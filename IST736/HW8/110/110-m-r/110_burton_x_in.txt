<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, another week has gone by, and we have taken no action whatsoever, no action whatsoever to solve the energy crisis. I listened to the majority leader during the 1-minute talking about what's going on next week as far as legislative action is concerned, and he said that even if there were more oil leases available, he said there are no drills available. 
   Well, if there are no drills available and the oil companies feel that there is oil down there, they are going to make drills that would be available. The problem is on the oil leases that are available right now, the oil companies aren't finding sufficient oil to be able to put up a $2 billion oil platform to drill, and we are only using 3 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf for drilling purposes and for these leases. 
   If we make more of the continental shelf available these oil companies are going to get out there, they are going to get these oil leases, and they will find oil. Geologically they will survey it. They will find oil, and they will drill. They will find the drilling capacity, they will find the drilling equipment, they will build the $2 billion platforms, and they will drill. But they will have to make sure it's economically feasible, or they won't do that. 
   You know, if we have more production, we are going to have lower gas prices, there is just no question about that. Every week that we go out of here like today, we are ending another week, we are going home, we haven't done anything to increase the supply which will lead to lower gas prices and lower energy prices. 
   I listened to the hyperbole during these talks on the floor. I listened to everybody giving reasons why we are not doing this or why we are not doing that, and the fact of the matter is we are not doing anything, and the American people are still suffering. They are spending $70, $80, $90 just to fill their gas tanks. They don't know what they are going to do. They can't get to work, they can't take their kids to school. It's affecting everything that we buy, our clothes, our food, everything. 
   As a result, we are facing not only energy problems, we are facing an economic problem, an inflationary problem. We are not doing a darn thing about it. 
   We need to drill wherever we can to find oil, in the ANWR, if necessary, off the continental shelf. We need to open up the other 97 percent of the continental shelf to drilling. If we do that I guarantee you, I guarantee there will be leases, and the oil companies will find the platforms necessary and the drilling equipment necessary to drill for that oil. If they can make money doing it, they are going to do it. 
   The leases they have right now, if they are not going to find oil down there, it's not sufficient, they are not going to put a $2 billion platform down there and drill for that oil. That's why we need to open up more of these areas of the continental shelf for drilling. 
   Remember, and I hope the American people listen to this, 97 percent of the continental shelf is not being explored or even allowed to be explored. That's terrible. We know we need energy, and we are sending $700 billion to the Saudis, to South America and other countries when we had that energy right here in America. 
   Somebody said, well, it will take 10 years to get that oil to market if we drill for it. Well, I don't think it will take that long, but let's say it does. We need to get started sometime, and we were going to start in the 1970s, and we didn't do anything. We are in a worse situation today than when we had the oil embargo. 
   We need to start. We need to move toward energy independence. 
   I will submit to you that before the end of this session, before September 30, we have an opportunity to end the moratorium on drilling off the continental shelf and elsewhere. The moratorium on drilling off on the continental shelf and elsewhere in this country expires September 30. The only way that moratorium can continue is if we pass legislation to continue it. So I believe, and I know that there will be legislation before this body and the end of September that will extend that moratorium. 
   I would like to say to my colleagues, both Democrat and Republicans, we need to vote against that moratorium extension. If it's in a spending bill or any other kind of a bill, we need to stop that bill from being passed as long as that moratorium is in there, because the American people are demanding, demanding that we do something about this energy crisis. They are demanding that we move toward energy independence. 
   They want alternative fuels. They want alternative sources of energy. They want solar, they want wind, they want all of that. We have seen all of that on television, but during this transition period, they want energy. The only way we are going to get it is to drill for gas and oil. 
   We can do that if we end that moratorium. I would like to say to my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, let's get together in the next month, end that moratorium, not allow any legislation to go through that will extend that moratorium, so we can move toward energy independence. 
   If you don't believe that the people in this country are concerned about it, go to any gas station in this country, the next week when you are home or next weekend when you are home, and you will find that everybody is madder than hell about this. I was getting gas the other day, and I heard a guy say to his child, ``Come here, son, do you want to help me spend some of your college education?'' 
   I am not kidding. He didn't know I was there. He had a pickup truck, and he said to his son, ``Come here, I want you to see how we are spending part of your college education.'' We need to move toward energy independence, we need to drill, and we need to do it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (LOWER THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AND OIL -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Well, it's 9 o'clock, it's a Wednesday night, and 2 days from now we will all be home for 5 weeks and Congress will not have acted on many pieces of legislation that deal with the energy crisis. While we are home talking to our constituents and doing things that we have to do back in our districts, the people of the United States of America will continue to pay $4, $5 a gallon for gasoline. They will have to take money away from other important areas of their homes; food, clothing, whatever it might be, so they can put enough gasoline in the car to get to and from work or to take the kids to school. I think that is tragic, Madam Speaker. 
   This Congress should be doing something immediately to lower the price of gasoline and oil. A few days ago, I think last week, the President of the United States removed the executive moratorium on drilling offshore. As soon as he did that, the price of oil per barrel dropped. Likewise, just in the last couple of days, the price of gasoline dropped. If the Congress of the United States were to act likewise to remove the moratorium on drilling offshore on the Continental Shelf, the price of gasoline would drop I believe dramatically in a very short period of time. 
   But we are not going to do that. We are going to leave here in the next 2 days without doing a darn thing. The American people sit at home, 70, 75 percent of them saying, Why in the world don't you drill? Why don't you drill here in America. Why are you sending all that money overseas, $700 billion a year to the Saudis and to others who aren't really our best friends? Why not keep that money at home; why not drill here; why not become energy independent so we don't have to worry about the rest of the world and what they are doing. But we are not going to do that.     
   We are going to leave here without doing a darn thing. Now, there are a number of bills pending before the Congress that have been introduced that would solve the problem, but none of them have seen the light of day and none are going to see the light of day between now and when we leave. 
   Today, a bipartisan group headed by NEIL ABERCROMBIE of Hawaii and JOHN PETERSON of Pennsylvania, about 15 or 20 Members, bipartisan, introduced a bill that had a lot of compromises in it that would have dealt with this problem of energy independence and would have helped lower the price of energy and gasoline. 
   It was a multifaceted bill. It dealt with solar energy. It dealt with wind energy. It dealt with cars that use all kinds of fuel, the hybrid cars, the hydrogen powered cars. It gave tax credits to encourage the people around this country and the industries around this country to move on wind-driven energy and solar energy and other forms of energy that we are not dealing with right now. 
   In particular, it dealt with the drilling off the continental shelf. It did not talk about ANWR, because that was one of the areas where there was some disagreement. So in order to go ahead and move forward with an energy bill, this bipartisan group decided they wouldn't put the ANWR issue in there, but they would go ahead with the continental shelf exploration. They said that 25 miles off the continental shelf from the shore would not be explored, and 25 to 50 miles offshore the States would have the right to decline to drill should they want to do that. 
   But it was a giant step forward, and they moved this bill today to the committees of jurisdiction and we should be acting on that. If we don't act on it between now and when we leave on Friday, we should certainly be acting on it in September. 
   Now, today we had a vote up or down on whether or not we should adjourn for 5 weeks starting this Friday until September. The vote passed by one vote. Democrats, many Democrats, and almost all the Republicans voted not to leave this body until we dealt with the energy crisis, and it failed by one vote. So the people of this country saw today that a large number of the people in this body that represent them in the Congress want to deal with the energy crisis, but the majority, the Speaker of the House, once again blocked this effort, and I think that is very unfortunate. 
   It is extremely important that we move on this before we leave in September. The people in this country are going to suffer for another 2 months, and we really need to do something about that before we adjourn for the rest of the year at the end of September, as has been told to us is going to be the case. 
   We have enough energy in this country to be energy independent. We have enough oil to be energy independent. We have enough gas to be energy independent. We have enough coal shale to be energy independent. We are not doing anything to deal with the problem, and the American people know it. 
   So I would just like to say tonight, Madam Speaker, before we leave, that this is intolerable, what we are doing. The American people want action. They want the gas prices down, they want the energy prices down, and it is within our power to get the job done, but we are not doing it. 
   So I would like to urge the leadership in this House, the majority in this House, as well as the minority in this House, to move rapidly; to move rapidly on an energy bill between now and when we leave on September 30th. This is one of the most important issues, it is the most important issue that we are dealing with this session. Madam Speaker, I think it is unconscionable that we have not yet dealt with it.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The geologists with whom we've talked say that they know that there is oil in the ANWR and that they know where the oil is off the continental shelf. I don't know about these other 8,000 leases in the spots that we're talking about, but I would be happy to talk to them about  exploring those if we could work together to get the oil out of the ground and get it to market. 
   I'd just like to say to my colleague that I know that you want to move toward energy independence. We have a different view on how it has to be done. You'd like to do it in an environmentally safe way, and so would we, but we aren't starting. So I'd just like to say to my colleague: 
   When are we going to start? In your opinion, how are we going to start, and how long will it take? 
   The transition to hybrids and to everything else and to get everybody in this country working on these things is a laudable objective, and I agree with you that we should be doing that, but in the interim, we've been just sitting around, waiting for 30 years. The American people, I don't think, can wait much longer. 
   So I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I'd just like to ask you: Where do we start? When do we start? How do we start if we don't drill?

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The reason I wanted to talk to you really briefly before Mr. Westmoreland and I take this hour is that we're going to have to work together to solve this problem. On its face, for us to say that the oil companies with these leases really don't want to exercise the ability they have to drill doesn't make sense. 
   The problem we have with energy right now is that China is buying an awful lot of the oil, and India is buying a lot of the oil. The appetite for energy is growing at a very rapid rate, even here in the United States, and we're not keeping up with the production necessary to keep the prices down. The oil companies want to drill. They want to make this money. They want more refineries. 
   You and I don't know each other really well, but what I'd like to say to you is that I'd like to sit down with you and with some of the oil companies executives and talk to them about the drilling problem and about the lease problem. Maybe there's something we can do by talking to them to get this thing off dead center. But to sit around and say they're not drilling where they should when the world needs more energy doesn't make any sense. We need more refineries. Everybody knows that. 
   As you were talking a minute ago, we want to move toward energy independence, but that's going to take time as well. So I would like to work with you and with other Democratic leaders--Mr. Rahall and others--and see if we can't get some of the oil execs in without beating them over the head about, you know, taxes on them and just say, ``What do we need to do to get you to do exploration in a clean way and to get this energy to market as quickly as possible?'' I'd like to talk to you about it and see about that.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. You know, you can blame us, we can blame you. We can go all the way back to the Carter administration when we had lines. You are a fairly young man, you probably don't remember, But there were lines around the block and people coming with five gallon cans to get gas because we didn't have any. There is probably enough blame to go around. 
   The problem is we are in an economic crisis right now that is not going to get any better until we work together. I have been down here railing against you and the Democrats for the last three or four or five weeks saying you guys are the reason that gas has gone up a buck-and-a-half in the last 2 years. You can blame us if you want to. But the people who are watching on television and the people around this country right now are paying 4 bucks-plus a gallon and they want us to work together. I would like to sit down with you and others like you and try to figure out a way to get this problem solved.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Before you leave, let me say I think what would be very illuminating for the American people is for you and three or four of your colleagues who have some expertise in this area to come down with three or four of our colleagues and sit down and discuss in logical way these issues you are talking about, because we all want the same thing. So I would like to talk to you about that after we are through here, and maybe we can work something out in the next week or two. 
   Thank you, Mr. Westmoreland.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. First of all, let me compliment my colleague from Georgia, because I really appreciate you taking the initiative to actually lay before the American people those who support energy independence, true energy independence and those who don't. I think this will do it. I hope this is publicized across the country so every single constituent of yours, mine, everybody in this country who is paying $4-plus a gallon for gasoline will know how their representative feels about this issue. 
   One of the things we were talking about just a few moments ago before our colleague left, which was very troubling, was that he indicated that oil companies were protecting leases, and he didn't want to drill in those places. It's very--it's almost a ludicrous argument. 
   Because with the demand for oil growing like it has around the world, the need for more oil or energy is apparent. The more oil companies, the  more they drill and the more they refine, the more they are going to be able to sell. What my colleagues have said in the other side of the Senate and over here is they want to raise taxes on the oil producers. 
   That's okay if they want to tax those people, but oil companies don't pay taxes. This is what people need to understand. Those taxes are passed on to the consumer when they buy the gasoline, because they raise the price of the gasoline. 
   When you buy a car, if you raise the taxes on the production of a car, it's passed on with the prince increase on the car. So companies, corporations aren't paying these taxes, the consumer is. That's what we really need to explain to the American people. 
   The thing that troubles me the most--and this is why I appreciate you doing this and taking this initiative, Representative Westmoreland, is because the American people are confused. Right now they read in the paper, see on television, well, the Republicans killed a bill in the other body that would have really put the hammer to the oil companies. 
   The fact is that it was raising taxes on the oil companies, which would have passed on to consumers in a price increase that would have made gas prices even higher. What we need to do, as you said, and what you are doing tonight, as my colleague from Georgia, your buddy here is going to talk about in a few minutes, is we need to get more energy out of the ground and we have the ability to be energy independent. 
   My colleagues say, well, it's going to take 10 years it may take 5 years, it may take 2 years. I don't know. But we have been talking about this since the Carter years in the 1970s, and we haven't done anything. 
   So I want congratulate you one more time, I am happy to be here with you tonight. I will stay with you for the whole hour if you want me to. But I hope that we will get across to the American people this, we don't want this to be political, we want to work together with them, and they are not willing to do it at this point. 
   We need to work with the Democrats to get a program, to become energy independent, to get our oil and natural gas and coal shale out of the ground so we don't have to depend on Saudi Arabia or OPEC or Venezuela and Mr. Chavez down there who may pull our string any day. 
   We need to become energy independent and quit talking about it. We need to work together to get that job done because the American people, if you look at the polling results, I think Congress is worth, what, 18 percent in popularity right now, a pox on all of our houses. We better get together, or they will throw us all out. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Our colleague from Ohio was talking about these leases. And the reason they want to drill in ANWR is because geologists found there is a huge supply of oil there. That makes your point. That's where the oil is. 
   As Willy said, that's where the money is. So why would you drill, as you said, in leases where there aren't any, when you know, you know that there's oil in the ANWR.

But if I were talking to the American people tonight, I would say, like you are saying, you ought to call your congressman and tell him to sign this thing. I can't say that to the American people because I'm only allowed to talk to you. But if I were talking to the American people, I would say Mr. Westmoreland has the right idea, let every Congressman know how you feel, and if you do, then they will change their mind and they will support exploration that will give us energy independence. 
   So I congratulate you on doing this. This is a great idea.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I think one of the things that ought to be put into the equation that we don't discuss a lot, and that is that we are depending on the Middle East for what, 40, 50 percent of our energy. Right now we know there is a lot of conflict in that part of the world. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he burned a lot of the oil wells. And had he taken over, we would all have been buying or trying to buy oil from Saddam Hussein. 
   The reason I bring this up is we don't know what is going to happen 5 or 10 years from now. There could be a terrible conflagration over there and we might not be able to get oil out of that area for our country. They might sink a couple of ships in the Persian Gulf and block the tankers from even getting out of there, and we won't be able to get energy. So what do we do then? Do we let the lights go out and let the cars stop on the streets because we don't have energy? That is another reason, for national security purposes, that we have an energy supply here and become independent of the other countries in the world. 
   As you said, both men from Georgia, we have the ability to do it. Even if it took 10 years, and I don't think it would, but even if it did, we ought to be looking down the road and asking, Do we want to keep depending our security on the Middle East where something could go wrong tomorrow when we could be independent, as far as energy is concerned, right here in America and protect ourselves, as well as getting the energy that we need, from a conflagration that might take place halfway around the world.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. One of the things that we haven't really discussed a great deal tonight is if they didn't want to drill for oil, for instance, we have a several hundred-year supply of natural gas, and there could be an entire new industry creating conversion units for automobiles that would be much less than a brand new car, that could convert gas-powered cars to natural gas power, which is a clean burning fuel. 
   But once again, the opposition will not allow us to drill for natural gas, which is a clean burning fuel which would help the environment. So it's not just the oil issue; it's the entire energy issue that you're talking about. 
   And that's why I think that the American people, I hope that they're paying attention to this. I know that they're getting their attention because the price of gasoline is so high. But we have the ability to use natural gas. We have the ability to use oil. We have the ability to get it out of the ground, to use shale and we're being blocked again and again and again. 
   And I appreciate you and the other gentleman from Georgia saying tonight that we'd like to work with the Democrats on the other side of the aisle to solve this problem. But, as you said before, it takes two to dance. Well, I guess I could dance by myself, but that wouldn't be very becoming. But it takes two to tango, and I would just say that if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are listening to my colleagues from Georgia, let's get together and see if we can come up with a way to get this problem solved.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   You know, the truckers across this country that drive these big diesel rigs that bring food to the market and all these other commodities, they were so upset when diesel fuel got to over $4 a gallon, now it's over $4.50 a gallon, that they came, hundreds of them, maybe even thousands of them, drove here into Washington, DC to protest. And they're very concerned about that. And the people who buy those products are concerned. 
   You even see now where people are stealing cooking oil from McDonald restaurants in the back so they can augment their fuel so they can get more mileage with their diesel trucks. 
   And I would say, if I were talking to those truckers across the country, and I know we can't because we're just talking among ourselves, that the truckers, I'm sure, would want their Congressman and the people they serve to contact their Congressman to say sign this petition because we can't afford to bring across the country the food and the commodities necessary to keep your standard of living where it is today. So it's not just the guy driving his car to and from work. 
   I had a young man, I won't tell you who it is because he might get fired. But he's a young man who works here in the Capitol. And he was talking to one of his friends, and I walked out, and I said, what about this drilling in the ANWR and in the United States to get oil? He says, I don't care where you drill. He says, I live 45 minutes from the Capitol. I can't afford to drive to and from work anymore, and I'm going  to buy an air mattress and pump it up someplace so I can spend half of my time here because I can't afford to go home. 
   So they're upset, the people driving these cars, because they can't afford to live like they did in the past. It's hurting people with home mortgages, their food and everything else, those on limited incomes. 
   But as I was saying before, the truckers have already demonstrated. And I'll bet you if they knew tonight that these petitions that you've come up with were here on the floor, I'll bet you every one of them would call everybody they know and tell them, call your Congressman. Tell him to sign that petition so we can get the fuel down so we can transport the goods and services you need across this country so you can live again.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. You know, a number of us--I'm on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I do some traveling to meet with leaders in other countries around the world. And one of the things that I have found is the Pound Sterling and the Euro, their currency has gone from where it was about 70 cents to the dollar to where the Euro is almost one and a half times what the dollar is as far as value's concerned. 
   And one of the reasons why you have seen the currency of the United States go down is because we're buying more and exporting less, and one of the main reasons for that is what you just mentioned a moment ago: we're importing all of this energy when we could be producing it ourselves keeping more of our money here, which would not only help us energy-wise, but which would strengthen the dollar and help the entire economy of the United States. 
   There are so many ancillary reasons, so many ancillary reasons why we should be drilling for our own energy that it doesn't make--that it isn't funny. And yet I can't understand why many of our colleagues don't understand that. It's not just energy, it's economic security, it's national security, it's a whole host of things; and we ought to get on with it. We really ought to get on with it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I don't think I'll take the whole 5 minutes tonight because I'm going to join Mr. Westmoreland of Georgia in a special 1 hour order on energy in just a few minutes. But I would like to say, during the 5 minutes that I have, that another week has gone by in the Congress of the United States and we have taken no action in dealing with the energy crisis that faces America today. 
   The price of gasoline is well over $4 in most areas, and in some areas it's up closer to $4.50. Diesel fuel is over $4.50 a gallon, and the truckers across this country are suffering, and they've even demonstrated here in Washington, D.C. 
   And it's not just the energy problem that we have to deal with, it's the effect that the energy problem has on other commodities, such as food and other equipment that we need to keep this economy moving forward. 
   The price of food is going to go up. It's going to have tremendous inflationary pressure on every family in this country if we don't address this problem and address it quickly. I know some of my colleagues say, well, you know, if we started drilling for oil in the ANWR today, it would take 10 years before we would get that oil to market. Well, I disagree; I think it would be a lot sooner than that. But the sooner we start, the quicker we will have that oil at our refineries. 
   We also could drill off the Continental Shelf and get another couple million barrels of oil a day. And that may take a little bit of time, but the sooner we start, the better. 
   The other thing we have to consider is we need more refineries to refine that oil. We haven't built a refinery, I think, in this country for the past, what, 30 years? And we need that capacity in order to get this oil transitioned into gasoline and diesel fuel for the people to use in this country.     
   To sit back like we have and not do anything over the past weeks and months, watching the gas prices go up and watching people suffering, in my opinion, is just unconscionable. Yet, my colleagues, we really haven't done a thing. 
   I reach out to my colleagues on the Democrats' side of the aisle. You're in the majority and we're in the minority, but we all understand we have a crisis facing this country. We need to work together to explore, to get the oil that we have in our country to market as quickly as possible. We also have as much as a 500-year supply of natural gas, a clean-burning fuel that we could get to market if we could get it out of the ground, and we can do it in an environmentally safe way, and we can extract the oil in an environmentally safe way. 
   If we were talking to Americans all across the country tonight and if we said, ``do you think gas prices are too high?'' they would all say, ``Yes.'' If we said, ``would you mind if we drilled in this country and in an environmentally safe way to get oil out of the ground to lower your gas prices?'' you'd get 80-90 percent to say, ``Yes.'' If you asked them ``what about the ANWR?'' they'd say, ``Where's the ANWR?'' Most people aren't aware that it's a very small part of Alaska which is three times the size of Texas. 
   We need to move toward energy independence. We have the ability to be completely energy-independent from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from Mexico, from Canada, from any country in the world. We can be independent if we work together, but we haven't done that. 
   Many of my colleagues are saying, ``Well, we're concerned about the environment.'' We all want to transition to new technologies, to new ways of getting energy so that people can have clean-burning fuel, but in the meantime, while we're doing that, we must realize that we're having a terrible, devastating impact on our economy by not taking action. 
   So I would just like to say to my colleagues, before I get together with Mr. Westmoreland for this 1-hour special order, let's work together. The American people are begging us. If you don't believe it, go to any gas pump in the morning or tonight and ask them. They're begging us to do something about the exorbitant fuel prices which are not only affecting their getting to and from work but that are also affecting their ability to buy groceries at the supermarket and that are affecting every other commodity. It's going to severely hamper and hurt this economy if we don't work together very quickly to get the job done. 
   Now, I believe that if we listen to the American people that Democrats and Republicans can work together, and we can come up with a plan to extract these vital, essential minerals so that we can lower our gas prices and can lower the energy prices in this country, but if we don't and if we continue to fight with each other and if we're recalcitrant and if we don't do something, then the problem is going to get worse and worse and worse. 
   So I would just like to say to my colleagues and to plead with them one more time tonight: Let's not let another week, month or year go by of our not having done anything to explore or to drill for our own natural resources that can give us energy independence. We've been talking about it since the Carter years back in the 1970s. It is time we did something. Americans are suffering, and we're not doing anything. Democrats and Republicans must work together to solve this problem. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York for handling this very important bill. I want to thank Mr. Costa and Mr. Poe for sponsoring this legislation. 
   When we talk about violence in the family, domestic violence, we quote a lot of statistics, and my colleagues have done that very, very well. But one of the things that's very hard for people to understand is what it's like to actually go through domestic violence. 
   It's so important that everybody in America be involved in stopping domestic violence. There's so many people that hear some woman scream or see some child being beaten by their father and they don't do anything about it. They say it's not my business, and so they go on their merry way, and they feel like this problem's going to go away. It doesn't go away. It gets worse and worse and worse until sometimes people get killed or maimed for life. 
   My father was six-foot eight, and my mother was five-foot-and-a-half inches tall, and he used to beat her so badly that we couldn't recognize her. He would tear her clothes off of her in front of me and my brother and sister, and then if we said anything he would beat me. 
   He went to prison for trying to kill her, and one of the reasons it went that far, in my opinion, is because there wasn't enough attention paid to what he was doing in the first place. 
   I can remember one night about 2 o'clock in the morning my mother, who had been beaten up, took me and my brother and sister down to the police station in Indianapolis, and she went to the desk sergeant and said to him, you know, she wanted to get a restraining order, get away from this brute and this brutality. And the desk officer said, you know what time it is, lady? It's 2 o'clock in the morning, and these kids ought to be in bed. If you don't take these kids home right now, I'm going to arrest you for child abuse. That was the attitude that we saw back in those days. 
   I can remember when she would throw a lamp through the front window when he was beating on her or me and scream for help so loud that you could hear it for blocks away and nobody came. Nobody's light went on. Nobody paid any attention, and that's the crime. 
   The crime isn't just the wife abuse or child abuse or spousal abuse. The crime is that people don't take it upon themselves to stop it. 
   Today, it's a lot better in police departments across this country. There's  a lot of organizations that are trying to help women and kids who are abused, and that's great. It's a great step in the right direction, but as these statistics that we've heard today will tell you, it goes on and on and on. And the only way it's going to stop, if collectively across this country, men and women who see violence in public or in private or hear about it, report it to the police, report it to the proper people and get that brute away from that man and that woman and those kids. If we don't do that, this is never going to stop. The brute has to be afraid of what's going to happen to him. 
   I'll just tell you how this story ends. My mother finally got away from him. He went to prison for 2 to 14 years. And when he got out, he still tried to bother us. But it wasn't until he realized that he was going to go back to jail if he did it again that he stopped. The fear of the law, the fear of prosecution, the fear of retaliation for what they're doing is the one thing that brutes and wife and child abusers understand. 
   And so I'd like to say to my colleagues, this is very important legislation. I really appreciate it. I'm glad that we sponsor this every year, and we need to make sure there's awareness of this. 
   But I'd like to say if anybody across the country is paying attention, it's your responsibility, every single American, if you see a wife or child abuse or abuse of any type like this, report it to the police. Tell your friends and neighbors to watch for it. That's the only way it's going to stop, and it's everybody's responsibility.  
   Each year children witness domestic violence and this experience can have a lasting impact on their lives. In order to break the intergenerational cycle, children need services and interventions to address their experiences and prevent future violence. Between 3.3 and 10 million children witness domestic violence every year. 
   The National Census of Domestic Violence Services (NCDVS) revealed that over 18,000 children in the United States received services and support from 1,243 local domestic violence programs during a 24-hour period in November 2006. During the survey day: 7,241 children found refuge in emergency shelter; 4,852 children were living in transitional housing programs designed specifically for domestic violence survivors; and 5,946 children received non-residential services, such as individual counseling, legal advocacy, and children's support groups. 
   Nationwide, participating programs reported that 5,157 requests for services from adults and children went unmet. Boys who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults. 
   Children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to exhibit cognitive and physical health problems like depression, anxiety, and violence toward peers. These children are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes. 
   Teens experience high rates of domestic and sexual violence and need specialized services that respond to this and prevent future violence. Domestic and sexual violence's prevalence in the youth population is a problem that deserves careful attention. 
   One in 3 teens know a friend or peer who has been hit, punched, kicked, slapped, choked or physically hurt by dating partners. One-fourth of high school girls have been the victims of physical abuse, sexual abuse or date rape. Girls and young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of intimate partner violence. 
   Not surprisingly, this violence can have a traumatic effect on the lives of these young people that can last well into adulthood. 
   Victims of teen dating violence are more likely to: use alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine; drive after drinking; engage in unhealthy weight control behaviors; commit sexually risky behaviors; and become pregnant. Over 50 percent of youth reporting dating violence and rape also reported attempting suicide. Girls who are raped are about 3 times more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders and over 4 times more likely to suffer from drug and alcohol abuse in adulthood. 
   American Indian and Alaska Native women are battered, raped and stalked at far greater rates than any other group of women in the United States.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for taking the time to do this. I wish everybody that is interested in golf were paying attention tonight because you're mentioning some really great players from San Diego. There must be something in the water out there. 
   But Scott Simpson is a friend of mine. I have had the opportunity to play with Scott a few times. And he is probably one of the nicest people I have ever met in golf. He is a very good Christian man. He is an outstanding golfer. He doesn't know the meaning of ``quit.'' And he won the U.S. Open as well. And he is one of those guys from San Diego that you as a San Diegoan, I guess that is how you say it, ought to be very proud of. 
   Billy Casper and Phil Mickelson, Scott Simpson and Gene Littler, a great bunch of guys and a great bunch of golfers; Phil Mickelson, I have had the pleasure of playing with him as well. I will tell you, he is going to win the Open one of these days because he has the ability, and he is the caliber of man to get the job done. I know he has had a few flukes here in the past. He has won the Masters twice. And I predict Phil will win the U.S. Open before too long.

He is tough in every tournament. So when people say something bad about Mickelson, they had better take a good look at themselves, especially if they are a golfer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I really appreciate my colleague on the Rules Committee yielding to me, and it is nice to see my buddies on the other side of the aisle looking so bright and cheerful tonight. 
   You know, if we don't do something about the price of gasoline and fuel, we will be able to go to the moon cheaper than we can drive down to the corner drugstore. I know that may sound like a joke, but the cost of fuel is going up so rapidly that everybody I have met, and I am talking about Democrats, Republicans, people on the street, everybody that I have met when I ask them what do you think about the price of fuel and gasoline, they say we have got to do something about it. 
   And I ask, What do you think about drilling here in the United States and the territorial possessions of the United States and offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, and they say drill wherever you have to; drill wherever you have to, but get my gas prices down. And that is about 80-some percent of the American people that are saying that. Everyone I have talked to has said that. 
   You know, last night I spoke on the floor and as I left the floor, I talked to some of the people who work here. I am not going to tell you who they were because I don't want to get them in trouble, but a couple of them told me that they drive about 35 or 40 miles to work every day, and they can't afford to do it because the price of gasoline has gone up so rapidly. One of them told me he was going to buy a blow-up mattress so he can sleep someplace around here in the Capitol because he can't afford to go home at night. Now this isn't baloney. 
   People can't survive with gasoline at the prices they are right now. And not only that, the transportation of foodstuffs and other commodities are going up as well because of the cost of transportation. 
   So when I say, you know, that it may cost more to go to the store than it does to go to the moon, I am being facetious, of course, but it sure sets the point in hard concrete. The cost is unbelievable, and the American people want us to do something about it. And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you are not listening. You are not listening to the American people. They want to drill in the United States. They want energy.

   I talk about immigration and everything else. This dwarfs immigration and all of the other issues we talk about because it is hitting people right where they live in their pocketbook and we must not be controlled by the lobbyists around here that are concerned about the environment. There has to be some balance between the economy and the environment in this country, and you guys need to do something about the price of gasoline. You're the ones who are holding it up.

   You are right, this is a major problem, energy, and you can blame anybody you want to all of the way back to the Carter administration and Reagan. But what do you think about drilling in the ANWR or off the Continental Shelf to get some of our oil? What do you think about that?

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (THE ENERGY CRISIS AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about the energy crisis in this country now for some time, and it has captured the imagination and the attention of probably every person in America, all 300 million people, because the price of gasoline is now over $4 a gallon. 
   It has affected every family as far as their ability to live the kind of life they want to because they have to spend so much money on energy. It has affected the price of our food because the people who transport our commodities across the country--the truckers--are now paying $4.50 to $5 a gallon for diesel fuel. In fact, they've demonstrated here at the United States Capitol with their trucks because it's so expensive for them to do their jobs. 
   We had a hearing today on how China is being involved in the United States and in Central and South America. They're buying up more and more of the oil because they have an economic expansion program, funded, in large part, by the money that we give to them in trade. India is now taking more and more energy and oil. So the demand around the world is growing at a very rapid rate. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always talking about new energy--new sources of energy, new technologies. I'm for all of that. We all want to clean up the environment, but with the demand for oil growing at such a rapid rate all around the world and with these countries that have more and more ability to buy oil and to use oil because they need more because their populations are growing so rapidly, we need to do something about energy in this country. 
   We have the ability from coal shale, I understand, to take care of this country for a couple of hundred years, as far as oil is concerned, by converting that shale into a usable energy oil shale. We have the ability to get 1 million to 2 million barrels of oil a day out of the ANWR in Alaska. We're not doing that. We have the ability to get 1 million or 2 million barrels a day off the Outer Continental Shelf. We're not doing that. We have up to a 500-year supply of natural gas in this country. We're not drilling for that. It's all because of what people call environmental concerns. 
   I would just like to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we should be concerned about the environment, but we should also be concerned about the economy of this country. We can't survive if the energy costs continue to go up and up and up while we wait on the transition to new technologies. Those new technologies are going to come, but it may take 1 year, 5 years, 10 years from now before they are able to pick up the major part of the energy needs of this country. We can't wait that long. We simply can't. We could become a second-rate economic power if we don't get control of our energy needs and are able to get the energy that is necessary for this country to grow economically. 
   I just don't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other chamber on the other side of the aisle continue to say we should not drill for oil in our own country.     
   The American people, if you went out on the street and asked anybody at any service station, will tell you they don't care where we drill, because they want their gas prices down. 
   Now, we can drill in an environmentally safe way, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not allow us to do it. It is just unexplainable, as far as I am concerned. We have the resources in this country, we have the ability in this country, to provide for the oil resources that are necessary to lower the gas prices in this country, and we are not doing it. And we are not going to do it as long as the other side, the Democrats in this Congress, continue to block us, because of ``environmental concerns.'' 
   There has to be a balance between the economic concerns in this country and the environment concerns, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are simply not realizing that. They have the ``ostrich syndrome.'' They have got their heads in the sand. 
   Gasoline prices have gone up $1.50 in the last 2 years since this body has been taken over by the Democratic Party. This is intolerable. They said they were going to do something about the energy crisis in this country when it was $1.50 less per gallon. We have to do something about it, and we have to start now. 
   We talked about energy independence during the Carter years back in the  seventies, and we haven't done anything about it. We had gas lines real long back in those days and we were going to become energy independent. We have not done it. The Congress of the United States has been controlled by the other party up until 1994, and we haven't done anything about the energy shortfalls in this country. 
   It is time that we become really bipartisan in the search for energy. It is time for us to work together. We need to be able to explore this country for the natural resources we have, the oil that we have in the ground and the natural gas we have in the ground, and we are not doing it. 
   I would just like to end by saying this, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Let's work together. Let's explore and drill for the oil that we have in this country so we can truly move towards energy independence and at the same time move toward the new technologies that will give us more and more of a clean Earth. That is what we all want. But at the same time, we have got to have energy now. We have to drill for it now. And I hope my colleagues will realize this before it is too late. 
   This is going to be a major issue in this campaign this fall, and I hope they will realize that and come to the conclusion that we ought to become truly energy independent and move in that direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (HONORING THE LIFE OF BENNY PARSONS -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are very sorry to hear about Benny Parsons losing his life and his battle with lung cancer. He was a great race car driver, known to his friends as BP. He spent his early years in North Carolina, where he began his career in sports playing high school football. 
   Shortly after high school, his family moved to Detroit where his father ran a taxicab company. He helped his father and drove cabs and also worked at a local gas station. 
   In a town known as Motor City, Benny's interest and experience in automobiles and racing thrived. He quickly became a real huge race fan. 
   As the story goes, he lucked out when a truck towing a race car pulled into the station for a fill-up, and after talking with the truck driver, he was invited to join him on his way to nearby Mount Clemens Speedway. Once they arrived at the track, the race car driver who was supposed to drive the car did not show up, and so BP offered to drive the car, and that was his first race. 
   It is hard to believe that somebody would go from a gas station to a race car and get in it right away. I am from Indianapolis, Indiana. The Indianapolis 500 is driven there, and I cannot imagine anybody without any past experience getting into a race car and driving it and doing well, but BP did.     
   In 1964, Benny Parsons drove in his first official NASCAR race. Only a year later, he received the Rookie of the Year award from the Auto Racing Club of America, in one year. He would go on to win the ARCA championship in both 1968 and 1969. He had an impressive record in racing during 1971 and 1972, and his points earned him the NASCAR championship in 1973. 
   He also won the Daytona 500 in 1975 and the 1980 World 600 championship at Charlotte, and he continued on to win the National Speedway USA, the Texas World Speedway and his career final victory at the Coca-Cola 500 in Atlanta, Georgia. Overall, he had 283 top-10 finishes and won 21 major races. 
   After he finished his last race in 1988, he switched gears from driving to commentating. He started out reporting from the pits during his final years of racing but began full time for both ESPN and TBS in 1988. His firsthand knowledge of the sport captivated his audiences. He could talk from the prospective of both a fan and a driver, and was skilled at sharing his insights through his broadcasts. 
   As the NASCAR industry grew more popular and was televised more frequently, he commentated for both NBC and TNT. Parsons received an ACE award in 1989 and an ESPN Emmy award in 1986. His talent as an announcer earned him the new nickname, The Professor. It is a long way from race car driver to professor, but he earned it. 
   When he spoke, audiences listened and learned from him. In the summer of 2006, Parsons began to have trouble breathing. His doctors diagnosed him  with lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking over 25 years ago. 
   After a successful treatment, he noticed more trouble breathing. Doctors found that his left lung had not fully recovered from the radiation. This past December, he reentered the hospital for treatment and passed away on January 16 of this year from complications from lung cancer. 
   His career encompassed four decades of racing, followed by nearly two decades of announcing. Among other awards, he was inducted into the International Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, the Court of Legends at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 1994, and the Motor Sports Hall of Fame of America in 2005. In 1998, he was named one of NASCAR's 50 greatest drivers. 
   Benny Parsons, known for his lovable personality and his positive attitude, will be greatly missed by all of those in the NASCAR community and family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to join me by supporting this resolution. We have a NASCAR race, the Brickyard 400, in Indianapolis, and we are going to miss Benny Parsons there. We wish his family well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   You know, there are a lot of reasons to thank Tony Dungy and Peyton Manning and the whole team for the great victory they had last Sunday. I sat in the rain for about 5 hours and watched them, and I didn't feel a drop of rain because they did such a great job. 
   I might have felt a drop of rain in the first part when Devin Hester ran 92 yards for the opening kickoff touchdown. It kind of scared everybody to death who were Colts fans, but we all had faith in Peyton Manning and the Colts, and we knew that they wouldn't give up, especially after watching them coming back from the biggest deficit in championship history to defeat New England 2 weeks before. 
   But the reason I want to thank them today is for my Illinois colleagues. I want Coach Dungy and Peyton Manning and the whole team to know, from my colleagues in Illinois, I want a deep-dish pizza, a pound of cheese cake and a bunch of DVDs for our troops over in Iraq. So I want to thank them very much for making sure I didn't have to pay for all that other stuff, but my colleague on the other side of the aisle does. 
   Let me be serious for just a moment. We are very, very thrilled to have a Super Bowl champion in Indianapolis, we waited for a long, long time. And it came at a time when we had some of the finest people that have ever been on a football team playing in Indianapolis. It came at a time when we had one of the finest coaches who ever coached football in Indianapolis. And not only is Tony Dungy a great coach, but he is a great American and a very patriotic man and a good Christian fellow. And everybody in Indianapolis really respects him. 
   Peyton Manning has been a gentleman on and off the field. The whole team has. I can name everybody on the team. And I just want to say, on behalf of the Congress, me and Julia Carson, my colleague who represents Indianapolis, and Steve Buyer and others, that we are very, very proud of the Colts. We hope they bring us another Super Bowl next year, but even if they don't, we are very, very thrilled. They have done Indianapolis proud, and we are very proud to talk about them here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (OIL PRODUCTION -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, everybody in America is concerned about gas and oil prices. We all remember the long gas lines during the Carter administration, and the government made a commitment that we would be independent as far as energy needs were concerned at some point in the not too distant future, and we were supposed to work toward that end. I would like to give a report on where we stand because the American people are very, very concerned about high gas prices right now and the lack of oil. 
   On May 29, the United States consumed as much oil as it will produce domestically all year. All the oil that we produce in the United States has been used up by May 29. That means from that date until January, 2008, next year, we are now completely dependent upon politically unstable regions of the world such as the Persian Gulf, Nigeria, and Venezuela for our energy needs. Why is that? Because year after year, decade after decade, this country throws up more roadblocks, usually because of some environmental reason, to exploring for and utilizing domestic supplies of oil and natural gas. 
   In the ANWR, for instance, it holds the single largest deposit of oil in the entire United States, and that is 10.4 billion barrels of oil, and it is more than double the proven reserves in the entire State of Texas, and almost half of the total proven reserves in the United States, which is 22 billion barrels. 
   To put it more simply, opening the ANWR could increase U.S. reserves by nearly 50 percent. 
   And I have been up to the ANWR, and I can tell you there is no environmental damage that is going to take place if we drill in that area. And we could get between 1 1/2 to 2 million barrels of oil a day. That would help a tremendous amount the needs of the American people. 
   On the outer continental shelf, another example, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Department of the Interior recently conducted a comprehensive inventory of oil and natural gas resources located off of our coastlines. According to the Department of Interior, there is an estimated 8.5 billion barrels of known oil reserves and 29.3 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves along our coastlines; with 82 percent of the oil and 95 percent of the gas located in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   However, even more importantly, the Department of the Interior estimates there are untapped resources of about 86 billion barrels, 51 percent in the Gulf of Mexico; and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 55 percent in the Gulf of Mexico, that is out there. 
   In July, 2004, a Spanish oil company, Repsol-YPF, in partnership with communist Cuba's state oil company, CUPET, identified five oil fields it classified as ``high quality'' in the deep water of the Florida Straits right off the coast of Florida, 20 miles northeast of Havana and within Cuba's Exclusive Economic Zone. 
   According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the North Cuba Basin holds an estimated 4.6 billion to 9.3 billion barrels of crude oil and 9.8 trillion to 21.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
   Unfortunately, since the 1980s, the U.S. has prohibited oil and gas drilling on most of the outer continental shelf except for limited areas of the western Gulf of Mexico, not the Florida Straits or around Florida, and limited parts of Alaska. 
   Oil shale: There is enough oil shale in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming to create the equivalent of 1.8 trillion barrels of oil and potentially as much as 8 trillion barrels of oil. In comparison, Saudi Arabia reportedly holds proven reserves of 267 billion barrels, which is less than about one-eighth of what we have in the United States in shale. 
   Unfortunately, oil shale is roughly equivalent to diesel fuel and a number of Clean Air Act regulations, such as low-sulphur diesel, and Federal motor fuel taxes, which favor gasoline over diesel fuels, have created a strong financial disincentive regarding the production and use of oil shale fuels. 
   I don't want to belabor this point, but we have enough oil that we could move very closely to energy independence if we didn't have environmental radicals stopping us from drilling where we have the oil and we have those known oil reserves. 
   It is tragic that we have to continue to rely on Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and other countries that are very unstable in various parts of the world when we really know that at some point in the future we are going to need more and more of their oil. 
   We need to move toward energy independence. We have been talking about it since the 1980s. Nothing has been done, and now gas prices are going up because we aren't producing enough oil and gas in the United States. And we have the reserves there to do it. We haven't even built any new oil refineries for 30 years. We can't even refine the oil that we do get here in the United States to take care of all the needs of the American people. 
   So I would just like to say to my colleagues, as I close, on both sides of the aisle, that we need to start moving toward energy independence. We need to start thinking about economic concerns as well as environmental concerns and have a balance there. We can do it in an environmentally safe way, and the American people want us to do it, and we need to listen to them as well as the environment lobby here in Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I would like to claim my 2 minutes, and then I will yield to my colleague. 
   First of all, let me just say that this is a very important resolution. I don't think many people in America really understand or remember all of the horrible things that occurred during the slave trading that took place in the past. 
   There is a movie out right now that talks about the slave trade and how horrible it was. It is called ``Amazing Grace.'' And I don't tout movies very much, but I would submit to all of my colleagues they ought to go see that movie. It is about William Wilberforce, who has been a hero of mine for a long time since I was a State legislator, and he led the fight in England to abolish slave trading; and it took him, I think, 18 years to get it done. But he was a real crusader for the rights of man and for the ending of slave trading. 
   So I would say to my colleague, Ms. Lee, I think this is a great bill you introduced. I whole heartedly support it, and I hope everybody in this House will. And as I said before, we ought to remember the horrible fight, the great fight that took place in ending slavery in England and in subsequent years. 
   So this is a great resolution. I really appreciate your bringing it forward. 
   And I hope everybody will remember William Wilberforce and the fight he made to end slavery and slave trading in England.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO FAMILIES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS MURDERED IN GUATEMALA -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   First of all, I want to congratulate Representative Solis for introducing this bill. She and I have worked together on it, and I really appreciate her hard work. She is really concerned about the rights of women around the world and not just Guatemala. I appreciate that. 
   Let me start out by saying today we have heard a great deal about human rights violation, slavery and other issues. The problem is not confined just to one part of the world. In China today, as Representative Smith of New Jersey has pointed out many times, there are as many as 10 million people suffering in communist gulags, and other parts of the world. In the Sudan,  we see the oppression and the horrible atrocities that are taking place and the mistreatment of not only men and women but children as well. It's just a horrible thing that we see these kinds of atrocities taking place around the world. 
   I really appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle working so hard to focus attention on what's going on in these various areas to try to bring them to a halt. For humanity's sake, we can do no less. 
   I, however, today, rise in support of H. Res. 100, which recognizes and honors the women and girls who have been murdered in Guatemala. This bill brings to light the problem women in the democratic nation of Guatemala face in their daily struggle for survival. Given the current environment in Guatemala, women are not safe to walk along the streets day or night. A simple walk from home or school or work to mean abduction, mutilation or death for a Guatemalan woman or girl. Given the lack of legislative protection and judicial investigation, women are often subjected to domestic abuse, often leading to death within the home as well. 
   Given that there is nowhere for these victims or their families to turn, over 2,000, as has been said to my colleague, over 2,000 Guatemalan women and girls have suffered horrendous deaths in the past 5 years. Tremendous efforts have been taken by some Guatemalan legislators and human rights workers and families of the victims. They come here to Washington to try to end such atrocities by focusing attention on them. 
   There has been a continuous rise, however, in the brutal female deaths. There can be no rest of the weary as long as these things go on. We must come together to assist their effort and urge the government of Guatemala to take quick deliberative action to investigate the killings and prosecute those responsible and eliminate the tolerance, the tolerance of violence against women. 
   The women in Guatemala deserve to experience peace and prosperity within their nation and not constant fear of sexual assault and deadly mutilation, in just walking to and from work, as I said before. 
   I ask my colleagues to see the urgency of this bill, and to support it. Once again, Representative Solis, thanks for your hard work. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   First of all, I want to congratulate Mr. Baca, my good buddy, for sponsoring this resolution. And I want to say very briefly that our side supports moving forward with this resolution of the gentleman from California, which recognizes the historical significance of Cinco de Mayo. 
   Our good neighbors to the south, Mexico, and we here in the U.S.A. have many things and values in common, and we ought to celebrate and share them together, as this resolution does today. Cinco de Mayo is an important holiday celebrated to commemorate May 5, 1862, the date Mexicans fought the Battle of Puebla to end their struggle for independence and freedom. 
   So let us recognize the historic struggle for independence and freedom of the Mexican people as symbolized by this important holiday and celebrate and rejoice together the holiday of Cinco de Mayo. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. First of all, I want to thank Mr. Inslee for introducing this amendment. I'm very proud to cosponsor it with you. It's very needed, and the reason I know it's very needed is because the things you talked about I experienced as a boy. I won't be redundant and go into the things that you have mentioned and the reasons why this program is so necessary. 
   But I do want you to know that I don't normally support changing money from one area to another like from the Department of Justice to these programs, but this is one of the most urgent needs in America, and it's been like this for the last 50 to 60 years. 
   I can remember when we went to police headquarters with my mother after we'd been beaten and my father had beaten my mother, and the police sergeant said, If you don't get these kids home, I'm going to have you arrested for child abuse. That's the way it was in those days. There was no place for a woman to hide, and the children had to experience this. 
   At 4 o'clock in the morning, when you hear your mother being beaten and you come down the stairs and your hair is standing straight up on the back of your head and your father turns and says to you, If you don't get back up the stairs, you're going to get some of this, kids should not have to endure that. They should not ever have to endure that. And the women who are treated like that should never have to endure that as well. 
   It's a shame that there aren't more people talking about this because this is something that's an urgent, urgent need. 
   Mr. Inslee's absolutely right about the chances for a child who's been abused like this to do the same things throughout the rest of their life. I was very fortunate that didn't happen, but I've known a lot of people who experienced that who did, and I think it's a tragic thing. 
   We really need to find a way to get these women and kids into shelter and away from these abusive parents, fathers and sometimes mothers, and we need to help the women who are abused. 
   As he just said, in the Native American community, there are women who are being raped and beaten, and there's really no place for them to turn. There's no registry so we can track these guys. That's a horrible thing to have to experience. 
   So I just want to say to my colleagues, and as I said, I won't be redundant, but I was reading in our information that we use when we discuss these issues, I was reading that between 3.3 million and 10 million children witness domestic violence every year. Can you imagine, up to 10 million kids that witness domestic violence in the home and elsewhere every single year? That's unforgivable. And at one time, in 1 day, one 24-hour period, there were 18,000 children in the United States that received services and support because they were experiencing domestic violence, in one day. That's something, in my opinion, that's inexcusable. 
   This is a very, very important piece of legislation. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for this. There should not be one negative vote on this, not one, because there are kids and women who are suffering, sometimes every day. Sometimes the husband will beat the child and they'll turn around to the wife and say, I'll never do that again, and he does it the next week. Sometimes he'll beat his wife and he puts his arms around her, and I've seen this firsthand, he says, Honey, I will never do that again. And the next week she's beaten again, and she sometimes has no place to go and she feels like there's no hope. 
   It's extremely important that we give these women and these kids hope,  and that's why I say to you, Mr. Inslee, thank you very much for introducing this amendment. I hope it passes unanimously. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (JULIA M. CARSON POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a dear friend and respected colleague of mine, Representative Julia Carson, and strongly support the underlying bill, H.R. 5472, ``To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, Indianapolis, IN, as the ``Julia M. Carson Post Office Building.'' 
   Born in poverty and racial segregation to a teenage single mother in 1938, Julia Porter Carson worked her way up through politics to become one of the most influential people in central Indiana. Julia Carson had a long career as a public servant. 
   In 1965, while working as a secretary at UAW Local 550, she was hired away by newly elected congressman Andy Jacobs to do casework in his Indianapolis office. When his own electoral prospects looked dim in 1972, he encouraged Carson to run for the Indiana State House of Representatives, which she did; she was elected in 1972, serving as a member for 4 years. In 1976, she successfully ran for the Indiana State Senate. 
   In 1990, she was elected as a trustee for Center Township that covers downtown Indianapolis, and was responsible for running welfare programs in central Indianapolis. Carson served 6 years as a trustee, creating a $6-million surplus from the office's $20-million debt. Carson employed an aggressive workfare program and anti-fraud procedures to quickly erase the enormous debt, while still providing much needed emergency services to the poor of Indianapolis. Her budget-balancing feat earned compliments from both sides of the political spectrum, including that of republican county auditor John Von Arx, who said, ``Julia Carson wrestled that monster to the ground.'' 
   In 1996, Julia Carson made history by becoming the first African-American woman Indiana has ever sent to Congress. Despite all her accomplishments and success, she never forgot her roots; she always remained true to herself and her beliefs. With all her success and accomplishments, she could have moved to a better neighborhood but chose not to. To the day she died, Julia Carson's home telephone number was in the Indianapolis phone book. 
   In all my years in Congress, I am not sure I can remember anyone as dedicated to their constituents as Julia was. She reached out to senior citizens, mothers of men and women serving in Iraq, crime victims and those struggling to pay the rent. She sent cards and routinely showed up at funerals and hospitals and front doors. She worked to find work for young men who were coming out of prison. She helped crime victims who were seeking justice. 
   While I didn't always agree with Julia politically, I always enjoyed working with her and her welcoming smile. She was a great woman and a dedicated public servant. While I was lucky to serve with her in this body, I was luckier to call her my friend. It is right that we honor her in the community that she served by naming this post office in her memory.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, those who don't profit from history are destined to make the same mistakes over and over again. 
   When I knew this debate was going to take place, I went back and started having my staff go through all the newspapers they could find prior to World War II criticizing Winston Churchill for his stand against Hitler and the build-up in violation of the Treaty of Versailles of Nazi Germany, and nobody listened. And as a result of nobody listening, 62 million people died. Not 1,000, not 10,000; 62 million people died. You ought to read these articles. They are very interesting. He was maligned; he was criticized. They said he should be run out of Parliament. And, of course, once the war started, he became Prime Minister and one of the greatest men of the 20th century.     
   We are in a world war now against terrorism. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said this isn't a world war, this is a civil war. But if you look at the record, since 1983, there have been numerous attacks, numerous attacks, on the West. There have been attacks at the World Trade Center in 1993. There was attacks in 1994; the Khobar Towers in 1996; the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; USS Cole in 2000; the September 11, 2001 attacks which brought this country into the war; the London bombings in 2005 and countless other attacks. This is not confined just to the Middle East. These people want to spread their venom throughout the world. 
   Now, if we pull out of Iraq, what does that do? Everybody knows right now that the President of Iran wants to expand his sphere of influence. He is sending terrorists across the border from Iran into Iraq. He is helping Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
   Let me read to you a quote from him. He said, ``Israel should be wiped off the map'' and that ``anybody who recognizes Israel,'' anybody who recognizes Israel, ``will burn in the fire of the Islamic nations' fury.'' And they have been involved in terrorist attacks. They are trying to build a nuclear bomb right now, and they are watching us on television as we speak, make no mistake. 
   Iran and the terrorists are watching, and they are thinking, my gosh, the will of the American people is waning, and we are going to turn tail and run. We are going to pull out. 
   This isn't Vietnam. Vietnam was a country, Cambodia and Laos are countries in southeast Asia. This is a world war. They have attacked the United States of America. It was a worse tragedy than that which took place in Hawaii in 1941 when they attacked Pearl Harbor, and now they are trying to develop a nuclear bomb. 
   If we pull out of Iraq, you may rest assured that Iran's sphere of influence will grow, and the fear of Iran throughout the Middle East and the world will grow. They will not back down from their development of a nuclear weapon and a delivery system that can reach not only the Middle East and Europe, but the entire world. 
   What I am trying to say now is if we start pulling out and looking like we are turning tail and running, we are likely to be in another huge war in the years to come. I don't know whether it will be 2 years, 5 years or 10 years, or quicker than that. But if they develop a nuclear weapon, and they see that we are weak, and we are pulling out, they are going to push like they have been pushing, and they will push, and they will push, and they will push until we have to go into a war that is much greater than what we face today. 
   There is a lot at stake right here, right now. My colleagues, I think, are being very myopic. They are not looking at the big picture. This is something that I think all of us ought to think about. 
   You know, we all have kids, and we all have grandkids, and we all have friends who are fighting in Iraq right now. We know young men who have gone over there and sacrificed, lost their arms and legs and have died, and it is tragic, it is a horrible thing. World War II was horrible. 
   Every war was horrible. When you see people dying, in combat, you can hardly stand it, because you know how their families and they feel, those who survive. 
   War is hell. But sometimes it is necessary. If you don't stand up to a bully or a tyrant, then they will push, and they will push, and they will push until you have to fight. If you wait too long, the fight is so severe that you really get hurt. It is better to whip them at the beginning than to wait until later on when the cost is much, much higher. 
   Lord Chamberlain went to Munich in 1938. He signed a peace agreement on Herr Hitler's terms, gave the Sudetenland to him and said, Hey, if you don't go into Poland or Czechoslovakia, we'll let you have it. All we want is peace, peace in our time. 
   He came back, and he had given the green light to Adolf Hitler because he appeared weak, and the allied forces appeared weak, they were dismantling their weapons and their military, and he said, They're weak. We can do whatever we want. So he started World War II, and 62 million people died. 
   We are in the same situation today, in my opinion, with the radical terrorists and Iran. We need to let them know that we are going to be firm, and we are going to stand up to whatever they throw at us right now so that we don't face a major Holocaust down the road. I really believe this. I am not just saying this as a political speech. I am not saying any of my colleagues are just making political speeches now, today. I really believe what they are saying. 
   But I am convinced after studying history and watching what happened in the past, that if we don't deal with this problem now, we will deal with it later, and the costs will be a heck of a lot more than it is today, and it may involve millions and millions of lives. Can you imagine what would happen if a nuclear weapon was launched in New York, California or someplace else in this country? Can you imagine? 
   Can you imagine a Holocaust if a nuclear war broke out involving Iran throughout the world, not only in the Middle East? This is what I think we face right now. Deal with them now, let them know we are going to stand firm, Iraq is going to be a democracy. We are not going to let Iran or any of the terrorists prevail, and we are going to stop a Holocaust in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (BLOOD LEVELS OF MERCURY ARE RELATED TO DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, it's late at night here in the Capitol, and most of my colleagues are in their offices or have gone home. But I want to talk about an issue that's very, very important that we've been talking about now for the last 8 years. 
   I was chairman of the Government Reform Committee for 6 years, and during that time, my grandson became autistic; and we checked to find out what was the cause, trying to find out, because my daughter and her husband were just extremely upset about it, as we were as grandparents. And we found that he had received nine shots in one day, seven of which had a product called themarasol, a preservative, in it. And the themarasol was 50 percent ethylmercury. And so I decided to have hearings to try to find out if the ethylmercury in those vaccines had anything to do with the autistic problem my grandson had. And we found, by having many, many hearings over a 4-year period, we found that scientists from all over the world and leading doctors and educators here that work with autistic children, that the mercury in the vaccines did contribute to the autistic epidemic that we had. 
   We used to have one in 10,000 children that were diagnosed as being autistic. One in 10,000. Today the Centers for Disease Control will tell you it's one out of 150. It's an absolute epidemic in this country. And we have been fighting and fighting and fighting to make sure that those families who have been damaged and those children who have been damaged by autism get some kind of compensation. And that's why, and I think in 1986 we passed what was called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund, and it took some of the money from the pharmaceutical companies when they sold their vaccine products to put into this fund to take care of people who are damaged by vaccines. And one of the reasons we did that was because of the issue of autism, although at that time I didn't know much about it. 
   In any event, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund has about $3 billion in it, and the people who's children have been adversely affected by mercury and have autism have not been able to get anything out of that. They have to go through a process and see a special master, and he has to judge whether or not the information that he has and the information they have lead them to believe that the mercury in the vaccines caused autism. And so far the special masters have not been able to ascertain, according to them, that the mercury in the vaccines does cause autism. 
   Well, last week, 2 years ago, let's see, 4 years ago there was a report, 2004, that said that there was definitely no connection between the mercury and the vaccinations and the children getting autism. Well, this past November, just last month, two doctors, Dr. Catherine DeSoto and Dr. Robert T. Hitlan, both very renowned doctors across this country, they have Ph.D.s in medicine, they wrote an article in the Journal of Child Neurology. And you can't discount this. What they're saying is fact. I want to read to you the summary of what they said. They said: ``The question of what is leading to the apparent increase in autism is of great importance. Like the link between aspirin and heart attack, even a small effect can have a major health implication. If there is any link between autism and mercury, it is absolutely crucial that the first reports of the question are not falsely stated and that no link occurs.'' 
   Now, get this: ``We have reanalyzed the data set forth originally reported in 2004 and have found that the original P value was in error and that a significant relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, the hair sample analysis results offer some support for the idea that persons with autism may be less efficient and more variable at eliminating mercury from the blood.'' 
   The fact of the matter is the mercury in the vaccines has autism. It's not the only cause of autism. But now we have scientific evidence by two leading doctors in the Journal of Child Neurology that says without doubt, the mercury in the vaccines does cause autism, is a major contributing factor. 
   Well, I've written, contacted Congressman Kucinich, who's chairman of the subcommittee that deals with this in the Capitol, and I've also contacted the special masters that decide these cases and have urged them to re-evaluate all of these cases where people who have autistic children have found that the mercury in the vaccines may have been a major cause. 
   Now we know that it is a cause of autism, and those people who have suffered, and those kids who have suffered need to be compensated out of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. 
   So I'd like to say to my colleagues, I hope you will join me in making sure that the information I just read gets out to everybody. These kids are going to live to be 50, 60, 70 years old, and unless there's some help for them, they're going to be a real burden on the taxpayers and on society. We have an obligation to make sure they're taken care of. 
   I hope all of my colleagues will read this statement tonight and help us to change the attitude of our health agencies and the special masters dealing with this problem.  
   In November 2007, the well-respected scientific journal, the Journal of Child Neurology, published an article authored by Drs. M. Catherine DeSoto and Robert T. Hiltlan (PhDs), detailing their findings on the relationship between mercury and autism spectrum disorders. The article was entitled ``Blood Levels of Mercury are Related to Diagnosis of Autism: A Reanalysis of an Important Data Set.'' 
   To summarize the article, Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan reanalyzed a data set the subject of a 2004 study that found no relationship between mercury and autism. By reexamining the data set, Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan determined that the conclusions of the 2004 study were wrong,  and that a relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. 
   As Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan noted in their article, there has been a marked increase in the diagnosis of autism in this country over the last 20 years. In fact we have gone from an autism rate of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 150. So, answering the question of what is (and is not) a possible contributing cause of autism is crucial, not only to the millions of American families currently affected by autism but to future generations. 
   We simply cannot dismiss or downplay scientific research, which has the potential to unlock the mysteries surrounding what is causing our Nation's autism crisis. We owe it 
   to the thousands of families living with autism to follow the science wherever it may lead. 
   That's why in late November, I wrote to the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Domestic Policy, Representative Dennis Kucinich; and the Special Masters assigned to the Congressionally-created Office of Vaccine Program within the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alerting them to the findings in Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan's latest research. 
   Specifically, I asked the Special Masters to take Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan's latest findings into consideration as they carry out their mandate of managing and adjudicating childhood vaccine claims. I asked Chairman Kucinich to hold a hearing on the environmental risks of mercury in childhood vaccines before the 110th Congress ends. 
   Given the high stakes involved, scientific reports discussing a connection between blood mercury levels and autism deserve serious consideration and review by the medical and scientific community. 
   During my tenure as Chairman of the House Committee on Government and Reform, I spent 6 years researching and hearing testimony from the autism advocacy and scientific communities about the autism epidemic sweeping our country. Over and over again, questions of causation, namely the use of thimerosal--the mercury-based vaccine preservative--in childhood vaccines were raised. 
   Here's what I learned: 
   A number of credible national and international scientists testified before the Committee that mercury in vaccines is a contributing factor in developing neurological disorders, including, but not limited to, modest declines in intelligent quotient, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. And 
   the body of evidence to support that conclusion gets larger everyday. 
   Experience tells us that, as with any other epidemic, while there may be underlying genetic susceptibilities, there usually is also some type of environmental trigger as well--be it exposure to a virus, fungus, heavy metal, or pollutant. There has never, to the best of my knowledge, been a purely genetic epidemic. 
   Genetics alone cannot explain how we went from 1 in 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorders 20 years ago to 1 in 150 today. The increase happened far too quickly for a genetic shift. 
   As mercury is a known bio-accumulative neurotoxin, it is biologically plausible that it is a contributing factor to our Nation's autism epidemic. 
   Autism has no cure, and while it is a life-changing condition, it is not a life-threatening disease. This means that the autistic children of today will be the autistic adults and autistic seniors, 20, 30, 50, even 70 years from now. Our Nation is ill prepared to deal with the complex educational, financial, housing, and health care challenges posed by a generation of autistic individuals. 
   My only grandson is autistic, so this is an issue that is very close to my heart; and for the last several years I have fought hard to raise awareness of this disease, and increase research into the causes of autism, as well as new treatments for those suffering with autism. 
   As a Nation, I believe, we have a collective responsibility to do everything we can to not only stop the further spread of this disease but to help the millions of children, adults and families afflicted with it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (CONGRATULATING LOVIE SMITH AND TONY DUNGY ON BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEAD COACHES OF NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE TEAMS TO QUALIFY FOR THE SUPER BOWL -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   You know, this is really a great Super Bowl we are facing for a number of reasons, not the least of which for the first time we have two African American coaches who are going to be coaching the football teams in the Super Bowl. There has never been an African American coach reach the Super Bowl, and now we have two, both teams. They are two of the finest men you are ever going to want to see coaching football teams, let alone teams in the Super Bowl. Tony Dungy, in his fifth season with the Colts, has compiled a record of 68-20. He has had five playoff appearances, he has had four AFC South titles, two AFC championship games, and finally an AFC championship. He has just done an outstanding job. 
   And Lovie Smith has done an outstanding job with the Chicago Bears. With a team racked by injuries, his first season he went 5-11. Then they went 11-5 and made the playoffs before falling to the Carolina Panthers. And then this year they made the Super Bowl for the first time since Mike Ditka led the Bears back in 1986. 
   They are both very fine men. They are not just a credit to the African American race, but they are a credit to humanity. I have watched both of them on television. They are both very strong Christian men, they are both very patriotic men, and they are loved by their teams. 
   I have not been conversant with how the people in Chicago feel about Lovie Smith, but everybody in Indianapolis thinks that Tony Dungy walks on water; they think he is the greatest coach we have ever had. And he is the kind of guy that, even when he is behind, doesn't know the meaning of giving up. I mean, this last playoff game when they came from behind from a greater deficit than any playoff championship team in history was really something. I admitted, when we were talking about the game the other night on the floor, that in the first half I was so upset I almost changed to American Movie Classics. We were behind 21-3. And I changed over the channel for a minute and I thought, no, I can't give up on the Colts; they won't give up. I changed the channel back, and dag-gone they came from that deficit to win the game. It was an outstanding championship effort. And it was led by an African American, Tony Dungy, who was the coach. 
   Lovie Smith did an outstanding job with the Bears. He led them through a very difficult last few seasons and led them to the championship. They were both talking about being the first African American in the Super Bowl, and now they are both at the same time. So I think that really shows what kind of men they are. 
   The only difference I would have with my colleague on the other side of the aisle who has a great resonant voice, Mr. Davis, is that I am one of the few guys here on the floor today who is going to be rooting for the Indianapolis Colts. 
   Now, we may be outnumbered here tonight. My colleagues are going to be speaking, and most of them are going to be talking about Lovie Smith and the Bears, you will outnumber us, but on Sunday you won't because the Colts are going all the way. As I said the other night, I am blue through and through and I am rooting for the Colts and they are going to win, but I still love the Bears and Lovie Smith, and I am very sorry that they won't win, but he is still a great coach. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank the Black Caucus for taking this Special Order tonight. JULIA CARSON was a friend of mine and a friend of STEVE BUYER. We traveled back and forth on the plane from Indianapolis to Washington on a regular basis and we got to know each other. 
   JULIA was a wonderful person, very highly regarded by the people of Indianapolis. In fact, she is the only woman in the history of the city who was recognized as Woman of the Year by the Indianapolis Star twice. That honor came to her by readers of the paper voting for her. That was quite an honor, an honor that has not been bestowed upon any other woman in the city's history. 
   The thing I really liked about JULIA was that even though she was a Democrat and I was a Republican, we worked together on a lot of issues that were very important to central Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. 
   I remember one case in particular that dealt with the Children's Museum. I talked to JULIA about it, and she took the bull by the horns and worked very hard to make sure that the problems that we had with the Children's Museum were resolved, and I really admired her for that. 
   Her predecessor and her buddy, Andy Jacobs, to whom you just referred in that article, really loved her like a sister. Andy served here for, I think, 28 or 30 years, and he is a very dear friend of mine, and Andy has told me on a number of occasions the great contributions that JULIA made to him and his staff when she worked for him before she became a Congresswoman. 
   She was a State representative. When Andy was defeated in 1972, he urged her to run for the Indiana House of Representatives, and she did. She was elected, and then she was later elected to the Indiana State Senate. Then she ran for the Center Township Trustee's job in Indianapolis and was elected to that. 
   The thing I talked about yesterday when we were acknowledging JULIA that I didn't know much about until just recently was that when she took over the Center Township Trustee's job, it was in a chaotic situation. And she was able to take care of the needs of the people of Indianapolis that really needed help and at the same time to reduce the budget of the Trustee's office, and that was something that I think all of us, Republican or Democrat, really can admire. 
   She was a very fine Congresswoman. She was a very fine person. She always had a smile for everybody, and I really appreciated knowing her. She shall be missed. I think that she is probably in heaven looking down on us right now. 
   JULIA, you did a good job.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (AMERICAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say to my good friend, Congressman Westmoreland from Georgia, I am so happy that you are going to all this trouble to get all of our colleagues to sign this petition. And if you're at 191, you're not too far short of 218. And when you get 218, I will join with you to go to the Speaker and show her that we have 218 signatures--or you do--and that they ought to bring this to the floor for a vote because a majority of the House wants this done. 
   You know, we passed another week. A week has gone by since you and I, I think, last were on the floor. And everybody's going home for the 4th of July recess--they're going to be in parades, they're going to be on radio, they're going to have town meetings--and we haven't done anything about reducing the price of gasoline or moving toward energy independence. And so I, like you, if I were talking to the American people right now, I would say, when your Congressman or your Senator is in that parade, I want you to talk to them strongly and say, we want you to drill in America. We want you to move us toward energy independence. We've been talking about it since Jimmy Carter was President 30-something years ago, and we aren't doing anything. And that's why we're dependent on foreign oil and that's why gasoline prices are over $4 because we aren't producing the oil here, we're sending it overseas. 
   We're sending over $400 million a day to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil that we're using. We could use that money right here in America, and it would help create jobs and expand our economy. We're sending $125 million a day to President Chavez in Venezuela, who's trying to move every country in this hemisphere toward communism and who is a good friend of the Castro brothers, Fidel and his brother Raul. 
   We have big problems here because we aren't drilling in America. And we need to have everybody in this country contact their Congressman and Senator and say, hey, listen, get with the program, it's time for us to move toward energy independence. We can't have this economy of ours suffer anymore. 
   I would like to enter into the Record, Madam Speaker, if I might, a  letter that was sent by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. These are the experts that say there is oil here, we ought to drill here, and here's how we ought to do it and here's how we ought to explore. And when you read this letter--which is now going to be put in the record--it tells very clearly that drilling costs for one well onshore costs a half a million dollars, and offshore it can cost up to $25 million. And so these geologists, when they get these permits to drill in a certain area, they go out to make darn sure that there's oil there before they sink a well that's going to cost $25 million. And that's an exploratory well. And it's a half million dollars if you drill onshore. So we're talking about big money. And when you realize that 68 percent of the people who drill for oil are independent drillers, they're not the big oil companies, and 87 percent of the people who drill for gas are not the big oil and gas companies, they're individual people who have small companies, and if they find oil they're going to get it, and if they find gas they're going to get it. And so this idea that these permits are not being researched and looked at is just crazy. 
   And when you read what the American Association of Petroleum Geologists said, and the President is a Mr. Willard Green, you realize that these people want to get oil and gas out of the ground, they want to get it out of the offshore sites on the Continental Shelf, and they can't do it simply because they don't have the ability to pursue these permits. 
   Only 3 percent of the area offshore is available for permitting and for drilling for oil; 97 percent of the Continental Shelf isn't being touched. And we have about 80 percent onshore that's not being touched. We ought to explore every place we can to move this country toward energy independence. We ought to remove ourselves from being dependent on Saudi Arabia, who isn't really a friend of ours, and on Venezuela, which really isn't a friend of ours, and other countries that aren't friends of ours. We ought to really move towards energy independence. And the minute we announce we're going to do that, we're going to drill on these sites, I'm sure the American people realize the price of oil is going to go down. The competitive nature of the free enterprise system and supply and demand will force the price of oil down, and it means the price of gasoline will go down as well.  
   June 3, 2008. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Steny Hoyer, Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  Hon. John Boehner, Minority Leader, House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  
   Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority leader Hoyer, and Minority Leader Boehner: Given the on-going debate about access and leasing activity on federal onshore lands and the Outer Continental Shelf, I would like to offer some perspective, on behalf of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), on the science and process of finding oil and natural gas. 
   AAPG, an international geoscience organization, is the world's largest professional geological society representing over 33,000 members; The purpose of AAPG is to advance the science of geology, foster scientific research, promote technology and advance the well-being of its members. With members in 116 countries, more than two-thirds of whom work and reside in the United States, AAPG serves as a voice for the shared interests of energy geologists and geophysicists in our profession worldwide. 
   AAPG strives to increase public awareness of the crucial role that the geosciences, and particularly petroleum and energy-related geology, play in our society. 
   Finding and developing oil and natural gas blends science, engineering, and economics. It has distinct phases: exploration, development. and production. And it is risky, because finding oil and natural gas traps, places where oil and natural gas migrate and concentrate, buried under thousands of feet of rock is like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. Talent and technology increase our chances of a discovery, but there are no guarantees. 
   What is exploration? Well, the grid pattern on a block map makes it tempting to think of exploration as a process of simply drilling a well in each grid block to determine whether it contains oil. But because of the natural variation in regional geology, one cannot assume oil and natural gas are evenly distributed across a given lease or region, Rather, exploration is about unraveling the geologic history of the rock underneath that grid block, trying to understand where oil or natural gas may have formed and where it migrated. If the geology isn't right, you won't find oil or natural gas. 
   Legendary geologist Wallace Pratt once observed, ``Where oil is first found is in the minds of men.'' When preparing a lease bid, geologists use their knowledge to identify the specific areas in a region that they believe have the highest likelihood of containing oil and natural gas traps. Successful exploration begins with an idea--a hypothesis of where oil may be found. 
   Since exploration is about developing and testing ideas, some acreage available for leasing is never leased. That is because no one develops a compelling idea of why oil or natural gas should be there. Similarly, some acreage is leased and drilled repeatedly with no success. Then, one day, a geologist develops an idea that works, resulting in new oil or natural gas production from the same land that others dismissed as barren. 
   Once a lease is awarded, geologists begin an intensive assessment. They collect new geological, geophysical, and geochemical data to better understand the geology in their lease area. They use these data to construct a geological model that best explains where they think oil and natural gas were generated, where it may have been trapped, and whether the trap is big enough to warrant drilling. 
   If there is no evidence of a suitable trap, the explorer will relinquish the lease and walk away. If they see a trap that looks interesting, they schedule a drill rig to find out if they are right. Drilling is the true test of the geologists' model, and it isn't a decision to be made lightly. Drilling costs for a single well can range from $0.5 million for shallow onshore wells to over $25 million for tests in deep water offshore. 
   As the well is drilling, geologists continually collect and evaluate data to see whether they conform to their expectations based on the geological model. Eventually, they reach the rock layer where they think the trap is located. 
   If there is no oil or natural gas when the drill reaches the trap they were targeting, they've drilled a dry hole. At this point the explorers will evaluate why the hole is dry: was there never oil and gas here; how was the geological model wrong; and can it be improved based on what they know from the drilled well? Depending on the results of this analysis, they may tweak the exploration idea and drill another well or decide the idea failed and relinquish the lease. 
   If there is oil and/or natural gas, they've drilled a discovery. Typically, they will test the well to see what volumes of oil and/or natural gas flow from it. Sometimes the flow rates do not justify further expenditures and the well is abandoned. If the results are promising, they will usually drill several additional wells to better define the size and shape of the trap. All of these data improve the geological model. 
   Based on this revised geological model, engineers plan how to develop the new field (e.g., number of production wells to drill, construction of oil field facilities and pipelines). 
   Using complex economic tools, they must decide whether the revenue from the oil and natural gas sales will exceed the past and continuing expenses to decide whether it is a commercial discovery. 
   The process of leasing, evaluating, drilling, and developing an oil or natural gas field typically takes five to ten years. Some fields come online sooner. Others are delayed by permitting or regulatory delays or constraints in the availability of data acquisition and drilling equipment and crews. Large projects and those in deep water may require a decade or more to ramp up to full production. 
   As you can see, oil and natural gas exploration is not simple and it is not easy. It requires geological ingenuity, advanced technologies, and the time to do the job right. It also requires access to areas where exploration ideas can be tested--the greater the number of areas available for exploration, the higher the chance of finding oil and natural gas traps. 
   U.S. consumers are burdened by high crude oil prices. Conservation and efficiency improvements are necessary responses, but equally important is increasing long-term supply from stable parts of the world, such as our very own federal lands and Outer Continental Shelf. 
   As Congress considers measures to deal with high crude oil prices, I urge caution. Policies that increase exploration costs, decrease the available time to properly evaluate leases and restrict access to federal lands and the Outer Continental Shelf do not provide the American people with short-term relief from high prices and undermine the goal of increasing stable long-term supplies. 
   I am happy to further discuss these ideas. Please contact me through our Geoscience & Energy Office in Washington, D.C. at 202-684-8225 or 202-355-3415. 
   Sincerely,         
   And when they talk about these speculators, there are people that speculate in gas futures and oil futures, there is no question about that. But the minute we say we're going to drill here in this country, you watch those prices drop; you watch those speculators start getting out of the market and selling what they have. And that will force the price  down on oil, it will force down the price of gasoline, and it will help this country. 
   And let me just say to my colleague--and I really appreciate him yielding to me--if we don't get with the program, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Senate and the House don't work with us on this side of the aisle, we're going to end up with gasoline prices being $5 or more per gallon. And if we have a conflict in the Middle East, as we've heard talked about here tonight, it could go much higher than that. That will put extreme pressure on this economy. 
   And I hate to predict this, but I really believe that if we don't get control of this situation and start drilling onshore and offshore in our territory, I think we could have a severe economic recession in this country. And when I say severe, I mean severe. The price of food is going up rapidly, the price of gasoline is going up rapidly. The price of products that are shipped across this country, which is almost--everything is going up very rapidly, and we're not doing a darn thing about it because we're depending on the Saudis. 
   We had Senators go over to the Saudis just recently and ask them to open up more oil fields so we can buy more of their oil. Why are we doing that? Why aren't we drilling in America so we don't have to depend on foreign oil? It makes absolutely no sense to send billions and billions and billions of dollars overseas and to other countries that don't even like us when we won't even drill here in the United States. 
   And so I am so happy that my colleague has taken the time and the effort to get the message out to our colleagues that they ought to sign onto this petition. And I know he feels like I do--and we come down here night after night talking to each other--that we would like, if we could talk to the American people, to put pressure on their Congressmen and Senators to sign onto this policy of drilling in America, to sign this petition so we can move toward energy independence. If we do that, and I would say this to my American friends all across this country, if we do that, you watch the price of gasoline go down. It will go down like a rock. You will see gasoline below $3 before you know it. But we have to say that we're going to drill for oil in this country, onshore and offshore. The minute we do that, America, just watch these prices go down. But first of all, we have to get this body and the other body, the House and the Senate, to get together and say, okay, we're going to drill. And we can't do that unless the American people put pressure on their Congressmen and Senators to sign on. 
   You have done yeoman service to this country, Congressman Westmoreland, because you've got 191 Members that have already signed that. And I'm going to work with you to get 218. And as I said before, the minute you get 218, I will walk with you to the Speaker's office and say, hey, it's time to bring this to the floor. 
   You're doing good work. I'm proud of you.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. No. That's right. They want to take tax breaks away. They want to increase taxes. And when you pass a tax increase on to a business or industry, oil or automobiles or whatever it is, it's passed on to the consumer in the form of price increases. So if they raise taxes, it won't give us one more drop of oil, which we ought to be drilling for right now, but it will make more expenses for the companies, and unless they can prove wrongdoing, those expenses will passed on to the consumer in the form of another price increase. So raising the taxes on the oil companies is only going to exacerbate the problem and make the cost of oil go up more. And I don't understand why my colleagues don't understand basic economics and the law of supply and demand. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. 
   We need to pass legislation that will get more oil to the refineries, build more refineries, as you've said, and start getting the price of oil down because we are energy independent. And just talking about, okay, we're going to hit Big Oil, that may resonate with a lot of people. Some people say, oh, my gosh, they are not paying enough taxes. They ought to be taxed more. They are making too much in profits. That's not going to bring any oil to the market, not a drop. 
   So I just say to my colleagues, quit beating on a dead horse. We have got to become energy independent. We have to drill here in America. And I hope everybody in the country who may be looking at this, and we can't talk to them, but everyone in the country who is looking at this tonight ought to ask their Congressmen and Senators, Is what you're talking about in Washington going to bring one more drop of oil to the marketplace? Is it going to move us toward energy independence? And if it isn't, they ought to sign that petition. They ought to get on with the program in making us more energy independent. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman would yield, let me just elaborate on that really quickly. 
   I hope everybody who may be paying attention to this, our colleagues in their offices, realize that business and industry have a certain margin of profit that they have to make to keep the doors open, whatever it is. And as you have just said, if they are taxed and they have a margin of profit of 8 percent and you raise their taxes, they're going to pass that cost increase on to the consumer in the form of a price increase. And that's what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, your colleagues, don't understand. 
   We really need to do what's necessary to move toward energy independence, and raising the price of gasoline by taxing these companies is not going to solve the problem. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman will yield just for a minute, I would like to say I agree with my colleague. These new forms of energy, these new technologies, are extremely important. I am kind of awed by the fact that you have taken the lead in Nebraska in getting this done. 
   But while we are doing that, the one problem that I think we have is we have to realize the transition to the new technologies is going to take time, and while that is taking place, we are going to have to have energy. That is why we ought to be able to drill in the United States, and do it in an environmentally safe way, so we can produce natural gas and oil here at home. And while we are doing the transitioning to the new technologies like you are talking about, we won't have to depend so much on foreign oil and what might happen in another part of the world.

   But, as you said and as has been said many times, that is going to take a transitional period, and during that transition, while we are trying to encourage more innovation, that we don't sink the ship by not having enough energy to get the job done.

   Madam Speaker, we are about to wrap this up. I just want to say to my colleagues, I see my colleague from down south is waiting patiently for us to end our Special Hour, I just want to say that we all want to work together. We want to solve this problem for the American people. We want to get the price of gasoline down and we want to go to new forms of energy. But it is going to take time. And during that time for transition, it is extremely important that we start moving toward energy independence. And a main cog in that wheel is drilling here at home for oil and natural gas. 
   So I hope, if I were talking to the American people, that they would talk to their Congressmen and Senators over this July 4th break. They are going to be there for parades and everything else. And I would say to the American people, if I could talk to them, talk to your Congressmen and your Senators. Tell them you want to be energy independent, you want to move toward energy independence, and we ought to drill here in the United States wherever we can.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I'd just like to say to my colleagues who oppose drilling for oil and natural gas in the United States, go home this weekend, this next week during the recess and talk to your constituents. Go to the gas stations and ask them if they would rather have the price of gasoline be as high as it is or start drilling for oil in the United States. 
   We have the supply. We have the ability. And we're not doing a darn thing about it, and the American people and our economy is suffering. It is not just gas prices. Food prices and everything else is going to go up because it has to be transported across the roads. 
   We need to move toward energy independence. We talked about it back in the seventies during the Carter years. We haven't done a darn thing in 30 years. It's time we started drilling here in the United States. The minute we start doing that the price will drop. Mark my words. 
   I'd just like to say to my colleagues, use a little analogy. Nero started fiddling while Rome burned. We're fiddling right now with the energy of the United States and the economy of the United States. This body and the other body has the ability to do something about the prices of gas and other commodities in this country, and we're not doing anything about it. 
   Another week has gone by. We're going to go back home. We haven't done a darn thing, and the American people are suffering. 
   So, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have reservations about drilling here in the United States and give me all this environmental stuff, this is the time to do it. We want to move toward other forms of energy. We want to be concerned about the ecology of this country and other forms of transportation, but at the same time, it's going to take time for that to happen. 
   We have to start drilling now. We can't wait. The American people want  us to do it, and if you don't believe me, ask them when you go home this week. They're signing petitions by the thousands. The people of this country want to move toward energy independence. They want their gas prices to come down. They want other prices to come down, and they won't until this Congress and the other body starts moving toward energy independence by drilling here in the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have been sitting down here and listening for about a couple of hours to the debate on the whole question of energy, and I would like to, from my perspective, tell you what I have gleaned from this debate. 
   First of all, Americans are suffering. That is a fact. The price of gasoline is too high. Another fact is that everything that is associated or has anything to do with transportation is being affected, and the prices are going up for groceries, for everything. And the American people are suffering. 
   I'm very concerned about the future of our economy if we don't get more oil and gas to market. 
   Now, a while ago, the chairman of the previous committee said that we're importing 61 percent of our oil, up from about 48 percent some time ago. This was the chairman on the Democrat side. I would agree with that. We are importing 61 percent, up about 13 percent from what we did a couple of years ago. The reason is we're not drilling enough here in America. We're not producing enough in America, and we're buying it from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela and other parts of the world. 
   We need to move towards energy independence, and if we don't, I predict we're going to have severe, severe economic problems over the next few years. We could have a major economic recession or depression if we don't get control of our energy prices because it's going to spread into every other area of our lives. And the American people, I think, sense that. And that's why I said to my colleagues, Go home and talk to your friends and neighbors at the gas station and ask them, Do you want to get the gas prices down, or do you want to make sure that we don't drill in America, that we're more concerned about environmental concerns than we are of taking care of our economy? 
   Obviously we want a better economy or better environmental situation. We want to go to alternative fuels. We want to do all of those things. Clean air, clean water. But at the same time, we don't want the entire economy of the United States to go down the tubes. And unless we get that energy independence by drilling here at home, that's a very real risk. We could have a real severe economic downturn. 
   Fact: Prices are too high. Fact: It's hurting our entire economy. Fact: We have enough oil and gas in oil shale to make us energy independent if we get it out of the ground and out of the ocean into the market. Fact: 68 percent of oil well explorers are small companies. That's been brought out here today. And 87 percent of gas producers are small businesses. We talk about these permits. Why would they not want us to drill? It's their livelihood.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Why would these oil producers and gas producers not want to drill? 
   So I think it's a bogus argument to say, Hey, they're holding these permits and not drilling. They want to make money, and if they don't drill, they're not going to make money. 
   In fact, 97 percent of the Continental Shelf and 94 percent of onshore areas are exempt from drilling, and the oil's there, the gas is there, and the coal shale is there; and we're not doing a darn thing about it, and we are arguing about it. There has to be a bipartisan move to solve this problem. It ain't gonna solve itself, and the American people continue to suffer. 
   So I would like to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, let's sit down and work this out because if we don't, everybody is going to suffer, and this blame game ain't solving anything.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, we realize that we need to start looking at every source of energy that we can come up with; solar, wind. Every kind. We need to move toward new forms of transportation; hybrid cars and other vehicles, maybe hydrogen-powered cars. 
   But in addition to that, while this transition from fossil fuels is taking place to these new technologies, we need to drill for oil. We need to be energy independent. We need to use such things as coal shale and offshore drilling, and drilling in Alaska, the ANWR, in order to get the oil that is necessary for us to move and become energy independent, and we can do that. But this Congress and the Senate, this House and the Senate, really needs to get together and come up with a plan that covers all of these things. If we don't start drilling for oil and using fossil fuel more efficiently in this country, we are going to have a severe problem. 
   The Iranians just fired some test missiles the other day. They did that in response to the Israelis flying about a hundred war planes down the Mediterranean for a distance that was pretty close to Tehran's distance from Israel. I think they are both sending signals. The head of the air force for the Iranians said that if there was any kind of an act of war toward them, they would sink ships in the Persian Gulf. 
   Twenty percent of the world oil goes through the Persian Gulf. You sink two ships in the Gulf of Hormuz and you're going to have chaos. We get as much as 40 percent of our oil from that region. If anything like that occurs, and as long as Iran keeps working toward their nuclear goals of building a nuclear weapon, the threat of war is definitely there. 
   Israel has been threatened with extinction by the Iranian leaders, Ahmadinejad, the President, and so the threat of a conflict is definitely there. The United States economically would be devastated if we weren't prepared for that eventuality because we don't have the energy here necessary to keep this economy moving. 
   The best way to make sure that doesn't happen is to use every source of energy we can come up with. While we are transitioning to these other forms of energy like air, wind, like solar, like hybrid cars, like coal shale, like hydrogen-powered cars, all those things, while we are moving toward those, which is going to take probably at least 10 years, or longer, some people say as many as 20, we need to have the energy to keep this country afloat without depending on Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, Venezuela and the Communist leader down there, Mr. Chavez. We need to move toward energy independence. The American people are paying between $4 and $5 a gallon for oil. 
   The Fourth of July parades just took place and I know that all of my colleagues heard from their constituents: Do something about the price of gasoline. The best thing we can do is start  drilling and looking for energy in America. I believe, and I think many experts believe, that if we start drilling in America and make a movement toward energy independence, you will see the price of oil drop very rapidly and, along with it, the price of gasoline. 
   But as long as we stand around here and don't do anything, we run the threat of a real economic chaos in this country because we aren't prepared to be dealing with our own energy problems if we can't get the oil from Venezuela and from other parts of the world, like Saudi Arabia. We are just not prepared for it. 
   We have the energy in this country and we are not drilling for it. We are sending as much as $500 million a day, a day, to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil that we have right here in this country. We could keep that money at home, we could create more jobs while we are coming up with alternative sources of energy. But we are not doing it. 
   So I say to my Democrat colleagues again tonight, and I will be down here day after day and week after week saying, Let's get together and solve this problem. 
   I saw that the popularity of the Congress is now down to 7 percent. You know why? The American people are fed up with us not doing anything. We need to get together and solve this energy problem. We need to have energy independence. And we need to start doing it right now. 
   Remember what I said. If a conflict breaks out over there, all of us are going to be sorry that we didn't do something about it, about dealing with energy here at home. 
   Energy independence. Drill in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (MAJOR ARTHUR CHIN POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I will submit the majority of my remarks for the Record. 
   I would just like to say that after reading about this gentleman, Mr. Chin, I think it is a great honor for him to receive having his name put on this post office. But he earned it. He really earned it. When you read about his exploits, as my colleague just mentioned, you can see why people like this deserve recognition.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a great American, Arthur Chin, who passed away in 1997 at the age of 85. 
    Angered by the Japanese invasion of China's northeastern provinces, Mr. Chin sailed to China along with other Chinese-American flyers to volunteer for the Chinese Air Force in 1932. After enlisting in the Chinese Air Force, Mr. Chin fought in many aerial battles against the more experienced Japanese. 
    Mr. Chin excelled in his military career and rose through the ranks to become a major in 1939. By this time, he had been shot down and wounded three times, and was severely burned when his Gloster Gladiator was hit by enemy fire at 3,000 feet and exploded. 
    Amazingly, he survived but he spent five years recovering in hospitals all over the world. Despite the extensive healing process, Mr. Chin valiantly flew again. 
    He transported supplies from India to China over the Himalayas until the end of the war. 
    After the war, Mr. Chin briefly flew for China National Airways Corporation in China until the Communists took over in 1949. 
    Upon returning to the United States, Mr. Chin settled back in his hometown of Portland, Oregon where he took a job with the United States Postal Service. 
    Because of his outstanding military service, he was awarded numerous medals, including the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross. Soon after his death, Mr. Chin was also honored as one of the first American aviators inducted into the American Combat Airmen's Hall of Fame. 
    In recognition of his years of selfless public service to his State and country, I believe it is fitting to name a post office in Beaverton, Oregon, in Mr. Chin's honor.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   I rise today to urge passage of this bill honoring a tremendous citizen of the great State of Texas for her continued dedication to improving her region, state, and country--the Honorable Cyndi Taylor Krier. 
   A native of Texas, Cyndi Krier has proudly followed in the footsteps of a long line of public servants. Her grandfather served as the postmaster in Dinero, Texas, until his death in 1956 and was succeeded by his wife, Cyndi's grandmother, who served as postmaster for an additional 20 years. Additionally, Cyndi's own mother served the USPS in Beeville, Texas, for more than 30 years. 
   Earning both her bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Texas, Austin, Mrs. Krier was elected to the State Senate in 1984 and went on to serve two terms, until 1992. 
   In 1992, Mrs. Krier became the first woman and first Republican ever elected as Bexar County Judge. In this capacity she worked to ``Build a Better Bexar County.'' 
   Throughout her career as judge, she focused on youth education programs, broad-based ethics reform, recycling and conservation, competition for country and contracts and controlling government spending. She was successfully reelected twice in 1994 and 1998. 
   In 2001, Governor Rick Perry appointed her to a six-year term on the University of Texas System Board of Regents. 
   She served in various capacities on the board including as vice chairman and as Chairman of the Academic Affairs Committee. 
   Throughout her career, Mrs. Krier has remained active in the community outside of her professional duties. Whether through her work with the United Way, serving as Chairman of the UT Austin Ex-Student Association or the number of statewide task forces helping to plan for the future of Texas, Judge Krier has consistently demonstrated her commitment to improving others' lives. 
   I urge swift passage of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 10250 John Saunders Road in San Antonio, Texas, as the ``Cyndi Taylor Krier Post Office Building,'' to honor this dedicated, passionate, and tireless public servant. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this fitting tribute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, the reason I want to do that is because I remember ``Big Cat.'' When I was a boy, I remember when he broke into the NBA, and he was an outstanding basketball player. 
   The prejudice that occurred back in those days was unbelievable. I played sports at Shortridge High School, and we used to go down to a place called St. Andrews and we played against some really great basketball players who understood how the game was to be played. 
   Big Cat said, and I just read his biography, his background here, said it was tougher playing basketball on the grass courts and the asphalt courts than it was when he went into college and the NBA, and I can attest to the fact that that was pretty rough basketball. 
   We played against a guy, he probably doesn't remember me very well, but we played against a guy named Oscar Robertson back in the fifties who was a pretty good basketball player from Indiana. And ``Biscuit'' Williams and Herschel Turner and some of the other guys that had to endure the prejudices of that time were really outstanding basketball players. You have to give an awful lot of credit to people who were willing to fight and overcome the racial prejudice and barriers that existed at that time. 
   So Big Cat gets my vote, along with Oscar Robertson and all these other guys. I really admire them for what they went through, and I also admire them for their basketball ability. I am telling you, some of those guys were unbelievable. Oscar Robertson was the only guy I ever saw play basketball who could go in five different directions at once and hit a shot without touching the rim. He was unbelievable. And Big Cat was in that league as well.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 286, honoring the accomplishments of Lloyd, the first African-American man to play in the NBA. 
   How strange it must seem to young people that a league now 80 percent populated by African-American players once didn't allow them. 
   But before Earl Lloyd signed with the Washington Capitols in 1950, that wasn't the case. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to take away anything from the well-chronicled accomplishments of Jackie Robinson. But in some ways, it must have been more difficult to do what Earl Lloyd did. 
   Baseball is played on a big field, and the players are rarely close enough to the fans to hear their comments. 
   Basketball is played in a room--sometimes not all that big of a room. Players wear what amounts to glorified underwear. In basketball, players hear the comments that get directed at them. 
   But Earl Lloyd was used to that. Raised in Alexandria, Virginia, Lloyd honed his skills on the tough playgrounds of this very city, Mr. Speaker. He once said college and even pro basketball were easy after the education he'd received on the Banneker and Parkview playgrounds in Washington, DC. 
   Mr. Speaker, Earl Lloyd did not accomplish what he did because of his skin color. And how did he do it? He helped his teams win. At West Virginia State, he led his team to two conference championships and one runner-up finish. In the pros, after being drafted by Washington, he played six seasons with the Syracuse Nationals. 
   In 1955, the Nationals won the NBA title, making Lloyd the first African-American man to own an NBA championship ring. 
   Today, he works in community relations for the Bing Group, which was founded by another D.C. basketball legend--Dave Bing. 
   He continues to contribute and make his community proud. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this fitting tribute.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Stark-Burton amendment to H.R. 3121 the ``Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007.'' This amendment is nearly identical to an amendment we offered last year which passed this House unanimously. I want to thank my colleague from California, Mr. Stark for once again cosponsoring this amendment. I would also like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for including parts of our original amendment in this years legislation which will ensure that FEMA notifications of elevation changes are published in the Federal Register, published in the most widely circulated local newspapers and provided to the chief executive officer of each affected community by certified mail. 
   Unfortunately, while extending notifications of changes in flood elevations to newspapers and local officials is helpful, H.R. 3121 misses the bull's eye by ignoring the most important part of the Burton/Stark amendment from last year; namely the requirement that FEMA provide written notification by first class mail to each property owner affected by a proposed change in flood elevations. Last year in my district we had about 300 or 400 people who had no idea that FEMA was redrawing the flood map in their area until they suddenly received notice from their insurance companies and mortgage lenders saying that they now lived in a flood plain and they needed to spend an extra thousand or $2,000 a year for flood insurance. There hadn't been a flood in that area of Johnson County, Indiana for over 100 years. In fact, no one had ever heard of having a flood in this area. 
   Once these flood maps have been finalized the only way to remove a property from the flood plan is to file an individual appeal complete with extensive survey work paid for entirely at the property owner's expense. The process is expensive and time-consuming and homeowners must still buy and retain flood insurance throughout the process. However, if homeowners can find out while the maps are still preliminary, they have time to utilize an automatic 90-day appeal process to have the remaps reevaluated, and potentially remove blocks of homes from the flood plain, at little to no expense to the owners. 
   What the Stark-Burton amendment does is very simple: 
   Requires FEMA to provide written notification by first-class mail to each property owner affected by a proposed change in flood elevations; 
   Requires the notifications be sent after the preliminary maps are released but before the required 90-day appeal period; and, 
   Requires the notification include an explanation of the appeal process and contact information for responsible officials. 
   Mail notices to each property owner affected by projected flood elevation remapping would be a simple and effective way to notify residents of changes. Such a process is direct and ensures that all affected parties are able to take full advantage of FEMA's community appeals process. The cost to the Federal Government of these mail notifications would be small compared to the millions of dollars homeowners would otherwise have to pay in last-minute flood insurance or to challenge FEMA's flood elevation determinations. 
   As Chairman FRANK said last year when we debated this issue, and my colleague Mr. STARK just said so briefly and eloquently, anytime a conservative from Indiana and liberal from California can come together on an issue it is truly bipartisan. In fact this is a nonpartisan issue that affects nearly everyone in the 20,000 communities nationwide that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. To ensure that all property owners are fully aware of any changes in flood plain area maps, and consequently their property values, is simply the right and fair thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support the Stark/Burton amendment to H.R. 3121.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (WAR IS HELL -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by commenting on the lady's speech that was just made. I understand her position. War is hell. It is a horrible thing. We have been out to Bethesda and Walter Reed Hospital, and we have seen the damage that war has done to a lot of our young people. 
   It is a terrible thing. It was a terrible thing in all the other conflicts we have been involved in where people have been killed and maimed, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War. War is horrible. Nobody wants war. We all want our troops home as quickly as possible. There is no question about that. Where we differ is what this war is all about and what will happen if we do not do what is necessary. 
   Yesterday, a Sunni insurgent coalition in Iraq announced an Islamic cabinet, and they named an al Qaeda leader as their Minister of War. Throughout this whole debate over these years, the opponents on the other side have said al Qaeda was not involved in Iraq, that we did not have any reason to go in there. Al Qaeda was involved in Iraq. Osama bin Laden was involved in Iraq. The people that bombed the USS Cole, the World Trade Center, our embassies around the world were in Iraq, and now they have appointed a war minister over there who is the head of al Qaeda in Iraq today. 
   So there is a world war against terrorism. Al Qaeda is the main leader of that war against the United States and the rest of the world. It is a war that we cannot afford to lose. They are using children as bombs. They are taking carloads of dynamite and other explosives and are driving into crowded places to kill people. 
   We all know how horrible that is, and we also know how horrible it was when al Qaeda operatives flew into the World Trade Center and killed over 3,000 people, the worst tragedy in American history, and it was on our soil. So we are in a world war against radicals, al Qaeda, and we cannot back down. 
   If we back down in Iraq, as my colleagues on the other side want us to do, it is going to send a signal, already is sending a signal to them, the al Qaeda and the terrorists, that we will not persevere, that we will back down, and they will, as they said yesterday, create an Islamic State in Iraq. And if you create an Islamic State in Iraq and do away with the democracy that is there now, you are going to provide a breeding ground for more terrorism and more attacks on the West and Europe and the rest of the world. 
   This is a war that may go on for a while, but it is one we must not and cannot lose. My colleagues on the other side are well-intentioned, but the fact of the matter is they want to encourage and they are encouraging by their factions, our enemy, our mortal enemy, the terrorists and al Qaeda. 
   Now, yesterday, I was very distressed when the majority leader in the United States Senate said that we have lost the war. To say that when al Qaeda is appointing a war minister in Iraq is a  tragic mistake. It should never have been said. The man that they appointed, al-Muhajer, is a terrorist, and his goal is to destroy the United States and our allies and change the whole world to radical Islam. That is his goal. That is Osama bin Laden's goal. They are there, and they want to destroy us and we must hang tough. 
   The President is standing there by himself. I know his popularity is very, very low, as Lincoln's was and George Washington's was when they were losing the wars that they were involved in, but this is something that the American people have to realize is absolutely essential if we are going to survive as a Nation in the long term. 
   These people want to destroy us, and if we back down in Iraq, make no mistake, they will gain in strength and they will attack us again and our allies again around the world with acts of terrorism. They will be coming out from under the doors like cockroaches, and it is going to be hard to stop them. My view is we either whip them there or we are going to have to fight them here.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, you know, one of the things that I think everybody in business understands is if you raise the taxes on a business, they pass that tax along to the consumer in the form of a price increase, cars, no matter what the product is. And in this particular case, what we're talking about tonight is oil. 
   Senator Obama, who is running for President, says we ought to tax the windfall profits of the oil companies. Well, that may be a good idea as far as he is concerned, but when you tax the oil companies, they're going to pass that on to the consumer in the form of price increases. Gas prices are already high enough as it is.  
   What we should be doing instead of increasing taxes like that is to drill in the United States of America. As my colleagues have just said, we have a lot of oil in the ANWR, and the geologists have told us there is oil there, as much as 1 million or 2 million barrels of oil a day, which could drive the price of gasoline down. And yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Senator Obama continue to say, no, no, that's not the answer; raise taxes on the oil companies. 
   That isn't going to get us one drop of oil. We need to drill here in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, President Bush today gave a speech, and he talked about the terrorist threat, and he talked about the attempts on the United States that have taken place since 9/11. He talked a little bit about the attempted attack last week at Fort Dix. 
   Yet I don't believe any of the media is paying any attention to that. It seems like every time the President talks about the threat, it just never makes the television networks. 
   That is very troubling to me, because after 9/11, the President said we are in a world war against terrorism, and it may go on for a long, long time. It may go on for more than my tenure in office. It may go on for decades. 
   When you are fighting a war of terrorism like that, you have to be resolute of purpose. There's no question that the war that's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan has been very trying on the American people, but this is a war against terrorism, and we must be resolute of purpose. 
   This week on the Internet, al Qaeda had put out a new message to possible recruits for them around the world. I would like to read to you what was on the Internet. 
   It says, al Qaeda has a new opening graphic for its propaganda tapes, the U.S. Capitol, that's this place right here, under attack. His quote, ``The Islamic State of Iraq ..... March Towards Washington,'' reads the headline in English superimposed over a digitally created scene of the U.S. Capitol under attack in the introductory sequence of one tape released on the Internet this week. 
   Another from al Qaeda's ``as Sahab'' production arm announces, ``Holocaust of the Americans in the land of Khorasan,'' and shows an image of the U.S. Capitol. They introduce a short clip of al Qaeda fighters. 
   ``This is a disturbing trend,'' says Laura Mansfield, an Arabic expert who monitors jihadi videos on the Internet. ``Recall that in January of 2006, Osama bin Laden said that plans for attacks in the U.S. were in progress,'' Mansfield told the Blotter on ABCNews.com. ``It may be that this new imagery is designed to motivate terrorist activity in the U.S., but it is certainly intended as a recruiting tool and perhaps intended to reassure al Qaeda's jihadi followers that they haven't forgotten their goal of an al Qaeda attack on Washington, D.C.,'' this city. 
   I don't tout television shows very often, but occasionally I urge my colleagues to watch something that I think is important. I just say to my colleague, I understand that tonight on the O'Reilly show on Fox Network, he is going to talk about a poll that was taken among Muslims in the United States. There are approximately 6 million Muslims in the United States, and I believe that 99 percent of them or 95 percent of them are very patriotic Americans. But in this poll they found that the Muslims between the ages of 18 and 29, approximately around 20 percent of them, are sympathetic to the terrorists who kill themselves, blow themselves up in an attack on American targets. This is a very disturbing poll that was taken. 
   This is a very trying time for Americans and for this country. I urge all of my colleagues to remember what the President said after 9/11. Remember, this is a world war against terrorism. Remember what I just read here that was on the Internet, that their ultimate goal is to attack Washington, D.C., and remember that there is a growing number of young men in America, Muslims, who are very sympathetic to the terrorists who blow themselves up. 
   We need to make sure that the American people understand the gravity of this situation. To back down to the terrorists now would be a big mistake. It's very important that we stay our ground in Iraq and throughout the world and send a message to the terrorists that we will not surrender and we will not be defeated.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. I intend to yield a couple of minutes to my colleague here. 
   But before I do, my colleague who just spoke said that we ought to be working together, and I really agree with that. The problem is, to my knowledge, the people on our side really weren't consulted about these appropriation bills in any real detail, and we didn't know that they were going to put pork-barrel projects in the bill after the fact, maybe in conference committee when we didn't have any idea what was going on there and we didn't have any control over those bills because they weren't, those pork-barrel projects weren't debated here on the floor. 
   So let me just say that we really should work together, and I hope you'll convey that to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so in the future we won't be taking this much time on the floor. 
   I will be happy to yield to my colleague.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his remarks, and I agree with him. 
   The fact of the matter is that there is billions of dollars in pork that is stuck in this bill or will be stuck in this bill and nobody in this place knows what it is going to be. And many of the liberal newspapers that support your side of the aisle, the Democrat side of the aisle, are taking issue with this practice. So even your own supporters, the New York Times and Washington Post, are giving you Hades for this. 
   So I would just like to say my colleagues, you ought to reevaluate what you are doing today because I think it is hurting you. You are sticking a knife in your own foot by doing this. 
   Now, the thing I would like to say before my time runs out is that the Democrats, since they have taken charge, have increased in authorization bills by $105 billion in new spending. They are hiding pork, as I said, from the American people. 
   They want to let the tax cuts expire, which means that everybody in this country will have a tax increase. In Indiana it will amount to about $2,200 per person. That is because you are letting the tax cuts expire. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Rahall). The gentleman's time has expired.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, if the tax cuts expire, that in effect is a tax increase. And that tax increase will amount to $392 billion on the American people, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   This second-degree amendment here only cuts $9 million in spending. Just $9 million. You guys have already authorized $105 billion in new spending. Why in the world would you object to a $9 million spending cut? It doesn't make sense. 
   My colleague from Tennessee just said that we ought to work together. I really agree with that, and I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the appropriations chairman will take that to heart and in the future not do the things that he did in this bill so we won't have to stay here all night and all day debating the same paragraph in one bill because you won't work with the Republican minority. You always complained about us and now you are doing worse. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair would remind the gentleman from Indiana to address his remarks to the Chair.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have been here in this Chamber for a long time, and I was here in the minority back in the early 1980s when my colleagues over there were running this place. They ran this place for 40 years. For 40 years they ran this place, and they ran the budget right into the ground and raised taxes and spent more money. 
   But they became reformed, like some ladies of the evening are reformed. And they changed their spots and said, we have got to do something about spending in the Congress because the Republicans took over for 12 years, and they didn't like the way we ran this place. They said we were spending too much money, and they went on a tirade time after time, saying that they needed to be back in power because they were going to be fiscally responsible, and they were going to control spending, and they were going to do everything they did not do for 40 years when they had control. 
   I used to walk past my colleagues' offices when we were in charge, and they had big signs out in front of their offices: Today the national debt went up this much and today spending went up this much, and it is all because of the Republicans, they were implying. 
   Well, they got control back and what has happened? They have authorized $105.5 billion in new spending over the next 5 years. And they complain because we want to cut $1.241 million out of this bill. Just $1.241 million, not billions but a million. And you don't like that. And we are keeping the spending at last year's level. 
   My colleagues on this side of the aisle do not want to vote for a balanced budget amendment. They will tell you they want to balance the budget. But when a balanced budget amendment comes to the floor, they almost all vote against it because they know where their power lies, and that is in spending and taxes, spending and taxes; and that is what they are going to do. 
   The tax cuts that President Bush and this Congress, back in the early part of the Bush administration, put in place, they want those tax cuts to expire. And in Indiana alone, that means that most of the people in my State will have a $2,200 per person tax increase because the tax cuts expire. They want those to expire. They want to spend more money like they are doing right now. They want to extend spending over the next 5 years by $105 billion. And yet they are the fiscally responsible people in this body. 
   I would just like to say to my colleagues and anybody else who is paying attention that they really ought to look at history. They really ought to look at what the Democrats said before they took power, and then they ought to look very seriously at what they are doing right now. They want more taxes. They want more spending. They want more control. And that is exactly what they did the 40 years they had control before the Republicans took office and the Bush administration. 
   There is no question that when we were in charge, we spent too much money. But compared to them, we are pikers. And the American people are going to find out once again how much these people spend and what big spenders they are and what big taxers they are. It is going to happen. 
   Hopefully, the American people will get the message and put the right people back in charge.

But I haven't heard anybody over there say anything good about the President, who is trying to protect us against terrorism around the world, which is emanating from the Middle East and al Qaeda. Al Qaeda are the ones that are running the opposition to the United States troops over there right now. 
   We were attacked by al Qaeda. We were going to go to war to stop terrorism against al Qaeda. And nobody is saying anything good about the President, who is trying to protect this country, and if we say one thing about the majority leader on the other side we are supposed to be condemned.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (NEED FOR SAFE VACCINATIONS -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that's made the United States and the world healthier than at any period of the world has been vaccinations. Vaccinations have stopped so many dreaded diseases from killing hundreds of thousands, millions of people, it's not even funny. 
   But while vaccines have saved so many lives, there have also been some shortcomings in vaccines. When I was chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, I held hearings on autism; and we have gone from 1 in 10,000 children who are autistic to 1 in 150. We have an absolute epidemic of autism in this country, and hundreds of thousands of families have been affected and they have nowhere to turn. 
   Because of that, we passed in the 1980s what was called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund, and it was supposed to take care of families and people who were injured by vaccines and had nowhere to turn. Well, that was supposed to be a nonconfrontational system. But unfortunately, there has been nobody, up until recently, who has been paid out of the vaccine compensation fund. And one of the reasons is because Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration have said that the mercury in vaccines, 50 percent of it is a preservative called thimerosal. The mercury in vaccines did not cause autism, and there have been a lot of studies that have come out saying the mercury in the vaccines was not a root cause of the autism crisis that we have in this country. 
   In fact, in 2004, there was a report that said categorically that the thimerosal, the mercury in the vaccines, was not a cause of autism. And yet, just recently, in the Journal of Child Neurology, an article published by Drs. DeSoto and Hiltlan, both doctors, reexamined that study and they said it was in error and that there was no doubt that the mercury in the vaccinations was a contributing factor to the epidemic of autism that we have in this country. 
   As a result of that and other information, some of the test cases that have been raised and are in progress right now have come before the special master. And just recently, a young  lady who was damaged by vaccinations, a young lady from Georgia, Hannah Poling, her case went before the special master, and the Justice Department had five attorneys who said that this young lady was not damaged in part by the mercury in the vaccinations. This young lady got five vaccinations in one day, most of which contained thimerosal, which is 50 percent ethyl-mercury. Shortly thereafter, she became autistic. 
   The same thing happened to my grandson. He got nine shots in one day, and within a short time, he became autistic. I won't go into all of the details of what happens when you become autistic, but it is certainly a tremendous change in the lives of not only the child but the entire family. 
   But anyhow, this case went before the special master along with two others. And just recently, a decision was made in that case by the special master; and in spite of the evidence that was presented by the Health and Human Services, the FDA, and the Justice Department, the special master awarded damages to this family and said that this girl was damaged by the vaccination. And the case was brought because this young lady took several shots, five in one day, that had mercury in them. So this is the first case that shows, in my opinion, that the mercury in vaccines is a contributing factor to the epidemic of autism that we have in this country. 
   The reason I come before the floor tonight to talk about this is it's time that we got mercury out of all vaccinations. We've been able to get it out of most of the children's vaccinations, but it's still in some. I think it is in three or four now. It needs to be out of all children's vaccinations. 
   We have had an increase in the cases of Alzheimer's in this country, and that's because in part, in my opinion, because mercury is in almost all of the adult vaccinations. When you get a flu shot or almost any kind of a shot, you're getting ethyl-mercury injected into your body. Now if we eat fish, they tell us to be careful because there's mercury in the fish and it may cause neurological damage. Yet, we are injecting it into ourselves and into our children through vaccinations. 
   It's high time that the Food and Drug Administration, Health and Human Services, and the pharmaceutical industry decides we want vaccinations because they give us a better quality of life and makes us live longer and prevents us from getting diseases, but we have to get mercury out of all vaccinations out of anything that goes into the human body; and until we do that, the problems with autism and other neurological diseases will continue to rise. 
   So I would like to say to my colleagues, I hope you will pay attention to this special order tonight. We have to get mercury out of all vaccinations. We can do it with single-shot vials that will not require that preservative; and once we do that, I think we will have a much better quality of life, and people will be able to get vaccinations without worrying about becoming autistic.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, this bill is all about the future. It's about protecting the Democrat incumbents to make sure they get reelected. This should be called ``The Protect Congressmen and Congresswomen Bill.'' We're bringing this bill to the floor at the 11th hour just before we adjourn for this year, unless we have a special session. They know full well this bill is not going to get through the Senate. So we're not doing anything. This is window dressing. 
   We have a severe problem in this country, and they're doing nothing but creating a facade so the American people will think they're doing something when they're not. This bill will not do anything to help people with the price they are paying for food, gasoline, clothes or anything else that is transported by diesel or gasoline. It's not going to do anything because it's not going to go anywhere. 
   In addition to that, this bill has no nuclear, no clean coal, no refineries and no revenue sharing with the States. So if a State says they want to drill off the coast 50 or 100 miles, which is a long way and it's going to be really deep, they are not going to do it unless they're going to get something back, some revenue back. Why else would they do it? So this bill is really a facade because it's not going to encourage the States to allow drilling off their coast because they don't get anything for it. This bill increases taxes on the oil companies. It's going to discourage further exploration and further drilling. 
   This bill is something that the American people ought to know is a fraud. It is not going anywhere. It's not going to  solve the gasoline crisis problem. It's not going to solve the energy problem. But it's going to help reelect some of the Democrats because they have heard from their constituents when they went home, you have to do something about the energy problem. You have to drill here in America. You have to pass a bill. So they're going to pass a bill. But this bill is not going to do anything. It's going to accomplish nothing. It's not going to get through the Senate. And we're going to be in the same situation 6 months from now because they will not move a real energy bill. 
   There was a bipartisan bill that Mr. Abercrombie of Hawaii and Mr. Peterson of Pennsylvania sponsored. I was a cosponsor of that bill. It had all kinds of compromises in it. But it dealt with the energy crisis. They don't want that bill. The Speaker doesn't want that bill. And they're not going to do a darn thing, and the American people ought to know.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, for many years, Washington, D.C. has had the distinction of being the murder capital of America. It's very high as far as crime is concerned, right up at the top. 
   I want to tell you a couple of stories, and I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle listen to this. I had a gal that worked for me, a young lady that worked for me as my secretary, years ago. She lived about four blocks from the Capitol, and one night she had her window opened this much on the second floor. A guy shimmied up the drain pipe, came in with a 4-inch knife and stabbed her four times. The only way she could protect herself was to hit him in the head with a pan. She couldn't have mace, she couldn't have a gun, and so she was at his mercy. 
   When I first got elected, I took a cab to the Capitol. On the way in, I said to the cab driver, I said, tell me about Washington, D.C. He said, ``Oh, it's a beautiful place, but there is an awful lot of crime.'' I said, ``Back in Indiana I used to carry a lot of money in my business, and I had a gun permit. Maybe I should get one here.'' He said, ``Oh, you can't get a gun permit here in Washington, D.C. Nobody has guns here except the police and the crooks.'' He reached under the front seat of his cab and pulled a .38 out and says, ``But if you want one of these, I can get it for you in 15 minutes.'' 
   Now a person who wants to defend themselves and their family in this city, and they want to do it legally, they are at the mercy of the people who can get these guns in 15 minutes. 
   The record shows that this has been a murder leader and a crime leader across this country, because criminals know if they break into your house, you don't have any way to defend yourselves. That's why the Supreme Court made the decision that it did, because people have a right to protect themselves. 
   You know, I live across the river in Virginia. The crime rate over there in Alexandria is much, much lower than it is here, and it's because the people have the right to defend themselves and their property in their own homes. If they want to, they can get a gun permit to carry a gun to protect themselves. 
   That's the way it ought to be in Washington, D.C., and it isn't. As a result, we have had Members of Congress mugged, the former minority leader of the House was mugged, beaten half to death. Two of my staff people have been mugged and beaten, one of them twice, and he took their money. They had no way to defend themselves, none, even in their homes. 
   Now, we are not asking you to give gun permits to everybody that's walking around the streets, but they ought to at least have the right to have a gun in their home to protect themselves if somebody breaks in. 
   I want to end up by saying this, I think this is a beautiful capital, I enjoy being in Congress, but there is no way in hell I would live in this city. I live across the river where it's safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I would like to say to the gentlewoman who just spoke that I sure share her admiration for Jesse Helms. I had the honor to work with him on legislation known as the Helms-Burton law, and I want you to know he was a wonderful man, a titan and a real conservative, and the kind of man that everybody in America could be proud to say that he was a Senator in the august body on the other side of the building. 
   Let me just say briefly today that we just celebrated the 4th of July, known as Independence Day, and we celebrate that because we became an independent Nation after the Revolutionary War by winning that war and becoming not a colony of Great Britain, but a United States of America, an independent country. Our Declaration of Independence. 
   Now we are faced with another problem. It is called energy dependence. We are dependent on Saudi Arabia, we are dependent on other countries in the Middle East, we are dependent on countries in South America like Venezuela that are not friends of ours, and we ought to be moving toward energy independence. 
   Any of my colleagues who were out marching in parades during the 4th of July recess ought to know that the people they were talking to on those parade routes were saying, hey, we don't want gasoline at $4 or $5 a gallon. We don't need to have gasoline at $4 or $5 a gallon, because we can drill right here in the United States and get  enough oil or gas or other energy products so we can be energy independent. All we have to do is start. 
   The problem is in this body and the other body on the other side of the building, they will not move, the majority will not move on drilling here in the United States. We could drill in the ANWR in Alaska and get 1 to 2 million barrels of oil a day. We could drill off the continental shelf and get 1 or 2 million barrels of oil a day. We have about a 400 or 500 year supply of natural gas. And we are not doing anything. We are not drilling. 
   We are sending $400 or $500 million a day over to Saudi Arabia and to Venezuela and South America for oil that we could produce right mere in America. It is costing us jobs, it is costing us energy, it is causing food price hikes, the price of anything else that you buy that is transported by truck in this country, and the people going to and from work or paying $4 or $5 a gallon or $70 or $80 or $90 for one tankful.     
   They can't survive. The economy will continue to go down if we don't do something about these energy prices. And we are not going to do it until we allow this country to drill, this government to drill in places like the ANWR and off the Continental Shelf, and use the coal shale that we have here in abundance to produce our own energy. We can do it. The people of America by about an 80 percent margin say drill now, drill in America, lower those gas prices. And we are not doing it. 
   We just celebrated our declaration of independence from Great Britain. It is high time we had a declaration of independence regarding our energy. We need to drill here in America, we need to drill in the ANWR, we need to drill offshore and become energy independent. It is time. And I hope all of my colleagues will sign my good friend, Mr. Westmoreland from Georgia's petition over here that will let everybody know in this country, all of their constituents know that they are committed to drilling in America to get energy prices down. 
   He is going to take a one-hour special order here pretty quick telling everybody why we should be drilling here in America. So if I were talking to people across this country, Madam Speaker, I would say call your Congressman, call your Senator, and tell them to sign Mr. Westmoreland's petition so we can move toward energy independence. It is high time. We should do it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I have high regard for everybody in this whole body, but when someone does something wrong, it is imperative that it be brought to light, and brought to light in a public forum. 
   About a week ago, the Speaker of the House, along with others, took a trip that the State Department and the White House disapproved of, to visit Syria. Syria is a terrorist state, has been on the terrorist state list for a long, long time. They have been working with Iran, they have been a transit point for weapons that went into Lebanon, weapons that killed a lot of people. They support Hezbollah and Hamas, two terrorist organizations. They work closely with Iran which has been involved in terrorism and is also on the terrorist list. And for the Speaker and others to go over there and talk with Assad, in my opinion and in the opinion of the law, the Logan Act, that it was not only the wrong thing to do and sent the wrong message, but it was a violation of an act of Congress. 
   I want to read to you the language in the Logan Act. It says, ``Any citizen of the United States, wherever he or she may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 3 years or both.'' 
   Now, I am not under any illusions that there is going to be any censorship of the Speaker or any prosecution of the Speaker, but I think the American people ought to know that she weakened the position of the United States in the Middle East, and she broke the law; and she should be held accountable for that. And tonight I hope the American people get this message and send a message to the Speaker. 
   She has talked recently, as I understand it, and she is thinking about going to Iran and talking to Ahmadinejad. He is one of the terrorist leaders of the world. And if she were to go over there while he is building nuclear weapons and the whole world is trying to get him to stop, it would be a sure sign of weakness on the part of the United States, and it would send such a signal that they would be more aggressive than they have been in the past. 
   In 1938 and 1939, Winston Churchill was looked upon as a warmonger because he warned about Hitler, and yet Lord Chamberlain went to Munich, Germany, and he signed a peace agreement on Hitler's terms, gave Hitler the Sudetenland, came back, and said, ``Peace in our time,'' because he went and talked with Hitler and he thought he could convince him not to be aggressive. That was the green light for World War II and 62 million people died. 
   Talking to these terrorists without getting them to discuss and want to change and move away from their policies of mass destruction is wrong. Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons and they will already have one; they are trying to build a delivery system for intercontinental, intermediate range, and short-range missiles. 
   We must not send a signal of weakness. I think the Speaker did the wrong thing. I believe she violated the Logan Act because she didn't have the approval of both the White House and the Defense Department, and I hope that she won't do this again. And I certainly hope she won't go to Iran.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I want to comment right now on a little article that was in the paper. Probably most Americans didn't see it today. But I followed what went on in Zimbabwe a long time ago when the communist leader, Mr. Mugabe, took over. He said they were going to make that country greater because of the movement towards communism. 
   Well, here is what happened since he took office: The government says that it is going to have to import 100 tons of extra wheat but that is still going to be really short of the 375,000 tons that they need to feed their people. And the United Nations World Food Programme estimates that at least 3 million people will need emergency food aid in Zimbabwe before the April corn harvest. 
   Communism simply doesn't work. It hasn't worked in the past. It didn't work in the Soviet Union, and it hasn't worked in Zimbabwe or other places. And we ought to be very thankful that we live in a democratic republic in this country. And we ought to do everything we can to help those living under the yoke of communism and do everything to can to make them free. 
   I think it is extremely important because when you go to those countries, as I have, and you see what those people have to live like and you see the starvation, little children with big bellies because they don't have the food they need, you realize that the communist menace is very, very costly anyplace it occurs in the whole world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, people who are watching this debate across the country are getting confused with all of the rhetoric that is going on. It boils down to two things: the Democrats, who promised fiscal responsibility, in this bill are spending $31.5 billion more than the President requested. They are busting the budget already when they promised America fiscal responsibility. So America, remember that. Remember that. They said they are going to balance the budget and they are not going to raise your taxes. They are already trying to raise your taxes. So raising your taxes and spending $31.5 billion more than they said they would on this bill. 
   Finally, the second issue is capitulation. If we do what they want, if we redeploy, as they call it, it is a withdrawal, and the vacuum that is going to be filled in Iraq will be filled by the radicals, the radical terrorists, al Qaeda and their fellow travelers. It is capitulation and budget busting. That is what they are all about today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I was watching television last night, I think it was the O'Reilly Show, I am not sure exactly, but I believe it was the Bill O'Reilly Show on Fox Network, and they had an excerpt of another show from which were taken some remarks by a well-known comedian and political advocate in which he was inferring that the country would be better off if the Vice President of the United States died. I took great umbrage at that. I was very, very upset about that, because Vice President Cheney has been an outstanding servant of this country for a long, long time. 
   I had the pleasure of serving with Vice President Cheney when he served in this body as the Republican whip. He worked very hard in the Ford administration as the chief of staff. I don't know that anybody has ever really been able to question his integrity, because he is a man of integrity, and he has been trying his best to assist the President of the United States in dealing with some very, very troubling issues, not the least of which are the war against terror and the war in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I won't mention the comedian, the political pundit, who made the remarks on television on HBO just recently, but I will just say that I think it is very, very bad taste for anyone to infer, even infer, that the Vice President of the United States, Mr. Cheney, who has done such an outstanding job for this country over a long period of time, should be better off dead. That was the inference that was made. I think it was wrong, and I hope that doesn't happen in the future. 
   I may take issue with political leaders on the other side of the aisle, and I may very much in very severe ways disagree with them, but in no way would I ever indicate that they should be better off under the ground than on top of the ground, even though we have severe differences. And for anyone to infer that the Vice President should die really, really bothers me, especially in this time we are in, these very troubling times. 
   Vice President Cheney is a great man. He has done an outstanding job for this country and he should be respected, even if you disagree with him.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (CONGRATULATING LEE MYUNG-BAK ON ELECTION TO PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 947, sponsored by my friend and colleague from California, Mr. ROYCE, which offers the House of Representatives' congratulations to Lee Myung-Bak on his election to the presidency of the Republic of Korea. 
   Additionally, this resolution recognizes the very special and longstanding relationship between South Korea and the United States; a relationship whose modern day form was first forged in the heat of battle as U.S. and South Korean soldiers fought to defend South Korea from aggression by Communist North Korea. In fact, our history of friendship reaches beyond the past century; and just last year we celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Korean American Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation which was signed in 1882. 
   In my opinion, it is hard to overestimate the importance of the close bond between the United States and South Korea. The United States and Korea have a mutual defense treaty that dates back to 1953, and Korea has supported U.S. military efforts abroad, as recently as in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Korea has been one of only four partners and allies that stood with us through all four major conflicts since World War II. In addition, South Korea demonstrated her great friendship and generosity in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, pledging over $30 million in aid for relief and recovery efforts--the fourth largest amount donated by any foreign country. 
   On June 30, 2007, representatives of both governments signed the historic United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. If and when this agreement is approved by Congress I believe it will increase trade and investment flowing through our agriculture, industrial, consumer products, automobile and financial services sectors. I believe this agreement will enhance the strong partnership between two great democratic nations and will open the door wider to the exchange of science and ideas that will cause us both to continue to prosper. 
   This agreement is a natural extension of the strong affinity between our two countries, marked by extraordinary diplomatic, political, military, and economic cooperation. Although the devil is always in the details, I understand that this agreement could potentially be the most commercially-significant free trade agreement signed by the United States in more than a decade. 
   As many of my colleagues already know, South Korea is already the United States' seventh largest export market and sixth largest market for U.S. agricultural products. In fact, according to the latest statistics, our annual bilateral trade totals nearly $80 billion. Any agreement that can open up more Korean markets to U.S. goods and services can only have a positive effect on the American economy by creating more and better jobs, enriching consumer choice, and boosting U.S. industry and manufacturing. 
   Koreans have invested nearly $20 billion in the United States, and have created American jobs through companies like Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics, and Kia Motors. And as the largest investor in Korea, the United States already has a leading presence in that country. 
   As I have said before and will continue to say, I think it is important to note that trade relationships do more than just facilitate economic growth; this FTA recognizes our special relationship with South Korea that I mentioned before and makes the strong statement that we will continue to stand with our allies. 
   South Korea is the fifth largest tourism-generating country to the United States with over 800,000 Koreans visiting the U.S. every single year. This number is expected to double (at the minimum) when South Korea joins the Visa Waiver Program. According to the Department of Homeland Security, South Korea also has the largest foreign student population in the U.S. Nearly 2 million Americans of Korean descent live in communities all across our Nation, representing all walks of life and making innumerable contributions to the enrichment of our Nation's culture and economy.  
   South Korea is a strong, unwavering ally in the U.S.-led Global War on Terror, having dispatched the third largest contingent of troops to Iraq, and to Afghanistan (where a South Korean soldier was killed during hostile action), and to Lebanon in support of peacekeeping operations; and South Korea is a key partner in the Six-Party Talks to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue. 
   I firmly believe that South Korea may be the premier success story of U.S. foreign policy in the post-World War II period. Having assisted South Korea in transforming itself from a war-torn, impoverished economy into a successful democracy with a free enterprise economy (the world's 11th largest), South Korea is now an indispensable partner with the United States in promoting democracy, a free market economy and respect for the rule of law around the world. 
   I believe that President-Elect Myung-Bak understands and appreciates the important history behind our bilateral relations. His desire to better relations with the United States through an emphasis on free market solutions encourages me that the work we have begun will continue to grow under his leadership. I look forward to a continuation of the United States-South Korean partnership during the President-Elect's term and for many years beyond. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 947 and join me in congratulating President Lee Myung-Bak, and extending to him the very best wishes of the House of Representatives as he assumes office later this month.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I think, Mr. Speaker, DANNY DAVIS did a great job in explaining this piece of legislation; so I won't be redundant in going over the same details he just covered. 
   I will say, last week this bill was scheduled for consideration, but it was pulled because of opposition to a number of contentious provisions added to the legislation such as the explicit authority for GAO to access Medicare part D pricing and rebate information and pharmaceutical trade secret information. Those provisions are not included in the bill today, and so there is no real problem with it. 
   I congratulate DANNY DAVIS on his presentation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 5683, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008. 
   Last July, the Government Accountability Office submitted to Congress a legislative proposal to make a number of largely non-controversial changes to GAO's authorizing statutes. 
   That proposal and the bill we are taking up today, for example, would make statutory GAO's inspector general, and it would authorize GAO to be reimbursed for conducting financial statement audits of Federal agencies. 
   In addition, H.R. 5683 attempts to resolve a longstanding pay dispute between GAO and some of its employees. Hopefully, this bill will allow stakeholders to put the dispute to rest and move forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5683 was originally scheduled for floor consideration last week but was pulled from the schedule because of opposition to a number of contentious provisions added to the legislation such as the explicit authority for GAO to access Medicare Part D pricing and rebate information and pharmaceutical trade secret information. These provisions are not included in the bill we are taking up today. 
   In addition, there were a number of objections to the bill raised by the White House. It is my understanding these objections have been addressed in the version of H.R. 5683 before us today. 
   I appreciate the majority's willingness to remove the contentious provisions so we can move forward with this bill, and I urge my colleagues' support.  
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague just said, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act is very important. 
   H.R. 5778 would amend the D.C. Home Rule Act to clarify that the chief financial officer of the District of Columbia does not have authority over the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, or WASA. WASA is a regional entity, funded by rate payers living in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. Under current Federal law, however, WASA's finances are under the jurisdiction of the D.C. chief financial officer. 
   A memorandum of understanding has been in place between WASA and the District of Columbia CFO for many years stating that the CFO would not exercise its authority over WASA. However, it was recently determined that such a memorandum was not legally enforceable and that Federal law needed to be changed in order to make the previous agreement enforceable.     
   The purpose of H.R. 5778 is to codify in Federal statute the Water and Sewage Authority's financial independence from the District. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALASKA AS THE 49TH STATE -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1860, at the Wigwam Convention Center in Chicago, Illinois, a man named William Seward marched around with his crowd of supporters, and he got to the convention center too late because the gallery was stacked with supporters for a guy named Abraham Lincoln. As a result of his getting there a little bit too late on the third ballot, Abraham Lincoln was nominated for President of the United States, and Mr. Seward lost, and he was the favorite. He was the odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee for President and to be the next President of the United States. Well, he lost, and it was a crushing blow for him. 
   Yet, later on, Abraham Lincoln saw the qualities of William Seward, and he appointed him his Secretary of State, and Secretary of State Seward did an outstanding job in that capacity. The thing he did best, in my opinion, was in making sure that the United States purchased Alaska. He purchased Alaska for $7.2 million, and it was the best buy, by far, of anything that this country has ever done. The resources that are up there are just unbelievable. 
   A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure to go up to Alaska with Representative DON YOUNG, and I had a chance to see the vastness of it and to realize the resources that are available to us up there. You just couldn't believe it. We had a chance to see ANWR. We had a chance to look at the Alaska Pipeline, and we could see what great potential there is out of Alaska if we would just use our heads and go after those resources. 
   One of the things that I don't understand and that, I think, the American people don't understand is why the Democrats and the Republicans in this body can't get together to start using our resources to reduce the cost of fuel, gasoline and energy in this country. As the gentleman from Alaska just said a few minutes ago, they have the resources up there. We could get up to 2 million barrels of oil a day out of the ANWR, and there may be more up there, and we could do it in an environmentally safe way. It's two to three times the size of Texas. If there were a spill up there--and of course I don't think that would happen--it still wouldn't hurt the ecology as much as we are suffering now under the energy pressure that the American people are feeling at $4-plus a gallon of gas. We should drill in Alaska. We should drill in the ANWR. 
   The Alaskan Senators and Congressmen want that done. They want those resources brought to the surface. Yet, the opposition party--my good friends over there like DANNY DAVIS--won't let us drill in the ANWR. I do not understand it. I just simply do not understand it. We are drilling in Texas. We are drilling in Oklahoma. We are drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, way up north in the ANWR we cannot drill. I just do not understand it. 
   I wish my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are influenced so much by the environmental lobby would go out on the street tomorrow morning at the gas stations and say, ``Hey, you're paying $4.10 a gallon for gasoline. Would you mind if we drilled in the ANWR?'' 
   The first thing they'd say is probably, ``Where is the ANWR?'' Secondly, they'd say, ``Drill any place in the United States to get my gas prices down.'' 
   Now, the Democrats took over this place 2 years ago, and I have an awful lot of friends on the other side of the aisle, and I love all you guys, but since you took power, the price of gasoline has gone up $1.50 per gallon. Now, why don't we do something about that. Why don't we get together, the Democrats and Republicans, and say, ``Okay. We are going to drill in the ANWR in an environmentally safe way. We are going to drill offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf in an environmentally safe way. We are going to bring 4 million barrels of oil a day into this country to reduce our dependency on Saudi Arabia and on Venezuela and on Mexico and on other parts of the  world so we can do what we should have done 30 years ago, become energy-independent.'' 
   Not only do we have the oil resources at our fingertips, but we have about a 400- or 500-year supply of natural gas, and we're not exploring that either. I will submit to you that there is probably a lot of natural gas up in Alaska as well. 
   So I would just like to say to my colleagues that I'm here to support Representative Young's resolution to congratulate Alaska on its 50th anniversary of its being a State. It's a great acquisition for the United States. It has a great Congressman and two great Senators. 
   As I close, I would just say to my colleagues: Let's get on with it. The American people are tired of $4.50 and $4.10 a gallon for gasoline. We have it in our country with coal shale, with oil and with natural gas to become energy-independent. Yet, we're blocked every day, every month, every year. I do not understand it. 
   So I'd like to say to my Democrat colleagues, who are good friends of mine, since you took power, gasoline has gone up $1.50 per gallon. Let's end that. Let's become energy-independent. We can look at the other sources of energy while we're doing that. Other sources are very important, too, and new technologies, but right now, we need oil and we need gas. You guys need to help us.  
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution seeks to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Alaska becoming a State. Our Nation's relationship with this beautiful and resource rich land began on March 30th 1867. 
   On that date, Secretary of State, William Seward, entered into a purchase agreement with the Russian Minister to the United States, for $7.2 million dollars. In August of 1868, Secretary Seward said he did not doubt ``that the political society to be constituted here, first as a Territory, and ultimately as a State or many States, will prove a worthy constituency of the Republic.'' 
   These words could not have been more true. Alaska has indeed contributed and more than proved its worth as part of our Nation; first as a territory in 1912 and ultimately as our Nation's 49th state when the official proclamation was signed by President Eisenhower on January 3rd 1959. 
   However, the road to statehood for Alaska was not one without challenges. 
   Originally, a bill for statehood passed the House early in 1950, however the bill died in the Senate. It wasn't until January of 1958, that a statehood bill ultimately passed both chambers and was signed by President Eisenhower. 
   It is well known that Alaska is home to some of our country's most beautiful landmarks and landscapes including Mount McKinley and almost 34,000 miles of shoreline. 
   From the beginning, it was a land rich in many commodities useful at those times--including minerals, timber, fur, and fish. Alaska was home to the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98. Today, oil and natural gas serve as the major exports of Alaska. The fishery is the second leading source of export, and also serves as a significant source of livelihood for Alaskans. 
   Today, another source of income that continues to grow is Alaska's tourist industry. Any number of large cruise liners can be seen off the coast of Alaska. And the Klondike Highway outside Skagway has beautiful descents for avid mountain bikers. Visitors are drawn to the beautiful views, wilderness, and the exciting adventures Alaska has to offer. 
   Of course, we couldn't talk about Alaska without mentioning one of the most unique sporting events in the world--the annual Iditarod race. Each year, individuals with a team of sled dogs cover a grueling 1,161 miles over a week to two week period from Willow to Nome, Alaska. 
   So to conclude, the State of Alaska is one that is rich in nature, resources and most importantly in people and heritage. 
   For this reason, I ask my colleagues to support H. Res. 127 recognizing the State of Alaska's 50th Anniversary.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (REFORM OF MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS FOR THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on S. 1245, legislation to reform mutual aid agreements for the National Capital Region. 
   This legislation was introduced by Senators CARDIN, WARNER, MIKULSKI, and WEBB last July and passed by the Senate in December by unanimous consent. 
   Under current law, the Federal Government is authorized to enter into mutual aid agreements with State and local governments in the National Capital Region in order to allow the various jurisdictions to cooperate in the event of an emergency without risk of liability for the acts or omissions of their employees while rendering aid. 
   Senate bill 1245 would further state that entities such as the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, the Water and Sewer Authority and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority would be authorized to enter into these mutual aid agreements as well. 
   The goal here is to ensure that emergency response personnel in the National Capital Region are able to coordinate as closely as possible in the event of an emergency. Hopefully this legislation helps us to move closer in that direction. 
   And before I yield back my time, since I've covered that subject, I just  want to say to my colleagues on the other side, for whom I have the greatest respect, tomorrow morning, when you get up and you get out of bed and you go to the office here on Capitol Hill, stop by one of the gas stations on the way in and watch some people pumping gas at $4 plus per gallon. And just walk up to them--and you don't need to tell them you're a Congressman or a Senator or anything else, just walk up to them and say, what do you think about the gas prices? And they're going to say, they're horrible; Congress has to do something about it. And then say, would you object if we drilled in the ANWR to get oil to reduce your gasoline prices? Would you object if we drilled off the Continental Shelf to get another couple million barrels of oil a day to reduce your gas prices and your energy costs? Would you object if we drilled in some of the forests that we have, national forests where we could get 400 or 500 years of natural gas out? Would you object to that? Would you object if we considered more nuclear reactors to produce electricity for this country so we can lower the price of energy and, in effect, end up lowering the price of gasoline and other fuel products as well? You know what they're going to say? They're going to say what the national polls have already shown; 80 percent plus are for drilling and getting oil out of our country and our resources out of the ground. That's what the American people want. 
   I want to point out one more thing, because I respect all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. When you first took over the Congress 2 years ago, one of the things that was said by you and Speaker Pelosi was that we were going to do something about the energy crisis and we were going to stem the tide to the growth in the cost of fuel, gasoline, and other energy products. Now it's gone up over 50 percent. It's now $4 plus. And it was $2.50 lower than that just 2 years ago. 
   It's time that we as Republicans and Democrats work together. The American people want that. It's time that we work together to lower the price of gasoline and other energy products. And we can do that by drilling in the ANWR, drilling off the Continental Shelf, drilling in our national forests where we can get natural gas, which is a clean burning fuel. And if we just start doing that, and at the same time look at other energy sources, new sources that are nonpollutants, we would be in great shape. Incidentally, we also have about two trillion barrels of oil in oil shale. 
   Let me just say to my colleagues that I hope that you will take heed to what I've said today. The American people want lower gas prices. We have it within our power to start drilling where we can get gas out of this country, natural gas, oil, and other things. Just tell the American people what you think and ask them what they think. And they're going to say ``Drill in America.'' You can do it in an environmentally safe way. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   As I understand it, when the conference report comes back, we have the right to raise an objection or point of order against the whole bill. But what about individual projects that are put in the bill? Will we be able to raise a point of order against each one of those projects that are put in the bill, that are airdropped into it in the conference committee? 
   One of the reasons we have been debating this so strongly over the last couple of days is because we want to make sure that the Members have a right to vote on these projects. There is a considerable amount of money in the bill which is not designated for any individual project right now. So if it is the whole conference report that we have to raise a point of order against, that is not getting to each individual airdropped earmark that is put in the bill.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, if the gentleman would yield further, I think this is very, very important. There are many of us, for years, that have come down and fought against individual pork-barrel projects, and it was my understanding over the last few days that we were going to try to make sure we knew what was in this bill, and if there were earmarks in there we didn't want, we would have an opportunity to vote on each individual earmark. 
   Now you are going to have a bill that is going to go over to the Senate without any earmarks in it, I would like to know also how much money is in here for earmarks, but it is going to go to the Senate and it is going to come back with airdropped earmarks in it, and we will not be able to vote on each one of those, as we would right now if we were going to debate each individual earmark that is put in the bill. 
   I understand what the minority leader is saying, but this is of concern I think to a lot of us, because if we get the whole enchilada and we can't go to the individual earmarks that are put in the bill because they are airdropped in, we don't really have a chance to cut out any of the pork.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, a number of the speakers tonight have been talking about the bailout on Wall Street. And we've been told by the head of the Treasury and the FDIC that, unless we do this, there could be real dire consequences for the entire economy of the United States. 
   The amount that we've been talking about, which will be brought to the floor, is somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 billion, which is directly going to go to our national debt, in all probability. Hopefully, some of those assets that are going to be bought will be able to be sold down the road and the money repaid to the Treasury. 
   But the thing that bothers me the most is we haven't done anything that will really create new jobs. The speaker that just spoke talked about the creation of new jobs. And we passed an energy bill last week that really isn't going to do anything. And we have the ability to drill off the Continental Shelf and Alaska and elsewhere. And we can get billions and billions of dollars in money coming into the United States Treasury from these assets that we have already, and that is, oil, gas, shale, and other commodities that will help us with our energy crisis. 
   We have an energy crisis right now, and we have not passed an energy bill that will do anything. Boone Pickens has been on television talking about the transfer of wealth, $700 billion a year. It's an odd consequence that we're going to be asking for $700 billion for the ``Wall Street bailout'' and at the same time we're denying the drilling for oil and other energy products here in the United States which could save $700 billion of our money that's going overseas to Saudi Arabia, to Nigeria, down south to Venezuela. And so the United States is actually turning over our money that we could keep here at home and create hundreds and thousands of jobs and really help this economy if we could just go after the energy sources that we already have here in the United States. 
   I just don't understand it. We're sending $700 billion to Saudi Arabia, and they're going to be buying these assets here in the United States. It's going to be our money that's purchasing the oil that gives them the money to buy the products here in the United States. It makes no sense, especially when we have the energy products right here in this country, offshore and up in ANWR, and elsewhere, trillions of square feet of gas, millions of barrels of oil, and we can't drill for them because of the environmental concerns that people are talking about. And we could do it in an environmentally safe way. 
   It makes no sense to me whatsoever to send $700 billion out of this country that we can keep here at home creating jobs. And at the same time that we're sending that $700 billion out of this country to buy oil from other parts of the world, we're asked to give $700 billion to bail out bad investments that have been made, bad loans that have been made. It just doesn't make sense to me. 
   If we're really concerned about the economy of the United States, we need to drill here, we need to drill now. Use alternative sources of energy as well--wind and solar and everything else--but we need to drill here in the United States. The American people are suffering. They're still playing $4 plus for a gallon of gas, $80 to fill up a 20-gallon tank on a car or a truck. The American people can't afford it. And we could be saving that money, reducing the price of oil and gasoline dramatically, if we drilled here and drilled now, keeping $700 billion of our money here instead of sending it overseas, and especially at a time when we're going to be bailing out financial institutions to the tune of $700 billion. 
   It's really odd. We're sending $700 billion of our money overseas--we don't need to--at a time when we could sure use it here at home to deal with our financial crisis. 
   We need to drill here, we need to drill now. We need to lower the price of gasoline and oil and other energy products and we're not doing it. And I simply don't understand it, Mr. Speaker. 
   And I want to say it one more time; the energy bill we passed last week isn't going to doing anything. It's not going to provide one barrel of new oil from the United States. And we're going to continue to send to Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, and elsewhere, $700 billion of America's money, which could be used to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It makes no sense. We should drill here, we should drill now. We should move toward energy independence and immediately start lowering the price of gasoline and other fuel products.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, during the August recess, I think a lot of my colleagues got the message from their constituents that they want an energy bill, they want energy independence, and they want us to start working on that right now. 
   I talked to some of my Democrat colleagues today, and I had an indication from them that we might have an energy bill next week. All I wanted to say to the leadership on the Democrat side is, Give us an energy bill that we can really support. Please don't give us a facade. Don't give us the frosting on the cake without the cake. We want an energy bill that will move us toward energy independence that will allow us to work and get energy from a whole host of sources, as well as the alternative sources that we're talking about in the new technologies. 
   Give us a good energy bill. Don't give us a piece of junk that we can't vote for.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much and I thank the whip for allowing me to go at this time. 
   Let me just say I remember my Democrat colleagues after 9/11. They, along with us, were one voice saying we're going to go after these terrorists, no matter where they are; no matter how long it takes, we're going to get them. 
   The terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the Cole, our barracks. They've attacked us many times. They attacked us once before at the World Trade Center. And al Qaeda has attacked in France, England, Spain, Indonesia, and elsewhere. 
   Now, the leader of the military wing of the terrorists in Iraq is al Qaeda. He's the guy that's going to lead the fight to make Iraq an Islamic State, a jumping-off point for terrorism around the world, al Qaeda, the same ones that attacked the World Trade Center and these other things. 
   I can't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, knowing al Qaeda is in charge over there, the military wing of the terrorists, knowing that they want to destroy us, knowing that Osama bin Laden said he wants to destroy America, that you want to pull out, that you want to tell them exactly when you're going to leave. 
   We're going to start moving in 4 months. We're going to be out of there in 12 months. You want to cut our troops off at the knees, and do you think al Qaeda is not going to be happy about that? What do you think Iran is thinking right now? What do you think Syria is thinking right now? What do you think al Qaeda is thinking right now? They're thinking we don't have the guts to go get 'em, and so they're encouraged. 
   Al Jazeera was mentioned just a minute ago. That paper has got all kinds of articles saying we're going to get out, and you guys are giving them all the information they need to know that they can prevail if they wait us out. If they do, we're going to have more terrorist attacks here in America. They're waiting for us to get out so they can focus all their attention on the United States and our allies. 
   We must not do this, and that's why we should sustain the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, you know, there's an old saying that sometimes people whistle past the graveyard. I think, last night, that's what this Congress did. The majority on the other side rammed through a bill that's not going to do anything to move us toward energy independence, and that means we're going to continue to send $700 billion a year overseas to Saudi Arabia, to Nigeria, to Venezuela, and to other countries, many of whom don't like us at all and who are using our own money against us. $700 billion a year. 
   While we didn't do anything about that, that which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, we have found that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae we have bailed out for God only knows how much money. It's in the hundreds and hundreds of billions. It's probably going to be more than the S&L tragedy we had years ago. Bear Stearns we bailed out. AIG, $85 billion last night. There's $25 billion to $30 billion we're going to give to the auto industry. We're going to be giving money, no doubt, to the aviation industry because it's in trouble because of the energy crisis. The stimulus package we're talking about is going to cost probably about $50 billion in the next week because the Democrat majority is going to send that to the floor, and we don't have the money. We're talking about $800 billion to $900 billion that the taxpayers are going to have to cough up that we do not have. Now, what does that mean for the economy of the United States? 
   It means simply that the dollar and the economy are going the wrong way. Today, get this: Gold went up over $70 an ounce. If you look back over the past several years, gold was running between $250 an ounce. Today, it went up by 25 percent over what the average was for the price of gold. Do you know why? 
   It's because there is no confidence in the dollar right now, and we're not doing a darned thing in this body or in the other body to deal with the problem. Nothing. We had a chance last night to move toward energy independence and to save $700 billion a year that we're sending overseas. That would have made a dent in the problem we're dealing with right now, and it would have provided a mechanism for hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it would have cut the price of gasoline and of heating oil and of everything else that we have to deal with. It would have moved us radically toward energy independence. It would have helped stabilize the economy of the United States. We didn't do a darned thing, and everybody knows it. Everybody knows what we did last night was a sham. 
   It's not going to result in any drilling. It's not going to result in any more oil here in the United States. It's not going to result in anything toward  nuclear or toward alternative sources of energy. It's not going to do a darned thing. Yet we went to the American people last night, my Democrat majority with that bill, and said, ``Hey, we're going to solve your energy problem,'' and it was a big lie, a facade. 
   We had an alternative bill. We had an alternative bill sponsored by Democrats and Republicans--Mr. Abercrombie and Mr. Peterson, Democrats and Republicans--that would have moved us toward energy independence that was really a compromise. It didn't allow drilling in the ANWR, which I preferred, but it did allow other things like coal shale converted to oil and drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf. It would have resulted in revenue sharing with the States that would allow us to drill. 
   The bill that we passed did not do any of that. The bottom line is this economy is in real trouble, and it's not just because of this Congress, but it's in real trouble because of loans that we gave to people who didn't deserve home loans, and it was because of the packaging of those loans and selling them up the line. 
   The fact of the matter is we could have done something last night to help stem the tide by passing an energy bill that would have led us not only to energy independence but to saving about $700 billion a year that we're sending overseas to people who are not our friends. 
   It's a real tragedy. This Congress is sitting on its hands, and it's not doing anything at a time when this country is crying out for some action, not just for energy, not just for lower gas prices but for some kind of a movement toward solving the economic problems that face this country. 
   I'm going to end by telling you this: If gold goes up $70 in one day, that's an indication that the value of the dollar is going down the tubes. In addition to that, everybody's 401(k)s and IRAs are going down with it. 
   This is a very, very difficult time for America, and Congress needs to respond, and we're not doing a darned thing. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are listening. The Democrat majority needs to do something about this, especially about the energy crisis right now and not just sit on your hands and pass bills to help get people reelected, which is what you did last night.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I want to associate myself with the remarks just made by Mr. Royce of California. I think he made the case very well for the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. 
   Colombia has been a great friend of ours under President Uribe, and we ought to be doing more to make sure that that government down there is stable and that the trade with us improves. Right now we have about a $2.56 billion trade deficit, because they have access to our markets but we don't have access to theirs, like we should, because of the tariffs. If we pass a Colombian Free Trade Agreement, it will be a two-way street that will help them, will help us create more jobs in the United States, as well as more jobs in Colombia. 
   But there is more to it than that. Right now, there is a threat from the FARC guerrillas in Colombia, and right on the border is Venezuela. President Chavez of Venezuela has recognized the FARC down there and is kind of working with those people, and I think that is a peril that faces Colombia over the long haul. Having a strong free trade agreement that will create jobs and a stronger economy in Colombia I think will be one of the things that will help stop the terrorists down there, the FARC guerrillas, the ELN and those who may be coming out of Venezuela. 
   So I think this is a very good first step tonight. We are extending the trade preferences for the next 9 or 10 months, and I think that that is all right. But we need to get on with the business of making sure we pass a free trade agreement with Colombia, as we did with Peru. I think it is in our national interests and their national interests. They are a good friend, and we should get the job done.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, you know, we've had probably close to 1,100 votes this session. We've been here since January. In fact, January we had more work scheduled than I've seen in a long, long time because January is usually a light month. But we had all those votes, and here we are with just a few days left in this session and we haven't done a darn thing. 
   In my opinion, the accomplishments of this Congress under the Democrat leadership has been a big zero. The appropriation bills that the President wanted to sign and get through this process have not been given to him, and now you're going to come up with an omnibus spending bill right here at the end with a lot of pork in it that nobody knows what's in it, and you're going to present that to the American people as a job well done. 
   Well, it is not a job well done. That omnibus spending bill, if it has all that pork in it that we've heard of, the President's likely to veto, and then we're going to have to come back with a continuing resolution to get us through the end of the year into the middle of January. 
   So I'd just like to say to my colleagues, whom I respect a great deal, the promises that you made at the beginning of the year when you took charge of this House have not been met. We have not gotten anything done of substance, and we're going to leave here with an omnibus spending bill that may or may not be vetoed, and the American people are going to wonder what in the world's in that bill. 
   So I'd just like to say to my colleagues, I'd like to say a job well done, but I can't. It's been a total zero this year.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, given my tensure in the House of Representatives, I have seen more than my fair share of good and bad legislation come to the House floor. In addressing the nonbinding House Continuing Resolution 63, I would like to take a step back and call this bill what it is, it is a fac 9ade, and a political maneuver. If we are going to spend four days discussing a piece of legislation, if we are going to vote on something, we should vote on funding. Our power in Congress is the power of the purse. If the Democrats have an action item, we should get to the point; let us vote on funding the war in Iraq, and stop making pointless partisan political arguments. 
   However, all of my colleagues are aware that a vote to stop funding for the war will not pass, as the Republicans will not support it and many Democrats would oppose such legislation as well. This is true because we all have American resolve, meaning we will work together as a country to finish what we began. 
   American resolve does not quit when a situation gets messy, we do not tuck our tail between our legs and run away scared. My colleagues and I are also aware that our legislative agenda does not exist in a bubble; that there are many factors at play. If we do not have the intestinal fortitude in Iraq, how will we be viewed by other countries like Iran? 
   It is vital to our prosperity that the United States maintains her impenetrable stance in the international community. If the United States is seen as a Paper Tiger there will be many deep, far reaching implications; one of them being Iran's nuclear missile program, which threatens the safety of the world. 
   In addressing the real threat posed by Iran, Ambassador Gregory Schulte has explained that, 
   ``The pursuit of nuclear weapons by the leadership in Tehran threatens Iran's neighbors and threatens the wider world community. In the Middle East, Iran's influence is rising. The fall of the Taliban and Saddam, increased revenues from the high price of oil, the electoral victory of Hamas, and the perceived success of Hezbollah in attacking Israel all extend Iran's shadow. 
   He also stated that: 
   ``A nuclear-armed Iran could embolden its leaders to advance their ambitions even more aggressively across the Middle East. Even without detonating a single nuclear weapon, the mere possession of an atomic arsenal could encourage Iran's leaders to employ their conventional forces and step up terrorism to advance their regional ambitions. Iran, with Syria, is allowing terrorists and insurgents to use its territory to move in and out of Iraq and is helping to train and arm militants who are killing coalition forces and innocent civilians.'' 
   In today's news, it was reported that Iraq had to shut down its border with Syria and Iran. U.S. officials have long suspected Syria of allowing foreign fighters to cross its long, porous border into Iraq, and this past weekend evidence was presented of Iranian-manufactured weapons being smuggled into Iraq. We will be paving the way for Iran and Syria to be the victors if we do not allow our troops the full force of our assistance in Congress. 
   I would like to be the bearer of a positive aspect of our work in Iraq, highlighting some major accomplishments achieved by our leaders and troops. Here is the positive side of the story that is rarely brought to light or reported on in the mainstream media: 
   Free Elections are transforming Iraq. In 2005, Iraq held two parliamentary elections and a constitutional referendum, with turnout increasing each time cumulating in 76 percent of registered voters participating in the December 2005 elections. 
   Economic recovery is picking up. The International Monetary Fund estimates GDP grew by 2.6 percent in 2005, and is expected to grow by 10.4 percent in 2006, adjusted for inflation. 
   A stable currency, introduced in October 2003, has allowed the Central Bank of Iraq to manage inflation; the IMF estimates inflation was 32 percent in 2004 and remained stable at this level in 2005. 
   Iraq is rejoining the international community. It is on the road to WTO accession, and received both an IMF credit facility and its first World Bank loan in 30 years. 
   Debt relief agreements are helping Iraq with its economic outlook; Iraq has secured an agreement to forgive at least 80 percent of its Saddam-era debt. 
   Foreign and domestic banks are opening new offices. 
   The stock market established in April 2004 currently lists nearly 90 companies. 
   Iraq had virtually no cell phone subscribers in 2003. Today, there are more than 5 million cell phone subscribers, and an estimated 2,000 Internet cafes. 
   Seventy-seven percent of Iraqi businessmen anticipate growth in the national economy over the next 2 years, in a recent nationwide poll, and 69 percent are ``optimistic'' about Iraq's future. 
   In conclusion, we must stand behind our troops, military commanders, and our Commander in Chief. We need to finish the job and secure areas in Baghdad and the Anbar Province. We must secure the situation on the ground so Iraq can establish the rule of law. We must provide this secure environment so social and economic development can take place. 
   Finally, we must protect the population and critical infrastructure. These are fundamental elements of counter insurgency strategy. These fundamental elements simply have not been able to take hold due to the amount of insurgents in the area and their ability to overturn our previous work. 
   I beg of my colleagues to refuse to allow our troops to become a casualty of partisan rhetoric. If we want to win the war, then we have one option. Support them. Support the mission. Support the military intelligence officers focused on this victory. Refuse to quit, refuse to weaken, and allow the counter insurgency this chance to succeed.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say that Julia Carson was a friend of mine. I have known Julia for a long, long time. She worked for our former colleague Andy Jacobs when he was in the House, and she did a tremendous job for him. 
   She started out politically in Indiana as a State representative and became a State senator. And when Andy retired, she ran for and was elected to the Congress of the United States. 
   She was also a trustee. One of the things she did as a trustee was she reduced the cost to the trustee's office and reduced the number of people who had to be served on the welfare rolls. I think that is very honorable that she did that. She worked so hard. As a Republican, I have to take my hat off to Julia for reducing the cost of that township trustee's office. She did a fantastic job. 
   She worked here in the Congress for a long, long time. Her health started failing, as you all know, in the last couple of years, but she continued to try to serve her constituents as best she could. Julia was loved, literally loved by all of the people she served in Indianapolis. She worked so hard and so long, and I know everybody in the Indiana delegation and in Indiana will miss her. And I know her good friend, Andy Jacobs, grieves for her as well as we do tonight. 
   I would just like to say that Julia, we miss you and we wish you Godspeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I am really distressed after listening to all the debate today. I have not seen this House split like this in the 25 years that I have been here, and I am really concerned not only about the future of Iraq and our troops over there, but I am concerned about the future of this country.  
   After 9/11, we were told by the President that this was going to be a long, arduous war against al Qaeda and that we had to go after terrorists around the world, wherever they are. Al Qaeda has attacked the USS Cole, as has been mentioned. It has attacked our embassies in Africa. It has attacked our residences in Saudi Arabia. It has attacked in Britain. It has attacked in France. It has attacked in Spain. They are not going to go away. 
   Al Qaeda, according to General Petraeus today, he mentioned them about five or six times, is one of the major adversaries that we face today. In fact, the new military leader, or war leader, this is the successor to al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006, a member of al Qaeda, is al-Muhajer, an al Qaeda leader who is now the head of the military wing of al Qaeda and the terrorist movement in Iraq. They have stated that they want to create an Islamic state and they are hell-bent to do it. 
   Al Qaeda, they are the ones that attacked the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 Americans. They are the ones that flew the plane into the Pentagon. They are the ones that attacked the plane and it flew into the ground in Pennsylvania, al Qaeda. 
   And they are the ones that apparently, according to the majority, are going to drive us out of Iraq, and if they do, my concern is that that will be a breeding ground and a launching pad for terrorism not only in the Middle East but around the world. I really have a concern about that, and if that happens, I think that what will happen is we will be involved in a much, much bigger war down the road. 
   We may be, if we pull out of Iraq, and I have no doubt that the opposition is going to push like the dickens to get it done, if we pull out of Iraq before the job is done, and I have sympathy for our troops and their families and everybody else, but if we pull out of Iraq before the job is done, I think we may very well be sowing the seeds for World War III. And as I have said on this floor a number of times and have talked to my colleagues, appeasement and weakness leads to horrible things. 
   Lord Chamberlain, going to Munich and talking to Hitler and appeasing him, led to 62 million people dying in World War II. We are now in a nuclear age. We have people who will blow themselves up in order to get their aims. They do not want to live. They want to die. They want to be martyrs. 
   Can you imagine what will happen if Iran develops a nuclear program and they have briefcase nuclear weapons? They will blow themselves up with a nuclear weapon. As I said earlier today, two blocks from here they could ignite one of those bombs, and it would kill all of us. They could do it two or three blocks from the White House, and it will destroy completely an eight-square-block area and radioactive fallout will be all over the place, killing tens of thousands of others. 
   I am really worried, and I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about not only today or yesterday, but the future. If we don't deal with this problem correctly now, if we don't let al Qaeda know that they can't win, then I believe the problems down the road are going to be much more severe, and thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions of people will die as a result of the wrong decision we are making right now.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on 9/11, 2001, two planes flew into the World Trade Center and killed over 3,000 Americans, the worst attack on America in the history of this country, worse than Pearl Harbor. The people who are behind it were al Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden said numerous times he wanted to destroy America. They are the mortal enemy of the United States of America. 
   General Petraeus today, when he talked to the Members of Congress, said numerous times that they were fighting al Qaeda, al Qaeda, al Qaeda in Iraq, the mortal enemy of the United States of America. 
   Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to pull us out of there. And if they do succeed, then I believe that that will become a gathering point for all of the al Qaeda operatives and other fellow travelers in the world, and they will try to attack the United States in numerous ways, probably on our home soil again. They attacked the USS Cole, our embassies in Africa, they attacked housing in Saudi Arabia. 
   I just want to say to my colleagues, remember what you are doing. If you force us out of Iraq now, you are helping al Qaeda. You are helping al Qaeda set up a base of operation, and they will be able to attack the United States of America again.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (OIL DRILLING IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for Ms. Kaptur, who just spoke. She and I have been friends for a long, long time, and I agree with much of what she just said. 
   We really need to move toward energy independence, and we need to use alternative methods of getting our independence. The problem is it's going to take time. If we use solar, if we use wind power, if we use all of these alternative sources, it's going to take time. It isn't going to happen in 1 year, 2, 3, or 4 years where we can not rely on oil or gas any longer. It's going to take time. In the meantime, Americans are paying $4-plus per gallon of gasoline because we don't have the oil necessary to keep the cost of gasoline down. 
   She is absolutely correct. We depend too much on foreign sources of oil. We depend on Saudi Arabia. We depend on Venezuela, which is not a friend of ours. We depend on Canada, on Mexico and on other countries throughout the world. We ought to be drilling right here in America. We have enough energy in this country to become energy independent. 
   Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, well, that's going to take time. It may take 10 years, if we get oil out of the ground today, to get it to market. Well, if that is the case, we still should do it, but experts whom I've talked to who have geological backgrounds say that we can start getting that oil to market within 1 or 2 years, and we could force the price of oil down very quickly if we decide we're going to drill here because it's going to put pressure on those who are producing oil that we're using around the world. It's going to force them to reevaluate the cost that they're charging us for the oil we're getting from them. 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, oh, these oil companies have all of these permits, and they ought to be drilling where they have those permits now. Those permits run 5 to 10 years. If they don't drill in those areas, then those permits expire, and they're bid on by somebody else. 
   So why would an oil company not want to drill if they have a permit? 
   It's because, when they get that permit, they don't know how much oil is down there, and they're certainly not going to invest millions or billions of dollars to drill for oil when they know it's not there. Once they get the permit, they do a geological study, and they do seismic studies to find out if there's oil down there. If there is no oil there, they don't drill, and so they don't utilize their permits. That's why we need to get more land available for drilling. 
   Right now, on the Continental Shelf, we're using 3 percent of the available area. Ninety-seven percent is not being explored. We can do that in an environmentally safe way, and we ought to allow these oil companies to drill in those other areas and get permits to do it. If there's oil there, they're going to drill there. 
   Why don't they drill in some of these other areas where there might be some oil? 
   Well, it costs $2 billion to explore and to build an oil derrick, a platform, out in the Gulf of Mexico or out on the Continental Shelf. If they can't make $2 billion back, they ain't going to drill there. That's why these permits, many times, are not useful, and that's why we need to explore in other areas. 
   Now I'd like to also talk really briefly about the ANWR. They have done geological studies up there, and they know that there are billions of barrels of oil up there. If we drill there, we can get 1 million barrels of oil a day to help lower the price of gasoline in this country. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, if I were talking to Americans tonight instead of to my colleagues--and I can't do that because we can't address Americans--I would say this: You ought to contact your Congressman and Senators and say, ``I want my gas prices reduced, and I want you to drill in America. I want you to move this country toward energy independence.'' We talked about it 30 years ago under the Carter administration, and we never did it. 
   If I were talking to them, Mr. Speaker, I would say that you ought to tell your Congressman to get with the program, to drill in America, to make us energy independent, and to bring down the price of energy, especially that of our gasoline.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Thank you, Mr. Davis, for yielding the time. 
   You know, I get such a kick out of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in particular the chairman of the committee. He was my ranking Democrat for 6 years. And during those 6 years we investigated the illegalities of the Clinton administration that took place, and he blocked and defended the administration, as I would expect him to do because he is a Democrat, every single time. But the thing that interests me is he's talking about corruption in our State Department. We sent out over 1,000 subpoenas, and he and his side tried to stop us at every turn in the road to get to the bottom of corruption during the Clinton years. We had over 100 people in the administration and associated with the administration either take the fifth amendment or flee the country. We have pictures of them up on the wall, people that would not testify, that had memory loss. We said there was an epidemic of memory loss at the White House. People were leaving the country. People were taking the fifth amendment. They wouldn't give us any information. They blocked us time after time after time for 4 years. 
   And so today, here they are on the floor talking about corruption and being blocked by the State Department when they are the authors of this process. They're the ones who did it for 4 straight years to protect Bill Clinton and his administration when there was no question about corruption in that administration. 
   We sent five criminal referrals to the Justice Department during the time I was chairman, and they and their colleagues in the Justice Department, the head of the Justice Department blocked us at every step of the way, every turn in the road. And here they are today complaining about our State Department, during a time of war, trying to deal with the problems over there, and they're alleging a cover-up, blockage and everything else. You know, there is nothing so righteous as a lady of the evening who is reformed. And so I just want to say to my colleagues tonight that this is another example of you coming to this floor complaining about the administration blocking you when you did it for 4 straight years. You did it every day, you did it every night, and now you're complaining because we're trying to do something about the war in Iraq and we're stopping you from getting some information that you think is absolutely essential. Where were you when we were investigating Clinton? Why didn't you want that stuff to come out?

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I will direct this to you, Mr. Speaker. 
   For 4 years, they did exactly what they're accusing this administration of doing, and they did it in spades. When people wouldn't testify, they stuck up for them. When people took the fifth amendment, they stuck up for them.     
   When people from the administration came down here to testify and couldn't remember anything, they helped block the testimony coming before the committee. So today, they are complaining about the very things that they did for four straight years and during a time of war. 
   Mr. Waxman, I just want to say to you one more time I appreciate your reformation. I appreciate your changing. I am happy you are seeing the light. But I don't know why you didn't do it when I was chairman.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I listened to my good friend, CHARLIE RANGEL, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, from New York, a while ago, and he was talking about all these areas where we are going to get additional energy. There were some great ideas there. The problem is many of them are going to take a long, long time before we get the job done. 
   Right now, people in this country are paying close to $4 a gallon for gasoline, and the issue is we have a supply of oil in this country that will take care of most of the problem. We can drill in the ANWR and get a million to 2 million barrels of oil a day. That is three-and-a-half times the size of Texas, Alaska is, and we can't do it because they say it's environmentally dangerous. We can drill off the Continental Shelf and get a million to 2 million barrels of oil a day. They won't let us drill off the Continental Shelf, and yet Cuba is going to drill within 50 miles of the United States and give the oil to China. 
   They are using all these environmentally questionable issues to keep us from drilling for oil in this country to be energy independent. We have been talking about energy independence for 30, 40 years, and we haven't done a darn thing about it. The Speaker said here not long ago, about 2 years ago, they were going to do something about skyrocketing gas prices when it was $2.33 gallon. Now it's approaching $4 a gallon and we can't even drill for oil that's in our country to reduce the cost of gasoline. 
   The American people want solutions. They want Democrats and Republicans to come together and do what is necessary to help them with their energy problems. They want us to work together. We need to have some balance between environmental concerns and the cost that we need to deal with regarding this economy, and that means we need to lower the price of energy, especially gasoline, so people can get to and from work and deal with the problems they face on a daily basis. There's no question about that. Gasoline should not be $4 a gallon, and we can lower it if we drill for oil in our country.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. While we are talking about the long-term problems of energy and dealing with new technologies, and we are all for that, we have to deal with the immediate problem, and the immediate problem is drill for oil in this country, build more refineries so we can get that oil to market and lower the gas prices like the Americans want it be to lowered back down to around $2 a gallon or less. 
   We can do it. But we will never do it unless we work together, Democrats and Republicans. All I hear from the other side of the aisle is, No; we have to worry about the environment. There has to be a balance between environment and economic concerns, and we are not doing it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I won't speak very long. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I really appreciate the information that my Democrat colleagues have been bringing out night after night on alternative sources of energy. I just learned a little bit more about geothermal energy than I did, and I would like to have that right next to my house. 
   But the problem, as I see it right now, is how do we deal with bringing the price of gasoline down, and what do we do in the case of a national emergency? 
   The former chairman of the Energy Committee, Mr. Barton, was talking about what would happen if there was an emergency and how we would utilize this Strategic Oil Reserve. My concern is what would happen if a major supplier of the United States and the rest of the world could not supply that oil? Right now, and I spoke about this the other night, there is a lot of unrest in the Middle East. There is concern about Iran developing a nuclear weapon. And they have been working on a program for some time. Israel just flew a mission the other day about 2 weeks ago where they had over 100 planes fly the length down the Mediterranean that it would be to fly from Israel to Tehran. And so there is the possibility that none of us want to see occur where there could be a major confrontation over there. 
   If you sink two or three ships in the Persian Gulf in the Straits of Hormuz, you're going to have a terrible problem in getting maybe 20 percent of the world's oil supply to market. And we get a lot of our oil from there. 
   And so I think we ought to look at the long-term problems that we face in this country while we're converting to other forms of energy, which I agree with you we should be doing. But oil is going to be with us for a while. And we're going to need that energy, as you said, for aircraft, transportation, for trucks and other things as we make this transition. And during that period of time, we need to be thinking about what we are going to do to protect this country strategically in the event of a conflict during this transition period. 
   And that is why I think that this bipartisan group that started meeting tonight is talking about trying to get everybody together to come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the energy problem and the gas prices, that we look at that. We look at the problems that occur not only today but what might occur a month from now, 2 months from now, 1 year from now, or 3 or 4 years from now.     
   And during this period of transition when we want to move to cleaner-burning fuels, we need to have the energy here in America. I appreciate everything that you are bringing up, but I also am concerned about the security of this Nation. And right now we are so dependent on foreign oil, if we have a problem in certain parts of the world, we will have an even higher price for a gallon of gasoline. That is why I believe we should expand our drilling opportunities out on the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR. 
   I appreciate this discussion tonight. I think we should be doing this on a regular basis.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (NIGERIAN SWEET CRUDE OIL -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I think everybody in America knows that we import an exorbitant amount of the oil that we use in this country. We are dependent on oil from the Middle East. We are dependent on oil from South America, from Venezuela and elsewhere. And as a result, we are at the mercy of these countries if they decide to cut back on the amount of oil that they are selling to this country or if OPEC decides to raise the price per barrel of oil. 
   As a result of our dependency on foreign oil, we now see gasoline at the pump of between $4 and $5 per gallon. And everybody in this country, in fact, almost everybody, about 70 percent of people in recent polls, have said they want America to move towards energy independence. They want us to drill here in the United States. They want us to drill offshore on the continental shelf. They want us to drill in ANWR up in Alaska. They want us to use coal share converted into oil for energy. And they want us to drill for natural gas. But unfortunately, we are not going to do it because we can't get the votes in the House or the Senate to get this job done. 
   Now today we had a meeting. And we found out that in addition to our dependency on foreign oil from sources like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela or elsewhere in the world, we find out that from Nigeria we import almost 37 percent of our sweet crude oil, which is the preferable kind of oil you want for many of the refineries on the east coast because they can convert that in an easier way into gasoline to be sold at the pump. Now if they have to rely on heavier crude oil, as I understand it, they won't be able to convert that because they are not geared up for that. They are used to using, and the refineries are geared to using the sweet crude oil. 
   So as a result, we see 37 percent of the sweet crude oil coming from Nigeria and almost 1 million barrels of oil a day coming from that country. And they have problems over there right now we found out today, Mr. Speaker. They have rebel groups that are stealing as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day and selling it on the world market to put into their own pockets. And if they decide to go further into the pockets of Nigeria, they can dig into the 1 million barrels of oil that we receive from Nigeria a day. And that is about 9 percent of the oil that we get from around the world. 
   The reason I'm bringing all this up is that we are dependent on Saudi Arabia. We are dependent on Venezuela. We are dependent on Canada. And we are dependent on Mexico. And now I find that we are dependent on Nigeria for about 9 percent of the oil we have, which is about 37 percent of the sweet crude oil we get, which is the preferable kind of oil that we need for refining on the east coast of this country. 
   We are dependent on the rest of the world. And the price of gasoline at the pump is between $4 and $4.50 a gallon. And if there is a disruption because of OPEC or what goes on in Nigeria, we could see the cost of gasoline per gallon go to $5, $6 or $7 a gallon. And the American people and our economy cannot stand that kind of a price for gasoline. People are spending $70, $80 or $90 for one tank of gasoline. And seniors and people that live in rural areas and business people trying to get to and from work cannot afford that. We can't afford the cost of getting food to the marketplace and for us to buy it without raising the price of these products. Everything is going up because of the price of oil. 
   And we find that we can be energy independent in this country. We can move rapidly toward energy independence if we drill off the continental shelf and Alaska, and drill for natural gas and convert coal shale into oil. We can be energy independent, and we don't have to depend on the rest of the world. 
   And the American people, Mr. Speaker, need to contact their Congressmen and their Senators and tell them that we need to move toward energy independence. We need to drill here in America. We can get the job done. We're a can-do country. And we need to get with it right away.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, just a little while ago, we voted to suspend the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and for other purposes, a bill, H.R. 6022, which is going to take about 70,000 barrels of oil a day that would be going into the petroleum reserve and put it into the market for Americans to use in gasoline and other products. 
   It sounded very good and I voted for it because it is one small step, if you can call it a small step, in the right direction, but it's really not going to solve the problem. 
   The problem we have is that the United States is not energy independent. We have been talking about energy independence for the last 35 to 40 years, and we haven't done anything about it. 
   This House, and primarily the Democrat party, is being held hostage by the environmental lobby that won't allow us to drill in places like the ANWR in Alaska. Alaska is three-and-a-half times the size of Texas. It's huge. I've been up to Alaska. Drilling up there in the ANWR isn't going to hurt anybody or anything. And I cannot understand why we can't get 1 million to 2 million barrels of oil a day out of there that would help the American people see the price of their gasoline and other fuel products reduced dramatically. 
   We can't drill off the continental shelf, even 100 miles out, because of the environmental lobby, and yet Fidel Castro, and his brother Raul Castro, 90 miles off of the Florida shore, can drill within 45 miles or 50 miles of the United States of America and actually drill into oil reserves that we have down in that area. In other words, taking our oil reserves and pumping them out of that area and into their coffers, and they're selling that under contract to China, our oil reserves that we could drill for down in the area between us and Cuba. 
   We also have such dependency on the Middle East it isn't even funny. We have dependency on Venezuela. One of our chief adversaries now is the President of Venezuela, and he controls in large part the price of oil and gasoline in this country, as do the people in the Middle East that have great oil reserves and are pumping it. 
   And it's extremely important, in my opinion, that we do something about becoming energy independent. We talk about it all the time. We talk about moving toward other forms of energy and I'm for that, but it's going to take time for that transition to take place. And in the meantime, the environmental lobby is blocking us from drilling in the ANWR, drilling offshore on the continental shelf, and allowing our enemies to make a huge profit at our expense. 
   The gasoline prices that the American people are paying today is a direct result of us caving in this country to the environmental lobby year after year after year. We could move dramatically toward energy independence if we could just pass an energy bill that would allow us to use our resources. 
   And we come to this floor and talk about it all the time, and the American people are getting a steady diet that President Bush is responsible for the high gas prices. That's absolutely absurd. The reason the gas prices are as high as they are today is because we can't drill the oil out of our country and get our reserves to the market so that the gas prices can be reduced. 
   We can't do it because the Democratic party primarily is caving in after year after year to the environmental lobby, and we can extract oil out of the ANWR and off the continental shelf in an environmentally safe way. So, if the people of this country are really concerned about gas prices, they ought to find where the fault really lies, and that is with this Congress and the liberals who are controlled by the environmental lobby and will not allow us to drill to get the oil reserves that we have in our country and off the continental shelf. 
   It's a tragic shame, and I just wish the American people could get the information and the drive-by media, as Mr. Limbaugh calls it, would report the facts as they are. We have the ability to move toward energy independence, and we don't do it year after year after year, and we continue to be dependent on foreign oil. That's one of the main reasons why the price of gasoline is approaching $4 a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives voted on H. Con. Res. 322, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modem State of Israel and reaffirming the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the people of the United States and the people of Israel. I am proud to be a cosponsor and strong supporter of this legislation because it pays appropriate honor and respect to our truest partner and defender of freedom and democracy in the Middle East, Israel. 
   Since its establishment 60 years ago, the people of Israel have turned a desert into a new nation, forged a new and dynamic society, and created a unique and vital economic, political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy costs of seven wars, unrelenting terrorism, frequent international ostracism, and economic boycotts. Through it all, the people of Israel and the people of the United States have shared a special bond. Forged originally in Israel's fight for survival, for freedom and for democracy in a region dominated by authoritarian and military regimes; today that relationship encompasses broad, social, cultural and economic ties as well. 
   For 60 years, the United States and Israel have maintained a special relationship based on mutually shared democratic values, common strategic interests, and moral bonds of friendship and mutual respect; most importantly, the people of the United States have a special affinity for the people of Israel, and regard Israel as a strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner. To our ally, our partner, and our friend, I offer my prayers for peace and my congratulations on your 60th birthday.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to thank SUE MYRICK who has worked on this for such a long time, along with the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for sponsoring this bill. It really is so important for people to be screened early. 
   I do not think there is a family in the United States that has not been touched by some form of cancer; and if you catch it early, the life expectancy can be extended a great deal of time, and in many cases, it can be cured. 
   We had a personal experience in my family. In fact, I lost my first wife to cancer, and I think in part it was because there was not early detection of that cancer. So one of the things that I think is most important is that women and men get screened for various forms of cancer. There is prostate cancer in men. There is cervical cancer for women. There is ovarian cancer. There is breast cancer. There needs to be early screening. 
   That is one of the reasons why DARRELL ISSA and I cosponsored Jo-Anna's Law to make doctors and patients aware of the signs of cervical cancer very, very early so that women can be saved from terminally being ill. It is so important that they learn about these things before they get out of hand. 
   I cannot express enough and I think SUE will tell you this, I cannot express enough the pain that a family goes through when they find out that one of their loved ones is terminally ill and it could have been prevented if you had found out about it early enough. That is why I think this is such a great program. 
   I am glad this reauthorization is taking place, and I thank SUE once again for working so hard on this. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for working so hard on this. I thank you for yielding the time, and I would just urge anybody who is paying attention to this discussion tonight, and a lot of people are not, get detection early. Get screened early. It will save your life. It will save your family a lot of heartache if you learn about these things before it is too late. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (COLTS SUPER BOWL XLI VICTORY -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my colleagues who have just spoken here on the floor, but today I am here on some happy news, so I will confine my remarks to what I consider to be a real celebratory event. 
   Sunday, the day before yesterday, I sat in the rain with 75,000 other Americans cheering the Indianapolis Colts to victory in the Super Bowl, and I want to tell you that it was one of the greatest football games that I have ever seen. 
   We were very much in favor of the Colts, as you might imagine, and when the kickoff came to the Bears, and Devin Hester ran 92 years for a touchdown, everybody's heart went down to their feet because we thought it was going to be a real letdown for us. 
   But Peyton Manning and the Colts came roaring back and won a very convincing victory in the Super Bowl. And after that they had a parade in downtown Indianapolis for the Colts in 8-degree weather. Can you imagine people going out in 8-degree weather to be in a parade? I can't. But the streets were filled by Hoosiers who were celebrating the victory and giving tremendous accolades to the Colts and the coach and Manning and everybody else that made this victory possible. 
   I would like to just make a couple of comments on what happened. The Colts gained 430 yards in that game against the third strongest defense in the National Football League. Peyton Manning completed 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and was named the Most Valuable Player. Running back Dominic Rhodes ran for 113 yards against that Bears defense, in driving rain, I might add. Running back Joseph Addai received 10 passes for 66 yards and ran the ball for 77 more yards in that driving rain. 
   And the Colts did a tremendous job on defense. Kelvin Hayden intercepted one of the Chicago quarterback's passes and ran it back 56 yards for a Colts touchdown, and the Colts scored in every single quarter in all four playoff games for the first time in playoff history. 
   So I would just like to congratulate Tony Dungy, the coach of the Colts, one of the most popular people in football and especially in Indianapolis; and we think he is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. He is only the third person in football history to win a Super Bowl both as a coach and a player. 
   I want to congratulate my friend Bill Polian, the president of the Indianapolis Colts, who put this team together over the past several years and did an outstanding job. Bill, we are very proud of you. 
   And I want to congratulate the CEO and owner of the Colts, Jim Irsay, who took control of the team in 1997 and dedicated himself to making us a Super Bowl champion. 
   It was a great day for Indianapolis. We are very, very proud of the Colts. On behalf of all Hoosiers, we want to say to the Indianapolis Colts, you are the world champions, and we are very proud of each and every one of you. 
   One more thing I want to mention. The Colts defense was maligned throughout the season. Later in the season, they said the Colts defense was one of the worst in football. In the playoff games, they took on everybody and held them to very, very low yardage. So congratulations to the Colts defense as well as our offense. You did a great job.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, everybody in America, at least the vast majority of Americans, are very concerned about illegal immigration. And they want it stopped. 
   Back in the early 1980s, we passed a bill called the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. It was in about 1986, and it was supposed to stop illegal immigration. And what it ended up being was a magnet for more illegal immigration. It just simply didn't work. So today, instead of 2 or 3 million illegals in this country, we have got maybe 14, 15, 16 million. And we really need to deal with the problem. 
   One of the problems we have is that we are not enforcing our laws. Here in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, a person can acquire an illegal driver's license, a fake, a fake Social Security card, a fake green card, and all they have to do is talk to somebody on the street. 
   My chief of staff lives over near a place here in Washington, D.C. called Adams Morgan. It's a very popular place, especially for young people. And the ABC News affiliate here in Washington, D.C., recently went down there with a camera and did an interview and watched what was going on as far as giving phony IDs to illegal aliens. And I want to read to you what happened. Here's what they said: 
   ``On any given day, you see them walking up and down Columbia Road in Adams Morgan. As soon as you make eye contact with them, they try to offer you freedom as best they can. 
   ``Seller: `Green card or security card?' 
   ``Buyer: `Yes. What will that cost me?' 
   ``Seller: `The green card and Social Security card will cost you $140. The driver's license alone will cost you $120.' '' 
   Now, they are selling fake IDs. And the people that attacked us on 9/11 had phony driver's licenses and had regular driver's licenses and they used them as ID to get on planes. And here in Washington, D.C., we have these people making phony ID cards, driver's licenses, green cards, Social Security cards, and they're selling them in broad daylight and we are not doing  anything about it. And these people may very well be terrorists and a threat to the United States of America. I'll go on: 
   ``After jotting down a fake name, using our subject's photo ..... the card sharks put it all together in a private office. Two hundred dollars and a couple of hours later, our subject picks up his documents ..... documents so real looking it's almost impossible to detect anything suspicious ..... identical seals, a new Social Security number, and even affirmation that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given its okay. It's easy to get a good fake ID that can legitimately fool employers. And the Federal employment verification ``Basic Pilot'' cannot detect fraud, which means employers must fend for themselves when determining if a prospective employee is authorized to work in the U.S. What's the point of a system if it doesn't work?'' 
   And that's my question tonight. What are we going to do? We have a system that invites illegal aliens to come into this country. They get education, they get health care, and we have even had legislation passed that would give them an apartment or a home to live in. It's just amazing. 
   And now we are not enforcing the laws that would stop these people from selling fake IDs, which could give a terrorist the ability to move about in a very easy way here in the United States of America. 
   This is tragic. Our FBI, our Homeland Security, the State police and the local police in this country need to enforce the laws against creating these fake IDs. It is absolutely essential to keep this country protected and to stop the flow of illegal aliens coming into this country. What's to stop them? Nothing. Right now they get fake ID and they can go anywhere they want, and the American people are sick and tired of it. You talk to any congressman and go to any congressman's district and they will tell you that the American people want this illegal immigration stopped. And we are not even enforcing the law and stopping the manufacture of fake IDs. We have to do something about it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (IN GOD WE TRUST -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues can understand me. I've got a little bit of laryngitis. 
   Mr. Speaker, directly across from me, at the top of the Chamber is a depiction of Moses, and behind me, above the Speaker's rostrum is words, ``In God We Trust.'' 
   There are a lot of people in this country who have tried to get all symbols of religion, belief in God taken off of all public properties and coins and currency. Recently, there were thousands of coins minted without ``In God We Trust'' on them, and now they're talking about putting ``In God We Trust'' in an obscure place on coins so that people can't read it, right on the edge of the coin. I think this is--we're moving in a very, very wrong direction. 
   This country was formed with a firm reliance on God Almighty, and when we start taking God out of everything, as some people want to do, we run the risk of having him turn his back on us. This Nation was formed and was founded with people praying every day in the Second Continental Congress when we had the Declaration of Independence and in Constitution Hall because they couldn't come to an agreement, and by prayer and supplication they were able to reach agreement; thus, we have the Declaration of Independence, and we had our Constitution that has made this country so wonderfully powerful and respected around the world for the past 250 years. 
   Those who try to take God off of all things governmental, such as coinage or currency or in this Chamber, are making a terrible mistake, in my opinion. And I'm going to be introducing legislation that will demand or mandate that ``In God We Trust'' be maintained and retained on our currency and on our coinage in a prominent place. 
   Once you start turning your back on the good Lord, I think you are going to reap the whirlwind, and this is something this Nation cannot afford to do right now.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Poe talked about this just a few minutes ago, and I'd like to carry on his thinking regarding the Architect of the Capitol or the Acting Architect of the Capitol. 
   There was a 17-year-old boy who was about to become an Eagle Scout. His name was Andrew Larochelle, and he wanted to give a flag that's flown over the Capitol to his grandfather, who was one of his heroes, and he asked that his Congressman be able to put this language into the certificate that goes along with the flag. And he said, ``This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, country and family.'' 
   The Acting Architect of the Capitol, if you can believe this, Stephen Ayers, took ``God'' out of that and sent the certificate back. And he said there can't be a reference to God in any kind of certification like that that comes out of the Capitol. 
   I'd just like to say to my colleagues, right here we have ``In God We Trust'' over the Speaker's rostrum. We have ``In God We Trust'' on our currency. We have ``In God We Trust'' on our coinage. We have ``In God We Trust'' in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. 
   And I can't imagine anybody wanting to take God out of a certificate for a Boy Scout or an Explorer Scout or anybody else in scouting because they wanted to honor their grandfather. 
   I'd like to just tell my colleagues that a few of our Founding Fathers had something to say about having God in our activities and in our government. Patrick Henry said, ``It is when people forget God that tyrants forge their chains.'' Thomas Jefferson said, ``God who gave us life gave us liberty.'' 
   And John Adams, I want to read you this because it's a little longer but it's very important. He says, ``It is the duty of all men in society, publicly, and at stated seasons to worship the Supreme Being, the Creator and Preserver of the universe. And so no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.'' 
   The Acting Architect of the Capitol should be removed from office posthaste for doing this, and anybody who  tries to infringe upon the rights of American citizens to express themselves regarding God and country should be taken to task. 
   This country was founded upon the principles of believing in God and a supreme being, and we're now trying to take that apart one step at a time. 
   The Architect of the Capitol, who represents the Congress of the United States and this Capitol, has no right to tell a Scout that he can't honor his grandfather by giving him a flag and a certificate that says, ``This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, country and family.'' 
   And so the President, as I understand it, appoints the Architect of the Capitol. Mr. President, if he happens to be listening, I hope he will remove this man and replace him with somebody who really loves God, country, and his fellow man.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I just want to start off by thanking my good friend Charlie Rangel, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for bringing this legislation to the floor. We have talked to a number of the countries involved in the preferences, and they were very concerned. 
   So, Charlie, I want to thank you for bringing this to the floor at this time. I wish it was for a longer period, but 8 months, as has been said by Mr. Weller, is a good start. 
   The one issue that I would like to mention, and it has not been addressed, and that is creating jobs in Central and South America helps us with our immigration problem. We are going to be talking about illegal immigration here in a couple of weeks or a couple of days maybe. I don't know when the Senate is going to send it over. But the fact of the matter is where there is poverty, where there are no jobs, where there is conflict, people leave and the people in Central and South America, obviously, would come north to the United States. We have a very serious immigration problem right now. In 1986 we tried to solve it. It didn't work. We gave amnesty then. It won't work now. But one thing that will help and will work to a degree are trade preferences and free trade agreements, Charlie, and I hope that you, as chairman of the Ways and Means, will look with some favor on some of the free trade agreements when they come up later on. I think it helps not only their economy and our economy, but it also helps with the illegal immigration problem in the long run.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This appears to be a pretty good bill, but we're not going to help small business until we get an energy package that's going to lower the price of energy, gasoline, and other forms of energy in this country. We're sending $700 billion a year overseas that could be kept here in America by drilling here in America and getting energy out of the ground here in America creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen until we get a good energy bill. 
   We're asked today to deal with a $700 billion piece of legislation that will help keep this country's economy afloat. And I submit to my colleagues tonight or today that even if we passed that and we solved this problem temporarily, we're going to be right back here if we don't deal with the energy crisis. 
   This energy crisis is taking money out of everybody's pockets: small business, big business, homeowners. If a person has to pay exorbitant prices to fill their gas tank to get their kids to and from school and to and from work, it's going to hurt them. It's going to hurt them when they have to buy groceries that are transported across this country by diesel fuel and trucks. And because of that, people's cost of living is going up and up and up. And if you don't think that's going to have an impact on their ability to pay their home mortgages, you're just not thinking straight. 
   We have to deal with the energy crisis so people can spend less on energy, can have that money for food for their kids, and to get to and from school and to and from work and to pay for their home mortgages.  
   I think we have to deal with the crisis that faces us right now. But I think all of us ought to be aware that until we solve the energy crisis, until we become energy independent or move rapidly in that direction, we're going to continue to have problems in the future with this economy. This economy cannot stand $4 a gallon gasoline. We just can't. And it is going to impact every area of this economy now and in the future. 
   Even if we pass this so-called bailout bill today or next week or tomorrow, whenever we pass it, it's not going to solve the problem until we deal with the energy crisis which is an integral part of the problems facing America.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I see my other colleague who's here. I hope I am not jumping in front of you. If I am, I will pledge to you I am going to talk a very short period of time so you can get to the mike and express your views. 
   My brother, Congressman Latta, is a State representative in Indiana, Woody Burton, and he called me the other day and he gave me some startling facts. I think the American people would be interested in hearing these things he told me because I'm sure it's happening all over the country. 
   He said that sales tax in Indiana is down by 28 percent, which means simply that people are buying so much less because they are spending their money on 
   gasoline and getting to and from work and on buying products that they have to have to survive. Food. Milk in Indiana had gone from about $2 a gallon, up over $3, and they are making packages of food that are close to the same price but they contain less of the commodity. And so sales tax is down in Indiana by 28 percent. 
   But just to let you know how much the people are spending on gasoline, gas sales tax is up 24 percent. So you see a direct correlation between the amount of money people are spending on products that help the economy and the amount of money that they are spending on gasoline to get to and from work and do what they have to do. 
   My colleague from Georgia just made a very eloquent statement on why we need to deal with this energy crisis now. I won't belabor the point by going into it again, except to say that about 75 or 80 percent of the American people, depending on which poll you look at, say: Drill here, drill now, just like T. Boone Pickens says. They don't want to see $700 billion going overseas when we can keep that money at home and create hundreds of thousands of jobs which, again, would be a big help to the economy. 
   I just want to say we really need an energy bill, we need it right away, and  if the American people are paying attention, I hope that they will, Mr. Latta, take this opportunity to contact their Congressman and Senators because when the pressure is put on them, then they do respond. 
   I talked to one of my Democratic colleagues today. He is a cosponsor of a bill that I am sponsoring with him and about 20 other Members of the House, both Democrats and Republicans, which is a bipartisan energy bill. And he said their caucus today was entirely about the energy issue, and he told me he was confident that we would have an opportunity to debate and vote on an energy bill in the next 2 or 3 weeks, which is the end of the session. 
   I hope he is correct, and I hope if we do have an energy bill, it's a real energy bill and not some kind of a facade. If we get a facade here, I hope we at least have some amendments that we can vote on, which would make it a real energy bill, and that means we'd have to have an open rule. 
   So let me just say to Mr. Latta one more time, thank you for doing this. I know it takes away from things you would like to be doing elsewhere, but you come down here on the floor of the House, along with a few of our colleagues, to talk about how important this issue is. And I applaud you for that.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (THE PRICE OF GASOLINE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, if you went out to a gas station this morning or tomorrow morning and you asked anybody pumping gasoline what the number one issue is, they would tell you without a doubt it is the price of gasoline because it is having an impact on their food and on every other commodity that they deal with. 
   The American people want gasoline prices and energy prices to come down. And the thing that really amazes me about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, is they won't listen to the American people. Eighty percent of the American people, according to recent polls say that if we have the resources here in America, we should drill for them right here. Obviously, everybody is concerned about the environment, but we can drill for oil in the ANWR and off the continental shelf and use coal shale to create a tremendous amount of gasoline and energy in this country without even relying on the foreign sources. The problem is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not listen to the American people. 
   Now I was watching Sean Hannity on Hannity and Colmes the other night, and Mr. Hannity said he couldn't figure out why the Republicans weren't talking about this and making this a big issue.     
   And if he were here tonight, I would say, ``Sean, we are doing it. We are screaming from the top of this Capitol that we ought to drill in the ANWR, we ought to drill off the Continental Shelf. We have a 500 year supply of natural gas. But the Democrats on the other side will not listen to the American people, and the price of gasoline goes up and up and up and the price of energy goes up and up and up.'' 
   I understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to go to new forms of energy that are environmentally safe, and I think everybody in this body wants that. 
   But while we are transitioning to the new technologies, we still have to live. We still have to have heating oil. We still have to have gasoline. We still have to have energy. And the way we can get it and not depend on foreign resources is by drilling in the ANWR, drilling off the Continental Shelf, using coal shale and using natural gas. But the environmentalist lobby, and my colleagues will never admit to this on the other side of the aisle, but the environmentalist lobby has them by throat, and as a result they will not yield to the America people's will that we drill here in this country to reduce the price of energy. 
   Now, I believe this will be an issue in the fall campaign. I know everybody is talking about OBAMA and MCCAIN and the presidential race. But the people who are in this country are really concerned about getting to and from work and paying their bills. I would just like to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, go to any gas station tonight, go to any gas station tomorrow, and ask anybody pumping gas this question: Do you think we ought to drill for our own oil? Do you think we should depend less on foreign resources like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela? And 80 percent of them will look you right in the eye and say, you bet. I want the price of gasoline to go down. 
   My Democrat colleagues, I want you to listen to them, because they are going to get more and more angry with you because you will not listen. We could bring the price of gasoline down immediately if we say we are going to drill in ANWR, drill off the Continental Shelf, because our competitors around the world are going to say, ``oh, my gosh, there is going to be competition,'' and you will see the price of gasoline and oil per barrel go down. 
   So, tonight, once again I will just say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, please, please listen to the American people. They want to drill in the ANWR. They want an environmentally safe way to drill in the ANWR, and we have it. They want to drill off the Continental Shelf. They want us to drill for our own oil and our own natural resources, and they don't  want to depend on Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico or anyplace else. And we should listen to them. We should listen to them. 
   So if Sean Hannity were here tonight, I would say, ``Sean, we are listening to you. We have heard you. We are screaming from the top this Capitol, but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle aren't listening right now.'' 
   But if we keep this up and the American people listen, and I think they will, they are going to hold my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, they are going to hold them responsible for the cost of energy. 
   So I would just like to say to you, the election is coming up and everything looks pretty good for your side of the aisle, but you better do something about energy, because the American people want something done and they want it done quickly.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (VETERANS CARE -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, occasionally things happen when you're in Congress that make you so angry that you can't hardly stand it. 
   I got a call this past week, Mr. Speaker, from a friend of mine from my childhood. And her brother is a veteran who was in the veterans hospital, and he was assigned to a community residential care program. That's where they put one of these veterans into a home in a neighborhood with other veterans, and they're supposed to be cared for. 
   She told me that the place where he was being kept was not clean and that the room he was in had a window that was sealed shut. He took oxygen, and there were no signs or anything that dealt with the oxygen that he was taking. A dog in the house came into his room and chewed through his oxygen tube. He had to keep his door shut, so it virtually made him a prisoner in this house. 
   There were four veterans in this house. And the attitude of the person who ran this home was not anything that you would call conducive to good care. The two sisters of his were very, very upset and they thought that he shouldn't be kept in this place, and they asked me if I would check into it. So I called the caseworker, a lady named Pat Erp, and she told me that everything out there was fine. I said I wanted to see for myself. So I went out to the house. By the time I had arrived, they had contacted the woman who owned the house, and she was very hostile and said she wouldn't allow me, even though I was a Member of Congress, to take a look at the circumstances under which Mr. English was living, that's my buddy from childhood, Paul English. I didn't want to press the case, so I called the director of the Roudebush Hospital in Indianapolis. He wasn't in, but I did get his assistant director, who was very nice, and he agreed to have somebody come out there and take a look at the situation. 
   He came out with two ladies who were nurses there. And my childhood friend's sister went into the house with him to try to get his clothes and everything out of there so they could take him to her house until they found another place for him to be kept. 
   They were hostile, the two nurses from the Roudebush Hospital were hostile. They evidently changed the cord on his oxygen equipment, and they said that nothing like that happened, and yet his sister saw that it happened and they were very upset. 
   The room in the house was not clean. He had two towels in his room, both of which had holes in them, obviously older. And on the weekends, the caseworker said that the woman who took care of these veterans who were in her care would leave for the weekend and left a pot of food on the stove. 
   This isn't the way that our veterans ought to be taken care of when they're in a community residential care program, so I decided to pursue it further.  And I got a call today and I returned the call of a lady named Phyllis Beamon, who is the head of the Extended Care Unit at the Indianapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Roudebush Hospital today. And she indicated that everything was fine and that they've used this house and this caregiver since 1983. And I could only imagine what other veterans had to live with who lived in this house since 1983 and were given this kind of ``care.'' 
   I can't tell you how this affected me. I served on the Veterans Affairs Committee for 10 years. And I had heard stories like this before, but I always felt that the veterans were getting the quality of care that we were paying for as taxpayers, and they were being taken care of. And yet my friend from my childhood was being mistreated, in my opinion. 
   His sister finally got him out of there and took him to her house. And the day after she took him to her house, because of the stress he was under, he had a heart attack. He went to the hospital and they put two stints in him and he did survive. 
   Don't misunderstand, Mr. Speaker, I think the people that serve in our veterans hospitals for the most part do an outstanding job. The nurses and the doctors who serve our veterans do a good job, but there are occasions when the care is not just less than adequate, it's almost criminally inadequate.     
   And this is one of the cases that really bothers me. And I'm going to call for a complete investigation of the Community Residential Care program and the people who provide it at the Indianapolis Roudebush Hospital, not because I don't think that most of the people who work at the hospital do a good job, because I think they do, but I think there's a dereliction of responsibility in this Community Residential Care program that needs to be corrected and it needs to be corrected very, very quickly. 
   We shouldn't have a veteran in a room in a house with the windows sealed so he can't get out in the event of an emergency. We shouldn't have him taking oxygen with a dog that's going to come in the room and chew on his oxygen tube. We shouldn't have people that are leaving the premises unattended with four veterans in there on a weekend and telling their relatives, well, you ought to take him someplace else because there won't be anybody here, and if they are here, they leave the food on the stove so they can get their own food. And these people, many of them, are mentally challenged, like my friend is. He's had some psychological problems. 
   Let me just say in closing, Mr. Speaker, this is something that needs to be addressed. There needs to be an investigation of the Community Residential Care program in Indianapolis, and if it's like this in other parts of the country, we need to have a national investigation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (ENERGY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that happens when you come to the well and you debate somebody, a lot of facts get distorted and they're really not very accurate. So tonight I would like to quote some accurate figures for my colleagues in their offices. And if I were talking to the people of America--I know I can't, but if I were talking to the people of America, I would ask them to listen to these figures as well. 
   We import 4.3 million barrels of oil a day, that's for gasoline, we import that much per day. We actually use 21.5 million barrels, but we have to import 4.3 million barrels of oil because we only produce about 17.2 million barrels of oil. So we're short 4.3 million barrels of oil a day. 
   We have an emergency stockpile, but that would only last a short period of time. In April of 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that an estimated 3.65 billion barrels of oil and 1.85 trillion cubic feet of untapped natural gas exists in Montana and North Dakota. If we could go after those reserves, we could start reducing the price of gas at the pump and energy for people all across this country. 
   In the ANWR, it holds the single largest deposit of oil in the entire United States. It's 10.4 billion barrels of oil, and it's more than double the proven reserves in the entire State of Texas. And according to the Department of Interior, there is an estimated 8.5 billion barrels of known oil reserves and 29.3 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves along our coastlines, with 82 percent of the oil and 95 percent of the gas located in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Now, a lot of my colleagues have said, well, my gosh, the oil companies can go ahead and drill off the coast on the Continental Shelf. Well, let me just talk about that for a minute. Only 3 percent of the Continental Shelf has been given to the oil companies in the way of permits, and those permits run 5 to 10 years. Now, during that period of time they have to decide, with seismic tests, whether or not there's oil down there. If they think there's some oil down there, they drill a test well. And if they drill the test well and it doesn't show enough oil to make a profit, then they don't go ahead with it. 
   So most of these things that they have there right now are not being explored because there is not enough oil to make a profit. Those permits are not allowing them to make a profit, so they're not building those derricks. Those oil derricks cost as much as $2 billion. Now, if you're going to invest $2 billion in an oil derrick, you want to make darn sure that there's oil down there. And only 3 percent of our Continental Shelf is being used, 97 percent is not being used. And we could explore for oil all along that coastline, but we aren't able to because of the rigorous position that this Congress has put the oil companies in. And I'm not saying that the oil companies are totally free of any blame. You know, they have made an awful lot of profit. And my colleagues want to tax them on the windfall profits that they have been getting. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, but that's not going to give us one more drop of oil. The only way we can get one more drop of oil is to drill for it. 
   The Department of Interior estimates that there are untapped resources of about 86 billion barrels in the Gulf of Mexico and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   As I said, on the Outer Continental Shelf they have 1.76 billion acres of untapped resources and not leased on the Continental Shelf. And since the 1980s, the United States has prohibited oil and gas drilling on most of the Outer Continental Shelf, except for a limited area in the western Gulf of Mexico. 
   We could be energy independent if we just looked at our own resources. Approximately 121 companies own the rights of the Continental Shelf, but they lease only 3 percent of the Continental Shelf. And about 15 percent of the U.S. natural gas production and 27 percent of our oil production comes from that area. 
   They invest billions of dollars to acquire and maintain their leases, and unless there is oil down there that they find from seismic tests or a test well, they're certainly not going to build a $2 billion oil derrick unless they can make a profit. 
   I would just like to say to my colleagues, the problem is that we're buying oil from the rest of the world; we're importing oil from the rest of the world. We're dependent on them. And the appetite for energy is growing very, very rapidly: China wants more oil; Taiwan wants more oil; countries all across the world that are expanding want more oil. So we're in competition with them for oil. We could be energy independent and not have to lean on countries like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, but we aren't doing it, we continue to import. 
   One of my colleagues tonight said, you know, we want to clean up the environment. Well, if we import gas and oil, you think that's not going into the atmosphere? Why should we import Saudi oil when we can get our own? If we want to clean up the environment, we can do that the same way. 
   Whether or not we import the oil or use our own oil, it makes no sense not to drill. We could bring down the price of gasoline and energy in this country very rapidly if we announced tomorrow that we were going to start drilling in the United States of America. 
   Let me talk about one other thing that is very important. In 1981, we had 324 oil refineries in this country; today we have 148. We haven't built a new refinery in 30 years. And that's one of the problems, you've got to get the oil to market. You've got to produce gasoline and other energy products from the oil, and you have to have refineries to do that. And we haven't built a new refinery in over 30 years. And we had the refineries that we did have cut by more than 50 percent. 
   This country ought to move toward clean energy, but in the process we should make sure that we use our reserves to create gasoline here in America and not have to import all that oil. We ought to be drilling. We could be energy independent if we really wanted to.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (RESEARCH BEFORE DRILLING -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, let me just say to the young lady who just spoke in the well, the new Representative, that if you are going to drill you have to have a geological study done that shows that there is oil there. Those leases are 5 to 10 years, and if there is no oil there, they are not going to put up a derrick. 
   On the Continental Shelf, they have to do seismic studies to make sure there is oil down there. If they think there is oil down there, they drill a test well. If there is not enough oil down there, they are not going to build a $2 billion derrick. Those platforms cost as much as $2 billion. 
   Unless it's profitable, they are not going to drill there. They have to drill where they know there is oil. That's why we need to expand beyond the 3 percent of the Continental Shelf we are talking about and get the other 97 percent involved. If we did that and they got those leases, we could become energy independent. 
   Drilling in the ANWR, which is the size of Dulles Airport, is not ecologically dangerous. We should go ahead and drill there and get the oil. We could get 1 to 2 million barrels of oil a day.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (AMERICAN ENERGY NEEDS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say that some Members of Congress do more work than others, and I want to congratulate you on taking the time and making the effort to get Members on record as to how they feel about drilling for oil and natural gas to get our energy prices down and get the price of gasoline at the pump down. You are to be congratulated. I watched you on television the other night, and I just wish you had more time to get into more of the details because what you say on the floor ought to be heard by people all across this country. 
   I took a 5-minute special order before this one, and I didn't get a chance to go into some of the issues in depth that the American people ought to know about because they hear so much on both sides of the aisle. On that side of the aisle they say, oh, my gosh, the oil companies have so many leases, they ought to drill on those leases, both on American soil and also on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   The fact of the matter is there are an awful lot of leases already out there, given to the oil companies, but they are not going to drill in those areas unless they know there is oil there. And that's why there are seismic tests that take place. And those tests don't take place until they get the lease. And that lease is for 5 to 10 years. If they don't move on that lease within 5 to 10 years, then they have to give the lease up and it is re-bid, and somebody else might go for that lease. 
   But chances are they will do everything they can to find oil in that 5 or 10-year period because they don't want to lose a lease that has a lot of oil within it. So they do seismic tests to find out if there is oil there. 
   If they drill on a lease that is next to another lease, sometimes they do test drills, if it looks like it is a promising lease or leases around that area, they  are going to drill on all of them. When they drill for oil off the Outer Continental Shelf or on the Continental Shelf, it costs $2 billion, up to $2 billion to erect a platform and a derrick and the drilling process, to drill down and get that oil out of the ocean. 
   An oil company is not going to do that unless they think that there is oil down there. Why would you spend $2 billion unless you know there is oil there. That's why they get the leases and do the seismic testing. Once they do the seismic testing, if it looks like there is oil there, then they drill. They have to go through a very strenuous program of getting more and different kinds of leases so they can drill. But once they find there is oil on those leases that are already available, they will drill there because they want to get the oil, they want to make the money. 
   The problem we have is we are only using 3 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf. The other 97 percent we are not drilling on. That really is troubling because there may not be an awful lot of oil in that 3 percent where they have the permits right now. But the other 97 percent, we know there is oil out there. 
   I would like to give a couple of facts that I think my colleagues and the people of this country ought to know.     
   We use 21.5 million barrels of oil a day. ANWR, and I think my colleagues talked about this, is the size of Dulles Airport. You're not going to kill the environment of Alaska if you drill in the ANWR. Alaska's almost three times the size of Texas, and the size of the Dulles Airport is not much bigger than Capitol Hill here, and we could drill there in an environmentally safe way and get up to 1 to 2 million barrels of oil a day. 
   ANWR has 10.4 billion barrels of oil, more than double the proven reserves in Texas. And in April, the U.S. Geological Survey announced there was estimated, now get this, 3.65 billion barrels of oil and 1.85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Montana and North Dakota. 
   On our coast lines there's 8.5 billion barrels of oil and 29.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. And you can go on and on and on and on. We have the gas. We have the oil necessary to become energy independent. We can get it in an environmentally safe way. And as my colleague from Georgia has said time and time again, we need to go after it. 
   We shouldn't be giving our money to the Saudis. They're not our best buddies. They're supporting these madrassas that teach Wahabiism, which is a radical form of Islam, all over the world. And they're using our money that they get from us buying the oil over there, and we can get this energy right here in America. And we can also, as my colleague has said, bring the price of gasoline down. And that's what I think Americans want all over this country. 
   The problem is, they may be confused because this young lady that was just down here, a new Member, she came down and started quoting all these statistics like there's this many leases and that many leases and why aren't they drilling there because they can drill. 
   You're not going to drill unless a seismic test shows there's oil and you do a test well in the ocean. You're not going to drill on land unless there's a study that shows that there's oil down there. We know that there's oil in the ANWR and so we ought to drill there. 
   All I can say to my colleague and to anybody that's paying attention across this country is that we need to get all of the Congressmen on board. My colleague's working his tail off to get it done. We need to get everybody on board so we can drill for oil and natural gas in this country, get the price of energy down, get the price of gas at the pump down to way below where it is now. And we can do it, but what we have to do is get every Congressman in this body on board and in supporting drilling in America. We can do it. 
   And the American people have done it in the past. They've written letters in when we tried to hold, when we tried to tax the interest on their savings in the banks, they sent us cards that looked like snow coming down in this place. And we ended up reversing ourselves and saying we weren't going to tax or collect taxes at the bank when they got interest on their savings. They didn't like that. 
   So if the American people, and I say this to my colleague from Georgia, if the American people want us to drill in America they need to contact their Congressman and say get on with it. Quit messing around. Drill for oil here. We want to be energy independent. We've been talking about it for over 30 years. It's time to act. 
   With that, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say to the gentleman from Georgia, he mentioned that we haven't built any new oil refineries since the late 1970s, and he's correct. But there's one other thing that he didn't mention. I know he knows this. 
   In 1981 we had 324 oil refineries. Today we have 148, less than half. There's no way that we can handle the oil that we could get out of the ground to lower the price of gasoline unless we build new refineries. And we've come up with an idea to put it on some of these closed military bases around the country, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not seen fit to agree to that.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Yes. 
   Along those lines, they say, well, it's going to take 10 years if we start drilling. It's going to take 10 years if we start refining it. I don't think that's the case. Most people think in 2 or 3 years we could really be pumping a lot of new oil out of the ground if we were allowed to drill for it, and we could refine it and get it in the gas tanks of the people across this country. 
   But even if it did take 10 years, when do we start? We were talking about this back during the Carter years in the late seventies. That's 30 years ago. And we haven't done a darn thing about it. 
   If we're going to keep the cost of energy down, with the demand for energy growing at a very rapid rate around the world, China wants more, everybody wants more oil to expand their economies, building new roads and everything else. There's a war going on right now for the oil that's available, the energy that's available in this world. If we're going to be able to keep pace, which will help us economically, and, in fact, maybe save us economically, we're going to have to drill in America for oil and gas. We're going to have to get on with the program. 
   I can't talk to the American people, but if I were talking to the American people, like my colleague from Georgia would like to do, I'd tell them get on with it. Call your Congressman. Write them. Sign all these petitions and tell them we want to be energy independent; we want to drill here in America.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman would yield, first of all, I would really appreciate if I could get the information on natural gas that you just gave us tonight because I was aware that it was a major problem, but I didn't know it was as big a problem as it is and is going to be. 
   And I'd just like to say something about the polls that show that people are becoming more and more concerned about energy and natural gas and gasoline. 
   The people are ahead of Congress. The majority, not too long ago, were saying environmental concerns were by far the biggest problem that we face. Now, seventy-some percent are saying, hey, we want to clean up the environment but at the same time we want to keep the economy moving and we want gasoline at a price we can afford and natural gas at a price we can afford. And so seventy-some percent now say drill in America. They know. They see it. 
   And if our Congress doesn't do something about it, as you said, we're probably going to suffer the consequences. I will make a prediction. At that point, there will be a knee-jerk reaction and they will throw everything to the wind, say drill everywhere, do whatever it takes, but at that point, it is going to take a long time to catch up, and our economy could suffer tremendously. 
   I'd just like to make one more comment about the Persian Gulf. The Persian Gulf is a tinderbox right now. We don't know what Iran's going to do. If Iran develops a nuclear capability, there may be a major war over there because Israel is not going to want to be threatened like they are threatened, and we could end up seeing a couple of ships sunk in the Persian Gulf and see a large percentage of our energy stopped flat, stopped. And if that happens, we're not going to have the energy to keep this economy moving immediately, immediately, not to mention the problems that you were talking about a minute ago. 
   I'd like for you to explain to me, if it's okay with the gentleman who has the time, I'd like you to explain to me why the United States can't be completely energy independent. Because when I look at these statistics on the trillions of cubic feet of gas that's there and the billions of barrels of oil that's there, it seems to me that if we just dealt with our own resources, we could become almost energy independent.

As a result, we're going to be short of energy, and the cost is going to go through the roof, and the cost of gasoline per gallon is going to go up, I believe, even further.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Well, let me take just 1 minute and say that this is a critical issue. The American people know it's a critical issue, but I don't think they know how critical it is or how critical it's going to be, the natural gas, the gasoline, the lack of energy, the lack of electricity, possibly, if we don't get this. 
   And so, you know, it is a critical time for us. And the American people really need to contact their Congressman and their Senators and let them know that they want to move towards energy independence by drilling here in the United States. We have the ability to move toward energy independence. We have the ability to lower the price of gasoline. We have the ability to lower the price of energy that's going to be needed to heat our houses and our businesses this winter, but we're not doing it. And if we don't get with it, as both my colleagues have just said, we're going to reap the whirlwind. The economy is going to really suffer. It's not going to just be individuals, it's going to be the entire country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING PROSTATE CANCER DETECTION AND TREATMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 353 and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton for bringing this resolution to the Floor today. I am proud to be a sponsor of this resolution and I was honored to work with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Representative Elijah Cummings--the Democrat sponsor of the resolution--to bring some critically needed awareness to this issue. Representative Cummings has been a true leader on this issue, and today is the culmination of a two-year effort to shine a public spotlight on this national tragedy. This resolution sends a strong signal to the National Institutes of Health and the private sector that Congress is prepared to help them move prostate cancer detection and treatment into the 21st Century. 
   Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer, other than some kinds of skin cancer, among men in the United States, affecting at least one in six American men, a rate comparable to breast cancer which strikes one in seven American women. In fact, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States, after lung cancer, and the seventh leading cause of death overall for men in this country. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2007 alone approximately 218,000 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and roughly 27,000 American men died as a result of this disease. 
   Medical experts do not know what causes prostate cancer. Medical experts do not know how to prevent prostate cancer, but they do know that not smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, and seeing your doctor regularly contribute to overall good health. 
   While all men are at risk for prostate cancer, some factors increase risk: 
   Family history. Men with a father or brother who has had prostate cancer are at greater risk for developing it themselves. 
   Race. Prostate cancer is more common in some racial and ethnic groups than in others, but medical experts do not know why. Prostate cancer is more common in African-American men than in white men. It is less common in Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native American men than in white men. 
   It is important for men to take advantage of prostate cancer screening exams in order to detect the disease at the earliest opportunity, when it is still curable. Unfortunately, a recent study funded by the National Cancer Institute demonstrated that the most common available methods of detecting prostate cancer, the PSA blood test and Digital Rectal Exam, DRE, the only preinvasive indicators available for the detection of prostate cancer, are not particularly adept at detecting prostate cancer. The study showed that many PSA blood tests that screen for prostate cancer result in false-negative reassurances and numerous false-positive alarms (15 percent of men with normal PSA levels still have prostate cancer). Even when PSA levels are abnormal, 88 percent of men end up not having prostate cancer that would require surgery but undergo unnecessary biopsies. As a result more than 1,000,000 U.S. men have prostate biopsies annually--costing our health care system approximately $1.44 billion--many of which could be eliminated if we had advanced diagnostic imaging tools. 
   Today, neither the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services nor the Department of Defense devotes substantial resources to prostate cancer imaging research. I have been told that the National Institutes of Health spent only $10 million on prostate cancer detection research last year out of a total prostate cancer research budget of $350 million. In short, there is no concerted Federal effort to bring the equivalent of mammography to prostate cancer detection. 
   Breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer resulted from the development of advanced imaging technologies led by the Federal Government and I am convinced that Federal leadership could lead to similar breakthroughs for prostate cancer. That is why we introduced, along with my colleague Elijah Cummings of Maryland, H. Res. 353--Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that there should be an increased Federal commitment supporting the development of innovative advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection and treatment. 
   We owe it to ourselves, our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, sons, husbands, and friends to make this effort. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res 353.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (FBI HELPED FRAME FOUR IN 1965 MURDER -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I wish the whole world were listening to what we are talking about tonight. In 1965, there with a murder committed in Boston, Massachusetts, and a man named Deegan was shot down. A man named Joe ``The Animal'' Barboza, the first man in the witness protection program, who was protected by the FBI in Boston, testified that a man named Joe Salvati, a man named Peter Limone, and two other people were involved in the murder, and they were not. 
   J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in the Boston office knew these men were innocent, but because they were protecting a Mob informant of the Winter Hill Gang headed by Whitey Bulger, they put these guys in jail for life. They were going to give them the death penalty, but that was commuted to life in prison. 
   Joe Salvati was the fellow that I worked with when I was chairman of the Government Reform Committee. We had hearings on this that lasted for about a year. We had some of the FBI witnesses testify before the committee. One man, named Rico, who was an honored FBI agent, lied about Joe Salvati, and Joe Salvati went to jail for 29 years, 29 years for a crime he didn't commit. 
   Two of the men who were convicted and went to jail died in prison, and Mr. Limone just got out in 2001. There is no question these men were innocent. We subpoenaed documents from the Justice Department and had to fight the administration to get them because they were claiming executive privilege. We finally got the documents, and we found that all of the way up to the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, they knew these men were innocent, but they put them in jail to protect Mob informants, Joe ``The Animal'' Barboza, the first man in the witness protection program, and James, ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, a friend of his, who was also a killer. 
   Joe ``The Animal'' Barboza was shot down in San Francisco years later because he was still involved in Mob hits. He killed over 28 people that we know of. 
   But anyhow to make a long story short, the long fight for justice was finally concluded today in Boston in a Federal court. 
   Judge Nancy Gertner issued a finding for Salvati and the other three men who were innocent of the crime but convicted and spent all that time in jail, two of whom died in jail, and she issued an order giving them $101.7 million because of this horrible crime that was committed against them by our justice system. 
   We have an awful lot of fine people in the FBI, the CIA and our other intelligence agencies, but unfortunately, we have had some bad apples in the system. 
   One of the gentlemen who was the head of the FBI up there is spending 2 to 10 years in jail for another crime. He's facing possibly another murder sentence when he gets out of jail because of something else he was involved in. 
   Mr. Rico was indicted for a murder that involved a man who was shot to death in Oklahoma at one of the golf courses there when he took his golf clubs out of the trunk. Mr. Rico had fingered him to the mob, and the mob went down there and killed him because this guy was the owner of an international company, and he found out that the mob was siphoning money off of him. So Mr. Rico who testified before our committee fingered this guy, and this guy was shot to death in Oklahoma City when he took his golf clubs out of his trunk. Mr. Rico, before he went to trial, died of a heart attack, but he had been indicted for the murder of this man who had been killed in Oklahoma City. 
   The long arm of justice reached out to these FBI agents, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Rico, who violated their trust, and also, it should reach out to J. Edgar Hoover. J. Edgar Hoover, whom I admired all of my life and I watched him on television and watched all the accolades that he was given, he knew these men were innocent, but to protect a mob informant, Joe ``The Animal'' Barboza, he put these guys in jail, and they left them there. 
   Joe Salvati's wife grew older without him. His children grew old without him. His wife went every week to see him for 29 years in prison. She didn't have a driver's license so she had to have people drive her out there. So Joe Salvati and his whole family suffered because of this. 
   I talked to Joe tonight. He's elated. His wife's elated, but they can't get back the 29 years that they suffered when he was in jail for a crime he didn't commit or Mr. Limone didn't commit. 
   So I'd like to say tonight that I want to congratulate Judge Nancy Gertner. I've never met her, but what she said in that court today really bears to be repeated. She said that the FBI case against Salvati and what they said in this court today was absurd. She said that the Justice Department said that these gentlemen were acceptable collateral damage. 
   Madam Speaker, I will put the rest in the Record because I want everybody to know about this, and I just want to make sure that everybody knows that these gentlemen were innocent, and this should never ever happen in a court of justice again ever.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I am not going to take much time. I am very concerned about the fiscal responsibility that we should have. And I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time defending the $300,000 per trip that the Speaker is going to be spending flying back and forth to California. But I don't think the American people are going to understand how $15 million a year is being spent for one person to fly back and forth to California. 
   The Speaker is a very important person. She is third in line to the presidency, but there are other ways to get out there that cost less. I think the plane the former Speaker used would cost about one-fifth or one-fourth of that. 
   And I don't think, no matter what the other side says, that the American people are going to buy $1.2 million a trip for her to go to California or $15 million a year for her to go back and forth to her district. It just won't wash, especially at a time like this when we are trying to get spending under control.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a great day for the State of Indiana and the city of Indianapolis. 
   For a long, long time, the Indianapolis Colts, our football team, has been trying to make it to the Super Bowl; but they have come just a little bit short the last 3 or 4 years. As a matter of fact, many people were saying that they didn't have what it takes to make it to the Super Bowl. 
   Yesterday, the Indianapolis Colts were down 21-3 at the half, and many Hoosiers who were watching the football game and people across the country were so dismayed because they thought once again we weren't going to make it. But Peyton Manning, the quarterback for the Colts; and Joseph Addai; Tony Dungy, the coach of the team; Bill Polian, who put this thing together as president of the club; and the whole team did an outstanding job and came back and made the greatest comeback in the history of championship playoff games to win the game by 4 points right at the end. 
   I just have to tell you that it was the most exciting game that I have ever seen, and I want to congratulate the Colts on behalf of the Congress and behalf of the people of the State of Indiana for doing such an outstanding job. 
   One other thing I would like to comment on is the defense of the Colts has been maligned over the past four, five or six games of the season, and yet when it came to the playoffs, they rose to the occasion and did an outstanding job. Defenses don't usually get the accolades they deserve when they perform well, but I want to say to the Colts' defense, you guys did one heck of a job, and you proved your mettle, and I hope in the next 2 weeks you will get yourselves all up for this big game for the championship in Miami. Everybody in Indiana is rooting for you. You did a great job in the playoffs. Peyton, take them to victory in the Super Bowl. We are rooting for you.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Thank you for the time, Jerry, I really appreciate it. 
   I have talked about this before with my colleagues over there. Al Qaeda is the enemy. They are the ones that attacked us on 9/11, attacked the USS Cole, our embassies in Africa, and they have said they want to destroy us. 
   The military leader of the terrorist group in Iraq today is the al Qaeda leader. They want to drive us out of Iraq and defeat us. They want us to turn tail and run so they can continue their attacks on the free world, especially the United States of America. 
   I just don't understand this. You say you want to redeploy. That means withdraw. You say that you want a fair end to this war. You say that you want a timetable for withdraw. 
   We didn't do that in World War II. It was a world war against terrorism. Adolph Hitler killed 6 million Jews in the ovens. This is a world war. They have told us in no uncertain terms what they want to do. They are the enemy, and we are going to withdraw? 
   I just don't understand it. I don't understand my colleagues. We cannot do that. They aren't going to go away. They will blow themselves up holding a baby in their arms. They will do anything to defeat us. 
   Al Qaeda, remember? This President said this war may go on for a long time because they want to destroy us. He didn't put a timetable on it; nor should we. 
   Al Qaeda, they blew up the World Trade Center; remember? They killed over 3,000 people and flew into the Pentagon; remember? They want to destroy us; remember? They are in charge of the military operation over in Iraq now; remember? 
   And you want to withdraw? If you don't fight them there, where are you going to fight them? Are you going to fight them in New York? Are you going to fight them in L.A.? Are you going to wait until they blow up Indianapolis? Where? If not now, when?

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, you know, I have listened to the debate with great interest. I listened to Mr. Murtha, for whom I have great respect, when he talked about the price being paid by our troops and what he has seen at Walter Reed and Bethesda. I would just remind him that he is not the only one that has been out there. Many of us have talked to our troops who have been wounded. War is hell, there is no question about it, but sometimes you have to fight like the dickens in order to preserve your way of life. 
   I would like to remind you just a little bit about history. You mentioned a revolution; that brought some things to my mind. In 1776, in the winter, four of George Washington subordinate generals went to Congress and asked them to remove him, and Mr. Lee of Virginia led the fight in Congress to have George Washington removed because he was ineffective, he could not win. 
   One of my ancestors was at Valley Forge with George Washington when he was 14 years old, and what I want to remind you is George Washington was not removed. They didn't listen to the Congress of the United States. They didn't let Congress change things. They left him as Commander in Chief, and as a result, he won the Revolutionary War. And we are free today, and he is the father of our country. 
   Now, the reason I bring this up is it wasn't right then for Congress to meddle and try to micromanage the war, and it is not right now for Congress to micromanage this war. General Petraeus is the one that ought to be making the decisions, not we in this body. Let the chief executive, the Commander in Chief, run the war, not 435 or 535 Members of Congress.

   The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 is stalled. 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, stalled. 
   H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, stalled. 
   H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007, stalled. 
   And the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, still stalled. 
   They have control of both Houses of the Congress, and these bills have not yet reached the President's desk, although they pledged to get these things done as quickly as possible after the election.  
   They have passed only 17 bills into law. Ten of those bills named Federal post offices and Federal buildings. None of the legislative impact on fighting the war against Islamic extremists, balancing the Federal budget, creating jobs, cutting pork barrel spending, or saving Social Security have been addressed or passed. 
   They have passed a budget. And the budget that they passed assumes that the President's tax cuts, which we passed early in the Bush administration that led to our economic recovery and low interest rates and low unemployment and low inflation, they want to do away with those tax cuts. And that, in effect, will amount to a $392.5 billion additional tax burden on the American people. 
   The Democrats' budget also includes an immediate $24 billion increase in nondefense, nonsecurity spending above the President's request. This is on top of the $23 billion of unrequested spending in the supplemental and $6 billion in the omnibus spending bill. 
   In addition, the Democrat budget includes 12 reserve funds, promising more than $115 billion in higher spending, which, if offset as required by the House rules, would almost surely mean another $115 billion in higher taxes. This would be on top of the $392.5 billion in tax increases they have already built into their revenue numbers. 
   The average taxpayer in Indiana, if this budget were to pass, would be saddled with $2,729 in additional taxes and more than 2.3 million Hoosiers would be affected just this year under the Democrat budget. 
   Now, I want to talk a little bit about the Democrat Iraq supplemental. That was for the defense of this country and for supplementing our troops and giving them the equipment and the support that they need to fight the war in Iraq and to fight around the world in places like the Balkans and in Afghanistan. The Democrat supplemental legislates defeat and funds favors at the troops' expense. 
   Let me just tell you what is in this bill. It is supposed to be for our troops and for the defense of the Nation. But in that bill they have added $120 million for the shrimp industry, which has nothing to do with defense; $74 million to store peanuts, which has nothing to do with defense; $25 million for growing spinach, which has nothing to do with defense; and $5 million for ``aquaculture,'' or to put it in a less fancy term, it is tropical fish. Five million dollars for research on tropical fish. These are things that shouldn't be in the defense supplemental, and yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle put them in that bill. 
   I think the American people need to know that while they made these commitments during the campaign, they have not fulfilled those commitments. And this is a report card on the first 4 months of their reign in this House. I will try to, in every 3- or 4-month period, give another report on the progress of the Democrats' agenda, and I hope it is a lot better than this one has been.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I just want to say to Mr. Kucinich and all the previous speakers, I agree with most of what I have heard today, except the way we get there. I don't think anybody in the House or the Senate wants the auto industry and related industries to collapse. Nobody wants that. The question is, how do we get to a solution that is workable, that will work over the long term? 
   Just a few weeks ago we passed the TARP bill, and we were told in just a day or two that we had to pass this or the entire financial system in this country and the world was going to collapse. We threw $700-plus billion at it, and today there are an awful lot of Members in both bodies that think, hey, it isn't working the way we thought it would. Things have gone south in a lot of areas, and we should have thought about this a little more carefully. 
   Now, I had the mayor of Marion, Indiana, and a lot of GM executives come in to see me last week and they told me in Marion, Indiana, they would lose $5 million in tax revenue if these companies go under.     
   And they would have to lay off firemen and policemen and other civil employees. Nobody wants that to happen. But how do we solve the problem long term? 
   And my concern is we're throwing $15 billion at this right now without a solution. We're going to have these people come to the conference table after we give them $15 billion, just like we gave the $700 billion a few weeks ago in the TARP plan, and we're going to say, now go solve the problem and come up  with an answer. We need to have these answers first, and then give them the money. 
   I don't mind staying here through Christmas and New Years to find a solution to save the automobile industry and the related industries. But this isn't the way, in my opinion, to do that. 
   Now, you know, Senator Corker, in the other body, said, here's the way that we ought to solve the problem; and I'd like to read this to my colleagues. He said, Number 1, the manufacturers should give existing bondholders 30 cents on the dollar to help reduce their overall debt. Right now they'd only get 13 cents on the dollar, so 30 cents on the dollar would make them happy, and they would agree to that. And Senator Corker said this ought to be one of the things that's in the plan. 
   Second, he said, wages should immediately come in-line with the transplant companies. And I think everybody that thinks about this realizes that if your cost of doing business is not competitive with your opposition, you're not going to survive. So that's an essential thing, in my opinion. 
   Third, the UAW should take half of GM's payment in the Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association in GM stock; and I think they should do that because they're in this thing with everybody else, and taking half of their benefits in stock would be a great thing. And I think they would enjoy doing that if they knew the company was going to survive. And they want it to survive. 
   And finally, the Jobs Bank program should be eliminated. He said, if you had these four things as a starting point, we could get on with the business of solving this problem. 
   Now, at the hearing in the Senate Banking Committee the other day, Mark Zandi, who is the Chief Economist and Co-Founder of Moody's Economic Guide said, testified, ``under the most likely outlook for the economy and the auto industry, the restructuring plans in which the Big Three have requested $35 billion in loans,'' at that time it was $34 billion, ``will not be sufficient for them to avoid bankruptcy at the same point in the next 2 years. They would ultimately need another 75 to $125 billion to avoid bankruptcy.'' 
   Now, we need to solve this problem. I want to help those employees. I want to help the executives. I want to help the communities that will suffer if they lose the tax revenues from these people who would lose their jobs and if the industry went south. I want to solve it. But rushing to judgement today, just like that, and throwing $15 billion at it, without a solution, in my opinion, is the wrong way to go. 
   So I'd just like to say to my colleagues, if you really want to solve this problem long term, let's don't rush to judgment today. Let's stick around here a few more days and work this out so we can really solve the problem long term so the industry can survive.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (GAS PRICES: AN ENERGY AND ECONOMIC CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Well, Mr. Speaker, another week has gone by, and the American people are paying over $4 a gallon for gasoline, and it's going up because we're getting into vacation time. And we're going home. We're leaving this body. This Congress, our majority party, hasn't done one thing or hasn't even made an attempt to lower the gas prices in this country. 
   We have the oil here in America. We have it off the Outer Continental Shelf and in Alaska at the ANWR. We have coal shale. We can develop it. We can get oil to the market within 2 or 3 years if we could lower the price of oil immediately once we address the issue because competition around the world will see we're going to drill for oil, and they will start lowering the price, and gas prices will come down, but we have to act. 
   Here we go with one more week. We're going home with nothing having been done, and the people of this country continue to pay these exorbitant prices for gasoline at the pump. 
   So, if I were talking to the American people, I would just say to them today: Contact your Congressman, contact your Senator, and tell them you want something done quickly because this is not only an energy crisis; it's an economic crisis.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, if America is watching this debate, I'm sure they are getting confused by all this minutia, which is very, very important. So the things that they really need to be listening to tonight is, and I hope America is paying attention to this, this is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States by the people who said they weren't going to do it when they were running for office. They promised a streamlined government. They promised less spending and lower taxes. 
   Let me tell you what they are going to raise, and I hope everybody in America is listening because this isn't minutia, this is the facts. Marginal tax rates are going up by $192 billion. The reduction in child credit, if you've got a child, the reduction in child credit is $27 billion. That's an increase. The increase in the marriage penalty is $13 billion, you know, the marriage issue that has been around for a long time. 
   The death tax. If you are going to leave your business to your kids, if you want to reduce that so that you can leave your children your farm or something, they are going to increase that by $91 billion. They are going to increase the capital gains tax. If you are a small businessman trying to make it in this very competitive society in which we live, they are going to increase the cost of capital gains by $32.5 billion, and then other tax increases by $47 billion. 
   So, America, if you are listening tonight, and I hope you are, it is late in the day, except in California, I guess in California it is only about 5 o'clock or a little before, but if you are listening, remember, the people who promised you a streamlined government, the Democrats, the people who promised you lower taxes and better government, the Democrats, remember, they are giving you, across the board, the largest tax increase in the history of America, $392.5 billion over 5 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   My first wife died about 5 years ago of breast cancer. And when she was going through her chemotherapy, we were sitting in a room with about five women that were getting their chemotherapy. And there was this one lady who was kind of complaining and actually had a few tears in her eyes, and she said that she had to pay $350 a month for Tamoxifen, which was the drug of choice. And a lady about three seats away from her said, Well, I get mine from Canada for $50. And I thought, my gosh, that doesn't sound right. 
   So we checked into it, and we found that the price of Tamoxifen was seven times higher here in the United States than it was in Canada. And I thought, well, that just doesn't seem right. 
   So I started checking into a lot of other pharmaceutical products. Today Tamoxifen in Munich, Germany is $60, and it is $360 here in the United States. 
   The point I am trying to make is the prices charged around the world are much less for the very same product, pharmaceutical product, than it is here in the United States. And Americans, I think, should get the same benefit as anybody else in the world. We are not second-class citizens. 
   Now, we get to the negotiation problem, and I heard the White House say, well, we shouldn't negotiate, shouldn't interfere with the free enterprise system. 
   I want you to know that we negotiate on just about everything right now. Let me just give you a few examples. 
   We negotiate on some of the aircrafts that we buy. As my colleague just said, we negotiated on the Cipro not too long ago. We negotiated on all kinds of military equipment. And for us to say that we can't negotiate on pharmaceuticals is just crazy. 
   When we passed the Medicare prescription drug in the dead of the night after 3 hours of keeping this machine open so they could drag up at least one vote for victory, we found out that it said in there that the government of the United States cannot, is prohibited, from negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies for prices. That means that they can set whatever price that they want and we have to pay it. There is no negotiation. And we hear from the White House and from others that we don't negotiate or shouldn't interfere in the private sector. We do it all the time. In fact, in the Veterans Administration they negotiate for drug prices right now. And many, many of the pharmaceutical products the people get in the military hospitals today are much, much less than they are buying through the Medicare system. 
   All I can say is that there ought to be negotiation. I am a Republican. My Democrat colleagues are pushing this bill, but it should be a bipartisan bill. The people of the United States should get a fair price for their drugs, and we should be able to have the Government of the United States negotiate for the benefit of the taxpayers to get the best price for the products that we are selling to our consumers.  
   H.R. 4 is a bipartisan bill aimed at cutting prescription drug prices for millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
   The current Medicare prescription drug law explicitly prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from using the strength of Medicare's 43 million beneficiaries to negotiate prescription drug price discounts. 
   Providing HHS with negotiating authority has bipartisan support in Congress and across America. In a recent poll, 92 percent of Americans stated they supported the proposal. 
   The bill requires the HHS Secretary to conduct such negotiations with drug companies on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries but provides the Secretary broad discretion on how to best implement the negotiating authority and achieve the greatest price discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The bill continues to prohibit the HHS Secretary from requiring a particular formulary (i.e., a list of covered drugs) to be used by Medicare prescription drug plans or limiting access to any prescription medication. 
   The federal government is well equipped with the skills needed to negotiate price discounts. It is done when we purchase airplanes for the military, when we purchase furniture for government buildings--and it is done in the health arena for programs in the Public Health Service, VA, and Medicaid. 
   We have seen that, even without establishing formularies, CMS can use its purchasing power to reduce costs. In times of dire need--Cipro for the anthrax attack on the Capitol in 2001 and with flu vaccines in 2004--CMS has been able to obtain lower prices. 
   The bill also clarifies that Medicare Part D drug plans are permitted to obtain discounts or lower prices for covered prescription drugs below the price negotiated by the HHS Secretary. 
   The purpose of this bill is to ensure that all avenues of achieving price discounts are being used to benefit the seniors and individuals with disabilities in the Medicare program. 
   While recent projections do indicate that the Medicare Part D program is costing less than originally expected, cost projections alone are simply not a strong 
   indicator of the program's success. In the real world seniors are still experiencing--complications, confusion and increasing premiums in 2007. 
   Requiring Medicare to negotiate for lower prices may not save the federal government huge sums of money but it will help save seniors money by reducing premiums and out-of-pocket costs. 
   Whether this bill saves the Federal government money is really a function of whether the Secretary uses his authority effectively. 
   Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimates are historically very cautious and CBO has indicated they will reexamine this estimated cost savings of this bill when they have more information from the 2006 plan year. 
   Today's law bars the Secretary from negotiating with drug manufacturers solely because the drug industry insisted on the prohibition. 
   We need to put the interests of America's seniors and people with disabilities ahead of the pharmaceutical and HMO industry. 
   This bill has bipartisan support and we should move forward to improve this vitally needed drug program for seniors and people with disabilities.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   You know, the things that are being said today, if George Washington had had television and radio and newspapers, would have been said about him. Several of his generals wanted him out because he wasn't winning battles and things were going wrong. Even in the Congress of the United States, Lee of Virginia led the charge to try to get rid of George Washington during the Revolutionary War. 
   Abraham Lincoln, McClellan, one of his chief generals, who wouldn't fight, ran against him for President, and Lincoln was going to be defeated if Sherman hadn't taken Atlanta. 
   War is not a popular thing. It's a horrible thing. Chairman Lantos was a survivor of the camps during the Holocaust during World War II. I would like to ask you a question: What would have happened if we hadn't won that war? How many more Jewish people would have been killed in those camps? Millions more. Six million died, but many millions more probably would have died if Hitler had prevailed. But we had Winston Churchill, who was willing to go to the mat to make sure that they didn't win and that he was going to defeat Hitler. 
   If we pull out unilaterally like they're talking about right now, we leave those people over there who voted and held their fingers up, we leave those people to their fate with these people who are radicals, who are going to take over. 
   Iran has camps. Senator Lieberman talked about that. They have training camps right there along the border. They are sending terrorists in to help augment the terrorists in Iraq. And if we unilaterally pull out, just like you're talking about, those people who voted for freedom and democracy, many, many, many of those will die, maybe even more than who have been dying in Darfur, and you have been talking about how important it is that we do something in Darfur.     
   A vacuum will be created, and Iran will fill it. They will not stop their nuclear development program, and we will be imperiled down the road from their nuclear development program because they'll have a real jumping-off point throughout the Middle East, not just in Iran but in Iraq and possibly Afghanistan, if many of you have your way. 
   I don't know why we're not waiting on General Petraeus' report. We just gave him authority and gave him the money to pursue this until he reports back in September. I don't understand why we're jumping the gun and trying to force withdrawal right now when General Petraeus, who talked to all of us, has not had a chance to succeed. 
   Mr. Speaker, 61 million people died in World War II, 6 million Jews; 61 million. In this nuclear age, if we pull in our horns and let Iran run wild over there, which they will, and they develop their nuclear program, how many millions could die in this country as well as around the world? I submit it probably would be more than 61 million. 
   In the United States, if we pull out like you're talking about, we'll probably have to go back in to stop them from developing that nuclear capability and stop them from training these people to go in and terrorize not only Iran and also Iraq and other places in the Middle East. That is a tinderbox over there and we have to make the right decision. 
   Every President who has been in a war has been criticized by Congress at one time or another. Every single President, unless it was a very short war where you were in for 5 or 6 days or a couple of months. This is no exception. 
   Have mistakes been made? You bet. Were mistakes made in World War II? Eight hundred guys drowned in a mock Normandy invasion off the coast of England. If we had television then and the newspapers we have today, we would never have invaded Normandy because they would have stopped it just like that because of criticism of those 800 guys drowning to death. They would have said it wouldn't have worked; it wasn't feasible. 
   This is a very, very important issue we are talking about. Our brave soldiers are doing their job over there. And they watch on television right now, and what are they hearing? Pull out, pull out, pull out. They are asking, What are we fighting for if the Congress is going to jerk us out right now? We have heard from a lot of them who say, hey, we're doing the job, and we're doing better right now. 
   I just think we ought to think very long and hard about what we're doing. It could effect a world war. We're in a world war against al Qaeda right now, but it could be a much more devastating war if we don't make the right decisions. I would like to say to my colleagues that I think it's extremely important that you think long and hard about what you're trying to do. Nobody likes war. Nobody likes war.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (DEMOCRATS' BROKEN PROMISES -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I would like to say to my colleagues who may be in their offices that were going to join me in a special order tonight that we're not going to be able to do it because of the late hour. So I'm going to take a 5-minute special order to talk about some of the issues we were going to discuss. 
   Today, we discussed at length the war in Iraq. And that's probably the most important issue facing America today, and I'm glad we had that very thorough debate. 
   But one of the things that's very, very important that we're not focusing enough attention on is transparency in government and the amount of money that we're spending and the taxes that are going to be raised. 
   When this new Speaker and the majority came into power, they said this was going to be the most transparent House in the history of the country, in all respects. And just 2 weeks ago, the majority wanted to start talking about a Slush fund rather than debating each one of the earmarks that should have been debated on this floor. And they were going to take that Slush fund money and go to the conference committee and behind closed doors decide how that money was going to be spent. The American people don't want that. The American people want to hear these issues debated, the amount of money being debated for special projects, so they know where their tax dollars are going and what the purpose is. 
   Not all earmarks are bad. Some of them are very, very good and very necessary, but they ought to be debated one by one on this floor so the American people know where their money is going. 
   I would like to also say that the budget that was passed by the opposition is going to necessitate at least a $217 billion tax increase, and in all probability it will be more like $392 billion, which would be the largest tax increase in the history of this country. And that, at a time when we need to address some of the more pressing issues, like how we deal with the Social Security trust fund. 
   The Social Security trust fund will go into deficit in 10 years. And at that point, we're going to see the American people starting to look at Social Security as a program that's going to be in the past, no longer something that we can rely on in the future. 
   The young people in this country are going to have a terrible time planning for their retirement because there won't be any money in the Social Security trust fund in the future for these young people unless we start addressing the problem right now, and we're not doing it. 
   As I said, the projected tax collections for Social Security and the spending for Social Security are going to be exceeded in 10 years. And after that, adjusting for inflation, the annual deficits for Social Security will reach $68 billion in the year 2020, $267 billion in 2030, and $331 billion in 2035. Many of us won't be around to see that, but our kids and our grandkids will, and they will be saying, why didn't we address the issue of the deficits and Social Security when we had a chance? 
   We can do that still today, but we're not focusing attention on that. And the people who are relying on Social Security and the Social Security trust fund ought to know that we're not addressing the problem. And the solvency of that fund, not for us, but for the future generations, is not going to be there, which means that we will have to either raise taxes or cut benefits. This is going to happen unless we address that issue. 
   So I would just like to say to my colleagues tonight, we are concentrating on the major issues, the war in Iraq, and a lot of other issues that are very important, but we must not neglect the budget. We must not neglect transparency and bringing these issues to the floor for debate, and we must not neglect addressing the issue of Social Security reform, because if we don't do it, our kids and our grandkids aren't going to have a retirement program to rely on.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (THE PRICE OF GAS -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I think the American people are not aware of is that on September 30, the moratorium on drilling for oil offshore on the continental shelf will expire. And when that expires, this Congress will have to vote once again to extend that moratorium. 
   Now most Americans are saying, well, what in the world does that have to do with me? The cost of gasoline is now over $4 per gallon. People that go to fill up their gas tank are spending $70 to $80 or even more dollars per tankful to get their car filled up to go to and from work and to run their kids to school. If we are allowed to drill off the continental shelf, it's my belief, and the belief of most of the Members of this body, that the price per barrel of oil will begin to drop precipitously, and that translates into lower prices at the gas pump for gasoline, which will be a benefit for every person in this country that drives a car. But in addition, it will have a positive impact on the purchase of goods and services around this country. Food, clothing and everything else is transported by truck. 
   And tonight, what I would do if I were talking to the American people, I would ask them to contact every Senator and Congressman in both Chambers, and if I were talking to them, I would ask them to tell their Congressman and Senators to eliminate that moratorium. The minute that moratorium is removed, we will be able to drill for oil and gasoline off the continental shelf. Right now, we're prohibited from doing that. And as a result, the price of gasoline, oil and gas products continue to go through the roof. 
   It's time that we move toward energy independence, Mr. Speaker. And the American people, if you talked to any of them at the parades that took place over the Fourth of July, or any other meetings that take place, the town meetings, they're all telling us, do something about the price of gasoline. Do something about the price of energy. Make us energy independent. Drill in America. Drill anywhere. But lower the price of energy and make us energy independent. 
   We have the ability within the next 60 days to remove the moratorium on drilling offshore on the continental shelf. We can do that. All we have to do is not pass a bill that extends that moratorium. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the American people are clamoring for that. They want the cost of gasoline to go down. They want the cost of energy to go down. They want us to be energy independent. Every place we go, they're saying drill here, drill there, drill anywhere, but lower the price of energy and get us to energy independence. We have the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to do that within the next 60 days. 
   And so, once again, Mr. Speaker, I know I can't talk to the American people. But if I were talking to the American people, I would say, call your Congressman, call your Senator, and tell  them to not extend the moratorium on drilling offshore on the continental shelf. Because if they do that, Mr. Speaker, then the price of gasoline and energy will go down, and we will move rapidly toward energy independence. And that is what everybody wants.

<DOCNO>Mr. BURTON of Indiana. (DEMOCRATS SEEK TO USE AMT AS WEDGE -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, nobody wants tax increases, and a tax increase right now would be detrimental to the economy of the United States. In fact, the Treasury Secretary thinks it would be disastrous. It would put the economy into a tailspin. 
   Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee recently tried to use as a wedge the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, as a way to create a new system down the road that would raise billions and billions of dollars in new taxes across this country. As a matter of fact, they would raise the top tax rate on capital gains to 36 percent. On people making over $200,000 a year, it would raise their tax rate to 36 percent; and these tax increases would be absolutely devastating to the people of this country and to the economy of this country. 
   Chairman Rangel in 1996 had an opportunity to vote against the alternative minimum tax, but he voted for it. And now he is saying he is against it, and he is using it as a wedge to get other taxes increased, which over the long term, over the next 10 years, will result in billions and billions of dollars of new tax increases for the people of this country. 
   Tonight, I would like to enter into the Record some statements made by Grover Norquist and Bob Novak in a column he wrote, so that the people of this country will be aware of what is coming about. Explaining all of these tax changes is very difficult in 5 minutes. It is very difficult for the people of this country to understand. But I want the people of this country to know that the Democrats are planning to use the AMT as a wedge so they can raise taxes across the board and hit everybody. And it is going to hurt the economy of this country and hurt every American taxpayer. 
   All I would like to say is that the American people need to know this. I hope everybody reads this. Everybody wants to do away with the alternative minimum tax on our side of the aisle, but we want to do it cleanly in one fell swoop. At least we ought to reduce it over a period of time so it goes away, but they are using it as a wedge so they can raise taxes in the next 10 years. And it will be very detrimental to the American economy.  
   Rangel's Priority Is Repealing the AMT  
   WASHINGTON.--Amid mounting opposition to a proposed tax hike on the managers of hedge funds and private equity firms, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel, is making clear that his first priority is fixing the widely reviled alternative minimum tax. 
   Congressional Democrats have zeroed in on private equity taxation in their search for new revenue sources to pay for expanded health care and other domestic spending priorities. Mr. Rangel convened a marathon hearing yesterday to delve into an array of tax ``fairness'' issues.  
   ``It has not been the goal of this committee to target any tax provisions other than the AMT,'' the Harlem Democrat said at the outset of the hearing, which featured 20 witnesses. ``However, it is fair to say that since the AMT is such an expensive revenue loser--because the revenue it brings in was never expected--that naturally we have to look at the entire tax code.'' 
   Created in 1969 to ensure that the wealthiest Americans assumed at least a minimum tax burden, the AMT, because it is not adjusted for inflation, increasingly is affecting middle-income taxpayers and has drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle. More than 23 million Americans could be subject to it this year. 
   ``It's the perfect storm of bad tax policy,'' the director of the Urban Institute's Tax Policy Center, Leonard Burman, told lawmakers yesterday, adding that the AMT is ``hideously complex.'' 
   Yet the cost of repealing the AMT is estimated at more than $800 billion over the next decade, leading to the proposed tax hike on private equity. A bill sponsored by Mr. Rangel and Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan would more than double the tax rate that hedge fund and private equity managers would pay on their investment gains, known as ``carried interest.'' Carried interest is currently subject to the capital gains rate of 15 percent, but the proposed change would treat it as income subject to the marginal rate of as much as 35 percent. 
   Citing annual incomes for managers as high as $500 million, one Democrat, Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama, made no secret of his view that the party should look for revenue from ``individuals who are making massive amounts of money,'' saying they ``frankly won't really miss the difference.'' 
   Economists and tax lawyers testifying yesterday debated the likely impact of the tax increase on the financial sector and the economy, as Republicans on the committee pressed them on whether it would drive investment overseas or whether managers would shift the burden to investors by charging higher rates.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I've always supported the right-to-life position. And I've listened to this debate with great interest. 
   Money is fungible. Tens of millions of dollars are going to go to NGOs. And these NGOs can take money that they already have and use it for abortions, because they'll have money that they can use for the family planning that they're talking about tonight. They'll be able to free up money to do what we don't want them to do. 
   Intent is one thing Mrs. Lowey's talking about. What happens is quite sometimes another. 
   The American taxpayers who are for abortion, and who are pro-life, don't want their tax dollars used for abortion, acro ss the spectrum. They just don't want it to happen. 
   No tax dollars can be or should be used for abortion. I've had town meetings, and people who are pro-choice have come up to me and said they don't want their tax dollars used for it. They're pro-choice, but they want people to do it with their own dollars. 
   I'd just like to say to my colleague, money is fungible, and this will be tax dollars used for abortion.

   Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to my colleagues I understand what you have been saying. You are going to give product to them. But w hen you give them product, that frees up money that they have for abortions. So you are indirectly going to be funding abortions. That is what I said. And the American taxpayers don't want their money in any way to be used, indirectly or directly, for abortions.
