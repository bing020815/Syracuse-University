<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (TO ELIMINATE THE EXEMPTION FROM STATE REGULATION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES DESIGNATED BY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me at the outset thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Meeks) without whom this legislation would not be possible. As he has mentioned, while we are on opposite sides of the aisle, we share the common goal of ensuring that the U.S. remain the envy of the world when it comes not just to capital markets but also the place where people can come, investors can come, entrepreneurs can exist and find capital and make this country even better and stronger. 
   Of course, we share the common purpose of representing the greatest city in the world, New York, which has always been and shall continue to be the financial capital of the world. I would also like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, and especially the ranking member, Mr. Bachus, for bringing this bill to the floor, again, without whom this would not be possible. 
   Over the past year or more there has been a new and rightly placed focus on the competitiveness of the United States capital markets. As emerging international markets continue to grow, the natural and historical attraction to the U.S. capital markets has given way to the considerations of a broader scale. In short, the U.S. is no longer the only game in town. 
   Over the past several years, as my good friend Mr. Meeks has indicated, several reports have been published that argue the regulatory and legal environment in the U.S. serve as negative considerations when market participants choose where to raise capital or headquarter a global business. With new markets popping up across the globe, investors and businesses now have more options, and increasingly we are seeing them choose alternatives to the U.S., such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and London. 
   We have seen an increasing number of U.S. companies, in particular small companies, raise capital on foreign exchanges, in particular, London's Alternative Investment Market, or, as known commonly, AIM. Clearly, the United States remains the global financial leader. Overall, I believe we can be optimistic about the future growth and success of the American capital markets. However, in a constantly evolving and ever-innovative global marketplace, we cannot take our leadership for granted, nor ignore indicators that the U.S. competitive edge is diminishing. As lawmakers, we have a critical responsibility to ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of the financial markets. 
   Strong capital markets are not a success realized by Wall Street and investment bankers exclusively. Strong markets mean jobs, economic growth and retirement security for people across the United States. We cannot control the evolution of overseas markets or their ability to compete in a global marketplace, nor should we want to. What we can control, however, is our ability to respond and to adapt to changing circumstances with innovation and flexibility that will allow our markets and market-makers to maintain their competitive edge. 
   This bill, the Small Cap Competitive Listing Act, is an important and reasonable step toward achieving that goal. In order to compete in an increasingly global and highly competitive marketplace, exchanges both domestic and international have developed additional listing tiers, with lower listing standards to expand opportunities for  smaller companies. Particularly for small cap companies, an opportunity to list on a developmental tier is an important component to their ability to raise the capital necessary to grow their business and to continue to innovate. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1996, Congress passed the National Securities Market Improvement Act in an effort to streamline the regulatory process and eliminate duplication. Common sense. This act included an important provision that granted preemption from State security regulation to the national exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the American Stock Exchange. Because these listings were national in scope on the major U.S. exchanges, Congress deferred regulation to the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, as the markets have evolved, that legislation has created a legislative barrier to the establishment of developmental tiers on national exchanges. 
   Because developmental tiers have less stringent listing standards, securities offered on those exchanges should in fact be subject to State regulatory oversight in addition to the SEC oversight. The legislation provides the national exchanges a legislative pathway that currently exists for regional domestic exchanges and foreign exchanges to offer a marketplace for small cap companies. By allowing the national exchange to establish this new tier, it will grant small cap companies a new alternative to London's AIM market and to other marketplaces that may be less regulated and less transparent. 
   This legislation represents sound policy. It puts all of our domestic exchanges on equal footing and removes a roadblock to progress. In addition, the bill represents an important approach to addressing American competitiveness. It grants the flexibility to develop new offerings without creating a regulatory race to the bottom. These new tiers would be subject to State security regulations, and any proposed new listing will be subject to oversight and approval from the SEC. Additionally, investor protections are upheld. As public companies, small cap companies seeking to list on a developmental tier will be required to fully comply with U.S. securities laws. 
   Let me just say in closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Meeks. We here in Congress, regardless of our party affiliation or where we are from, know that this country is the engine of the world, and we want to keep it such. We understand that financial markets, in particular the securities industry, is a vital component of our national economy. 
   And it is not just about Wall Street. As mentioned, many of us, whether you are from Queens, Brooklyn or Staten Island, many of our constituents benefit from a vibrant financial service industry. Much of that tax revenue disproportionately in New York City goes to fund schools and parks and roads. This is just a small way in which we can maintain that competitive edge, give entrepreneurs and small companies the opportunity to access our capital markets, put us on equal footing to compete with London's AIM and other emerging market exchanges across the world, and understand that the American people, the American businessman and woman, can compete with anyone if given the tools and the barriers are diminished. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers. Mr. Meeks, thank you very much. As well, I would like to add my thanks to his staff and that of Mr. Frank, Mr. Bachus, and on my staff, Ryan McKee, and urge my colleagues to adopt the underlying legislation. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would like to engage Mr. Dicks in a colloquy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Tiahrt, for their willingness to work on an important issue to my district in Staten Island. 
   In recent years, forests in Staten Island and other parts of New York, yes, New York City does have forests, have been under attack by the Asian Longhorned Beetle. The beetle has already eliminated 8,400 trees and, according to a recent New York Times article, Federal and State officials are expecting to eliminate 10,000 trees on Staten Island and Pralls Island due to the infestation of this invasive species. This does not include the additional 13,000 trees that are going to be sprayed with pesticides. In the United States, 35 percent of all urban trees are at risk, at a combined replacement value of $669 billion. 
   An infested silver maple tree located on a private wooded lot in Bloomfield in Staten Island is the first evidence of Asian Longhorned Beetle found. It was detected on March 22nd of this year. Thankfully, its early detection gives hope that the threat can be contained before it spreads to the nearby Staten Island Greenbelt Forest. However, without having the proper control mechanism in place by the July hatching period, Staten Island's 2,800 acre Greenbelt is in peril. 
   In May of this year, after the discovery of this on Staten Island, I wrote to the Secretary of Agriculture urging him to direct the U.S. Forest Service to develop a plan to address the Asian Longhorned Beetle in New York City. 
   The Greenbelt is one of the largest natural areas within the five boroughs of New York City and provides the most extensive system of connected trails within it. In contrast to other parks, such as Central Park and Prospect Park, the Greenbelt is maintained in a more natural state, both in the forested hills and the low-lying wetlands, and provides New York City residents a place to camp without having to drive 2 hours or more upstate. 
   In 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture forecast that the Asian Longhorned Beetle would be eliminated by 2009, but, unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, the Department of Agriculture now estimates it will take at least until 2033 to eradicate this 1 1/2 inch beast. These funding setbacks reveal that the beetle will not only stick around in areas in which they currently reside, but they will also spread to new urban forest areas. 
   The bill before us today increases the Cooperative Lands Forest Health Management program by $9 million over the President's request of $47 million. With these additional funds, it is my hope that the United States Forest Service will dedicate some of these additional resources to fighting the beetle and eventually eliminate it from our forests. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an urgent and serious problem for Staten Island and the rest of New York City's forests. I look forward to working with you to make sure the Forest Service has the necessary funding to eliminate this beetle and protect the trees that have thus far survived the beetle but may not be able to live much longer. 
   I would like you to be willing to work on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in strong opposition to this amendment, with much due respect to my friend and colleague from New Jersey. 
   And in large part it has been echoed, but let me repeat it. If anybody who was sitting on a runway, whether you are across this country, especially in LaGuardia or Kennedy, and in particular, Newark Airport, you would be stampeding this House to ensure that this redesign go through. The reason being, as has been detailed extensively, and who knows it better than the riding public, is that congestion is at all all-time high and only will get worse unless this plan is put in place. 
   The second, and perhaps I would, quote, in clean hands talk with respect to air noise with the people of Staten Island, that practically every plane that takes off to the south goes over Staten Island. So I can appreciate those who don't want more planes going over because the people in Staten Island suffer every day. 
   The preferred alternative in the plan will reduce traffic from Newark Airport from about 20 minutes to 12 minutes; will reduce air noise, as I said, over Staten Island; will reduce costs to airlines by $248 million by 2011; and a 1999 study showed that by 2010, we would hurt the U.S. economy by about another $4 billion, and the preferred alternative outlined in the plan could save our economy as much as 7 to 9 billion. 
   It is important and imperative that this plan go through. The riding public deserves it. Those sitting on runways now deserve it. Those waiting to get to Newark or any other airport deserve it. And I would just urge a speedy and urgent opposition to this amendment.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Congressman Paul Gillmor and offer my sincere condolences to his family. My wife and I extend our sympathies to Paul's wife Karen and their 5 children. I know that no words can provide comfort during this difficult time or shine light on this period of darkness, but please know that Paul's family remains in my thoughts and prayers. 
   I had the pleasure to work closely with Paul as a Member of both the Energy and Commerce Committee and Financial Services Committee for nearly 10 years. I got to see first-hand his passion for public service, his commitment to the people of Ohio and the earnest way in which he approached his job. He truly loved representing his community and making a positive difference in their lives and the lives of all Americans. 
   The 5th District of Ohio was well served with Paul Gillmor in office and he will be remembered dearly for his many years of public service.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (TRIBUTE TO ROBERT RICCIARDI -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and honor to Robert Ricciardi, a New York City firefighter who's retiring today after many years of service to the city of New York and to the people of New York. 
   Robert is an exemplary model of what makes the Fire Department of New York the best Fire Department in the world. Like many other firefighters, Robert spent a great deal of his free time volunteering throughout his community on Staten Island. He was an active member of his church and spent much time coaching youth sports. As a matter of fact, I bet tonight Robert will be at the St. Claire's gym for youth basketball tryouts. 
   Robert has served New York City with distinction as one of New York's bravest. Over the course of his career he's helped save the lives of countless people, risking his own safety to protect others. Like his fellow firefighters and so many throughout the country, Robert rushed into burning buildings as others ran in the opposite direction with a singular mission, to save the lives of the people whose names he did not know, that he never met and might never see again. Robert understood that one of the most important contributions we can make is to help others in need. He's dedicated his life to this principle, and he leaves behind a great legacy of service. 
   Robert, like so many firefighters across Staten Island and the city also knew many who lost their lives on September 11, as the previous speaker just mentioned, and with that, he carries that with him throughout his life. 
   We also know that Staten Island and all of New York are better off because of Robert's dedication and decision to be one of New York City's bravest. His service will be clearly missed, but we are fortunate that Robert will continue to be a positive force in our local community. We wish Robert and his wife, Dorine, along with their four children, Robert, Christian, Nicole and Gregory, the best of luck in their future, wherever it may take them. 
   I'm honored to call Robert a friend, and I'm delighted to have this opportunity to say thank you for all that you've done for New York City. 
   Good luck, Robert. We wish you well.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it's been suggested that September 11 was a tragic day. Indeed it was. But the reality is there were thousands of individual tragedies that occurred. 
   Time has given us the perspective to look back and understand what really happened. It has given us the ability to look back and see how individual families have dealt with their loss. Staten Island and Brooklyn alone lost more than 300 people. If you go drive around the streets of Staten Island today, you will see street names with the names of those lost on September 11 as a constant reminder of the extent of the carnage and the damage. 
   I have been to memorial runs. I've seen scholarships offered in the names of the deceased. I've seen families try to tell their young children, who are probably too young at the time to understand, what it meant when Daddy wasn't coming home anymore, when Mom wasn't coming home. These children are at an age now that they can begin to appreciate that they'll never have a dad again. There were hundreds of them on Staten Island alone and thousands across the country of young children who lost their fathers and lost their mothers. 
   The role we have here is very simple, I think. That is to protect the American people and to ensure an attack like that never happens again. The most powerful way we can memorialize September 11, and as our own private thoughts and prayers and to offer to extend a helping hand to those in need, but as Members of Congress I think we have a solemn responsibility and duty to stand up against the evil, against our true enemies who want not to just destroy this country but our way of life, and forever may we remember those who paid so dearly with their lives on September 11, 2001.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I rise in support of the Crowley-Matsui-Fossella-Garrett amendment. I want to thank Chairman Price and Ranking Member Rogers for their work on this legislation. 
   Time after time we come to the floor to ensure that homeland security dollars are allocated on a reasonable and rational basis, and that is to protect the American people and those who come to our country. 
   Time after time, we wake up and realize that places like New York City and other high-threat areas are the subject of potential terrorist attack. There are many, including myself, who believe that our homeland security dollars should be based on the threats and the vulnerabilities and the consequences that come with the potential; or, God forbid, an attack itself, as was the case, the catastrophic case, on 9/11. 
   As has been mentioned, our amendment would add $50 million in funding for the high-risk, high-threat cities to fight terrorism. The additional funding would be directed to the Urban Area Security Initiative, which is the only homeland security grant program which distributes funding based on a risk-based formula, which is a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   The President's budget on the underlying legislation funds UASI at about $800 million, $50 million short, we believe, of the all-time highest appropriation, which occurred in fiscal year 2005. 
   Despite the fact that America has not been attacked since September 11, our Nation is still at war with an evil enemy. Indeed, just a month ago, law enforcement captured four alleged terrorists on charges that they were plotting to blow up Kennedy Airport in New York City. Their plan was to top the attacks of the World Trade Center, to massacre more people, destroy more property, inflict more damage, and leave our city in ruins. 
   The threat of terrorism remains very real, making it essential for cities that face the greatest risk to have the tools and resources they need to stop attacks before they occur. The amendment will help our first responders prepare, train and be ready to protect innocent Americans from acts of terrorism. 
   I believe it will also provide greater consistency to UASI, which has been beset by funding fluctuations of hundreds of millions of dollars from year to year. 
   It is clear that major cities like New York remain the center of the bull's-eye for terrorists. UASI helps us fight terrorism, and ensures our first responders have the equipment they need to protect the American people. 
   In a way, just in the last couple of years, a number of attacks have been foiled thanks to the efforts of law enforcement and intelligence gathering, much of it because of the funding that has gone through programs like UASI. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we can keep having the news media focus on foiled terrorist plots rather than counting caskets. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5349, PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. 
   You know, kicking the can may be a fun game when there's nothing to do and there are no consequences at stake. But when it comes to national security and protecting the American people, providing the right tools to those on the front lines in the war against terrorism, kicking the can could be a fatal bargain. 
   Congress continues to kick the can down the road on a key tool that has kept this country safe since September 11. The other body closed a loophole in FISA that will ensure intelligence services have all the tools necessary to track terrorists overseas, terrorists who want to do us harm. Our Nation has not been attacked since September 11, in large part because of our ability to detect and disrupt terrorist plots before they've had a chance to carry out their evil acts. FISA is essential to those efforts. 
   Why do some ignore history? Why do some ignore the mindset of the likes of al Qaeda and others? Why do some want to weaken our ability to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs? Why do some put our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in harm's way or at risk? 
   Last year we modernized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act only after the National Intelligence Director told Congress that we were ``missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence that we should be protecting to protect our country.'' What about those consequences? 
   Preventing the destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge is but one example. More tragically is the case of Specialist Alex Jiminez of Queens, New York. Last May, Specialist Jiminez was taken hostage by al Qaeda in Iraq. Information had been secured on one of the possible kidnappers, but intelligence experts were hamstrung by the outdated version of FISA. It prevented them from conducting surveillance on terrorists in a foreign nation without first obtaining a warrant. As the kidnappers acted, lawyers sat around a conference table here in Washington for 10 hours debating and drafting legal briefs to establish probable cause to conduct the surveillance. While the lawyers debated, losing precious time, Specialist Jiminez most likely was killed. They've yet to find the body and that of his colleague. 
   Let's stop kicking the can down the road. This is not a game we can afford to lose.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (A TRIBUTE TO JOHN LAVELLE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to someone that lost their life several days ago. 
   Today, on Staten Island, at St. Peter's Church in St. George, many gathered, family and friends of John Lavelle. He was a State assemblyman from Staten Island and also the Democratic Party leader from Staten Island. His mother, his children and not to mention his colleagues in the State legislature, the Governor, the Attorney General and many members of the City Council, Councilmen Oddo and McMahon; State Senator Andrew Lanza; State Assemblyman Vincent Ignizio; the borough president; and so many others who flocked to the church to honor a good, decent guy. 
   As I mentioned, he was a leader of the other party; and perhaps, if he had had his way, I wouldn't be here today. But in a way it is a reminder, and John Lavelle to me lived it, that you can disagree and you can feel very passionately about certain things, and, in fact, most often, John and I, we shared the same goals: how to help those who are poor, how to help those who are oppressed. 
   He was the son of immigrants. The notion that new immigrants to this country make it the great country that it is and they need our help. The fact that he was such a community oriented guy. 
   Some of the eulogies today emphasized not just his passion, but his son talked about John's grandson and will the community be okay now that his grandfather passed away? He had a beautiful family. Three boys and grandchildren that kept him going and kept him strong. 
   He was someone who came into office not just for the sake of running. In fact, he spent many years in the private sector and, while in the private sector, paid his dues. He paid his dues at the soup kitchens. He paid his dues at helping those who were poor and oppressed. Politics was his life and his passion, but it wasn't just about politics. In my opinion, John was truly someone who wanted to help others. 
   And I will bet you right now there are folks gathered back in Jody's Club Forest on Forest Avenue in Staten Island who are raising a beer to John and his life and his memory, as well they should, because as much as he brought to life a passion for politics, he also brought a passion to be around others and to fight hard during the day. Almost like two lawyers in a courtroom, they are fighting it out on behalf of their clients, but when the courtroom door closed, you could get together for a beer and share and swap a story or tell a joke. 
   The world needs more folks like him. He was someone who wasn't so caught up on style. He was focused more on substance. Indeed, a straight shooter and someone who, although you may disagree with his policies or his point of view, he knew exactly what he meant and where he was coming from. 
   So we pay tribute because I know sometimes in life, especially in political life, we have a tendency to get caught up in the toxic environment which is created, but I can tell you in Staten Island folks were able to rise above it. And last week alone, while John laid in the ICU, Democratic- and Republican-elected officials as well as so many family members and friends held vigil in the hospital to hope for a recovery that tragically and sadly did not come. 
   Staten Island was a better place because of John Lavelle. This country was well served by his service. So tonight I pay heed not as a political official here but as a friend of John Lavelle.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of H. Resolution 345 honoring the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York. I thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for helping pass this resolution. And I thank the gentleman from Queens, Mr. Crowley, for helping spearhead this through, as well as Mrs. Maloney from Manhattan, who were instrumental getting this passed last week out of committee. 
   Let me briefly say at the outset, it was somewhat of a bumpy road to arrive at today's vote. We are nevertheless here to honor the Archdiocese of New York. When we introduced the resolution in May and set about to secure the 50 cosponsors, we got it pretty quickly. It was heartening to see the outpouring of support. Initially the committee balked because of the reference to Cardinal Egan. And on a personal level, I thought it was insulting to the cardinal and professionally, by extension, I thought it was insulting to the millions of Catholics who comprise the archdiocese. 
   Cardinal Egan is the head of the archdiocese and is a significant spiritual leader of Catholicism in the United States and a man of great integrity and honor. Like those who have come before him, Cardinal Egan has carried forward the mission of his Catholic Church and helped to provide spiritual guidance to millions. I am proud to say the committee realized and recognized the appropriateness of recognizing the role of the archdiocese, and today the Congress has an opportunity to pass this resolution honoring the Catholic Church and the Archdiocese of New York in particular.     
   Mr. Shays provided some very compelling statistics about the archdiocese so I won't repeat them. 
   We know that the resolution pays tribute to the dedication and character and compassion and values that embody the archdiocese; and, by extension, I think it honors the service and deeds of so many Catholics who have enriched this Nation. 
   And you really can't tell the American story without telling the story of Catholics who have come to this country and enriched and made this country better and stronger. Lord knows, over the last couple of hundred years, there have been some great, not just contributions, but some great controversies. 
   In the 1800s there was a political party that was formed in large part, called the Know Nothings, rooted in anti-Catholicism. Fortunately, they have gone away, and the archdiocese of New York, like so many across the country, have remained steadfast and have been institutions that uphold the dignity of life. 
   Mr. Crowley mentioned Elizabeth Seton, and Seton Hall University is named in her honor in part. The Seton Foundation for Learning, for example, on Staten Island is a school that is principally designed to help children with developmental disabilities and all disabilities and are a strong reminder of the value and wonder of all human life. 
   The archdiocese includes over 3,700 charitable organizations, touching practically every neighborhood across New York City's region, and we know that Catholic Charities alone provides 5 million free meals annually to the less fortunate. 
   As I mentioned, you can't tell this American story without telling the Catholic story. There is probably no more rich archdiocese in this country than the one in New York, and you can't tell the New York story without knowing the archdiocese of New York. 
   So many people who have served in private life have also served their church through faith and in the local neighborhoods I mentioned, and so many police officers and firefighters and civil servants, who not only serve this country with honor and distinction but also serve through their faith the archdiocese. And we saw that very clearly on 9/11 when firefighter after firefighter and their families were laid to rest in the Catholic Church. 
   Those are some of the stories by which we can tell a compelling tale for America; but, today, the Congress, I say thank you to Mr. Davis and Mr. Shays and all who essentially set a little time aside to honor a great institution and celebrate 200 years of serving the poor, the less fortunate with dedication, compassion, and pure social outreach.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Chairman, today I rise in support of my amendment to the FY2009 Defense Authorization bill (amendment number 27), authorizing free mailing  privileges for the family members of our service men and women deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. This amendment provides a tremendous opportunity for us to increase the morale of our troops overseas, which, as we are all aware, is necessary for having a confident and motivated military. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member Hunter, Personnel SubCommittee Chairwoman Davis and of course my fellow New York colleague, Ranking Member McHugh for their help in cultivating this amendment. I drafted this amendment in response to concerns expressed to me by many military families that it was becoming too costly to send regular care packages to loved ones overseas. I heard story after story of families, already finding it hard to make ends meet, having to spend as much as $1,500 a year to mail care packages. Each package our men and women in uniform receive arrives with a touch of home. Personal items in these packages, like pictures, cards and school, projects from their children make deployments much more bearable. 
   Mail from home also serves a second and important purpose providing our military men and women with basic necessities like shampoo, foot powder, phone cards and even the ever essential fly paper. 
   In my district of Staten Island and Brooklyn, local residents joined together and raised money to help military families send these packages over seas. I was inspired by the outpouring of support for our service men and women in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, where postal service employees raised money to cover the postage for every package sent to our troops. In Staten Island, residents formed Staten Island Project Homefront, Incorporated: a non-profit organization dedicated to serving our deployed troops and their families by sending thousands of care packages to the troops in theater. This month alone, over 200 packages were mailed overseas by this group with a postage cost of over $2,000. 
   It was these acts of great generosity and patriotism which prompted me to advocate for this essential program in Congress. 
   This amendment has received the support of organizations such as the VFW, American Legion, and the National Association of Uniformed Services. To quote the VFW, ``letters and packages from home do wonders in boosting the morale of our men and women serving in harms way, and high morale transfers to combat ready and effectiveness.'' Comments such as this, I whole heartedly agree with. 
   I recently heard from Debbie Parsons from Staten Island; Debbie had two sons in the Marine Corps serving in Iraq; both of whom will return for their second tours in the fall. Six days a week Debbie volunteers her time at Staten Island Project Homefront, packing boxes to send over to our troops. She would hear from her sons regularly and they often request she send supplies such as snacks, Power bars, soft drinks, books and foot powder, among other things. Prior to the donations from Staten Island Project Homefront, the packages she sent to her sons cost hundreds of dollars every month. 
   It goes without saying our servicemen and women are making enormous sacrifices fighting the War on Terrorism and defending freedom and liberty. They face great challenges under trying circumstances, and often without the benefit of basic necessities like socks and foot powder. It falls upon their families to get them these supplies and to cover the cost of shipping them overseas. This amendment will help make life a little better for our soldiers and ease the financial burden on those supporting them. It is a simple way to bring a touch of home to America's heroes overseas. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and provide our military families an easier path to sending a piece of home to their loved ones.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I remember after Ð9/11 how there was a lot of finger pointing as to who made mistakes and who caused it, where was the intelligence community, where were our defenses? 
   Isn't that what this is all about, trying to put in place mechanisms to ensure and to allow our intelligence community to stop another attack? Isn't this what it's all about to protect the American people and not to have so many police officers and firefighters rush into a burning and collapsing building? 
   Just remember one thing. On 9/11, aside from a tragedy that occurred that day, about 3,000 kids lost a parent, 450 kids on Staten Island alone. Just think of how many missed birthdays there are, missed weddings, missed graduations, 3,000 kids lost a parent because of what happened on that day. 
   Shouldn't we be standing united to ensure that not one more kid in this country loses their parents because some terrorist wants to blow up a building in this country? Shouldn't we err on the side of giving our folks the power to stop that?

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Mr. Kingston and Ms. DeLauro. And of course my colleagues, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Weiner, and Mr. Nadler, because despite this being a national problem, as you can imagine, are very specific to New York, and in my case, Staten Island has been under attack by the Asian Longhorned Beetle. The beetles have already killed 8,400 trees. Officials are expected to destroy 10,000 trees to keep the beetle from spreading throughout the U.S. 
   We know that 35 percent of all urban trees are at risk. Replacement value is $669 billion. The first evidence was found on a silver maple tree on March 22 by USDA tree climbers. This early detection gives hope the threat can be contained before it spreads to the nearby Greenbelt, which is an urban forest comparable to Rock Creek. 
   The bill before us today provides a little over $20 million to help eradicate the beetle, a far cry from the $48 million the USDA says is needed annually. 
   This a serious problem for Staten Island and the rest of New York City. I look forward to working with you, Madam Chair, and Mr. Kingston in an effort to provide additional funding in conference. Will you be willing to work with me on this issue?

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Addison Good is an 80 year-old retired cook from Staten Island. He survives on a very limited income of Social Security and a small pension. Through every step of his hip operations, his Medicare Advantage plan paid for the services and drugs that he needed. He switched to a new plan that provides even better benefits at lower cost. He says he does not know how he would get the care he needs without his Medicare Advantage. 
   Let me say up front, we will consider Mr. Addison Good as we consider the legislation; and I support the SCHIP program, I support its reauthorization, I support expanding access to health care for low-income children. 
   I do not support this ill-conceived plan that pits parents against their grandchildren. Make no mistake, the bill cuts Medicare by more than $190 billion. In my district alone, it will reduce funds for Medicare Advantage by $58 million for the 38,000 enrollees in just the first year. 
   The real-world impact of slashing $58 million in Medicare in Staten Island, Brooklyn, for seniors enrolled in this program could result in the following: either denied access to the program altogether, to lose health care benefits like hearing, vision and dental services or have to pay more out of pocket. We should not gut Medicare or punish seniors to achieve a Democratic goal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Let me thank the gentleman for yielding as we continue the debate on ensuring children's health care. 
   Madam Speaker, let me bring up another point, and that is something that has been debated. Despite all the things we talk about here, there is nothing more important than protecting this country. Regrettably, I lost more people in Staten Island in Brooklyn than any other district in this country on 9/11. We should be doing everything possible to ensure that our intelligence community is preventing terrorist attacks. Right now, Congress, I believe, is abdicating its responsibility. That's why I urge my colleagues to defeat the rule and urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the rule. 
   If the previous question is defeated, we will immediately bring legislation to the floor to solve an intelligence gap. Very simply this, the American people need to know, if there is a foreigner on foreign soil, if there is an area in Afghanistan where the intelligence community knows for a fact that there are terrorists plotting attacks to kill Americans, right now, without a court order, we can't listen to those conversations. That's irresponsible. 
   If we want to help and protect the American people to the best of our ability, we will allow our intelligence community to listen to foreigners on foreign soils whose sole objective is to kill more Americans and our allies without a court order or obtaining a warrant. 
   If we have another attack, God forbid, I would like to see Members in this body rush to the floor and explain why they wouldn't allow our intelligence community to listen to foreigners on foreign soil who want to only do one thing, kill us.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this budget, which significantly raises taxes on the American people. The Conference Report represents an enormous tax increase on hard-working American families--families that cannot afford to send more of their money for politicians and bureaucrats to spend. 
   My staff analyzed the original House budget resolution and determined that it would cost an average family on Staten Island or Brooklyn nearly $4,000 more a year in Federal taxes. My friends across the aisle hail this resolution because they say it raises taxes less than the budget Resolution--as if that is an achievement to be proud of. The simple truth is that this Budget still raises taxes when we should instead be working to reduce them. 
   In fact, the reduced tax increase is only achieved if certain triggers are hit--triggers that are based on projected surpluses. But you don't need a degree in economics to know that surpluses will only be hit by restraining spending, which this Resolution most certainly does not do. 
   How are we supposed to have a surplus large enough to avoid raising taxes when this Resolution does nothing to reign in spending--and also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending without proper offsets? The math does not add up. 
   I cannot support a budget resolution that will ultimately cost families on Staten Island and Brooklyn $4,000 more every year in Federal taxes or a New York City Police Officer $1,300 more, a New York City public school teacher $1,500 more, and a New York City Firefighter $2,000 more. 
   The other side claims to support a ``Pay As You Go'' system when, in reality, this budget Resolution amounts to ``Buy Now, Pay $400 Billion More in Taxes Later.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against what is one of the largest tax increases--if not the largest tax increase--in American history.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and I thank her for her efforts to date on being one of the strongest and one of the most vocal advocates for ensuring that the people who, regrettably, either are not known about or too often are forgotten, those are the folks that have been represented so well by Mrs. Maloney and mentioned by Mr. Nadler, people who are suffering today. 
   There is one thing I know about the American people. If they know that their fellow citizens are suffering, especially those who responded to that tragedy on 9/11, they will be willing to help. So I think it is part of our job, a very important role here is that we continue to inform not just the Congress, but really, by extension, the American people that there are thousands of people who need our help. 
   As we approach the sixth anniversary of 9/11, it is time to reaffirm our commitment of never forgetting. As was mentioned, we may forget too much here in Washington. All of those who worked, lived and went to school in Lower Manhattan, who breathed in the toxic air created by the destruction of the Towers, many of them are suffering tragically from health effects. A New York City Health Department study shows an increased incidence of asthma for those that worked at the pile. A Department of Health and Human Services study shows that illnesses that are a result of exposure to 9/11 toxins are definitely on the rise. As this problem grows, progress on coming to a solution can be measured only in small steps rather than giant leaps as critical needs continue to be unmet after 6 years. In fairness, in the last 2 years or so, we have had some progress: $125 million from the Federal Government, of which $75 million went for treatment, that was for the first time, working with Mrs. Maloney in particular; getting the creation of a health czar by the name of Dr. John Howard to help coordinate and minister the Federal response.     
   As was mentioned, there was $50 million in the appropriations bill. But so much more needs to be done, and I think a stronger Federal response is appropriate. We fought across party lines. After all, this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; this is just about people coming together to help our Federal citizens to ensure that an adequate Federal plan is put into place. 
   We have a step in the right direction, and we need to keep the momentum going. That is why we are working to help draft legislation that addresses several key areas to help our heroes who are sick today, as well as anyone who falls ill in the future. One of the alarming trends that we see is that according to anyone you talk to with knowledge, it is beyond anecdotal. We can all tell stories of individuals who we know, young firefighters who ran a 6-minute mile in their thirties and forties and now have trouble walking up a flight of stairs. 
   The clinic that deals with the fire department in the City of New York that  sees on a regular basis firefighters has already evaluated more than 14,000 firefighters. That is 14,000 firefighters. That doesn't include the more than 55,000 people on the registry. 
   As we speak, there are 3,000 firefighters who are seeking mental health counseling and 2,000 who go for regular check-ups for their physical well-being, pulmonary problems, respiratory problems, the World Trade Center cough, asthma. The list goes on, not even to go into the cancer-related illnesses that we think may spring up in the future. I say that because many illnesses will not manifest themselves for another 15 or 20 or 25 years. 
   Is it the right thing to do for America to turn its back on young men and women who really gave their all on that day, who ran into burning buildings to try to save others, who stayed on the pile week in and week out? Are we really doing the right thing by saying they might not get to see their grandchildren or their kids go to school or to graduations or weddings? 
   I don't think it is the right thing to do, which is why I think this legislation is so important. When you think about the number of people on the registry, 71,000, maybe not all of them are sick, but let's suppose half of them are. That is larger than many small towns and cities and villages across the United States. They are actively under review for health care problems. 
   We know the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that 6,500 responders, and I mentioned within the fire department, but in total 6,500 responders are currently being treated for 9/11-related health problems through the federally funded World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, and another 500 to 1,000 additional responders are signing up each month. 
   I know we have a wonderful gift in this country to be compassionate, to take care of those in need. I think our roles here, with my colleagues Mrs. Maloney, Mr. Nadler, so many across the New York delegation, I just think it is our role to speak loudly, convincingly, working with the AFL-CIO in New York. 
   We will be getting together Saturday at Ground Zero to call attention once again and to reaffirm our commitment never to forget. 
   On a very personal level, I know too many people across Staten Island and Brooklyn who were willing to risk their lives. I know many who risked their lives and gave their lives on September 11. But the untold story, and it will be told for years and years to come, are so many young people who stayed there for the recovery and rescue effort and now need our help. This Federal legislation that we are proposing and soon to be introducing will help them give a degree of certainty. 
   Finally, we mentioned the new clinic alone on Staten Island that will make it more convenient for firefighters. How important it is for treatment and monitoring to go hand-in-hand. It is one thing to give these individuals a level of assurance that the treatment will be there. Another is the financial implications. It is not unusual for a firefighter to have copayments for prescription medication, not available in generic, of $2,600 a year because of having to respond to Ground Zero after 9/11. 
   Two thousand six hundred dollars is a lot of money, especially to a firefighter. We should be there to help offset that cost. And the monitoring is important because of the fear and the concern, the fear and the concern that the more debilitating, more severe illnesses will manifest themselves. I talk of leukemia or blood illnesses or cancers. 
   That is why it is so essential that we get this plan put in place and that the Federal Government and the United States of America not turn its back on the thousands of people who need our help.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the lady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the question before us is whether the front line in the war on terrorism moves from Baghdad back to America. 
   Although this resolution is nonbinding, the message it sends to our troops on the battlefield and to our enemies is crystal clear. Our words have consequences, as powerful as our actions. We must choose them carefully, for they are being listened to all over the world. And the words this Congress speaks today will send a message to both our allies and enemies about our resolve. 
   It is not a contradiction to support our warriors in battle and also to seek a lasting peace. That principle has guided us through tougher times than this. Indeed, it is America's gift from one generation to the next that we create a Nation that is stronger, freer, more prosperous, and more likely to enjoy God's world in peace. 
   To abdicate this responsibility for political expediency is a dereliction of duty and a sign of lost faith in the promise of America. 
   Throughout history, it has been proven that you cannot surrender the battlefield and still win the war. This war on terrorism was thrust upon us. America and other free nations were attacked by evil forces. To leave these forces unchecked would stoke the insatiable appetite of the beast. We know this because we have seen it before. 
   Regarding the fall of Cambodia, Henry Kissinger wrote: 
   Sirik Matak, who was the prime minister, was asked by then Ambassador John Dean if he would like to be evacuated, as the United States had just announced it was leaving. The prime minister responded, in part: Thank you for your offer to transport me towards freedom. I cannot, alas, leave in such a cowardly fashion.     
   As for your great country, I never believed for a moment that you have the sentiment of abandoning people which have chosen liberty. You have refused us your protection and we can do nothing about it. You leave, and my wish is that you and your country will find happiness under the sky. But mark it well, that if I shall die here on this spot and in my country that I love, it is no matter because we are all born and we must die. I have only committed this mistake in believing in you, the Americans. 
   The very next day the New York Times reported the evacuation with the following headline, ``Indochina Without Americans: For Most, a Better Life.'' 
   As for the Prime Minister, he was shot; and it took him 3 days to die without medical help. Every other government official and their families were executed, and one to two million Cambodians were rousted from their homes and led to the slaughter like cattle. 
   Is this the fate we wish to leave millions of Iraqis who have tasted freedom after decades of oppression? 
   Is this the fate we wish for our allies and the leaders who are nurturing an infant democracy? 
   Is this the legacy we choose for our airmen and our soldiers and for those heroes who have fallen? 
   With an open mind I have spent hours this week listening to the debate. Like many Americans, I was willing to listen to new ideas and explore a new course in Iraq. But an opportunity was wasted, because all I have heard is no from the other side. I have not heard a plan, nor have I heard a strategy. 
   And let me be clear. It is not my place to question one's motivation or patriotism. But I can question judgment. This resolution is either an endorsement of the status quo or a clarion call of retreat, and neither is acceptable to me or to many in this Chamber. 
   Some now talk about a slow bleed strategy to cut off funding for our troops. I ask, if we surrender this battlefield, which battlefield will our enemy choose next? Will it be New York? Will it be Los Angeles? Will it be Washington, D.C.? Appeasement does not work. Just look back. The World Trade Center in 1993, Somalia, the Khobar Towers, Kenya and Tanzania, the USS Cole and, of course, September 11, 2001. 
   This copy of the Staten Island Advance, my local paper, shows the faces of some of the victims, 240 on this sheet alone. These are the people I knew, and they were the people who we promised, these 240 people who left 450  children without parents because they perished because evil people attacked this country. We made a promise to them that we will never let this happen again. I ask you, do we break that covenant? Do we surrender to the beast? To that I simply respond, no.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, most people don't realize while our troops are in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq, that their family members back home, if they want to send them a care package, whatever that care package may consist of, from a young child's homework assignment or a drawing or an artist's rendering, to just something from home to help them in their time of trouble, right now those families must pay for it. And on average, it's not unusual for a family to incur about $1,500 a year in postage to mail those packages. 
   My amendment would authorize free mailing privileges for family members of our servicemen and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe the amendment offers tremendous opportunity to increase the morale of our troops overseas which, as we are well aware, is a necessary component to have a confident and fully prepared military. 
   I would like to thank, of course, Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member Hunter, Personnel Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Snyder, and my good friend, JOHN MCHUGH from New York, for helping to bring this amendment to fruition. 
   I drafted the amendment in response to concerns expressed to me by many family members that it was becoming too costly to send those regular care packages to their loved ones overseas. I heard story after story of families that are already finding it hard to make ends meet now having to spend as much as $1,500 a year to mail care packages. 
   These packages, as I mentioned, bring a touch of home to our servicemembers. Pictures, cards, school projects from kids, and I'm told there's not good pepperoni in Afghanistan yet, so that comes as well. But they also provide the military men and women with basic necessities like additional shampoo or powder or perhaps phone cards. 
   In my district of Staten Island and Brooklyn, residents join together and raise money to help military families send these packages overseas. I was inspired by the outpouring of support for our servicemen and women, particularly in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, where postal service employees raise money to cover the postage for every package sent to our troops. In Staten Island residents formed the Staten Island Project Home Front, Incorporated, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving our deployed troops and their families by sending thousands of care packages. This month alone they sent over 230 packages to our soldiers overseas. It was with acts of generosity and patriotism such as these that prompted this amendment. 
   The amendment has also received the support of organizations such as the VFW, American Legion, National Association of Uniformed Services. And to quote the VFW, ``Letters and packages from home do wonders in boosting morale of our men and women serving in harm's way, and high morale transfers to combat ready and effectiveness.'' Comments such as this I wholeheartedly agree with. 
   It goes without saying that our servicemen and women are making enormous sacrifices fighting this war on  terrorism and defending freedom and liberty. They face great challenges under trying circumstances, and often without some necessities such as blankets or toothpaste. It falls upon their families back home to get them these supplies and to cover the cost of shipping them overseas. The amendment will make life a little easier for our soldiers and to ease the financial burden on those back home. It's a simple way of bringing a touch of home to America's heroes overseas. 
   In short, what it would do would give each family member a voucher, the equivalent of sending a 10-pound package every 2 months, and would reduce that cost to those families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would also like to thank Congressman Engel and Congressman Terry for their efforts in the establishment of the ALS Registry Act. As we know, we have an annual event here in Congress when we get visits from members of the ALS organization, the association, and their advocates, but more importantly the citizens of this country who have been afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease. It is gut-wrenching to watch knowing full well what a debilitating disease it is, and it knows no boundaries. As has been mentioned by my colleagues, perhaps 30,000 Americans, perhaps 1,000 in New York State alone, are suffering with ALS. I know a gentleman on Staten Island who helped to have built one of the largest banks in Staten Island, if not the largest, retiring, thinking he was going to enjoy his golden years, and soon after that became diagnosed with ALS. To watch the horrific progression over the last couple of years is, as I mentioned, gut-wrenching not  just to his friends but, I am sure, his family. 
   That is why I think it is important that Congress finally step up and act, and as a cosponsor of the legislation today, I am pleased to see it brought to the House floor today. 
   I would like to thank the tireless efforts of the ALS Association and advocates in educating and advocating for a cure, which is what we all want. Unfortunately, we know little about ALS, a disease that is diagnosed for 5,600 Americans each year. Without a cure and without treatments to slow the progression of the disease, as has been mentioned by Ms. Baldwin, the average life expectancy of a person is only 2 to 5 years. It is a death sentence once diagnosed. The rapid progression, lack of understanding about its cause, and debilitating nature of the disease make it particularly hard on those afflicted with ALS, as well as their family and friends. 
   We need to give scientists the tools they need to find the treatment and cure for ALS. The registry does just that. It creates a single, national patient registry to collect and store information on the prevalence of incidences of ALS in the U.S. We know of several research studies ongoing at the NIH and other private facilities, investigating possible risk factors that may be associated with ALS. Researchers are working to better determine what genetics and/or environmental factors are contributing to developing ALS. 
   While there has been incredible and groundbreaking advances in science that give hope to people with Lou Gehrig's disease and their families, this legislation will provide an important new link that will allow scientists to take emerging new discoveries ever closer to a cure. And I pray that one day we will have that cure so no families or individuals will be afflicted by this terrible disease. 
   Madam Speaker, I stand in support, urge adoption and reserve the balance of my time.

It is a terrible indictment, Lou Gehrig's disease, that it is, and one day, as we say, perhaps this registry will get to a point where no longer will our fellow citizens have to suffer. So, for people like Gary Anderson, to this day, a gentleman I mentioned before, Harry Doherty, who is currently suffering as we speak, I would urge the adoption of this.

At the outset, I would also like to thank Mr. Upton of Michigan and Mr. Larsen of Washington for their work on this important legislation. Mr. Upton in particular has been a true champion and is one of the reasons why we are here. 
   Dextromethorphan, or DXM or DEX as it is sometimes called, is an ingredient found in cough medicine. The ingredient relieves the coughing associated with the cold or flu, which is a positive, and cough medicines containing this drug are common and can be obtained without prescription, as we full know. While the drug is safe and effective, it is also dangerous if too much is taken. 
   Reports have shown that some segments of the population, particularly young people, will take large amounts of this medicine in an attempt to absorb large amounts of DXM to get high. The abuse of this drug can cause death as well as other serious adverse events, such as brain damage, seizure, loss of consciousness, and irregular heartbeat. 
   Madam Speaker, at this point, I yield to my colleague and a true champion of this, Mr. Upton, for 4 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a dreaded word in the English language, and it is called ``cancer.'' Not a family in America is left unscathed or untouched by cancer and what it means to the families, and very often the terrible outcomes. 
   If there is a positive light, we know over the last several decades in particular, many health care professionals, organizations and groups have dedicated not just time and money and research, but their true passion to helping find a cure and treat cancer in many different ways. 
   I know on Staten Island this week we will have the annual breast cancer walk that will attract thousands of people, many of whom are survivors, and many who will work in remembrance and memorial of loved ones. 
   That is why I join my colleague, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), in support of H. Res. 448, expressing the sense of the House that there should be established a National Cancer Research Month. Perhaps it should be all year. I think it is important to at least acknowledge that National Cancer Research Month be this month. 
   The purpose of establishing this month is to provide an opportunity to better educate the public in an effort to make cancer research a national priority. 
   At the NIH, the National Cancer Institute conducts research into cancer in conjunction with numerous other institutes and centers. The NCI alone comprises one-third of the NIH's $30 billion budget. The work being done at the NIH towards cancer research is invaluable. Establishing a Cancer Research Month can help highlight what is being done by the scientific community and how the public can become involved. 
   While acknowledging and putting aside this month is important, what is even more important is continuing to support the research of those caring, compassionate health care professionals and researchers who will one day find the cure for all cancers, and that should be our wish and national goal and priority. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 133, supporting the goals and ideals of a Long-Term Care Awareness Week. As designated, the first week in November is designed as the opportunity to educate Americans on the likelihood of one needing long-term care. Additionally, greater education is needed as to what types of long-term care programs are available and what the various costs of services are. Families should take this opportunity to discuss the options to help plan and pay for their future. 
   We know the baby boomer generation is now becoming eligible for Social Security, so it is sort of a wake-up call for what it will be, not just for having some financial independence, but what it would be and what it means to take care of dealing with their health care and the notion of rising health care costs. So the sooner one prepares, the better off they will be when they reach that age. 
   Madam Speaker, health care costs are increasing, people are living longer, and I think we have a real responsibility here to educate constituents who need to become actively involved in ways in which they can provide for their own future of health care, as well as the care of their family member. I stand in support of this and ask my colleagues to support the resolution as well.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, let me commend the gentlelady from South Dakota and the gentleman from Louisiana for bringing this to the floor.  I think what they said is totally accurate in the sense that as our population lives longer and lives more healthy lives, along with that comes an understanding and an obligation to begin preparing for those long-term health care needs as part of their retirement. 
   As I mentioned before, baby boomers officially begin to receive, for those early retirees, Social Security in just a few months. That population, as we know, is large. I just think the more we can emphasize and educate the people of this country on what their options can and should be as they retire, the better off we will be when that day arrives.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I join my colleague from Wisconsin in urging the support of H. Con. Res. 182 and at the outset commend our colleague Mr. Deal from Georgia for introducing the resolution. 
   We all knew and remember Charlie Norwood who served in this House with honor and distinction, and those who knew Charlie Norwood well knew he was a fighter, passionate about his constituents, his belief, and passionate about this country, and many fights he won. But the fight he did not win was when he was diagnosed with a serious lung disorder in 1998 called, shortly, IPF. 
   He received a single lung transplant but passed away in February of this year and for that we miss him. 
   IPF is a progressive and generally fatal lung disease. It's marked by debilitating scarring of delicate lung tissue and hinders the lungs' ability to transport oxygen to vital organs. 40,000 people, 40,000 Americans will die this year from IPF, and there's no cure or treatment for this debilitating irreversible disease. Far too many of those with IPF face severe disability or death within a few short years, and we saw that progression here with our colleague Mr. Norwood. 
   The purpose of this resolution is to bring awareness to the severity of this devastating disease. Additionally, the resolution will support the goals of the National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week and encourage the work being done by the Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis and partner organizations in educating the public about IPF. 
   40,000 people die in a year, Madam Speaker. We should do what we can to bring attention and education and awareness to ensure it doesn't happen. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 507, the Vision Care for Kids Act, and join my colleague in asking for its adoption. 
   And at the outset, let me thank a few individuals for bringing this bill to the floor: of course, Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. I'd also like to thank Representatives Green, Sullivan, and Engel for their leadership and support in bringing the Vision Care for Kids Act to the floor, and Mr. Pascrell, who's been very, very passionate about this issue for many years. I've had the privilege and pleasure of working with him, and I know how passionate he is, like so many of us, to get quality vision care for kids who need it. 
   We've been working on this bill for about 6 years; and after countless modifications, negotiations and compromise, I'm proud to say we have a bill that is unanimously supported by the entire vision community. 
   And my colleague from Wisconsin put it very simply: there are many kids today who have problems with their eyes; who have an inability to see properly; who, if left untreated, obviously, leads to negative consequence in social interaction, not to mention their poor performance in school and academic achievement because of their inability to see, and not to mention the fact that they're not getting the appropriate care that in some cases leads to greater illnesses and in some cases leads to death. 
   The legislation we hope to pass today represents the kind of quality, sound public policy that can only come about through the bipartisan cooperation and a willingness to compromise by many interested parties. 
   H.R. 507 represents a responsible and sensible approach to public health. It's well documented that without the adequate access to vision screening and treatment for eye disorders, a child's entire learning and development can be adversely affected. And we say that for children who do not qualify for a public program and did not have health insurance, our assisting in catching potentially eye disorders is critical. 
   The bill strikes an effective balance with a shared relationship between Federal and State governments. Once States have identified, through the screening mechanism of their choice, that a child may have an eye disorder, this legislation will provide Federal funding for follow-up comprehensive eye exam and the necessary treatment. 
   By incorporating a three-to-one Federal-State match, we maintain incentives for States to run their programs efficiently, providing additional assurances to taxpayers that we're maximizing the use of each dollar spent. 
   I'd like to thank the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Vision Council of America, Prevent Blindness  of America, the American Optometric Association for their support of the legislation, that of my colleague, and know full well that if this bill does become law, there will be children who currently don't have access to quality treatment that will get the treatment they deserve and need so that they can live a more full and healthy and happy life. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I failed to mention Ms. Ros-Lehtinen before. She was instrumental as well, and Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Engel. Let me commend and thank my colleague Ms. Baldwin for her eloquence in shepherding all these bills to the floor. 
   As it relates to this bill, early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment, we know that those are the magical things that have to happen in order for a child to lead a more forward, healthy life. Without the access to the care that a child needs, we know that that life is going to be compromised in some way, shape, or form. 
   I think that this bill helps to get us to that point. I think it will help a lot of children who currently have no help and no access. 
   I would also like to thank Ryan McKee from my office, who has worked on this bill for several years in our efforts.

   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 20, the Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act, and join my colleagues in commending Mr. Rush for bringing the bill to the floor. 
   As has been mentioned, the bill highlights the need to increase awareness of postpartum depression and expand the knowledge of its terrible side effects. 
   It's important to note that as many as 80 percent of women experience some mood disturbances after pregnancy, and for most women the symptoms are mild and go away on their own; but 10 to 20 percent of women develop a more disabling form of mood disorder called postpartum depression. 
   This legislation encourages the continuation of research being done by Federal agencies as to the cause of postpartum depression and how it can be better treated. And with my colleagues, I stand in support of the legislation and hope my colleagues will join me.

   Let me join my colleague from Wisconsin in supporting H. Res. 524 and also acknowledging again at the outset the work and efforts of my colleague from New York (Mrs. McCarthy). 
   As was mentioned, the resolution recognizes the elements of the Diamond-Blackfan anemia and the research being done on the disease. 
   DBA is a blood condition, as mentioned, present at birth which is characterized by failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, and unlike other types of anemia, DBA relates to a bone marrow failure. It's been the result of a genetic mutation and has generally been diagnosed at birth. 
   The purpose of this resolution is to bring awareness to this disease and the research and education surrounding Diamond-Blackfan anemia. As is always the case, although the word is rare and operative, the point is if somebody is suffering from DBA they're suffering, and just because there may not be tens of thousands a year, the fact is that suffering doesn't go away. 
   So I would urge the adoption.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today as well in support of H.R. 1727, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, introduced by Representatives Baldwin, Bono, and Bilirakis. My colleague from Wisconsin stated very eloquently the statistics and the justification for this act, and it is long overdo. As was mentioned, the legislation would authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health to coordinate paralysis research through the NIH Institutes and Centers. 
   Research would be focused on basic, translational, and multicenter networks of clinical sites focused on designing clinical rehabilitation protocols for one or more forms of paralysis. Such paralysis research would include paralysis from the central nervous system trauma, disorders, stroke, or any combination of such conditions. Additionally, the legislation would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for activities related to paralysis, including grants to establish paralysis registries and disseminate information to the public. 
   Madam Speaker, we have seen over the years how the Reeves served as strong advocates for the paralysis community, meeting with a wide variety of colleagues in the House and the Senate over the last several years. Their dignified presence in Washington will be greatly missed. I believe that through legislative initiatives such as this one the work done by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation will continue that work that was left unfinished, and will be done so in a respectful manner. 
   As the population continues to grow and to age, I think more and more of society will be confronted with the likes of paralysis. It is our job, and I think responsibility, to partner with the private sector to bring awareness, funding, and education to ensure that as few people as possible are brought down by this illness.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me just thank the majority for bringing this bill to the floor because I think most Americans want Democrats and Republicans to ensure that all America remains safe and secure, and not to repeat another September 11. And, by and large, there are some very good elements in the legislation. 
   But let me, right at the outset, request that as we go forward, there are some specific concerns that New York City has that I think need to be addressed. First is the notion that the city itself cannot apply directly. It must go through the State without any requirement for the State to get the funds to the localities like New York City. We know by now that New York City has specific needs, and therefore, I believe should be addressed. 
   The same would apply to what could be a duplicative process whereby the grant program, and as someone who was involved in the establishment the first grant program under the Department of Commerce, where, as we speak, the NTIA is in the process of preparing guidelines, my concern is that we don't get into a situation where there are two different agencies getting into a bureaucratic trap which will prevent the flow of money. 
   Most important, however, is the fact that we know that one size does not fit all. And I speak specifically that, under the current bill, there could be, and I think will be, a problem with the restriction to Section 306. And that is that over the last 10 years, New York City has dedicated a lot of money and, in the last 5 years, since 9/11, almost $1 billion to upgrade its interoperability capacity to allow firefighters and police officers to talk with each other. 
   Now, under this bill, we are essentially saying that everyone must use the 700 megahertz in the spectrum. New York City cannot. As I say, they have developed and deployed $1 billion plus in the 400 and the 800 megahertz of the spectrum. Why? Because they found it easier to use that for communicating into the subways, into high rise buildings. And the last thing I think this Congress wants to be on the record for is to essentially tie the hands of New York City, undo much of the good work that has taken place over the last 5 years, and allow New York City and other localities that have unique and specific needs to continue to deploy and build on the networks that they have put in place. I think it would be a big mistake. I encourage the majority to consider this as the process goes forward. 
   I make no mistake and make no hesitation in suggesting that this will hurt and punish New York City and the millions and tens of millions of people who come there annually to visit the greatest city in the world.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the Catholic Schools not only in my home Congressional District of Staten Island and Brooklyn, but also the entire Nation as we honor Catholic Schools Week from January 27-February 2, 2008, which is sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
   America's Catholic schools educate nearly 2.5 million students a year, providing the Nation's young men and women with a broad academic background emphasizing the lifelong development of moral, intellectual physical and social values. 
   Catholic school initiatives that reach out to disadvantaged young people have touched a diverse group of students who sometimes find themselves trapped in underachieving schools. It is not surprising to me that more than 25 percent of Catholic school students are from minority groups and nearly 14 percent are non-Catholics. Parents recognize the importance of a quality education and are willing to sacrifice to ensure their children have every opportunity to succeed in the world. 
   Catholic Schools Week pays tribute to the dedication, character, compassion, and values that embody Catholic education in this country. I believe it is important to recognize the outstanding contributions Catholic Schools make in our country today. Their commitment to the educational standards and values ensure our children will have the right moral framework to help lead our great Nation in the future. 
   As a product of Catholic education, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I would like to recognize all Catholic Schools in the 13th Congressional District of New York: Academy of St. Dorothy, Blessed Sacrament, Holy Rosary, Immaculate Conception, Notre Dame Academy, Monsignor Farrell High School, Moore Catholic School, Mother Francciska, Notre Dame Academy Elementary, Our Lady of Good Counsel, Our Lady Help of Christians, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, St. Benedicta, Our Lady Queen of Peace, Our Lady Star of the Sea, Sacred Heart, St. Adalbert, St. Ann, St. Charles, St. Christopher, St. Clare, St. John Villa Academy, St. Joseph, St. Joseph by the Sea High School, St. Joseph Hill Academy, St. Joseph-St. Thomas, St. Margaret Mary, St. Mary, St. Patrick, St. Paul, St. Peter's Boys, St. Peter's Girls, St. Peter's Elementary, St. Rita, St. Roch, St. Sylvester, Seton Foundation For Learning, St. Teresa, Most Precious Blood, Fontbonne Hall Academy, Our Lady of Angels, Our Lady of Grace, Our Lady of Guadalupe, St. Anselm, St. Bernadette, St. Ephrem, St. Finbar, St. Frances Cabrini, St. Patrick School, Sts.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, I know the underlying legislation is very noble in the sense of its essence of cleaning and maintaining the wonder of our beaches and our coastal areas. And as someone who grew up and still has family in South Beach and Staten Island, New York, I'm very sensitive to the notion that our beaches are our Nation's jewels. 
   But I'm also very sensitive to the fact that there are terrorists among us who will use any way possible to destroy innocent life. I know all too full well that on September 11, 2001, when almost 300 of my constituents perished at the World Trade Center because of fanatics who flew two planes by now we know into the World Trade Center. So to me still the most important thing that this country can do is to protect innocent people. While we all enjoy the beaches, we know that the greatest threat we face in this country are those who want to kill us and do us harm. 
   We know that we've debated this FISA bill many times in this House, and the other body has passed, I think, a very effective bipartisan way that will keep this Nation safe. Here we are, another week going by where we bury our heads in the beach sand and not pass the appropriate legislation that will help to keep this Nation safe. 
   In the underlying legislation, it talks reasonably about monitoring and finding the source of the pathogens. Well, one of the biggest threats that we have, that any intelligence official will tell you, is bioterrorism that has its roots in the pathogens, whether it's waterborne or not. So I believe that the amendment is very germane to the underlying legislation. 
   Specifically, section 5, subsection A calls for the usage of rapid testing methods in the monitoring programs included in this legislation, which will create a means of assessing pathogen content in coastal waters and alerting the public to the possible health effects. 
   Additionally, section 2 provides for source tracking and identification programs to assess where these harmful pathogens originated from. 
   The legislation is concerned with pollution and monitoring of beach water quality, as well it should be, and to that end I am extremely alarmed that waste water treatment and pollution processing plants are becoming attractive targets for possible terrorist attacks. 
   The environmental damage to both the beaches and water quality of New York City would be catastrophic if such a threat were realized. Preventing such an attack, of course, is the greatest concern to me, and I would hope, all Members of Congress. 
   The amendment is clearly in order because it provides our Nation's intelligence community the tools to monitor foreign threats to our treatment facilities and prevent planned attacks on our environment. 
   The irony should not be lost here that today we are considering a bill that concerns beach monitoring and requires prompt Federal, State and local agency notification regarding water quality sampling, when we've yet to pass the long overdue legislation that updates our Nation's ability to indeed conduct foreign intelligence monitoring and requires prompt judicial notification requirements regarding foreign threats. 
   To that end, I call on the Chair today to recognize my amendment, which contains the bipartisan Senate-passed FISA language. It's time, as I mentioned before, that we stop burying our heads in the beach sand under the guise of doing what we think is noble. 
   At the end of the day, what we have to come together for in this body, whether it's this end of Pennsylvania Avenue or the other, is to keep this country safe. And as we know, intelligence officials tell us time and time again we're losing precious information that's intelligence that could ultimately lead to a prevention of a terrorist attack. One of those possible terrorist attacks is waterborne pathogens that would be covered under this legislation. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I ask that you consider this amendment to the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is designed to prevent the Department of Justice from enforcing a decision made recently by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Many of us know of the policy in China of forced sterilization and forced abortions, and this decision recently really ties into that. 
   As we also know, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 clearly stated that Chinese nationals are eligible for asylum if they're subjected to forced abortions or sterilization procedures in China.     
   A decade of Department of Justice policy has held that spouses or unmarried partners of those subject to brutal treatment are also eligible. 
   Recently in Lin, et al., v. The United States Department of Justice, the second circuit overturned years of that policy and previous judicial decisions allowing Chinese men to claim asylum if their wife or partner is subject to a forced sterilization in China. 
   Less than 1 month before the second circuit handed down their decision, the third circuit came to the exact opposite assertion in Jiang v. The Attorney General of the United States, where they clearly upheld the decade-old policy of the Department of Justice granting asylum to spouses of those physically harmed by China's policy. 
   The chilling effect of the second circuit's decision is already being felt in States covered by the second circuit. Just 1 day after the second circuit handed down its decision, an immigration judge in Manhattan was bound to order the removal of an individual because her claim of asylum was based on the fact that her husband was a victim of the forced sterilization. 
   The lady had three children in violation of China's barbaric population control policies, keeping the first two hidden from the government. Upon the  birth of her third child, the Chinese Government became aware of her violation of the law and came to her home to force her to undergo sterilization. Due to the complications from her third birth, the doctor was unable to perform the sterilization, so the government simply seized her husband and sterilized him. 
   The judge in her case was sympathetic to her story and indicated his wish to grant her asylum; however, he felt that his hands were tied by the second circuit's decision just 24 hours prior. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will include the entire story for the Record. 
   We also have heard from many immigration lawyers. In light of this decision, many immigration lawyers are actively recommending to their clients who are seeking asylum based on such inhumane treatment to leave the States covered by the circuit in order to avoid expulsion. 
   Chinese nationals make up the largest number of asylum seekers in the United States. Between 2000 and 2005, 35,000 of the 157,000 asylum seekers came from China. It is unclear how many were petitioning solely due to China's brutal population-control policies. 
   In her dissenting opinion in the second circuit case, Judge Sonya Sotomayor made the point well when she wrote, ``The majority clings to the notion that the persecution suffered is physically visited upon only one spouse. But this simply ignores the question of whom exactly the government was seeking to persecute when it acted. The harm is clearly directed at the couple who dared to continue an unauthorized pregnancy in hopes of enlarging the family unit.'' 
   To me it is clear that the effects of China's brutal forced sterilization procedures do not harm only the mother, but also the father, or vice versa. If the Second Circuit Court of Appeals can't recognize that, then I feel it is our responsibility to protect such asylum seekers either until there is a consistent national policy, or Congress considers a legislative remedy if necessary. 
   The second circuit's opinion, as we mentioned, recognizes the split. There are contrary decisions in the third, sixth, seventh and ninth circuits between 2002 and 2007. 
   Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the statement on Jiang Meijiao. 
   Statement 
   My name is Jiang, Meijiao. I was born on August 19, 1967 in Lian Jiang County, Fu Jian Province, P. R. China. I started school at the age of nine and stopped going to school after the second year of junior high. I stayed home to help with family chores afterwards. 
   My husband and I were junior high schoolmates. We held a traditional wedding ceremony on January 1, 1991. We were only allowed to have only one child according to the family planning policy because my husband belonged to city household and worked in a government work unit. 
   I found myself pregnant in early 1993. We wanted to have more children so I went to stay in my brother's home. I gave birth to a girl named Chen, Xi and another girl named Chen, Yu on September 18, 1993 and December 10, 1996 respectively with help of midwives in my brother's home. 
   I was pregnant again in October 1999 and during the late term of the pregnancy, I often experienced pain in my abdomen area. I dared not to seek medical examinations in hospitals so I went to a private doctor but was refused treatment by the private doctor. The private doctor suggested that I should go to a hospital. In the morning of June 12, 2000, around four o'clock in the morning, my water broke. My husband rushed to locate a midwife for help. When the midwife learned about the frequent pain I had during the last phase of my pregnancy, she refused to deliver my child but urged us to go to the hospital. My husband had to take me to Fu Zhou City No. 1 hospital immediately. I gave birth to our third child, a son named Chen, Qi on June 12, 2000. 
   During the delivery of my third child, I had bled severely. I had to stay in the hospital for about a week. I was diagnosed with hysteromyoma and the doctor gave me medicine and injection as well. I was told to return to the hospital to check up half year later. 
   I brought my newborn baby to my mother's home to stay after being released from the hospital and left our two daughters to my brother and his wife to take care of. 
   On October 9, 2000, six family planning cadres came to my mother's home and forcibly taken me to Lian Jiang County Family Planning Service Station and when the doctor tried to perform the sterilization operation, they found out the leiomyoma in my uterus was too big and they dared not to continue with the operation. 
   The family planning cadres detained me at the family planning office and went to my husband's work unit. They took my husband to Fu Zhou No. 2 Hospital and sterilized him. I was released afterwards. We were fined 20,000 on February 3, 2002. 
   I came to the U.S. on April 11, 2001 and returned to China on October 3, 2001. I came to U.S. again on February 9, 2006.

   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Chairman, we are all on the same page as to the decision itself. The consequence of what we are trying to offer this amendment for is to delay the deportation that is already occurring in the second circuit. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York and I share the second circuit as members of the New York City delegation, but what we are trying to do is at least provide a stopgap measure. We know quite clearly that just 24 hours after this decision was reached, a young lady, and perhaps her whole family, will be sent back to China. We are looking for a consistent policy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to work towards a legislative remedy, but until that time, we are trying to keep people here who want to seek and enjoy the American dream.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Catholic Schools not only in my Home Congressional District of Staten Island and Brooklyn, but also the entire nation as we honored Catholic Schools Week from January 28-February 3, 2007. 
   America's Catholic schools educate nearly 2.5 million students a year, providing the nation's young men and women with a broad academic background emphasizing the lifelong development of moral, intellectual physical and social values. 
   Catholic school initiatives that reach out to disadvantaged young people have touched a diverse group of students who sometimes find themselves trapped in underachieving schools. It is not surprising to me that more than 27 percent of Catholic school students are from minority groups and nearly 14 percent are non-Catholics. Parents recognize the importance of a quality education and are willing to sacrifice to ensure their children have every opportunity to succeed in the world. 
   Catholic Schools Week pays tribute to the dedication, character, compassion, and values that embody Catholic education in this country. I believe it is important to recognize the outstanding contributions Catholic Schools make in our country today. Their commitment to the educational standards and values ensure our children will have the right moral framework to help lead our great Nation in the future. 
   I would like to recognize all Catholic Schools in the 13th Congressional District of New York: Academy of St. Dorothy, Blessed Sacrament, Holy Rosary, Immaculate Conception, Notre Dame Academy, Monsignor Farrell High School, Moore Catholic School, Mother Francciska, Notre Dame Academy Elementary, Our Lady of Good Counsel, Our Lady Help of Christians, OL Mount Carme/St. Benedicta, Our Lady Queen of Peace, Our Lady Star of the Sea, Sacred Heart, St. Adalbert, St. Ann, St. Charles, St. Christopher, St. Clare, St. John Villa Academy, St. Joseph, St. Joseph by the Sea High School, St. Joseph Hill Academy, St. Joseph-St. Thomas, St. Margaret Mary, St. Mary, St. Patrick, St. Paul, St. Peter's Boys, St. Peter's Girls, St. Peter's Elementary, St. Rita, St. Roch, St. Sylvester, Seton Foundation For Learning, St. Teresa, Most Precious Blood, Fontbonne Hall Academy, Our Lady of Angels, Our Lady of Grace, Our Lady of Guadalupe, St. Anselm, St. Bernadette, St. Ephrem, St. Finbar, St. Frances Cabrini, St. Patrick School, Sts. Simon & Jude, Visitation Academy, Xavarian High School, Xavarian Genesis Program.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   On October 6, 2005, New York City was once again the site of a potential terrorist attack, an apparent plot to hide bombs in baby strollers, briefcases, and packages and set them off in the city's subways. Unfortunately, New Yorkers who tuned in to the news that day for information received conflicting messages. 
   On one hand, local officials announced that a credible threat was aimed at the city's subway system; on the other hand, Federal officials downplayed the severity of the threat, even describing it as ``specific yet noncredible.'' 
   The incident in New York was not isolated. Just weeks later, Federal officials responded to a bomb threat in the I-95 tunnel in the Baltimore Harbor, a threat that local officials learned about from the news media. The information was either credible or not credible, but it certainly wasn't both. 
   I strongly support efforts by antiterrorism forces at the Federal, State, and local levels; but it disturbed me, and I am sure others, to watch the confusion that unfolded in these situations. 
   Where improvement is needed is how different levels of government interact with each other when terrorist threats are elevated. Everyone needs to be on the same page and, when credible threats occur, the public needs to be informed in a coordinated manner. In short, what is needed is a 911 call center for first responders. 
   To achieve that, my amendment works as follows: authorizing a study to be conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to identify the problems and the successes of terrorist threat information sharing among the different levels of government; 
   Recommends a formalized process for that sharing; 
   And authorizes centers of best practices spread throughout the country, and would allow local governments, State and others, to interact and to share that information. 
   Because not every city, as we know, can dedicate resources to developing advanced techniques to fight terrorism, the Centers for Best Practices would be on the front lines providing advice to every city and State in our Nation on the most effective strategies to protect their citizens from new attacks. 
   This amendment would ensure an enhanced level of coordination on communicating terrorist threats to the public. But while it comes to matters of national security, our government must speak with one voice, a knowledgeable voice that can provide accurate information to the American people. Government cannot send conflicting messages at such critical times. 
   Last year during debate of this bill, the House approved this amendment by voice vote; and I notice the gentlelady from California who is here, Ms. Harman, said it probably best. She said at the time, We not only need to share information better horizontally, a point we have been making in this committee and one of the reasons we set up the Director of National Intelligence, but we need to share it better vertically. Some of the best ideas are in our hometowns and some of the best people to try to keep us safe are in our hometowns. 
   I support the Fossella amendment. It will help us through the establishment of Centers of Excellence to develop best practices to share information horizontally and vertically, and give best information to those in our hometowns trying to protect us. 
   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is great, because in other countries, sometimes opposition candidates get put under house arrest. Here in this great institution we have the debate in plain view. And as has been mentioned repeatedly, there is just a clear distinction on how to solve this problem. 
   Personally, I think I speak for many, the AMT is a problem, and it is a problem for 52,000 people living in Staten Island and Brooklyn, many of whom, by the way, are small business owners, are those firemen and police officers and teachers who are working sometimes two, three and four jobs to put food on the table. We should abolish it. Abolish it once and for all, as has been suggested. 
   Put simply, this is a wolf in sheep's clothing. We know what it will do. This is the first installment on what will be the largest tax increase in American history. My concern is more than just being an American citizen here. My equal concern is what will it do to New York's economy. 
   People talk about how we are going to pay for firefighters and police officers. We know that this bill will punish investment, punish capital, kill jobs that in large part go to fund the salaries of those firefighters and police officers and teachers who do a great job every day. It is a clear distinction, a clear disagreement on where we are going. Kill this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to call attention to two provisions in this legislation, one in the manager's amendment and one in the underlying legislation passed in the Education and Labor Committee. The first provision allows colleges and universities to apply for a non-Federal matching grant for fire prevention technologies through an already established program via the Department of Education. These funds will be used to professionally install fire prevention devices in student housing, dormitories, and other buildings on campus. More people are alive today, we know, Mr. Chairman, because of fire detection, and this provision will help prevent fires in college housing and save many lives in the process. 
   We don't need to be reminded of, for example, Seton Hall University several years ago that had a devastating fire in one of the college buildings that resulted in student deaths. The last thing, I think, a parent wants to discover or hear is that their child was injured or, worse, killed in a fire while away at college. 
   The other provision was included in the manager's amendment with the help of Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon. The provision will provide colleges and universities with additional funds to acquire security cameras, intrusion detection sensors, and other technologies to protect students, faculty, and campus visitors. Allowing colleges and universities the opportunity to use these funds will provide the higher education community with a safer environment, again, one where parents can go to bed at night not worrying whether or not their children are safe so far away from home. 
   As we all have colleges and universities, chances are, throughout the country in our districts, whether St. John's University in Staten Island or Wagner College, we all know that this funding and these provisions will go a long way to help their campuses become more secure and more safe.

<DOCNO>Mr. FOSSELLA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FOSSELLA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be as brief as possible. If there is any issue that we all could come together on, despite the many disagreements that exist, is the notion that the American people should be as best protected as possible. I hope that this bill does just that. 
   At the outset, let me thank the chairman, and, in particular, my good friend, Peter King, for their tireless work in trying to advance this bill. Importantly, I thank the common sense of Peter King and his tenacity and persistence to ensure things like the John Doe provision remain part of this conference report, so I tip my hat. 
   The first part, a beneficial part of this program, is finally the UASI program has been authorized into law. At $850 million, I believe that this true threat-based funding formula will bring assistance to the first responders in high-threat areas such as New York City that they deserve. 
   Second, the bill resizes the Homeland Security Advisory System and makes improvements to information sharing between and among local, State and Federal officials, a goal I worked on with several amendments to the intelligence authorization bill for the last 2 years. 
   However, let me say I continue to be disappointed of the fact that the 9/11 Commission suggestions are not fully implemented here. Reducing the State minimums from .75 percent to .375 percent and then .35 percent is a step in the right direction but falls short of truly realizing the report's recommendation. 
   Earlier today we passed the farm bill. Farmers get the money. In homeland security, the cities that deserve and have the highest threat and the most vulnerabilities and the consequences should get the money. I think that's common sense. As a reminder, on page 396 of the 9/11 Commission report, states that the ``Homeland Security security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. ..... Federal Homeland Security assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing ..... Congress should not use this money as a pork barrel.''
