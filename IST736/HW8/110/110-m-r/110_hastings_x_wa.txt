   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate your getting this time. I appreciate my colleagues that are going to speak later. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue is about promises, because we live in the greatest country in the world where people make their decisions on who will govern them by the promises that they made. I would really like to emphasize the point that has been made several times by the distinguished ranking member and the gentleman from Florida, that process has consequences, because ultimately process turns into substance, it turns into laws, and, of course, that is what governs us.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentleman saying that. I note that that statement was made after the election. Presumably, there was a decision made that the campaign was about change, and so this statement was made after the election. 
   The statement that I have up here by the distinguished chairman now of the Rules Committee, LOUISE SLAUGHTER, was also made after the election. It says: ``It is our goal to use rules responsibly, opening up the workings of the House and using it to usher in the most honest and ethical Congress in history. An open process will mean that more commonsense legislation written in the national interest will get to the House floor and be voted on.''

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. We were promised this after the election, I remind my friend from California, this was after the election. 
   The reason for this is very obvious. The role of the Rules Committee is to funnel legislation so that every Member could have a possibility to be heard. We have 19 standing committees. Because we have two vacancies, there are 433 Members of the House today. We simply couldn't control this unless we had the standing committees doing their work. 
   Yet, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee this year is on track to rewrite more bills in the Rules Committee than we ever did during the 12 years that we were in control of Congress. They have done it with troops in Iraq. They did it with lobby reform. They did it with the farm bill legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a bit about the farm bill. I come from rural America. I was very much involved in that process as we are going forward. I recall very, very specifically that when the farm bill came out of committee, it came out of committee with strong bipartisan support. Yet, when we went to the Rules Committee the next day to report out a rule, there was a massive tax increase that was put on that farm bill. 
   I remember the distinguished ranking member, last year's chairman, of the Agriculture Committee, BOB GOODLATTE from Virginia, came to the Rules Committee and testified. He said, I felt betrayed by what went on, because he was not a part of that process. I know, I can speak to the bipartisan nature of how this farm bill was put together as it relates to the farm because there was a hearing in my district. There were four Republicans and four Democrats that showed up to this hearing last June, so this was a process in the making. Yet, at the last minute, all that process was thrown aside, and it was a broken deal. 
   It is bad because of what is happening. The policies that we have in place have potential detrimental effects to the farmers. The farm bill, I might add, expired at the end of September.     
   We put a 2-week extension on that. I suspect we will probably have to have another 2-week extension on that. It is not right, in a body of this size, to rewrite bills in the Rules Committee. 
   I want to follow up on my friend from Florida who talked about the SCHIP bill. That bill was enacted on a bipartisan basis in 1997. I supported that. It was part of a larger bill. That was probably the most egregious rewrite. We met at 1:00 in the morning, only had about an hour to look at what was in the bill, and there was a lot of rumors going around, but we met at 1:00 in the morning, a 500-page bill. 
   I got a heads-up from a clinic in my district that is physician owned that they would be out of business if this bill were signed into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. They said they would be out of a business because of a provision that related to the Medicare part that they added to the SCHIP bill as related to physician-owned facilities. This facility was put in place in 1940, 67 years ago, and yet the provision within this bill said that you could not have physician-owned hospitals. 
   I might add, Mr. Speaker, that this clinic in Wenatchee, Washington, covers an area the size of the State of Maryland. Now, if the idea is to expand health care, why would you potentially shut down a facility that covers the geographic size of the State of Maryland? 
   We went around and around with those that were testifying in favor of  this particular bill, and they first started out and said no, you're mistaken, that is not in the bill. But after discussions going on with my friend from Texas (Mr. Sessions) and me going back and forth, they admitted at nearly 3:00 in the morning that yes, that provision was in there, and it was intended to be in there.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. That is exactly right. It was done purposely. They first said we must be mistaken. But after probing and asking questions, they were essentially saying that you could not get any Medicare reimbursement if you were a physician-owned facility. 
   Now, I just don't understand what the motivation is behind that. But the point is, and we are obviously working on this because we don't want this to happen, but this is what happens when the process gets all messed up and you start rewriting bills in the middle of the night. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to point out those two examples. I think it's contrary to the promises that were made by the new majority and what they have carried out. I think that is something that needs to be talked about. 
   I want to thank the ranking member for putting this Special Order together so we can discuss these issues in an open manner.

Clearly, clearly they have a following in that community, or they wouldn't have survived in that competitive atmosphere unless there were people that wanted to go to that facility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this is an oppressive rule, written to restrict debate in the House and to strip away rights from the minority. 
   This rule makes in order four Democrat amendments and only three Republican amendments. This means that 80 percent of requested Democrat amendments were made in order, but just 33 percent, or one-third, of Republican amendments filed with the Rules Committee were made in order. Mr. Speaker, this isn't balanced. It's restrictive and not in the tradition of having an open debate on important issues. 
   Last night at the Rules Committee, Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank said that he supported allowing debate on an amendment relating to illegal immigration and legitimate concerns of ensuring that persons illegally present in this country do not benefit from the new Federal program created by this bill. 
   Rules Committee Democrats responded by making in order the least substantive, most meaningless and unenforceable immigration amendment possible. A Republican amendment by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite. of Florida had very clearly and explicitly made certain that anyone illegally present in this country cannot rent or buy a house from this new government program. That amendment was not made in order. Every Democrat on the Rules Committee voted to deny the House voting on this meaningful amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Democrat leaders aren't totally shutting down debate, they are giving the House window dressing instead of substance on important issues. Not content with blocking two-thirds of Republican amendments and restricting the opportunity of every Member of this institution to come to the House floor and offer amendments to improve, fix or alter this bill, House Democrat leaders went even further to shut down the minority, squelch dissent and take away their parliamentary rights. 
   Section 2 of this rule takes away the right of any Member of this House to make a motion that the House rise out of the Committee of the Whole and places it solely in the hands of the Democrat majority leader or the Democrat chairman of the Financial Services Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, the new majority promised to run the most open, honest House in history. Instead of keeping their promises to the American people, Democrat leaders are acting with impunity as they shed any semblance of openness, fairness or regular order. 
   I don't believe many of the freshmen Democrat Members who were elected in the last election came to Congress to block debate and prohibit Members from offering amendments on the House floor. Yet, Mr. Speaker, they have joined lock-step with Speaker Pelosi in stooping to a level of oppressive partisanship that far exceeds the sins of any previous Congresses. It's a shameful record that shatters the promise Democrat leaders made to the American people to run an open, honest House. 
   Mr. Speaker, all this is being done to pass a bill that would create a brand new, Big Government, $15 billion Federal program to buy, remodel, resell or rent thousands and thousands of houses across the country. Who will profit from this new $15 billion government program are the lenders who made the bad loans and then foreclosed on families who didn't make their mortgage payments. It's a bailout for home lenders that knowingly took risks. 
   It's terribly unwise and wasteful of taxpayer dollars to create a new government program that invites other lenders to take gambles on home loans because the American taxpayer will come along and wipe away their bad decisions. Mr. Speaker, why should American taxpayers be footing the bill for calculated mistakes made by others? Why should American taxpayers,  who are making their mortgage payments each month or who are paying rent, have to come along and fund billions of dollars to give away grants and zero interest loans for those who speculated, gambled and lost? Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not take this hit. 
   Now I recognize that this bill is titled the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and that its stated intent is to help rehabilitate neighborhoods in metropolitan cities and urban communities that have multiple foreclosed homes sitting vacant and empty. But, Mr. Speaker, why should rural and middle America be forced to have their tax dollars used to bail out lenders in big cities and urban areas? I believe, Mr. Speaker, we should work to find incentives for people to purchase these homes and improve these neighborhoods.     
   But we should oppose a new $15 billion spending program so the Federal Government can be involved in flipping houses or renting out homes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this oppressive rule and the bad underlying bill. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago Speaker  Nancy Pelosi promised Americans a Democrat plan to lower gas prices at the pump. Democrats have controlled Congress for 16 months but we have still not seen the plan. Meanwhile, the cost of gas has gone so high it is setting record after record. 
   Since Democrats took control of Congress in January of 2007, the cost of gasoline has gone up by more than 50 percent. In fact, the cost of gasoline has gone up more in 16 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years. 
   Despite Speaker Pelosi's promise of a ``commonsense plan'' to ``lower the price at the pump,'' this Democrat Congress has put forward no plan, taken no action, and passed no bills to lower gas prices. 
   It is time for the House to debate ideas for lowering prices and it is time for Democrats to reveal their promised plan. 
   By defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow any amendment to be made in order on the underlying bill that ``would have the effect of lowering the national average price of gasoline.''

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, on April 21, CNNMoneyline.com had a poll, and the things that Americans were most concerned about from a financial standpoint were: the cost of gasoline, 65 percent; the cost of food, 16 percent; the cost of health care, 13 percent; and the cost of housing, 6 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, that makes the case in my view for defeating the previous question so we can respond to the 65 percent of Americans who are concerned about the rising price of gasoline. This will give the House of Representatives an opportunity to debate ideas to reduce the cost of gasoline. So I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can consider this vitally important question for American families, for workers, truckers, small businesses, and for the entire economy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I want to thank my friend from Florida for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule as was described by my friend from Florida that allows not a single amendment to be offered on the floor of the House today and in opposition to the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill won't become law, and it shouldn't become law. Its priorities are all wrong. It won't lower gas prices; it is going to increase them. It totally ignores nuclear power as a non-emitting energy source. It totally ignores hydropower as a clean, non-emitting energy source. It raises taxes by unknown billions. And, Mr. Speaker, it gives a tax credit to people for riding their bikes to work. I am sorry, but gas prices and climate change aren't going to be fixed by making people ride their bikes to work. 
   This isn't a plan to make America energy independent and to free us from foreign oil. It is just a dream for the political left in this country. And let me repeat, Mr. Speaker, it raises taxes, it is anti-nuclear and anti-dams, it forces people out of their cars, and gives tax credits for riding their bike to work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to address an issue, the Secure Rural Schools issue. And you might ask, why do I want to address that issue, because it has nothing to do with energy. And that is a very good question. It has nothing to do with energy, but it is in this bill. It is another cynical way the Democrats have approached this issue. 
   Time after time this year, Democrat leaders have attached Secure Rural Schools to bills they know will never become law, like this bill, and blocked attempt after attempt to put it in bills that will become law. The way this bill is written, it abandons our rural schools and communities and it moves in the program. 
   Don't take my word for it. Just last Tuesday, Speaker Pelosi told the Oregonian newspaper in Portland, Oregon, during a visit to Portland that ``where we go from here is to see how we can phase this system out.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit the full text of the article for printing in the Record.  
   Pelosi Says Health Care Change Can Start Here  
   Oregon could become a leader in the drive to establish centralized computer health records for everyone who gets medical care, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday in Portland. 
   Pelosi, D-Calif., stressed the importance of records as a way to save billions of dollars in health care costs, reduce medical mistakes and ensure better care in rural communities. 
   ``Electronic records are essential to improving health care,'' Pelosi said. ``This is the future. I see Oregon taking the lead in that future.'' 
   Pelosi made her comments after holding a round-table discussion with a group of medical experts, hospital administrators and elected officials, including U.S. Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., and Gov. Ted Kulongoski. The discussion, held at Oregon Health & Science University's South Waterfront office tower, was closed to the media. 
   Pelosi's visit to Oregon was part of her ``innovation agenda,'' an effort to boost technological progress, such as more broadband access and alternative energy systems, and to increase the number of scientists, mathematicians and engineers coming out of U.S. schools. 
   At the same news conference, Kulongoski announced the state has received a $20 million federal grant to install broadband cable at rural hospitals and clinics throughout the state. The grant, from the Federal Communications Commission, would allow a doctor in a remote part of the state to send a digital MRI image to a specialist at OHSU Hospital, for example. 
   Kulongoski said the grant and Pelosi's initiative are part of a widespread movement toward better communication in the health care industry. He said he saw a recent study that showed savings of $1 billion in Oregon alone if electronic health care records were in place. 
   In Oregon, as with much of the country, recent attention on medical issues has focused on the escalating cost of health care and the rapidly rising number of uninsured or underinsured.  
   After talking to reporters for about five minutes, Pelosi answered two questions. One was about the trade-off between her goal of improved record-keeping and efforts to make health care more affordable to everyone. The other was on an unrelated topic: federal timber payments to Oregon counties. 
   Pelosi said the push for centralized medical records would not take away from efforts to give health coverage to millions of people who lack it. Medical experts say the ability to transfer records with ease is as important as other medical breakthroughs, such as new medicines or therapies, Pelosi said. 
   ``We're not talking about this as some kind of elitist thing for people who already have health care,'' Pelosi said. ``We're talking about it as essential.'' 
   Pelosi all but brushed off the question on timber payments. Oregon's congressional delegation has been pushing to keep federal payments to counties that used to receive millions of dollars from logging on national forests. 
   That program expired, although Congress passed a one-year extension this year. 
   ``Where we go from here is to see how to phase this system out'' over the next few years, Pelosi said Tuesday.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leaders of this House need to stop with these false promises regarding rural schools. Let's get serious. Let's keep the promises that were made, the full promise, not one that dwindles towards nothing. Let's get it done as relates to rural schools in a responsible way before the year ends and before this program expires.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, it is an unfortunate spectacle to see the leaders of this Congress manipulate the extension of unemployment benefits into a partisan weapon and a diversion from their failure to do anything about the skyrocketing price of gasoline and diesel. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want the American people to believe that Republicans are mean, uncaring and opposed to providing help to unemployed workers as they look for a job. 
   I am certain, Madam Speaker, that Democrat after Democrat will come to the House floor and attempt to paint this cartoon view of the world. But nothing, Madam Speaker, is further from the truth. It is Republicans who have been trying for weeks, months and years to overcome the near monolithic Democrat opposition to producing more American-made energy, which will increase the oil supply and lower prices at the pump to keep our economy working. The high cost of gasoline is affecting families, workers and businesses in every town in this country, and this Democrat Congress does nothing. 
   Let me state for the record that Republicans not only believe in the importance and value of unemployment benefits and that we support extension of benefits in times of needs, but that it was a Republican Congress and President that last enacted unemployment benefit extensions in 2003, and I supported and voted for those extensions. 
   Yet the liberal leaders of this Congress decided to bring an unemployment benefit extension bill to the House floor that purposely undermines the bipartisan, responsible manner in which extensions have been enacted for the past 27 years, going all the way back to 1981. Democrat leaders decided to change the rules and to do it while blocking every single Representative, Republican or Democrat, from being able to come to the floor of the House and offer their suggestions for improving unemployment insurance or better directing benefits to those Americans or those communities in our country that are most in need. 
   As written in this bill, Madam Speaker, Democrats have mutated the requirements for receiving benefits so that an individual could work for just 2 weeks and then get an entire year's worth of unemployment benefits. Madam Speaker, giving 365 days worth of benefit checks for having worked just 14 days violates most Americans' sense of fairness. There is a big difference between providing a leg up and giving a handout, and I think this bill crosses that line. 
   This bill also gives an extra 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to States where the unemployment rate is incredibly low, below 3 percent. Instead of focusing benefit extensions to where it is needed, this bill gives it to places where it is not. 
   As I said, Democrats have chosen to mutate the way unemployment benefit extensions have been done for the past 27 years so that they can try to score political points. But Democrats have also decided it is okay to break the promises they made to the American people in just the last election. 
   One of the promises that Democrat leaders spoke about the loudest and most often was their commitment to what is known as PAYGO, or pay-as-you-go. Under the promise made by Democrat leaders, a new rule was written in the House at the start of this Congress to prevent any bill from passing that wasn't budget neutral, that didn't offset new spending with spending cuts or tax increases. 
   Madam Speaker, Democrats are not keeping that promise on this bill. On this bill, they are waiving PAYGO rules. They are now saying that the PAYGO rule they wrote and the promise they made to the American people can be ignored whenever it is convenient or expedient. 
   Madam Speaker, my purpose in raising the issue of PAYGO rules being violated is not to use it as an argument against the extension of unemployment benefits, but to point out the broken promises and hypocrisy of the liberal leaders of this Congress. They claim it is okay to ignore PAYGO because American people pay unemployment insurance tax out of every paycheck, so it is the American people's own money that is paying for the bill. 
   Well, when it comes to income tax increases, that is the American people's money too. Yet it was just 2 days ago that the Democrat majority leader flat out declared that Americans will face billions of dollars of tax increases this year if expiring tax rates aren't offset by PAYGO rules. 
   Madam Speaker, the leaders of this House are using PAYGO to hold hostage tax relief legislation that would prevent 25 million Americans from having their taxes go up by an average of $2,000 next April to pay the AMT tax.     
   They are holding an extension of the State sales tax deduction hostage under PAYGO rules by requiring taxes to be increased so that the residents of sales tax States, like my State, can be treated as fairly and equally as residents of income tax States. For the leaders of this Congress, PAYGO is an excuse to raise taxes by billions of dollars, but PAYGO can be ignored when they mutate long-standing unemployment benefits to allow someone who works just 2 weeks, just 2 weeks, to get an entire year's worth of benefits checks. 
   This extension of unemployment benefits is labeled as an emergency, as an emergency, because unemployment rose from 5 to 5.5 percent last month. It's stated that this is the largest 1-month increase in two decades and so Congress must now pass legislation. This 1-month increase of 10 percent is justification for urgent, immediate action that this House and the Senate must clear all other schedules and vote to pass this legislation without delay. That's what has been said. 
   Where is the same level of urgency and need for immediate action on gas prices? Gas prices have gone up over 10 percent in the last month. Americans aren't just paying the highest gas prices in the past two decades, they are paying the highest prices ever, ever, recorded in the history of this country? Almost every day the price of gasoline sets a new record. 
   Since Democrats took control of Congress the price of gasoline has gone up over 75 percent. At the pace that prices are climbing, it may only be a matter of time until they have doubled, doubled, while this liberal Congress does nothing. 
   I absolutely agree that losing one's job is a painful experience and that it deserves the attention of Congress. But  the pain of filling up your gas tank is felt by every American, whether they just lost their job or not. The pain of skyrocketing gas prices is hurting all Americans, all Americans, yet this liberal Congress does nothing to help increase the supply of gasoline to lower prices at the pump. 
   Time after time Democrats have blocked real solutions for more American-made energy by increasing oil and gas production and refining here, right here, in America. America has billions of barrels of oil reserves and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, but Democrats insist on keeping it off limits. We are not allowed to make our own energy, and so the prices continue to climb. 
   How long will Speaker Pelosi and this liberal Congress refuse to act to increase supply and lower gas prices? How high do prices have to go before they stop blockading America from tapping its own resources? There were thousands of oil-drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that weathered two back-to-back Category 5 hurricanes, Rita and Katrina, and not one single rig ruptured. America has the resources and safe technology to produce oil for years, but Democrats refuse to allow it. 
   Eighty-six percent of congressional Democrats have opposed more American-made energy, while 91 percent of Republicans have supported producing more energy right here in our own country. If this Congress is serious about addressing economic pain, then they need to get serious about gas prices and stop blocking real solutions. 
   For months Republicans have tried to force this House, and for months Democrats have refused to act. Meanwhile, the price of gas and diesel just goes up and up and up. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Madam Speaker, the idea here is to take care of those that have lost their jobs by extending unemployment benefits. The idea is to get a bill to the President that he will sign. As the gentleman from Illinois said, this bill has been waiting now for 8 weeks before it has been brought to the floor, but the bill, in its present form, will not be signed because it has changed 27 years of bipartisan support on extending unemployment benefits. 
   So I think that we need to go back to the drawing board, if you will, and get a bill that we know that the President will sign. But more importantly, more importantly, we need to get our economy going again. And so it's time, in my mind, for the House to debate ideas for lowering gas prices to get the economy going again. 
   I'm going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that the House can consider H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses energy bill. By defeating the previous question, the House will still be able to act on the unemployment benefit extension bill, but the House will also be able to finally act on legislation that will create more American-made energy and jobs to increase the supply of gas by producing more gas and producing more gas here in our Nation. It will increase the supply and decrease the price at the pump. Skyrocketing prices need the attention of this Congress, and we've got to act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, it is imperative that the over 200,000 miners in the United States work in a safe environment. Tragedies in recent years have highlighted the need to improve mine safety. In an effort to improve mine safety and prevent future tragedies, I was pleased that in 2006 the Senate unanimously, and the House overwhelmingly, passed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act, which was signed into law. This comprehensive, overwhelmingly bipartisan law represented a significant step, the first in some 30 years, forward in improving mine safety. But, Madam Speaker, it's unfortunate that today Democrat leaders have put bipartisanship aside and brought forth a rule to allow the House to consider legislation that threatens to jeopardize, not improve, meaningful achievements and efforts currently under way. 
   The MINER law of 2006 is still being implemented, and to date, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has met all of its statutory deadlines in implementing the new law. However, Democratic leaders have chosen to bring forth the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, which ignores the progress that has been made, and further, provides no opportunity for stakeholder participation in the regulatory process and imposes unrealistic time requirements on employers. 
   In addition, it is concerning that this bill would allow technology to be placed in mines that has not been deemed ``intrinsically safe'' by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. This has the potential, Madam Speaker, to result in serious safety issues, such as maybe an explosion. 
   Another major safety concern is that this bill creates a two-tiered notification system in the event of an accident, with one set of reportable incidents being subject to be reported within 15 minutes and another set within an hour. Madam Speaker, current law requires a mine operator to call the Mine Safety and Health Administration within 15 minutes of a reportable incident or face a fine. This new confusing tiered system could potentially lessen protection to miners. 
   Lastly, this bill does not empower all miners to participate in the development of safety policies and procedures through the formation of safety teams. Currently, miners who are not part of a union can be prohibited from working with management to promote safety. Representatives Kline of Minnesota and Wilson of South Carolina will be offering a substitute amendment later to end this discrimination between union and nonunion employees. All miners should be able to have a say when it comes to their safety, and this bill fails to do that. 
   Before enacting additional legislation that could be counterproductive, Congress should allow current law to be fully implemented. Congress should also review the law first before dictating mine safety regulations that fail to advance safety, potentially threatens jobs, and impose over $1 billion in unfunded mandates on the mining industry. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, for the last several months, Republicans have highlighted the need to change the House rules in order to restore accountability and enforceability to the earmark rule. 
   Clearly, the rules are flawed when it comes to enforceability of earmarks. House Republicans believe every earmark should be debatable on the House floor, but time after time Members have been denied the opportunity to challenge earmarks during consideration of the rule and the bill. 
   Over the last several months, we have learned that the earmark rule does not apply when considering amendments between the Houses. This loophole has prevented numerous earmarks from being challenged in the energy bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program expansion legislation, and the omnibus bill, which contained nearly 9,000 earmarks, including at least 150 earmarks that were air-dropped in the bill at the last minute. 
   Madam Speaker, in October Parliamentarian John Sullivan sent a letter to Chairwoman Slaughter confirming that the current rules are flawed as they relate to earmarks. In his letter, he states the earmark rule ``does not comprehensively apply to all legislative propositions at all stages of the legislative process.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I will insert this letter from House Parliamentarian John Sullivan into the Record.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill provides more than $53.5 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2008, which is over 6 percent more than last year's enacted level.     
   While I support some of the increases in this bill that support our national priorities, such as counterterrorism and crime-fighting initiatives, I'm concerned that this bill falls in line with the spend now, tax later philosophy of the Democrat majority. This philosophy, as outlined in the Democrats' budget plan, puts each taxpayer on the path toward an average $3,000 increase in their Federal tax bill. This, once again, is another burden for the average taxpayer to bear. 
   Rather than prioritizing spending and making the tough choices, this bill aims to solve our Nation's problems by simply spending more money. This also ignores real threats to our security that must be addressed. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, one very serious problem that must be addressed before Congress adjourns next week, and that is changing current law so that our Intelligence Community has the tools it needs to monitor the telephone conversations of foreign terrorists physically located in foreign countries. 
   Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff earlier this month indicated that the United States remains vulnerable to another terrorist attack, and that recent chatter levels are near those levels prior to September 11, 2001. But because of our failure to respond to technological advances, current law ties the hands of our Intelligence Community since significant portions of our intelligence is being missed, intelligence that could prevent a future attack on our Nation. 
   If we expect our Intelligence Community to do everything in their power under the law to protect our Nation against a future attack, then we must give them the resources and tools they need to stay ahead of those who wish to harm us. 
   It is vital that we act immediately to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in order to clarify that the United States no longer will be required to get a warrant to listen to terrorists who are not in the United States. 
   Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. In order to clarify, change the law in order to clarify that the United States no longer will be required to get a warrant to listen to terrorists who are not in the United States. Each minute we wait to act, our Intelligence Community could be missing vital information, increasing our risk of another attack on U.S. soil. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the rule so that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act can be immediately modernized. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me talk about this process of defeating the previous question so we can take up the amendment regarding the FISA Act. 
   This does not slow down the process at all. I want to repeat that, Mr. Speaker; this does not slow down the process at all. It simply makes in order, with the appropriate waivers, to discuss the amendment that was described by Mrs. Wilson from New Mexico. 
   This is a very, very serious issue. It has been described by a number of people how important this is to our Intelligence Community. And by definition, it falls into the area of secure knowledge. But for those that are on the committees of jurisdiction, those that hear this on a regular basis, we need to act on it sooner than later. And we can act on it today without slowing down the process whatsoever by defeating the previous question, voting ``no'' on the previous question. 
   I will be submitting an amendment that will be made in order, with the appropriate waivers, and we can debate the issue. It sounds to me, Mr. Speaker, that there is strong bipartisan support in order to achieve this end that has been described. We have the opportunity to do it now. We ought to do it before the August recess. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. By defeating the previous question, we will give Members the ability to vote today on the merits of changing current law to ensure our Intelligence Community has the tools that they need to help protect our Nation from a potentially imminent terrorist attack. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text  of the amendment and extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule and urge my colleagues to oppose it as well. Mr. Speaker, this rule is the 39th closed rule the House will be considering this year. The Democrats have not just broken their promise to the American people to cooperate in an open and honest manner, they are actually doing it in a record-setting manner. In fact, this Democrat-controlled Congress has considered more than twice as many closed rules, twice as many, Mr. Speaker, as the previous Republican-controlled Congress did at the same point in the session. 
   So they didn't just break their promise, Mr. Speaker, they have shattered it. Most troubling of all is that this rule would prevent Representatives from offering amendments to adjust and alter the bill out of concerns directly affecting the districts and people that those Representatives were elected to represent. 
   The Celebrating America's Heritage Act authorizes $135 billion to be spent over the next 15 years for nine already established National Heritage Areas and six new National Heritage Areas. One of the new National Heritage Areas created in the bill is the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area, which includes land in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. Mr. Bartlett of Maryland and Mr. Goode of Virginia have expressed concerns that the land in the districts they represent is included in this new National Heritage Area and that this bill does not guarantee local residents will be allowed to participate in decisions affecting the area in their districts. If Congress is going to dictate how land is to be used, we must make sure that those who are directly affected by such designations are, in fact, supportive of the legislation. 
   I believe that all Members should be afforded an opportunity to have their voices heard on behalf of those they represent when their district is directly impacted. It was remarked yesterday in testimony before the Rules Committee by Mr. Young of Alaska, ``That is just good government.'' What he was referring to obviously was to have a Member talk about issues that affect their district. Unfortunately, if adopted, this 39th closed rule of the year will deny Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Goode and, in fact, all Members of the House, the opportunity to bring forth their concerns to attempt to amend--to perfect this bill. Although National Heritage Areas typically do not create additional Federal lands, the Federal Government can significantly impact the use of the land in and surrounding National Heritage Areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, coming from an area in my area in central Washington that is 40 percent federally owned, I want to take this opportunity to discuss my concerns with future actions that could lead to additional Federal lands. As I have said many times before on this floor, I believe Federal land management agencies simply have too much land to manage effectively. Federal land agencies continue to struggle to maintain trails and facilities on public lands as well as to manage unnaturally high fuel loads that can lead to catastrophic wildfires. We had that discussion on the previous rule; yet, year after year we are spending precious tax dollars to buy up more private property to take off local tax rolls. 
   There are far more pressing issues affecting public lands management that  we could be considering today. For example, Mr. Speaker, we should be discussing the extension of payments to forested counties for rural schools and roads or for development of clean energy on public lands. These are far more pressing issues, and they are not going to go away. I believe the House should act quickly in a bipartisan manner to address them. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a closed rule, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. In closing, I would like to read a quote from the distinguished majority leader (Mr. Hoyer) from Congress Daily PM on December 5, 2006, a little more than 10 months ago. He said, Mr. Speaker, ``We intend to have a Rules Committee that gives opposition voices and alternative proposals the ability to be heard and considered on the floor of the House.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the distinguished majority leader said that a little bit more than 10 months ago. Unfortunately, the Democrat majority is once again not living up to the promises they made to Americans just less than a year ago. We are shutting out the people and the Representatives who are directly impacted by this legislation with this closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote against this, the 39th closed rule of the year. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past several weeks, my colleagues on the Rules Committee and I have highlighted loopholes in the House rules related to earmark transparency. While this is an important issue that still must be addressed, there is still a more pressing issue that the House must act on immediately. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has now been 130 days, 130 days, since the veterans funding bill was approved by the House. The Senate passed a similar bill. Mr. Speaker, contrary to what was said in the debate in the last bill, the Senate has appointed their conferees over 6 weeks ago. Sadly, the Democrat leadership in the House has refused to move forward on this bill and name conferees and instead has chosen to put partisanship and politics ahead of ensuring our veterans' needs are met. Every day the Democrats choose not to act to move this bill forward, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million. 
   Last week, Republican Leader BOEHNER took a positive step toward naming House Republican conferees. Now, Speaker Pelosi must follow suit and take the steps necessary to ensure that work can begin on writing the final veterans funding bill that can be enacted into law. 
   I might add, Mr. Speaker, this is one of those bills that enjoys strong bipartisan support. It is troubling to me that Democrat leadership chose to consider a simple resolution today supporting and encouraging greater support for Veterans Day each year, but thus far, has refused to demonstrate meaningful support for our Nation's veterans by working on this final funding bill. Our veterans, and all Americans, want us to put partisanship and politics aside and work together to do what is in the best interests for our Nation's veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I see no better time than right now. Therefore, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately act to go to conference with the Senate on H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill and appoint conferees. 
   The amendment to the rule I am offering would allow the Speaker to declare a recess for the purpose of consulting with the minority leader prior to the appointment of conferees. Further, it would provide that the motion to instruct conferees otherwise in order pending the appointment of conferees instead shall be in order only at a time designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule within 2 additional legislative days after adoption of this resolution. In other words, Mr. Speaker, we can act on this as quickly as we possibly can. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House will send a strong message to our veterans that they have our commitment to write a final bill providing them the funding and increase they need, deserve and were promised. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee heard testimony nearly 2 weeks ago from my good friend and colleague from Washington, Subcommittee Chairman Norm Dicks and the Ranking Member Todd Tiahrt of Kansas. When they appeared before the Rules Committee, concerns were raised that the bill at that time did not include a list of earmarks or earmark sponsors and that no Member could challenge, discuss, and call for a vote on earmarks on the House floor. 
   Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, Republicans succeeded in forcing the Democrat majority to restore the earmark transparency and enforceability rules that they had changed at the beginning of this Congress, and now spending bills are being brought to the floor with earmarks where they can be discussed, debated, and voted upon, as they should be. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the fiscal year 2008 Interior and Environment Appropriations bill that we will consider today contains a list of earmarks and the names of the sponsors of those earmarks. This means that Members will have the opportunity to review them before casting their vote on the House floor and not just see them added months from now, as was previously tried. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Central Washington area that I represent covers more than 19,000 square miles, much of which is controlled and managed by the Federal Government. The Federal agencies funded in this bill directly impact those that I represent on a number of levels. When storms and mudslides wipe out trails and roads, it affects not only my constituents that enjoy camping, hiking, and hunting on public roads, but also visitors to the area and the local businesses that rely on tourism. When invasive species, plant pests, and wildfire threats are not adequately controlled on Federal land, the problems do not stop at the property line. 
   I think I speak for many Western Members of the House when I talk about the huge stake we have in the general direction of the agencies funded under this bill. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that at a time when Federal land agencies struggle to manage the land they now have, this Congress would provide tens of millions of dollars for the Federal Government to buy up more land. This takes private property off the tax rolls and leaves county governments with a heavier burden to pay for emergency services, roads, and schools. 
   I have stood on this floor before to discuss the importance of another program, the Secure Rural Schools program, which compensates local governments that are negatively affected by Federal forest land policy and ownership and the virtual shutdown of the Federal timber program over the last 15 years. We need to get the Secure Rural Schools program reauthorized and we need to get the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program fully funded for the long term before we start spending millions of dollars adding more and more land to the Federal estate. 
   Finally, I want to express my concern about the overall increase in spending that this bill represents. I know that the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member worked very hard to try to manage the many demands for funding under this bill. However, this bill represents a $680 million increase over last year. As I have said previously with respect to other appropriation bills this year, we simply must rein in spending in order to prevent the massive tax increases that the Democrat majority is poised to impose, as reflected in their budget. 
   Congress must work for balancing the Federal budget in 5 years. There are two ways to balance the budget, whether it is your family budget or the Federal budget. You can either, one, reduce the amount of money being spent or, two, increase the amount coming in. This bill highlights the Democrat majority's allegiance to option number two: spending more money each and every year and at a rate faster than inflation, while relying on tax increases to balance the budget down the road. 
   Mr. Speaker, we don't need a bigger Federal Government. We need a balanced approach that holds the line on spending; provides for our Nation's most fundamental priorities; and allows taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money to spend, save, and invest as they see fit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Washington, the chairman of the subcommittee. 
   As the chairman is aware, I have been concerned for some time with the issue of Federal land acquisition due to its effect on local tax rolls. Many of the counties that I represent are heavily federally owned. Some of them have strong reservations about Federal land acquisition. 
   I would like to say a word or two specifically about the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. As the chairman knows, I represent the northeastern part of the scenic area. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic River Act, passed by Congress in 1986, authorized $40 million for land acquisition, $10 million for economic development grants, and $10 million for recreation grants for the scenic area. I am concerned that even though it has been 20 years since the Act was passed, the economic development and recreation accounts have yet to be fully funded. Meanwhile, the Forest Service has spent more than $55 million on land acquisition in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. I believe we should make it a priority to fund the economic development and recreation accounts as envisioned under the Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to Chairman Dicks for his comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this is an unfair rule making in order, in my view, a bad bill, and a poor way to run the House of Representatives. It is claimed by this legislation's proponents that it is just an attempt to write into Federal law a new BLM, Bureau of Land Management, land management scheme that was invented by then-Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt.     
   It is the weakest of justifications for passing legislation and an abdication of responsibility for the legislative branch, for this Democratic Congress, to argue that we have to pass this bill to authorize what the last Democratic President created by fiat. Yet the harm to the powers and responsibilities of the House and our public lands is far greater. 
   This bill simply doesn't write into law the national landscape conservation system that Secretary Babbitt created, because this bill is written so poorly and loosely that it actually gifts the authority of the Congress over to the political appointees and career department bureaucrats in the Interior Department. 
   Vague words such as ``values'' are left undefined by this bill. It is the job of the Congress to define terms and write bills plainly and clearly. Not doing so gives away the power to these presidential appointees and career bureaucrats. When the elected Congress doesn't do its job, the unelected agencies and departments are free to impose their opinions and philosophy as laws and regulations. 
   With the faults and deficiencies of this bill so obvious, it was no surprise that last night 28 amendments to improve this legislation were filed with the Rules Committee, and with the Democratic track record of shutting down debate in this Congress, it was certainly no surprise when the Democratic Rules Committee blocked 19 of these amendments and denied representatives an ability to come to the floor and have a debate and a vote on their proposals. 
   My dear friend from Florida noted that the rule makes in order two Democratic amendments and six by Republicans, but I must point out that this means that every amendment offered by the Democrats were made in order, but 19 were not allowed to be made in order that were sponsored by Republicans. 
   Many relevant and constructive amendments were shut down by the Democratic Rules Committee. These include amendments to ensure the ability for wind and solar energy production on these public lands, to require that the Federal Government fully fund payments in lieu of taxes to local governments before spending new funds on landscaping, to ensure that there is no net loss of off-highway recreation areas and boating access facilities, to protect existing grazing rights, to ensure that hunting, fishing, recreational shooting and other current uses can continue on BLM lands and to require that the privately owned property of American citizens are not included in the NCLS without the written consent of the owner. 
   When the Rules Committee blocked these amendments, they acted to put the decisions in the hands of the Interior Department. This bill is a threat to the ability of citizens to enjoy and use their public lands. Democrat leaders won't even permit Members of the House to vote on whether Americans will be able to continue to ride, boat, graze livestock, shoot, hunt or fish on the lands that they can use today. This Congress says to Americans that their private property rights are not certain, that these rights and their land is at risk subject to the whims of the Interior Department. 
   That Democratic leaders are shutting down debate on this bill is truly not a surprise, but it is a broken promise. When the new majority took control after the 2006 elections, they promised to run the most open House in history. Unfortunately, they have not kept this promise. 
   In fact, the Democratic majority has set a historic record of the most closed rules in the history of the House, and they have already done that in record time. They have shut down debate on the House floor more than any other majority ever. 
   Why have they done so? It certainly isn't because of the tremendous accomplishments of the 110th Congress. The list of items not done, overdue bills and unfinished business of this House is long and growing longer. 
   For example, House Democrats have refused to pass the bipartisan Senate bill to protect our country by modernizing the 1970-era FISA law to monitor foreign persons in foreign places. Another example is the farm bill that expired last September, and America's farmers have been left waiting for months and wondering when this Congress will act. 
   Another is fixing the Medicare payments to doctors so that they can keep caring for seniors. Another is passing funding for the war on terrorism. The new No Child Left Behind act awaits renewal later this fall. Also the Secure Rural Schools Act desperately needs to be passed to keep the Federal promise made to rural communities whose hospitals and schools are at risk. 
   The State sales tax deduction expired last December for those States that don't have a State income tax like Washington and Florida. With the deadline just 6 days away, the new majority has yet to create a final budget outline for the next fiscal year. 
   The House isn't working on these national priorities, but last week the Rules Committee went so far as to pass a rule to restrict debate and permit only three amendments on legislation to renew the Fire Administration. 
   The end result of this closed process was that all three amendments passed by a voice vote and the bill passed this House by 412-0. Hardly a controversial bill, but under the closed process we are left with that example of how this House is being run. 
   With the House neglecting its work and not acting on these priorities, we have a lot of free time on our hands, to which the new majority leaders respond by shutting down Republicans from being allowed to offer amendments on even the most noncontroversial bills, like last week and what we will take up this week. 
   This is an unfair rule on a poorly written bill that threatens each and every American's ability to recreate, use and enjoy their public lands. It puts citizens' private property rights at a real risk.  
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, to oppose the bill and insist that the House get to work on the important business this Congress is thus far failing to get done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I would just make this point: There are many times when amendments are filed by Members of this body and they do not come to the Rules Committee and their amendments are made in order, and that was the case, for example, of one of the amendments that was made in order by a Democrat Member last night. Those things do happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, this is a restrictive rule that prevents Members of this House from offering amendments to try and improve the poorly and loosely written underlying bill. 
   As has been said several times, 19 amendments were blocked by the Rules Committee. This rule does not allow the House to debate amendments to protect American's current ability to enjoy these BLM lands through fishing, riding, hunting, and boating. 
   But even more egregious is that this rule blocks the House from voting on an amendment to protect private property rights of American citizens. As Representative Bishop has pointed out, and he had filed an amendment to the Rules Committee, it was amendment No. 13, that would have simply directed the Secretary of the Interior not to include private property within the National Landscape Conservation System without the written consent of the landowner, and this deals with the issue of in holdings, as Mr. Bishop mentioned. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a fair amendment. It is an important amendment. It seeks only to protect the private property rights of American citizens. The Rules Committee should not have blocked his amendment from being made in order and let Members vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on that amendment. 
   So I am going to give, Mr. Speaker, Members an opportunity to support or oppose private property rights by asking Members of the House to defeat the previous question on the rule. By defeating the previous question, I will seek to amend the rule to allow Representative Bishop to offer his private property rights amendment No. 13. By voting ``no'' on the previous question, Members are voting to respect and protect the private property rights of all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to House Resolution 157 and the underlying resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation is engaged in a Global War on Terror, a war that we did not seek, but a war that was brought to our shores on September 11, 2001. Today, we fight an enemy without borders that is determined to destroy our Nation by any means necessary. An al Qaeda leader said that they have the right to ``kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children, and to exile twice as many and wound and cripple thousands.'' 
   The President of Iran has called a world without America and Israel ``possible and feasible.'' 
   It is also undeniable that Iraq is the central front on the war on terror. But you don't have to take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. The terrorists themselves have told us it is so. Al Qaeda's deputy leader has repeatedly said that Afghanistan and Iraq are the ``two most crucial fields'' in the Islamists' war. In a letter he said that expelling Americans from Iraq is the first step in expanding the jihad wave. 
   If this, Mr. Speaker, is what the terrorists are telling us, why should we not believe them? 
   As much as I wish that our troops were home, I recognize that arbitrary pulling out of Iraq would provide a sanctuary for terrorists and have serious consequences for our U.S. security. A self-sustaining government there is critical to our security here. 
   I share the frustration of all Americans who had hoped that the Iraqis would be protecting and governing themselves by now, but that simply is not the reality. Previous strategies to stabilize Iraq have not succeeded and things cannot continue as they have been. In order to succeed, Iraqis must step up and take responsibility for their own security. And under the new strategy, Mr. Speaker, announced last month, they will be held more accountable in the future. 
   Some say this new strategy is wrong; yet they fail to say what is right. They  call for an arbitrary pullout yet have not answered the question ``what then?'' They seek to cut off funding for our troops yet offer no plan for fighting terrorists. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no easy answer. But simply declaring that we don't wish to be at war anymore does not make our enemies surrender. Withholding military personnel, failing to provide funds for our troops, or pulling out of Iraq with no plan to win the war on terror are simply not options. The consequence of failure is simply too dire. If we are defeated, Iraq will become a haven that our enemies will use to launch attacks against us. The Middle East will remain destabilized. Terrorists will fight us on our soil. And it will send a dangerous signal to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Syria, and embolden terrorists around the world. 
   The Baker-Hamilton Commission warned specifically against a precipitous withdrawal. They said: ``The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.'' 
   So our challenge, Mr. Speaker, is to insist on victory and not accept defeat. So, accordingly, I will not vote to deny our troops the support they need to protect themselves and America. 
   The nonbinding resolution before us today is contradictory on supporting the troops. On the first page it says we will continue to support the troops in Iraq, but on the next page it expresses opposition to sending reinforcements that our military says are needed to support our troops currently on the ground. 
   Mr. Speaker, how can you support the troops but not the mission? 
   Let me say again that I will not vote to deny our troops the support they need to protect themselves and America. What I would vote for, if given the opportunity, is a plan that would have the force of law, that would set benchmarks to measure progress, that would ensure that funding for our troops is not cut off, and that would keep Congress fully apprised so that they can make informed decisions. 
   In closing, I would just say that we must not forget the sacrifice that our troops are making. They are fighting the enemy abroad so that we will not have to fight them here. The bottom line is that this is about America and our security and a set of enemies who have said again and again that their goal is to destroy us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this closed rule and the underlying resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule. This closed rule provides for consideration of a bill to Federally recognize six new Indian tribes in the State of Virginia. This bill marks the first time in over 20 years that the House of Representatives has considered legislation to extend Federal recognition to a tribe. 
   While I will acknowledge Congress can grant Federal recognition to individual tribes, the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs has the administrative process by which a group may establish itself as an Indian tribe and become eligible for services and benefits extended to other tribes under Federal law.     
   While each of these six tribes have separately submitted a petition for recognition to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, none of the petitions are complete. Rather than wait for these petitions to go through the administrative process, the Democrat majority has decided to bring this legislation to the floor under a completely closed rule, which allows no input or improvements to be made to this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite commitments made by the Democrats for a new era of openness, the Rules Committee has only approved one truly open rule that allowed Members of Congress to come to the floor and offer amendments during consideration of a bill. House Resolution 377 is the 18th closed rule brought forth by the Democrat majority, which means that this is the 18th time the Democrat majority has shut Members of Congress out of the deliberative process. So I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I have no more requests for time, so I'll close. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would just suggest that the exchange that we have had here back and forth between the gentleman from Virginia and the gentleman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Florida begs to a process  that should be much more open. Clearly there are some issues that were raised. 
   My friend from Connecticut talked about the process and the fact that this may be bypassing the process. Maybe an open process would have allowed us to pursue that, but we don't have that opportunity. We have a closed rule dealing only with six tribes. I think that is significant. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as a majority member of the House Rules Committee in the last Congress, I just want to point out that nearly 16 percent of the rules by that committee in the last Congress were open rules and 84 percent were restrictive or closed. 
   Thus far in this Congress, the 110th Congress, only 2.5 percent of the rules brought forth by the new Democrat majority on the Rules Committee have been open, while a staggering 97.5 percent have been restricted or closed. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the trend we see before us today with yet another closed rule denying Members an opportunity to try to improve legislation does not continue for much longer. However, I must comment that I am more disbelieving with each restrictive and closed rule brought to the floor. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate my friend for yielding. 
   First of all, if there is a preprinting requirement, that means that once that deadline is done and debate starts on the floor, no one can come down and amend the rule. Therefore, it's a closed rule. 
   Secondly, I can't say for certain, but the exchange that we had down here, a very good exchange, may have brought forward some idea by a Member wanting to come down and at least discuss an amendment. We don't have that opportunity. That is simply the point that I am making. This is a closed rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, most Americans, including some Members of Congress, had never heard of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, that is, until the proposed purchase of commercial operations of six U.S. ports by the Dubai Ports World, a company controlled by the United Arab Emirates. 
   After reviewing the way in which the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States operates, it became clear that we must revamp the process by which foreign investments are examined for any effect that they may have on national security. The House acted and passed legislation last year, but, unfortunately, differences with the Senate were not resolved. That is why we are here again today to consider the bipartisan National Security FIRST Act, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends on the majority for bringing to the floor a bill that mirrors legislation championed in the last Congress by Republican whip Mr. Blunt, the National Security FIRST Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a unanimous vote last year of 424-0. 
   This underlying bill would for the first time establish in law the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is currently a creation of a 1975 executive order. It would require the committee to increase its scrutiny of foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets whenever the transactions involve firms owned by foreign governments. The bill would also enhance congressional oversight of the committee by ensuring that leaders of both parties in Congress are briefed on investigative results before the committee completes its reviews of the takeover bids. 
   Following the tragedy of September 11, 2001, protecting our homeland must be a top priority for Congress. We face no greater challenge than protecting Americans from an enemy without borders that we all know is determined to destroy our Nation by any means necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is vital that we act to revise and review the investigative process for foreign investment activities that may affect our national security. In the wake of the Dubai Ports World controversy, the current foreign investment process lacks confidence, predictability, and reliability, trademarks, I might say, of the U.S. securities markets. 
   The underlying bill, the National Security FIRST Act, restores confidence, predictability, and reliability while continuing to encourage foreign investments and preserve the over 5 million American jobs that foreign investment supports in the United States. 
   In my home State of Washington, Mr. Speaker, U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies play a vital role in supporting jobs, employing over 83,000 Washingtonians. This bill has been carefully balanced so as not to discourage these important investments. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this open rule, and I hope this will not be the last open rule that we have providing for consideration of legislation impacting our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the small business programs covered by this bill are almost totally without their critics; they enjoy widespread bipartisan support. But, Mr. Speaker, there is controversy and opposition to this legislation because of the manner in which Democrats have chosen to conduct the business of this House. 
   First, there are concerns expressed about the increased set-aside for these two programs, which will come at the cost of other important research. Concern and opposition of this bill has come from the head of the Small Business Administration, from the White House, and from the Association of American Universities, among others, which represents 60 leading research universities across the country. 
   Typically, there would be an opportunity to address these types of concerns through committee action before any bill comes to the House floor. But the Democrats have chosen to skip past a hearing of the full House Science Committee on this scientific research legislation. They're just bypassing that step and sending it here to the House floor, where the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee decided to further restrict action on the legislation by limiting the number of House Members who can offer amendments, and they just limited it, Mr. Speaker, to just 17 out of 432 Members in the House. 
   Now it is true that my Democrat friends on the Rules Committee have allowed some amendments to be offered on this bill, but they have certainly treated themselves very well. Under this rule, Democrat members of the Rules Committee get to offer one-third of the amendments allowed to the entire House. Out of the 17 amendments that would be made in order under this rule, the Rules Committee Democrats get six of them. But under the rules that the Rules Committee wrote, 415 Members will not be allowed to offer even one amendment. 
   Restricting debate on the House floor is really becoming an old habit for the new Democrat majority, the new Democrat majority that pledged to run a more open, bipartisan House when they won the election in 2006. The Democrat majority has not kept their promise to the American people and have instead passed more closed rules denying all amendments on the House floor than any Congress in history, and they did it in record time. 
   Despite this record of shutting down debate in the House, the new majority has failed to complete its work and address matters critical to American families, small businesses and the economy. They failed to meet last week's April 5 deadline to write a budget for the next fiscal year, for example. The current farm bill ended last September, and our farmers are still waiting for that bill to be finished. 
   House Democrats have refused to pass the Senate's bipartisan bill to modernize FISA and to protect our country. Vital tax relief is set to expire while Democrats propose the largest tax increase in American history. Families, workers and small businesses don't need a record tax increase, Mr. Speaker, and they can't afford the plans to cut the child tax credit in half, reinstate the marriage penalty, and raise rates on every single taxpayer. 
   While Democrats plot these record-breaking tax increases, they sit by while the price of gasoline rises to record levels. Since Democrats took control of Congress in January of last year, the cost of a gallon of unleaded gas has gone up by 50 percent. According to the AAA, the national average for regular unleaded gasoline has gone up $1.18. The cost of gas has gone up more in 15 months, Mr. Speaker, than it had gone up in the prior 6 years. 
   Two years ago tomorrow, on April 24, 2006, House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, then the Democrat minority leader, issued a press release claiming that House Democrats ``have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' This was 2 years ago tomorrow, Mr. Speaker. Two weeks after that press release, then minority leader Pelosi said that Democrats have ``real solutions'' that would ``lower the price at the pump.'' That was 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker, just less than 2 years ago. But now they've controlled the House for over a year, yet the ``real solutions'' and the ``commonsense plan'' promised by Democrats are nowhere to be seen. They pledged to lower gas prices, and they've done nothing; gas prices keep climbing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's time for Speaker Pelosi to reveal the Democrat plan and for this House to be allowed to consider ways to address the rising price of gasoline. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that I can amend the rule to make in order any amendment to the underlying bill that would ``have the effect of lowering national average gas price per gallon of regular unleaded gas.'' This House can then debate the rising cost of gas and we can have that debate, Mr. Speaker, by defeating the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I will insert into the Record both Speaker Pelosi's 2006 press release and a letter sent yesterday from Republican leaders to Speaker Pelosi asking for the Democrats to put forward the commonsense plan that they had promised. 
   Pelosi: `With Skyrocketing Gas Prices, Americans Can No Longer Afford Rubber Stamp Congress' 
   Washington, DC.--House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today on President Bush's, Speaker Hastert's, and the Republican Congress' empty rhetoric on gas prices. Key facts on the Majority's failure to address gas prices follows Pelosi's statement. 
   With skyrocketing gas prices, it is clear that the American people can no longer afford the Republican Rubber Stamp Congress and its failure to stand up to Republican big oil and gas company cronies. Americans this week are paying $2.91 a gallon on average for regular gasoline--33 cents higher than last month, and double the price than when President Bush first came to office. 
   ``With record gas prices, record CEO pay packages, and record oil company profits, Speaker Hastert and the Majority Congress continue to give the American people empty rhetoric rather than join Democrats who are working to lower gas prices now. 
   ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices by cracking down on price gouging, rolling back the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, tax breaks and royalty relief given to big oil and gas companies, and increasing production of alternative fuels.'' 
   Key Facts on the Majority's Failure to Address Gas Prices: 
   President Bush, Speaker Hastert and the Majority Congress wrote and passed a Republican energy bill that President Bush's own Energy Department said would raise gas prices on American consumers. Big oil and gas companies wrote the Republican energy bill, and the American people paid the price. 
   The Majority rejected imposing tough penalties on price gouging companies three times in the past year, since that time, gas prices increased by another 11 cents a gallon.  
   Speaker Hastert and the Majority have been blocking action on Congressman Stupak's Federal Response to Energy Emergencies Act (H.R. 3936) since last September, which would protect American consumers from high gas prices by empowering the FTC and the DOJ to investigate and prosecute oil companies engaged in price gouging at each stage of the energy production and distribution chain and outlaws market manipulation.

   Two points: 415 Members of this House are denied an opportunity to offer an amendment because this is a structured rule, number one. 
   Number two, I would hope that my friend from Oregon would join me in voting to defeat the previous question because he has a view on why gas prices are high. If we have an open debate on that, he'll have his opportunity to make that argument and perhaps offer legislation that would lower the price of gasoline. That is precisely what I'm going to be asking my colleagues to do in defeating the previous question so they'll have that opportunity. I hope the gentleman will join with me in that regard.

   Two years ago, Speaker Pelosi promised Americans a Democrat plan to lower gas prices at the pump. They  have controlled Congress for 15 months, but we still have not seen this plan. Meanwhile, the cost of gas is setting record highs. 
   Under their leadership, the national average price of gas has increased by $1.18. It is time for the House to debate ideas for lowering gas prices. It is time for the Democrats to reveal their plans. 
   Mr. Speaker, by defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow any amendment be made in order on the underlying bill that would, quote, have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, along with my colleagues from Washington State, to pay homage to our friend and colleague who passed away last Thursday, Jack Metcalf. 
   Jack Metcalf represented the Second District of Washington from 1995 to 2001, and I have known Jack personally since 1968. I first met Jack when he first ran for the U.S. Senate. I was contacted by some people, and they said that he was coming into town and asked if I would meet with him, which I did, he ended up spending the night at my house and slept on the couch. 
   I only say that from background because that was typical of Jack. He was totally unpretentious. In fact, his history, electoral history, as a representative of northwest Washington goes back for many years. He first ran for office in 1958, unsuccessfully, I might add. Two years later he ran and was elected to the State legislature and served there for two terms and left. Then he got elected as State senator and served for 8 more years as a State senator, and left to run for the U.S. Senate again, and got beat and then came back and served as a State senator for 12 more years. He left that time to run again unsuccessfully for the U.S. House. But he was successful when he ran in 1994. 
   I point that out because that was four times that he ran for office in an endeavor to serve his constituents of northwest Washington. And it never bothered him, at least he never said it to me, that he was unsuccessful in the past. In fact, after he had lost in 1992 and was contemplating running in 1994, he was approached by the then Republican Central Committee chairman and suggested that maybe Jack ought not run because he was 68. And Jack replied to him, ``Well, I think I can win.'' And I can just hear Jack say that because that was so typical of him. He was totally unpretentious. 
   So I am here simply to say that he was a friend for many, many years. He was somebody that served his constituents well, and he was somebody, I think, that was really very, very true to his beliefs. And I think that is an asset that a lot of people probably don't have, but certainly Jack did. And I am very, very proud to have called him a friend for all these years. 
   And I can say that our thoughts and prayers are with Norma and his family, and he will be greatly missed. 
   With that I would like to yield to the individual that succeeded him in the Second District, my friend from Washington (Mr. Larsen).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, Federal law bans job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, or gender. In addition to Federal law, 11 States have passed laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, while another eight States bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would extend Federal employment discrimination protections to employees on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose discrimination in the workplace, and I believe that skills and job performance are essential for determining whether employees are hired, promoted, or dismissed. However, I do not think it is the place of the Federal Government to legislate how each and every workplace operates. As a former small business owner, I know that what brings success  to one company does not necessarily bring success to another. 
   As I mentioned, a number of States have enacted State laws in this area. That is their right as States. Many small businesses and large corporations have chosen to adopt their own policies. That is appropriate as well, Mr. Speaker. This bill as written, though, raises a number of concerns, including that it would expand Federal law into a realm where perception, Mr. Speaker, would be a measure under discrimination law. 
   On Monday, my colleagues on the Rules Committee and Members testifying before the committee pointed out that debate on the bill, at least in committee, had been productive and a respectful one. Mr. Speaker, I am truly disappointed that moments later, the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee chose to report out a rule that denies the House and the American people the opportunity for a full and fair debate by prohibiting 99 percent of the Members of the U.S. House the opportunity to come to the floor and offer amendments. 
   For the last 2 weeks, Democrat leaders have had the opportunity to amend, alter, and change this bill. This editing and rewriting has been done behind closed doors and is contained within the Miller-Stupak amendment. Democrat leaders have acted to deny a public debate and to deny Republicans the opportunity to offer an amendment similar in scope to the Miller-Stupak amendment. This is not an open and honest way to run the House, and it is not what Democrat leaders promised the American people only a year ago. 
   This rule only makes three amendments in order, Mr. Speaker, but buried in this rule there is a special provision, a special provision, that allows amendment No. 3 in the report of the Committee on Rules to be withdrawn by its proponent before the question of adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, what does this mean? It means that the Rules Committee decided to make three amendments in order but denies the House a vote on one of those amendments. I just have to wonder why the Democrat Rules Committee is denying a vote on this amendment. My friend from Florida was up there, and I would yield to the gentlewoman from Florida if she can tell me why this provision is in the bill to deny the House a vote on amendment No. 3. 
   I would yield to my friend if she would explain this for me.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for giving me that option. I can't remember how many times I have been in the Rules Committee talking about and asking Members who come forward with potential amendments what their choice would be, would they like to have an open rule or would they like to have a closed rule. And every time I hear, at least from the members of the Rules Committee, that the Rules Committee will decide. 
   Now, it sounds in this particular case that one Member decided that she didn't want a vote on it, so we deny everybody in the House an opportunity. The gentlewoman said that she would like to be able to vote on this. I will give her the opportunity to do so. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say I have served on this Rules Committee for a decade, and I cannot recall one instance when Republicans were in control that a rule allowed a Member to bypass House Rules and withdraw an amendment. I believe it is wrong for a substantive legislative issue to be raised on the floor only to deny Americans, through their representatives, a voice on that amendment. 
   Let's be clear about what is happening here. And that is that the rules of the House are being altered to block the House from voting on this amendment. It is clear and simple. We were elected to represent our constituents by casting a vote and votes, and today Democrat leaders are denying us a vote. I am extremely concerned with this unprecedented rule and I have an amendment, and I hope the gentlewoman will support me. My amendment would, in section 1 of the resolution, strike the sentence which begins, ``Amendment No. 3 in the report of the Committee on Rules.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be amended to reflect the change as offered in my amendment.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I understand. 
   Well, if that's the case, then, Mr. Speaker, I accept the ruling, and I wish I had a more full description of why there is a problem not at least allowing potentially a vote on amendment No. 3. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no other choice but to ask my colleagues, then, later on today to defeat the previous question so that I can amend the rule by striking the language that I described that allows the proponent of amendment No. 3 to withdraw their amendment before a vote.     
   So, just let me be clear. When I offered this motion, by voting ``no'' on the previous question, Members will, therefore, be allowed to show their support or opposition on amendment No. 3, which would expand the bill's protections to persons discriminated against based on gender identity. This is defined in the amendment as ``gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms or other characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to an individual's designated sex at birth.'' Now, Members who choose to say ``yes,'' then, on the previous question would, therefore, be showing their support for denying Members of this House an opportunity to vote on that issue. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge, and I will talk about this later, but I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' when I offer that motion on the previous question. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I find that we are debating a rule that is rather ironic because the underlying bill that this rule would make in order is a bill about discrimination and ending discrimination, and yet the very rule, the very rule that we are debating, which makes three  amendments in order, is a discriminatory rule because it does not treat all three amendments equal. 
   As I mentioned in my opening statement, Mr. Speaker, I will be calling for a vote on the previous question, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, by voting ``no'' on the previous question, Members will show their support for having a vote on amendment No. 3, which would expand the bill's protections to persons discriminated against based on gender identity. This is defined in the amendment as the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or other characteristics of an individual with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth. 
   As I said, those voting ``no'' on the previous question will be able to vote on this question. Those Members who vote ``yes'' on the previous question will be showing their support for denying Americans, through their representatives, a voice on this issue. 
   Again, if the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule by striking that provision in the language that denies having to seek unanimous consent to offer to withdraw the vote. If the previous question is defeated, the House will still be able to consider the employment nondiscrimination bill today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, it is with great frustration that I must speak out in opposition to the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   I am a strong supporter of fair trade and have voted to support every trade agreement during my time in Congress. The benefits of these agreements are clear. They lower barriers and open new markets for Central Washington farmers, and they create new opportunities for manufacturers and producers in Washington state and across the nation. Given a chance to compete fairly and our farmers will lead the world in exporting high-quality fruits and vegetables. 
   That is why I deeply regret the totally unfair provisions in this Peru agreement relating to asparagus. This agreement forces our American asparagus growers to pay the price for a failed anti-drug effort in South America that has actually resulted in more cocaine production. 
   The Peru Trade Promotion Agreement is preceded by the Andean Trade Preferences Act of 1991. This Act was a unilateral granting of access to American markets for the Andean countries of South America. Its purpose was to allow legal manufacturing and farm exports into our country in an effort to fight and reduce drug production and shipments from these countries. It has been an abysmal failure. Since this one-way trade system was put in place, cocaine production in the Andean countries is actually higher now than when the agreement was put in place. 
   However, since the Andean Act was enacted, imports of fresh asparagus from Peru went from 4 million pounds a year to over 87 million pounds in 2006. That's a 2000 percent increase! This flood of US-subsidized foreign imports cut asparagus production in Washington state from $200 million in 1990 to approximately $75 million today. American growers were given no transition period. No time to adjust. No consideration whatsoever. 
   Corporations have closed asparagus processing facilities in the United States, only to reopen them in Peru. 
   What our government's policies have done is magically create an industry in a foreign country under the flawed logic that Peruvians would grow asparagus instead of cocaine--when the two crops are grown in two totally different regions of that country. 
   When the United States and Peru completed negotiations on this agreement in December of 2005, I expressed my disappointment with the trade deal and the treatment of asparagus. This was after months of meeting with and encouraging American negotiators to fix it. 
   I regret that in the almost two years since then, the attention of the Administration to addressing the injustice wrong done to domestic asparagus growers has been non-existent. It's been up to those few of us in Congress, both Representatives and Senators, who represent asparagus producers to work together to try and bring some degree of fairness. 
   We are making progress and there is movement in the right direction, but we are still a long ways from it becoming reality. I hope we  are successful in our efforts and I would welcome the attention and assistance of the Administration. 
   American asparagus growers deserve better than to be ignored and placed at a competitive disadvantage by their own government. Until fair treatment and assistance to American asparagus growers is a reality, I am unable to support this agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of this Congress, the Democrat majority chose to gut the earmark transparency and enforceability rules that the Republicans enacted just last year. They then decided to bring the spending bills to the floor that did not include earmarks so no Member could challenge, discuss, and call for a vote on the House floor. 
   Fortunately, the Republicans were successful in forcing the Democrat majority to restore earmark transparency and enforceability rules and bring spending bills to the floor with earmarks where they can be discussed, debated, and voted upon. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, let me be clear that the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water appropriations bill before us today does not contain earmarks. However, Republican and Democrat leaders have reached an agreement that Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on earmarks to be included in this bill before this bill is sent to the Senate, and I, along with my colleagues, will work to ensure that this promise is kept. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also wish to point out that the underlying bill is of tremendous importance to the central Washington congressional district that I represent. I am pleased by the funding provided for Hanford cleanup and the efforts to ensure that the Richland Operations Office can meet legal cleanup milestones along the River Corridor and in transuranic waste retrievals. 
   However, I must say, Mr. Speaker, the funding level for the waste treatment plant at Hanford is of a concern to me. It is important for this House and the Congress to recognize that while the bill provides sufficient funds for construction in this fiscal year, this bill's funding level will require a significant boost in funding in just 2 years to keep the project on its new independently verified budget and schedule. We must acknowledge that the choices made on funding for the waste treatment plant in this bill require balancing with a substantial increase in the very near future. 
   I also, Mr. Speaker, support the funds vital to the operation of Pacific Northwest National Lab, particularly the DOE Office of Science and NNSA plan  to transition scientists' work in the 300 area to replacement lab facilities. This initiative is critical to our country's national security. And this bill provides a solid endorsement and boost to that project. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrat majority keeps its promise to include earmarks and detail spending in this bill, we will know far more about the multibillion-dollar budgets of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These are also of great importance to the irrigators, farmers and ports of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. 
   Originally, as we know, the Democrat majority would have had this House consider the Energy and Water appropriations bill with a report that included page after page of blanks where dollar amounts should have been in the Army Corps and Reclamation budgets. But due to the demands of the Republicans, they will now fill in the blanks before and not after the House votes and sends this bill to the Senate. This will ensure that all Members will have an opportunity to review earmarks on the House floor and not just see them added months from now when they would have been beyond the scrutiny of a House vote. 
   We Republicans have secured a rules change to ensure this House and the American taxpayers can scrutinize earmarks, and that earmarks are subject to a vote of the House. This is the right thing to do, Mr. Speaker, and I'm pleased that the Democrat majority has agreed to Republican demands to restore transparency and openness on earmarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   I think the gentleman, in his opening remarks, said something that currently should be expanded. Current law within HUD has an Office of Economic Development, and its responsibility, and I want to quote what its responsibility is, it ``works with public and private sectors as well as not-for-profit organizations to provide financial and technical assistance to local communities to develop and implement their own economic development and community revitalization strategies.'' Now, that's current law. If the gentleman believes that that agency shouldn't exist, then certainly he can introduce a bill, and we can have a worthy debate on that. But that is existing law. 
   And it is within that context, then, as this relates to my district, which is a very diverse agriculture area, labor intensive in many of the specialty crops, but there is a new industry that is emerging in my district, and that is the wine industry. It's only about 35 years old. Historically, the wine industry in this country has always been in California. This is emerging in my district, and it has the benefit, then, of economic development to expand, to bring more tourists into this area, which means there's more hotels, more restaurants. That is the very definition of what economic development is all about. 
   So let me be very, very clear on this. This project is fully consistent with requirements for projects normally and routinely funded under this program and existing programs. 
   And I might add, it is named for an individual who has been widely recognized as the father of the Washington wine industry. He is the one who convinced farmers to transfer some of their lands to growing wine grapes. And, frankly, they've been very successful. 
   There has been $5 million raised by other governmental agencies and quasi-governmental agencies to build this center. This is part of that. What it demonstrates to me is that there is a strong commitment of this wide community that identifies this as a local economic development project. 
   So while there has been a lot of discussion with the earmarks this year, and I suspect we will have more of those discussions, I firmly believe that within existing laws and within the context of economic development, this falls into a category that I feel very, very comfortable with in saying that we ought to earmark dollars for this center because it will expand the economic development in this largely rural area that I have the privilege of representing. So, to me, it is an example of what the economic development initiative is supposed to be. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, let me restate again that it is existing law within HUD of this office that provides for economic development. I am simply following the law and exercising my right as a Member of Congress, who is part of the writing of the appropriation bills, to earmark what I think is important for my district. 
   Now, if the gentleman wants to, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, if he wants to have a debate on whether that office ought to exist, well, I think that is worthy of debate. In fact, I would have suggested to the gentleman that maybe he should have defunded completely the whole office; therefore, he could have been at least consistent rather than picking out one project that I think is worthy, following what the requirements are of the Economic Development Office. 
   So with that, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the Flake amendment as it relates to the Walter Clore Center. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, history is being made today in the U.S. House of Representatives. Yesterday, Democrat leaders and the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee chose for a record-setting, a record-setting 50th time to consider legislation under a completely closed process that allows no amendments, no alternatives, no substitute proposals, and permits not a single Member of this House the opportunity to change or improve the underlying bill. 
   Last January, the new Democrat majority promised the American people a new era of openness in the U.S. House, but they have delivered the most restrictive and unfair process in the history of the House. It is only March in the first part of the second session of this Congress, but the Democrats have already exceeded the 49 closed rules of the entire 109th Congress.  
   Mr. Speaker, that is a historic low. We were promised change, and we have gotten it. Only it has been change, Mr. Speaker, for the worse. 
   Mr. Speaker, time after time, Democrat leaders have shut down any and all opportunity for Members of the House to amend, alter or debate legislation. This is a sad and disrespectful way to approach the business of the American people and the people's House. It doesn't have to be this way, and it certainly isn't what the Democrat leaders promised a little more than a year ago. That promise has been tossed out the window, along with any pretense to seek out bipartisan compromise in passing legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill on mental health parity, and, Mr. Speaker, it passed unanimously. Yet House Democrat leaders refuse to even allow the bipartisan Senate compromise to be voted on in the House. An amendment to allow a House vote on the Senate compromise was blocked by the Democrat Rules Committee, just as it blocked every other amendment offered by Members of this House, and that only happened last night. 
   Yet the reach of this bill goes far beyond mental health parity. The $1.3 billion cost it would impose on businesses providing health care to employees is an issue that, frankly, is not addressed, or any loss of care that may result from new government mandates that are contained in the bill is also not addressed. 
   The reach of this bill stretches deep into the ability of doctors to provide care to patients across this country through a $3 billion cut in health care to Americans served by doctor-owned hospitals. This is the second time in 7 months that the House will vote on legislation that seeks to ban doctor-owned hospitals by cutting funding from Medicare and Medicaid to these facilities, and, as such, Mr. Speaker, it imposes a very real and serious threat to some Americans' ability to access health care. 
   One of the hospitals threatened by this proposal is Wenatchee Valley Medical Center in my district in central Washington. The Wenatchee Valley Medical Center, Mr. Speaker, was founded in 1940 by three physicians. In the last 68 years it has grown, and now employs 1,500 people. It serves a population of 250,000 people in an area the size of the State of Maryland and it treats 150,000 patients a year. It has been designated by the State of Washington as a ``critical need hospital'' that is serving a rural underserved area. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, it is 100 percent owned by 150 doctors. Apparently, that is a crime, because this bill would outlaw this facility as it has existed for 68 years, because this bill would prohibit any hospital from being more than 40 percent owned by doctors if they are to continue receiving Medicare patients for the care that they provide to their seniors. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center has been treating and caring for patients longer than there has been even 50 States in our Union, and yet this bill could end that care. 
   When I discussed this threat to Wenatchee with the proposal sponsors last night in the Rules Committee, they said the simple answer was to sell the 60 percent stake in a government-ordered fire sale so it meets the 40 percent limit on doctor ownership. Not only is a fair price, Mr. Speaker, unlikely to be paid when selling under a threat of government action, but it is unfair and disruptive to any institution with a long record of excellent care. 
   Mr. Speaker, what is so nefarious about 100 percent doctor ownership, or 75 percent, or 50 percent, or even, Mr. Speaker, 41 percent? What is magically solved with the ownership of 40 percent? The answer is nothing, nothing when it comes to Wenatchee. 
   The irony is not lost on me that this bill only bans doctor-owned hospitals in an effort to supposedly target bad behavior. Consider this, Mr. Speaker: If a corporation engages in the exact, in the exact same practices that this bill tries to stop doctor-owned hospitals from doing, the corporation would pay no penalty. It wouldn't even be touched. So apparently patients are safer if corporations are in charge, but patients are in danger and taxpayers are being ripped off if doctors prosper from owning a hospital and are providing excellent care. 
   What is really happening in this bill is a push to move our country ever closer to a Canadian-style government-run health care system, as under this bill such a Canadian-style system will replace good, high quality care from down-home doctors with the extensive medical expertise of Congress. The Federal Government will decide where Americans will get care and what hospitals will be banned or shutdown. The Federal Government will also decide when Americans are allowed to get care, if they are allowed to get care at all. 
   If the Federal Government can ban doctors from owning a hospital, then the health care access of every American, Mr. Speaker, in my view, is at risk. I fundamentally disagree with those who believe that an all-knowing Congress and thousands of Federal bureaucrats can deliver Americans the best health care possible. 
   Keep in mind, this ban on doctor-owned hospitals, quote-unquote, saves $3 billion. Ironically, Mr. Speaker, this is accomplished by denying or reducing access to care for seniors and poor Americans on Medicaid and Medicare. Instead of growing the size and power of the Federal Government by taking decisions away from local doctors and removing freedoms from individual Americans, we should be allowing American patients to make more choices and free doctors to focus on their profession of healing. 
   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to Wenatchee Valley Medical Center, the accusations of negligent care and fiscal rip-offs that are leveled at doctor-owned hospitals simply don't apply to this facility. Wenatchee is not guilty of the sins of others simply because it is a doctor-owned hospital since 1940. It should not be targeted or threatened for the real or anecdotal failures of recently created doctor-owned hospitals. 
   The language in this bill is simply not ready for passage as it is currently written. It is too broad and imprecise. It would punish honest, well-performing hospitals and doctors and their patients for the actions of others. If there is bad behavior, Mr. Speaker, to be banned, then target that behavior. Don't impose an overreaching ban that harms innocent patients and doctors. 
   My constituents are not alone in facing this threat. Both Mr. Hinojosa of Texas and Mr. Kagen of Wisconsin have similar concerns about health care institutions in their districts. 
   Efforts to improve this legislation so that it doesn't threaten and harm our home-grown hospitals have not been met with openness. In fact, we have been denied on a bipartisan basis. Last night in the Rules Committee I made three separate attempts to try to offer an amendment to protect innocent hospitals. However, Democrats on the Rules Committee chose to deny each and every attempt to preserve the stricture of my hospital and the hospitals of Mr. Hinojosa and Mr. Kagen. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are legitimate bipartisan concerns about the toll this language would have on local hospitals that have done no harm and who provide important health care access to thousands of Americans. 
   This bill needs to be corrected, not forced through the House with zero opportunity for improvement or amendment. This record-setting closed rule denies any chance for help to be provided to Wenatchee Valley Medical Center or to patients in hospitals in Texas and Wisconsin. The rule deserves to be defeated and this House allowed to vote on correcting this flawed bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are several parts to this bill. And obviously by the remarks that I made previously, I am worried about what we call the pay-for part of that because it would have a detrimental effect, as I mentioned, on doctor-owned facilities, particularly in my district, but also in other parts of the country. 
   Since this issue came up some 7 months ago, we discovered that there are very few doctor-owned facilities that are unique in the sense of what I was talking about today, and I think my colleagues from Wisconsin and Texas talked about last night in the Rules Committee, and so I want to ask my friend from New Jersey who is the sponsor of this legislation, and I will be happy to yield to him. 
   He talked about the issue of overutilization. Now, I simply have to bring this up because I doubt that the 150,000 patients of the Wenatchee Valley Clinic would say that they are overutilizing that clinic. I think they go there because they want to have their health needs taken care of. So I don't think that is applicable to that facility, and I mentioned that in my previous remarks. 
   I want to ask my friend from New Jersey a question. 
   As I mentioned, apparently there are just a few hospitals that fall in the category that I was describing.     
   But there are bipartisan concerns about the effects of this bill on good hospitals providing quality care. I made that point. 
   Will you work with me and other Members from both sides of the aisle to protect these hospitals and to exempt them totally from this ban on doctor ownership? 
   I yield to my friend from New Jersey.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Reclaiming my time, I asked if the gentleman would work with me, and apparently the gentleman is saying that he won't work with me, even though this apparently is a very, very small universe, a universe of hospitals that deserve, I think, to have some sort of special consideration because if you have, for example, a government-mandated fire sale, what is the value of the enterprise that you're trying to sell? Yet that is precisely the language that you have in place. 
   So I'm asking you again. Since there are very few of these facilities, in three different States, would you work with us to exempt them totally from the ban that's imposed by this bill?

   To me, Mr. Speaker, this sounds precisely as a look into the future, as we move towards what I would consider, I know that some would want, a government-style health care in this country, where conditions are going to be set forth on what kind of care, when that care is, what's the condition of ownership. All of these things apparently are on the horizon, and we are seeing an inkling into the future of how that would be effected.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, there's been a lot of discussion here today on the underlying bill, the subject of which has broad support. The issues are the PAYGO and the issues are the denial, denial of the Democrat leadership in this House to allow a vote on a bill that passed in the other body unanimously. So much for openness that was promised a little over a year ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus my closing remarks on another issue, another issue that has not been taken up and needs to be addressed, and that's the FISA issue that we have talked about so many times. 
   It has come to my attention today, and it will be in a publication presumably tomorrow, that the distinguished majority leader said that the electronic surveillance bill, or the FISA bill, will not be taken up this week. 
   We are becoming unprotected in this country because we don't have all the capabilities that we need in our intelligence community. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, in this rule, Democrat leaders have blocked the House from voting on a bipartisan compromise on mental health parity, as I had mentioned. 
   I want to talk now about modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act into the 21st century. The Senate has passed legislation that will  bring this 1970s Jimmy Carter-era law up to date to reflect today's age of disposable cell phones and the Internet. Yet for weeks now, House Democrat leaders have refused to allow Representatives to vote on this Senate bill. They've done this despite the public support given the bipartisan Senate compromise by 21 members of the Democrat Blue Dog Coalition. 
   House Democrat leaders are tying the hands of our intelligence professionals to make them jump through unnecessary red tape and paperwork to protect our country. If foreign persons in foreign places are conspiring and plotting to harm Americans and our country, then our intelligence personnel should be listening to them. They shouldn't have to waste precious time and energy on bureaucratic hurdles. 
   We can protect and are protecting the constitutional rights of Americans, but we also must protect their lives by recognizing the terrorist threat to our country and modernizing FISA. 
   I ask all my colleagues to join with me in defeating the previous question so that we can immediately move to vote on the bipartisan Senate FISA bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California, my good friend (Mr. Cardoza), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former small business owner, I recognize the need for legislation to help update and streamline Small Business Administration programs and leverage new investment strategies in order to expand small business investment. 
   However, we must also make a commitment to small business that tax relief measures that passed the House the last several years should not be allowed to expire at the end of this year. With a month left before Congress's target adjournment date and just 3 months left of 2007, small businesses are depending on Congress to act quickly to renew tax relief which has allowed them to create more jobs and grow, helping America's economy grow at the same time. Tax relief and reduced regulatory burdens can make all the difference whether a small business is profitable at the end of the year or is forced to close its doors. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee adopted a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 3567, the Small Business Investment Expansion Act of 2007. While this rule makes all submitted amendments in order, I believe the underlying bipartisan bill that is supported both by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business should have been considered under an open rule on the House floor today. 
   Yesterday the ranking member, Mr. Dreier, on Rules gave the Democrat majority on Rules the opportunity to double the number of open rules that this body has heard other than appropriation bills reported from the committee this Congress. Unfortunately, Democrat members of the Rules Committee denied bringing the underlying bipartisan bill to the floor under an open rule process. Thus only two, Mr. Speaker, only two of 433 Members of the House will be able to offer amendments on this bill today. While this is disappointing, this, unfortunately, is not an unusual practice of this Rules Committee, despite promises of openness made to the American people just last year. 
   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, House rules were adopted that require the disclosure and allow Members to challenge earmarks in appropriation bills;  however, under current House rules, earmarks and authorization bills and tax bills do not have to be disclosed and are not allowed to be challenged. This loophole needs to be closed, and I am going to give my colleagues in this House another opportunity to send a strong message to the American taxpayers that we are serious about earmark transparency. Therefore, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to allow for immediate consideration of House Resolution 479, the earmark accountability rule. By defeating the previous question, we will be able to address earmark enforceability in order to restore credibility to this House. By considering and approving House Resolution 479, we will send a strong message to American taxpayers that the House will no longer turn its head the other way when it comes to transparency of earmarks. 
   As my colleague LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART observed yesterday, it has been a good week for earmarks and a bad week for transparency. We have an opportunity to change that, and I hope the Democrat majority will not make this another missed opportunity to make good on their promises to seek earmark transparency to American taxpayers. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Words cannot express the shock and sorrow that I feel today. 
   I know that all of you join me in keeping her family, sons Reagan, Bryant and stepson Angus Thomson, and her loving husband, Keith Thomson, in our thoughts and prayers. 
   All of us who have served with Jennifer Dunn in the House have known the kindness, the wit and political savvy that she embodied. She was vibrant, enjoyed life, and she always had a kind word for everyone. 
   She was known, Madam Speaker, as a fierce advocate when it came to supporting Republican women for election, both locally in our State of Washington and nationally. 
   On a personal note, for 32 years she was my friend, fellow Ronald Reagan activist, my State party chairman and colleague in the House where she served the Eighth District of Washington from 1993 to 2005. 
   Always positive, dignified and poised in everything that she did. A loving wife and mother, as well as a political leader with great skill. 
   Today, Washington State and our Nation has lost a giant, a true leader and a stateswoman in every sense of the word. Madam Speaker, she will be dearly missed. 
   I yield to my friend, the senior Democrat from Washington (Mr. Dicks).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 429 allows for consideration of H.R. 1100, the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site Boundary Revision Act, which would increase our Federal inventory of land by up to 115 acres. Rarely does the Rules Committee consider rules for bills making changes to historic sites because they are typically brought to the floor under suspension of the rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, coming from an area in central Washington that is 40 percent federally owned land mass, I believe we ought to be encouraging land exchanges where possible rather than more land purchases. The Federal land management agencies simply have too much land to manage effectively with their current level of funding. We all know there is a serious backlog of road, trail and facility maintenance on Federal lands. In many cases, Federal land agencies are struggling to manage invasive species, plant pests, and unnaturally high fuel loads that lead to catastrophic wildfires. Yet, year after year, we are spending precious tax dollars to buy up more private property and take it off the local tax rolls. 
   We need to make land exchanges and the orderly restructuring of Federal land holdings easier. The Federal Government owns and must maintain many small, isolated parcels of land that have no special resource value. We should make it easier for the Federal agencies to dispose of these properties and retain the proceeds to acquire lands that are high in resource value.     
   This is a practical solution that allows us to protect special places without having to spend limited tax dollars. 
   I would also add that there are many other issues, in my view more pressing matters, affecting public lands management that we could be considering today. For example, the extension of payments to forested counties for rural schools and roads. As many of my colleagues are aware, the Congress long ago promised rural communities that they would get a fair share of the revenue produced from Federal forestlands as compensation for the tax-exempt status of Federal forestlands. 
   However, unfortunately, special interest groups successfully used litigation under the Endangered Species Act to bring harvest to a standstill in many places like the Pacific Northwest. This left many counties struggling to pay for basic services while saddled with large areas of nontaxable Federal land. Although the House has passed legislation providing for a 1-year fix on this issue, we need a longer-term solution, and we need to get this legislation to the President's desk as soon as possible. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House will soon have an opportunity to consider these and other issues impacting Federal land management. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I just point out that this is an increase of 44 percent over the current land value, and I know we're talking about acres and we're not talking about square miles. But to paraphrase former Senator Edward Dirksen, in another sense, you know, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real dollars. Well, we're talking about Federal land ownership, and I'm very sensitive to that because I come from the western part of the United States. 
   As I mentioned in my opening remarks, 40 percent of my district is owned by the Federal Government, and I have some counties in which 75 percent of the counties' land mass is owned by the Federal Government.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (REINTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF ANCIENT REMAINS -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, last month the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved a bill that included a two-word addition to existing law that effectively blocks the scientific study of ancient skeletal remains discovered on Federal land. This change, tucked into what is being called a technical corrections bill, is very far from a minor ``technical correction.'' It is a fundamental shift in existing law and would overturn a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court, which is second only to the Supreme Court. Such an extreme action should not be hidden within a mostly noncontroversial bill. 
   In its ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court expressly allowed the research and scientific study of ancient human remains found in the United States. The Senate bill seeks to quietly erase our Nation's ability to study our past and the planet's human history. The Tri-Cities community in my central Washington district needs no introduction to this issue. They experienced firsthand the court battles that ensued after the 9,300-year-old Kennewick Man remains were discovered on the banks of the Columbia River in 1996. These remains are among the oldest found in North America, and the quality of the remains has the potential to yield researchers greater insight into the early history of man in North America. 
   A full 8 years after the Kennewick Man's discovery, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in 2004, as I have explained, that the remains were to be studied by scientists. Then, during the last Congress, the Senate first sought its two-word addition in ``technical corrections.'' I introduced a bill to challenge and publicize this action. 
   Members of the Senate committee decided to try again last month in this Congress. I am forced once again to respond by reintroducing my bill. My bill very simply and plainly ensures the ability for scientific study of truly ancient remains. If this matter is pushed to the Senate, then let us have a full, open and honest debate about what the Senate Indian Affairs Committee would do to scientific study in our country. The effort to quietly slide through such a dramatic change needs to stop. Those who support it should explain why and give a justification. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope the introduction of my legislation will help bring balance to what is being done on the other side of the Capitol, and that scientific inquiry is not extinguished through the quiet acts of the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, this Agricultural, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration appropriations bill provides more than $18.8 billion in discretionary spending for the next fiscal year. This bill represents an increase in spending by nearly 6 percent over last year's bill and continues the trend of the Democrat majority choosing to provide spending increases well above the rate of inflation and putting each taxpayer in the country on a path towards an average $3,000 increase in their Federal tax bill. Madam Speaker, this is too great a burden for the American taxpayer to pay. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I represent one of the premier agriculture districts in the country. Central Washington is rightfully famous for its apples, cherries, wine and many other farm and ranch products. The programs funded under this bill are of great importance to the communities I represent, and there are some provisions in the bill that I do indeed support. 
   For example, I am pleased that funding is maintained for rural development, which provides critical financial help to rural communities across the country. This bill also fully funds the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which provides on-the-ground technical assistance to farmers and ranchers dealing with soil and water management issues. I also note that this bill maintains a provision that I have long supported which allows Americans to be able to purchase drugs in other countries at lower prices and bring them back to the United States lawfully. 
   However, Madam Speaker, I am very disappointed that this bill cuts Agriculture Research Service funding by over $50 million compared to last year. I represent three Agriculture Research Service labs, two of which are collocated with Washington State University research facilities. Federally sponsored agriculture research not only improves crop productivity, it also helps farmers and ranchers find solutions to environmental and marketing challenges. 
   Many agriculture research initiatives were already facing the prospect of cutting essential research programs and researchers. Surely, Madam Speaker, with such a big increase over last year's spending level, we could have found room to at least protect the level of research being conducted today. 
   I am concerned about the potential impacts of these cuts and what it would mean for facilities in my district, in particular the Agriculture Research Service lab in Prosser. I intend to continue to work with my colleagues from Washington to ensure that we provide the funding necessary to maintain the important agriculture research activities already underway at these facilities. 
   I am also disappointed that this bill provides only $10 million for the Specialty Crops Block Grant program. This program provides grants distributed by the State departments of agriculture to assist the development, production and marketing of fruits and vegetables. Earlier this year, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in asking that this program be fully funded at the $44.5 million level. This bill falls far short on this account. 
   Madam Speaker, if we pass this rule today, the House will begin consideration of the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration appropriations bill. While this must be accomplished in a timely manner, the Senate in fact will not begin consideration of this bill until September and there is, frankly, a more pressing issue facing our Nation today. 
   Watching the news and reading the newspapers, Americans are reminded each day that the United States remains vulnerable to another terrorist attack. It is vital that our laws keep us one step ahead of the terrorists, but currently, Madam Speaker, we lag behind. 
   Right now, Federal law ties the hands of our intelligence community, causing them to miss significant portions of intelligence, all because technological advances have outpaced Federal law. We cannot wait to respond only after another attack. We must act today. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, I will be calling on my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. By defeating the previous question, we will give Members the ability to vote today on the merits of changing current law to ensure our intelligence community has the tools they need to protect our Nation from a potentially imminent terrorist attack. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed my friend from Massachusetts would not respond to my asking him to yield when he spoke just a moment ago, and I am not discounting at all how important the provisions in this agriculture bill, how important they are, notwithstanding some of the problems that I have. 
   But this issue that we are talking about, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, is very important and it is timely right now. Right now. 
   Let me explain how this process works, because this does not slow down. And I shouldn't say it doesn't slow it down; it slows it down for one hour. Can't we take 1 hour to debate this issue? 
   If the previous question is defeated, and I will call for it to be defeated on the floor. If it is defeated, then the rule will be amended to take up the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments for one hour to debate up or down. 
   This issue is very, very important and it is timely that it gets acted on before Congress leaves for the August district work period. So this does not slow down agriculture. It is not saying anything disparaging about agriculture. 
   And, frankly, Madam Speaker, I should know. I live in an agriculture-based economy. All of my neighbors are involved, in one way or the other, in agriculture. So I should know the importance of it. 
   But I also know the importance of taking up this issue regarding FISA and doing it right now, doing it this week, doing it today, by defeating the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   The House of Representatives is expected to adjourn later this week for the August district work period. This district work period gives Members the opportunity to leave this humid area in Washington D.C. to work in their respective districts and listen to what is on the minds of the people that we all represent. Congressional ratings are at an all-time low, and I feel that is in part due to the fact that Congress is failing to address pressing issues. 
   I am asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, as I mentioned earlier. Voting ``no'' will not delay the consideration of the Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration appropriations bill. 
   Let me qualify that. It will delay it for 1 hour. It will, however, give Members the opportunity to vote on the merits of updating current law so that our intelligence community has the tools it needs to monitor the telephone conversations of foreign terrorists physically located in foreign countries. Let me repeat that, foreign terrorists in foreign countries. 
   I hope that the Democrat majority will not stall any longer in allowing the House to vote on this very vital issue. Each minute we wait to act, our Intelligence Committee could be missing vital information, therefore increasing our risk of another attack on U.S. soil. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4847, UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in 2003, this legislation, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act, passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent, and it passed the House that same year as a suspension bill by a voice vote. This year it was approved with bipartisan support and a voice vote out of the House Science Committee. The history of this bill has clearly been one of bipartisanship and broad agreement on the merits for renewing the U.S. Fire Administration activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a prime candidate for consideration as a suspension bill by this House, and in a Tuesday meeting of the Rules Committee, I suggested that if no amendments were filed with the committee, that the House should actually consider it as a suspension bill because of its broad support. 
   The Democrats on the Rules Committee said no to consideration as a suspension, as was done in 2003, which, I might add, was done with their consent in 2003. The Democrat Rules Committee insisted on a structured amendment process requiring Representatives to file their proposed amendments through the Rules Committee for the committee's review. Ultimately three amendments were filed with the committee. This rule would make only those three amendments in order, thereby prohibiting the 432 other Members of the House from coming to the House floor and offering an amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority has set an historic record for the most closed rules in the history of the House. In doing so, they shut down debate on the House floor more than any other majority has. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is really a terrible record. As the new Democrat majority took control after the November 2006 elections, they promised the exact opposite. They pledged to run the most open House and to allow for bipartisanship. 
   Mr. Speaker, they have broken that promise. Other than appropriation bills, which are historically considered under open rules, this Congress has had only one, just one open rule, and that was over a year ago, in February of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill to renew the activities of the Fire Administration is noncontroversial. If it is not going to be considered under suspension of the rules, then it should be done under an open rule. If this noncontroversial bill is not a candidate for an open rule, then what bill will this Democrat majority be willing to bring to the floor and allow under an open rule? 
   The Democrat majority blocks debates on controversial bills and noncontroversial bills. No legislation appears safe from their drive to shut down and shut out debate in this House. They promised to run the House in an open manner, and they are not. They passed new rules to make conference committees more open. Then they just stopped using conference committees and retreated further behind closed doors to write final bills. Mr. Speaker, as just one example, take the Democrat refusal to conference with the Senate on FISA legislation. 
   The American people were promised that this House would be run differently, that it would be run better, but in fact it has not been. The Democrat majority has exceeded and surpassed the heavy-handed tactics that they condemned in the last Congress. Now they have gone so far as to take a noncontroversial bill that was passed by voice vote and turn it into another opportunity to tighten the vise and block debate on the House floor.     
   This House deserves to be allowed to work in an open and free manner, and it hasn't had that, Mr. Speaker. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I would just make the observation: This bill, as I mentioned in my remarks and as the gentlelady from Ohio mentioned in her remarks, has obviously very, very broad bipartisan support. Why not consider it then under an open process? There are probably many Members that have an idea that they could perfect this legislation, but we are being denied, with the exception of three amendments, to try to perfect this bill. 
   I just think it is the wrong way to go in a body that prides itself being open to debate and being very deliberative. We are certainly not getting that opportunity under this noncontroversial bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation, offered in good faith by my friend and colleague from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), would create a process, and I want to emphasize ``process,'' because that is what this is, for establishing and recognizing a Native Hawaiian government entity that would be empowered to act on behalf of its members with the State and Federal Government. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, as the Wall Street Journal noted in 2005, the practical effect of granting this status to self-identified Native Hawaiians would be to allow this new class of American citizens to declare, and I quote again from the Wall Street Journal, ``complete legal and territorial independence from the United States and the establishment of a Hawaiian nation-state.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, before this statement is dismissed out of hand as a completely unbelievable statement dreamed up by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, I should mention that they were not the ones that were making this claim. They were merely reporting on a statement made by the State Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which first acknowledged this fact. 
   In addition, a recent statement made by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission raised concerns that this legislation, and, again, I quote from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, ``would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide American people into discrete subgroups according to various degrees of privilege.'' 
   Despite the best efforts of this legislation's advocates to compare Native Americans with Native American tribes who govern reservations and often live on them, this legislation would make it possible for our next-door neighbors in Hawaii to suddenly coexist under different legal regimes, a clear violation of the 14th amendment of the Constitution's equal protection clause. 
   Mr. Speaker, because this legislation would grant broad governmental powers to a racially defined group, to include all living descendants. The new Native Hawaiians created by this bill would need no geographic, political or cultural connection to Hawaii, much less a physical connection to a distinct Native Hawaiian community. As the Federal courts have recently explained, this is problematic. Again, I quote the Federal courts: ``The history of the indigenous Hawaiians is fundamentally different from that of indigenous groups in federally recognized Indian tribes in the continental United States.'' 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation raises significant constitutional concerns, which have been raised on other bills this year, namely, H.R. 8345, the Hawaiian Ownership Act of 2007, which the House considered in March of this year. The Hawaiian Township Act initially failed under suspension of the rules because 162 Members of the House recognized, and in 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in Rice v. Cayetano, that the current configuration of Justices would likely strike down the Federal benefits flowing to Native Americans as an unconstitutional racial set-aside, if given the chance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that there are legitimate constitutional concerns that must be addressed in the underlying Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that the rule makes in order an amendment to be offered by Mr. Flake of Arizona that would attempt to address the constitutional concerns and ensure the underlying legislation complies with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate my friend from Hawaii's clarification on this, and I just want to point out a couple of things in my opening remarks. 
   I emphasized that this is a process which I think acknowledges the fact that there is a history that goes back to when Hawaii was a kingdom, and so I acknowledge that point. But I simply raise those issues because those issues I think are important when we talk about the United States as a whole, as a government under laws and everybody being treated equal, and these are questions that I think need to be addressed. 
   I appreciate very, very much my friend's clarification on this. The point that this is a process and the point that there is some lineage going back from a State to a territory to a kingdom probably has some viability to it. 
   But there are always unintended laws when we write national laws that appeal to one State or one set of people. That is what we have to be cautious about. That is why I simply raise these concerns. The issue is before us. We have a rule and we have made in order an amendment that deals with the 14th amendment. I think that is important to be discussed, and I doubt if this issue will be completely decided here today. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to have Speaker Pelosi, in consultation with Republican Leader BOEHNER, immediately appoint conferees to H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for 2008. 
   Two days ago a number of news publications, including Roll Call, reported that the Democrat leadership intends to play political games and hold off on sending any appropriations bills to President Bush so that they can use an upcoming anticipated veto of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to serve as ``an extension of their successful public relations campaign on the State Children's Health Insurance Program.'' Roll Call is the one that made that observation on October 22, 2007. 
   While the House Democrat leadership plays politics on this issue, however, our Nation's veterans are paying the price. The Senate has already done its work and appointed conferees for this bill. And for every day that House Democrats allow the veterans funding bill to languish without conferees for their only political advantage, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million, money that could be used for veterans housing, veterans health care, and other important veterans support activities. 
   On October 18, American Legion National Commander Marty Conaster, five national vice commanders and all 55 Legion national executive committee members sent Speaker Pelosi a letter pleading with her to put partisanship aside and provide this funding for the troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include a copy of the letter for the Congressional Record.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the intent of the original 1978 FISA law was to enhance Americans' security while at the same time protecting Americans' privacy. Recognizing that no responsibility of the Federal Government is more important than providing for the defense and security of the American people, Congress should be doing all it can to ensure that FISA continues to reflect the intent of the original law. 
   In the nearly 30 years since FISA became law, we have seen tremendous advances in communications technology, such as the Internet, cell phones, and e-mail. However, under the original FISA law, our intelligence officials are not free to monitor foreign terrorists, Mr. Speaker, in foreign countries, without a court order, because of advances, as I mentioned, in communications technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me repeat again: Because of advances in technology, our intelligence officials are not free to monitor foreign terrorists in foreign countries. It is clear that the law is outdated and must be modernized to reflect changes in communications technology over the past three decades. 
   In August, Congress, in a bipartisan manner, took an important step to close our Nation's intelligence gap. The Protect America Act passed only after repeated attempts by Republicans to give our Nation's intelligence professionals the tools and authority they need to protect our homeland. This action was long overdue, and this law marked a significant step forward in improving our national security. But, unfortunately, Democrats forced these needed technology tools to expire in 6 months. 
   In November, the House Democrat leaders brought legislation to the floor that does not go far enough to reform outdated FISA laws. It weakens Americans' privacy protection and fails to permanently close our Nation's intelligence gap. A bipartisan, permanent solution is needed that shows all Americans and our enemies that the United States is truly committed to closing our Nation's intelligence gap. 
   Yesterday, the Senate acted in a bipartisan manner by a vote of 68-29 to permanently close the terrorist loophole and ensure that intelligence officials are able to monitor communications of suspected terrorists overseas such as Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders. This commonsense solution would help keep our country safe from attack and should be acted on immediately and sent to the President to be signed into law. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrat leaders need to stop dragging their feet. They need to end their delaying tactics, indeed, to let the House vote on the Senate-approved measure. Today, I am going to give Members of the House an opportunity to support the bipartisan measure that the Senate passed just yesterday. If the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to allow the House an opportunity to concur with the Senate amendments. By approving the Senate amendments, the bill can become law before the current extension expires in just a few days. 
   We don't need to close the terrorist loophole just temporarily, Mr. Speaker. We need to close it permanently and update our Nation's surveillance laws in order to protect our Nation from another terrorist attack. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can permanently close the loophole. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the tragic events of September 11, 2001 taught us many lessons. One of the lessons we learned that day was that our Nation must remain aggressive in our fight against international terrorism. We must always stay one step ahead of those who wish to harm our fellow Americans. Now is not the time to tie the hands of our intelligence community. The modernization of foreign intelligence surveillance into the 21st century is a critical national security priority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with that assessment. On January 28, 2008, less than 3 weeks ago, 21 members of the Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi in support of the Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation. The letter states, and I quote, ``The Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation contains satisfactory language addressing all these issues and we would fully support that measure should it reach the House floor without substantial change. We believe these components will ensure a strong national security apparatus that can thwart terrorism across the globe and save American lives here in our country.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that was a letter sent to Speaker Pelosi less than 2 weeks ago by the members of the Democrat Blue Dog Coalition.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been in this body for going on 14 years, and I thought I understood how this system works. We have Republicans and we have Democrats. And always, I think, it's in the best interest of the American people when we can work in a bipartisan way. 
   The issue I want to address myself to is the Secure Rural Schools Act. It expired. It is very, very important to States, particularly in the western part of the United States where there's a big influence of Federal lands and particularly forest lands. 
   I just caught the end of what my colleague from Oregon talked about as to  why we are in this situation in the first place. But I can tell you, this is a big economic hit for those rural areas because they don't get the revenue from the Federal lands that they otherwise would have had. 
   But what I don't understand is that this issue has strong bipartisan support. I serve on the Rules Committee, and there are five of my Democrat colleagues on the Rules Committee, five out of nine, that are cosponsors of this legislation. 
   We know that we are nearing the end of this Congress. And we know that there are things that have to pass. The tax extender package is a very important package for other provisions in that bill. For example, the sales tax deductibility for States that don't have a State income tax. Florida is in that situation. There are several members of the Rules Committee that are affected by that. My State is one of those. 
   But this issue of Secure Rural Schools is very, very important. I have four counties in my district that are impacted, and one that is heavily impacted, impacted in a way that my friend from Oregon (Mr. Walden) talked about. 
   What I find rather confusing about this is that we have now a bill that will be brought before us that we could pass in a nanosecond. It's a tax extender bill that the Senate sent over with a vote of 93-2. It has essentially the same provisions that I think everybody agrees, taxes that need to be extended. But it has the provision and a fix to the Secure Rural Schools for 4 years. For 4 years. It allows those communities now to make some plans as to what the transition may be in the future, since we--of course, I think the best thing we ought to do is utilize our Federal lands. But if that's not going to happen, at least they'll have some time to plan for it. 
   This morning, and, by the way, we got the text of this bill at 9:52 this morning, which is a little over 3 hours ago, even though we were told that we're going to have 24 hours to look at any bill. But we had it at 9:52 this morning. And we discovered that the Secure Rural Schools Act was out of the House bill. It wasn't in there. 
   Well, I'm a member of the Rules Committee, and as a member of the Rules Committee, you can amend the rules by suspending rules to put certain provisions in that you think need to be passed. It happens all the time, especially at the end of the session. 
   So here we are, this morning, discovered the Secure Rural Schools wasn't in there. I questioned the individual from the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Blumenauer from Oregon, who came up and testified on the bill, if this was in there. It wasn't in there. 
   By the way, his State is affected. Even though his district isn't affected, his State is affected. 
   So I asked him why this was not in the bill. And his response to me was, well, this is a tax bill and really the Secure Rural Schools issue is a spending issue, so we felt it shouldn't be part of the package. 
   Well, I said, if that's the case, and I accept your argument, then maybe it could go on some appropriation bill. 
   And then I thought, wait a minute. Yesterday we had a continuing resolution with three appropriation bills that passed this House, and Secure Rural Schools wasn't on it. I don't know why the Democrat leadership didn't put it on that vehicle. That probably would have been the proper one. But we're running out of time. And the House Rules Committee can suspend the rules and attach a provision to anything they want to. We know the Senate bill came over here 93-2. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment to take the text of the Senate language, which passed 93-2, and asked that that be debated on the House floor, just asked for it to be debated. If it loses, okay. That's fine. But I think there's broad support. But if it loses, I understand that. 
   I called for a vote on that. And the vote was on a party-line vote, 8-3 no. In other words, the five Democrats that are cosponsors of this provision, in the waning days of the session, voted ``no'' to consider this on the House floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me talk about the broad bill and speak as to how important that bill is. I think it is vitally important to extend these tax extenders. Frankly, I think these tax extenders that we have here ought to be made permanent, but maybe we will have a debate on that at a future time. 
   It is especially important to my State of Washington, because it allows for the sales tax deduction of State sales tax from my Federal income tax obligation, because Washington State, along with six or seven other states, doesn't have an income tax, and this is simply a fairness issue. 
   So this is a very important bill, very broadly, but it is not a complete bill. This bill in its current form will not pass the Senate and therefore will not become law. 
   Why is that, Mr. Speaker? The reason why is because it leaves out a very, very important provision, a provision that the Senate put in there, and I don't always like to congratulate the Senate, but in this case, in their wisdom, to take care of a problem that faces rural America, especially, and especially rural America that has a lot of Federal lands, and that is the Secure Rural Schools Act. It extends it for 4 years. 
   What is this act? This act is simply an act to recognize that Federal policies in the past, i.e. policies that don't allow some communities to log their Federal lands and get the revenue from that, puts a big hurt on local government and school districts. The Secure Rural Schools Act is designed to mitigate that because of Federal policy. 
   Now, what I can't understand about this is this has broad bipartisan support. It has had support a number of times. And, here we are, winding our way down in this Congress, and you would think that the broad bipartisanship of this would recognize that the Senate passed this bill 93-2 and that they say I think this has a pretty good chance of becoming law. But, no, earlier this morning I offered an amendment to the rule to allow me to simply bring up the opportunity to vote up or down on this issue, and it was defeated on a partisan vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue is very, very important. I have in front of me here, Mr. Speaker, and I will include it for the Record, a letter from the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition.     
   The essence of this--and it is dated today--a letter to Speaker Pelosi to include this provision in the Tax Extenders Act. 
   Well, it is in the act. It is in the act that passed the Senate. 
   Now maybe there are politics being played with this. I know that we are in a political arena here, sometimes that happens, but I think the Speaker of the House, who comes from urban San Francisco, doesn't understand rural America. 
   I would suggest that probably the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who comes from urban New York City, doesn't understand the needs of rural America. I can only think that's the reason it wasn't included in something that has broad bipartisan support. 
   I think that we should defeat this rule, and I think what we need to do at the end of the day is to pass the Senate bill, because we know the President will sign it. He has sent a letter to every Member of the House saying that he would sign that bill. 
   I don't like to concede everything to the Senate. There are a lot of times I disagree with what they are saying. 
   But I think we need to take into account what the majority leader has said. I think we need to take into account what was said by the senior Senator from Oregon. By the way, Oregon is one of these States that are heavily hit, impacted by the lack of rural school language in this bill. 
   Senator Wyden said, after passage of the Senate bill, and I quote, ``Now it's up to the House and the President to do the right thing, or thousands of critical employees in hundreds of communities across Oregon could face a very difficult winter.'' 
   Well, I have got to tell you, the President is on board. He doesn't have to say the President would do the right thing, the President said he would sign this bill. It's up to the House. 
   The way to accomplish that is to defeat this rule so we can take up the Senate bill and concur with them, send it to the President's desk, and it will become law.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are two points I want to make, and I know there are Members on your side that have advocated paying for things. 
   Yesterday we had two tax bills on the floor, the AMT fix, that didn't have a pay-for, and the disaster relief which didn't have a pay-for. So we have made exceptions to that in the past. 
   This issue has been in front of us for some time. It is absolutely critical to these communities involved. 
   Now I would suggest, in fact, when Mr. Blumenauer from Oregon was upstairs in the Rules Committee this morning in your stead, he suggested that rural schools probably shouldn't be on this bill, particular bill, because it's a tax bill.  
   I will concede that that may be a logical course of action. But if that is the case, it seemed to me there should have been another vehicle, like an appropriation bill in the CR, and it wasn't on the CR. We are running out of time, is what I am just suggesting to my friend. 
   Let me ask my friend, if this bill does not pass, is there any likelihood whatsoever of the Senate bill that passed 93-2 being enacted into law?

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Far be it from me to defend the actions of the other body. I am a Member of this House and I am proud to be a Member of this House. 
   But we have to recognize this is a bicameral process. Sometimes we have to recognize, as they have to recognize on some legislation that we pass, where we don't move, and that's happened in the past. 
   This one is a 93-2. That is overwhelming, and it includes language, as I mentioned on Secure Rural Schools, that is very, very important. 
   So I hope that the Senate bill passes. I would urge my colleagues to defeat this rule, as I mentioned, and the underlying bill so we can take that up, and I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the length of time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is really very, very important because we are at the last days of this session and we know there is a rush to try to get things done. And I understand that it was a bookkeeping--it wasn't intentional. I understand all of that, we've been through this before. But the significance of this, and it needs to be understood by this body as we are being asked in the future to make some big decisions, the difference in this little error was $100 million. It wasn't small potatoes, so to speak. And I just want to say that the right thing to do--and I hope this is what's going to happen--is that the Rules Committee goes back upstairs and reports it out correctly so we can have the text. But I think that point needs to be made. And I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, for many months the liberal leaders that control this House have blocked, dodged, and refused to allow a vote on legislation to produce more American-made energy. 
   Democrat leaders have been absolute in their opposition to lifting the ban on drilling offshore, and they have repeatedly and adamantly refused any action on such legislation to help lower gas prices that are hurting people at the pump. 
   And yet today, Mr. Speaker, after these many months and years of stamping their feet and yelling ``no,'' are we now to believe that these same liberal Democrats, standing before us today with a salesman smile on their face, are we to believe them that they are now declaring that this is a pro-drilling bill? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are not fools. They won't be taken in by this sham of a bill that will actually lock down Americans' ocean oil reserves. 
   There are two phrases that come to mind, Mr. Speaker, about this bill. The first is ``grasping at straws,'' which is defined as trying to find reasons to be hopeful about a bad situation. The second phrase is ``fig leaf,'' which means something you use to try to hide an embarrassing fact or problem. Mr. Speaker, with this bill, Democrats are grasping at straw fig leaves. 
   There's an election coming up, and Democrats are desperately in search of political cover, political cover for their long record of opposing drilling and producing more American-made energy. 
   This straw fig leaf bill was written in secret. There were no public hearings on this bill. The first copy of it was made public at 9:45 p.m. last night, barely 12 hours ago, and it's 290 pages long. 
   The Democrat-controlled Rules Committee blocked every single Member of this House from being able to offer their ideas for improving this bill. No amendments were allowed to the bill. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Democrats are simply playing a political game. Everybody knows this bill will never pass Congress and become law, but don't take my word for it. Democrat Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said this bill is ``dead on arrival in the Senate.'' And when you examine the details of this bill, it certainly deserves to be dead, Mr. Speaker. 
   It permanently locks up vast amounts of America's oil and gas reserves, including more than 10 billion, with a B, 10 billion barrels of oil on Alaska's remote North Slope. It leaves 88 percent of America's offshore energy resources locked up. It increases taxes by billions of dollars, taxes which will land squarely on the shoulders of American consumers. And it permanently bans drilling within 50 miles of American shores. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, why is this fact important? It's important because, according to the Interior Department, of the nearly 10 billion, again B, barrels of oil believed to be offshore in California, only 5 percent is beyond the 50-mile barrier.     
   Mr. Speaker, what this simply means is that this bill permanently bans drilling on 95 percent of the oil believed to be off the coast of California. 
   As if a permanent ban on drilling in the first 50 miles offshore were not enough, drilling between 50 and 100 miles out would also be effectively banned. By refusing to allow States to share in revenue generated by offshore drilling, this bill guarantees that drilling offshore will never be permitted by the States. 
   Right now, States along the Gulf of Mexico are paid a share of the oil produced in those waters. Under this bill, royalty sharing won't be allowed. As a result, States would have no incentive to allow any drilling whatsoever. In fact, I would submit they would have a disincentive. Why would a State allow someone to come into their back yard and pay them no share of the profits that would be made by the offshore drilling? It is the equivalent of the government opening a Starbuck's or a McDonald's franchise in your garage or family home but paying you nothing,  even to alleviate the cost of dealing with the impacts of that business. 
   And consider this, Mr. Speaker, if this is truly a drilling bill, why is there no outcry from the radical environmental special interests? Mr. Speaker, it's because they know that drilling will never happen under this plan. Those who are opposed to drilling can vote for this bill secure in the knowledge that drilling will never actually happen under this sham bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, my district in central Washington is the home of Grand Coulee Dam and vast amounts of hydropower. It is the home of the only nuclear plant in the Pacific Northwest. It is home to the vast majority of wind farms in Washington State. And it is home to the Pacific Northwest National Lab, a leader in renewable energy research. 
   Those who call central Washington home believe in an all-of-the-above plan that lowers energy prices. That means promoting alternative energy sources like wind and solar power, recognizing a need for more nuclear power, protecting our valuable hydropower dams, and also allowing drilling offshore in Alaska and on other Federal lands. But this bill, Mr. Speaker, does not address those issues. 
   The Democrat plan just means billions of dollars in higher taxes, more government mandates that will increase costs for everyone, and a permanent ban on most of our offshore resources. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the American people deserve a vote on legislation that truly expands alternative energy sources and lifts the ban on offshore drilling and in Alaska. They deserve a vote on H.R. 6566, the American Energy Act, but the liberal leaders of this Congress have blocked a fair yes-or-no vote on this bill for months. They blocked a fair yes-or-no vote, Mr. Speaker, because I believe they know if it were on the floor, it would likely pass. 
   Mr. Speaker, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi control the Democrat Party here in this Congress. They oppose drilling. They have fought and blocked it for years. Every time drilling has come up they've said ``no, no, no.'' And this bill is just more of the same because it says no drilling in Alaska, no to truly lifting the offshore drilling ban, no to opening up oil shale in the western United States, no to hydropower as a renewable energy source, no to non-carbon emitting nuclear power, no to building new refineries here in America, and no to clean coal and coal-to-liquid technology. The only thing that the Democrat bill says yes to are tax increases, permanent bans on drilling, and continued high prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I conclude my opening remarks, I want to shine the light on an area of this bill that has not gotten much attention, partly because no one had a copy to read this bill before 9:45 last night. 
   Of serious concern are the costly new mandates included in the national Renewable Energy Standard that this bill creates. The most likely and certain result of this is to increase the power bills of almost every American family and business that it affects. That's right, Mr. Speaker, the Democrat bill isn't going to lower gas prices, but it will increase power bills. 
   The most egregious of it all is that this new mandate is slanted and biased by saying solar and wind power are renewable under the standard, but that hydropower isn't. This discrimination against hydropower is absolutely ridiculous. Hydropower is the most abundant source of renewable energy in our country. Hydropower is renewable, clean, non-emitting, non-polluting, and a reliable energy source. 
   Mr. Speaker, those are the facts. 
   And consider this; if capturing the sun shining and the wind blowing is renewable energy, then so is water running downhill, which is precisely what hydro is all about. But believe it or not, it is not renewable by definition under this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Democrats--who just days ago were proudly declaring their career-long opposition to oil drilling--are suddenly preaching the merits of this self-proclaimed drilling bill, you know, it's really hard not to laugh, except for the fact that families, workers, farmers, schools and small businesses are struggling under the high cost of gasoline, and really this Democrat Congress is doing nothing to help. 
   Instead of real solutions to real problems of high gas and energy prices that Americans are facing, this Democrat Congress has chosen to look after themselves in writing this bill. What do I mean by that? This bill will do nothing, nothing but give Democrats a talking point and a 30-second television commercial where they can smile and claim that they are supporting drilling for American oil. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this unfair rule and this sham bill. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this morning, our Democrat colleagues spoke about the need to ``pay as you go'' as that relates to government spending. They insisted that if we are going to extend existing tax relief to protect Americans from big tax increases, that those tax extenders must be paid for. So that is, to put it another way, to have tax relief, they insist on having massive tax increases. This is the reason that the House Democrats are staying away from passing a bipartisan compromise tax relief bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 93-2 and which President Bush said he would sign into law. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me repeat again; these are tax extenders, meaning that tax relief currently exists for the people I'm going to mention here, and without action, taxes will go up; like tuition deduction for students. That means that tuition will go up for students trying to improve themselves. State and local sales tax deductions for States that don't have an income tax. There are seven States; my State of Washington, Florida, Texas, and others, are involved in that. There is a research and development credit to enhance and help businesses innovate to help the economy move. That would go away also. And also, for our teachers that are teaching our school children, they get an expense deduction when they have to go out and buy other materials in order to teach the students that they are teaching.     
   Also just another example, there are many more examples, Mr. Speaker, is more standard deduction for real property taxes, when they are feeling the crunch right now, that should stay. These are current tax reduction principles that are in place. 
   But in order to put them in place, the Democrats would increase taxes in another way. Now that was what they were talking about this morning. It is now 3:45 this afternoon. And the tune of the remarks that they were making as relates to PAYGO has changed, because now they are proposing to increase government spending by billions and billions of dollars. 
   But it, Mr. Speaker, is not paid for. 
   So when it comes to lower taxes and preventing tax increases, Democrats insist on raising taxes. But when it comes to government spending, they just spend and spend and spend with no concern on how it's going to be paid for. I just want to kind of get a handle on this. Where is the impassioned opposition to deficit spending that came from those that opposed the tax extenders from those within the Democrat Party? The Democrat pay-as-you-go promise has been revealed unfortunately just today as nothing more than something that is hollow and meaningless. And it is really nothing, if you look at the examples, but an excuse to raise taxes. 
   Democrat leaders claim that this economic stimulus bill, this is a job creation bill, yet nothing could be better for our economy in creating jobs than ensuring the extension of the tax relief that I was talking about in just those small examples. But it is the House Democrats who are refusing to allow the House to vote on a bipartisan tax bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 93-2. 
   Tax increases would hurt our economy and cost jobs. History is full of examples like that. Yet House Democrats won't even let this House, the people's House, have a vote on a Senate bill that is focused on lowering taxes and not raising them. So House Democrats are the only ones that are standing in the way of tax relief and tax fairness from becoming law. And again, Mr. Speaker, this is existing tax law. 
   Just this morning, I spoke with the junior Democrat Senator from Washington State, my State, MARIA CANTWELL, who, by the way, is a member of the Senate Finance Committee. And she helped put this tax relief package together in the Senate. She called me because of her deep concern that the House's action or refusing to act might put this bill in jeopardy. I fully agree with her. And I told her that I am committed in a bipartisan way of supporting her work in voting on the Senate bill, and I said that yesterday, if of course the House Democrats would quit blocking the vote. 
   So here we are. Rather than voting on the Senate tax relief bill to help our economy, the House chooses to consider this cobbled-together appropriations bill. Now I have talked about this before. And it's probably well known. But the House Appropriations Committee unfortunately has failed to pass into law even one of the 12 annual appropriation bills to fund this government despite the fact that the fiscal year ends in only 4 days. That committee has failed to do its job of passing these bills unfortunately. I might say, and this is also well known, in the middle of a committee markup last summer, House Democrats just gaveled the meeting to a close, and they got up and walked out. 
   So now the House is considering this appropriation bill that was first unveiled to us around 9:30 this morning. And of course it was revealed without any consultation from House Republicans. So it would have to have been written in total secret if that is the case. And with this rule that we are considering, the House Democrats are now closing down any Member from offering any amendment to improve, to add, or even to subtract if one would desire, or to offer their own ideas on this spending bill. 
   It is a closed rule. And it has set another record in this Congress for having closed rules. I don't believe, Mr. Speaker, that this is a serious effort to stimulate the economy and create jobs because the Senate has defeated even considering a stimulus package in that body. So this bill isn't going to go anywhere. And frankly I think we all know that. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me address another issue that we have had a great deal of discussion on in the past 2 days, and that is the issue of the Secure Rural Schools Act. This program affects hundreds of rural counties and thousands of school districts across the country. And these school districts and counties are running out of money. As a result, they are laying off teachers and closing lunchrooms. And frankly they are in deep pain. But this bill does nothing to help them. We were told this week by House Democrats that Rural Schools was left out of the tax bill because it's not paid for. But now they bring an unpaid-for appropriation bill to the floor and they left out Rural Schools in this bill. 
   House Democrats say Rural Schools isn't a tax bill because it's not a tax issue. I guess I can concede that. Then when we have an appropriations and spending bill, why then would you leave out Rural Schools because clearly it's a spending bill? 
   Mr. Speaker, I think this House needs to stop with the excuses, to stop wasting time, and stop paying lip service to these rural communities and the thousands of kids that attend schools in these communities. 
   In the Senate tax bill there is a provision to extend the Rural Schools Act for 4 years, 4 years, to help them. But the House apparently won't let us even vote on that proposition. So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop standing in the way. Let's get on with this business as this Congress winds down. 
   And with that I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this proposed rule would provide for consideration of the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill, the seventh out of 12 appropriation bills to be considered by the House this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased that for the seventh time we are considering this appropriations bill under an open rule that allows every Member of the House the opportunity to come to the floor and to offer his or her amendment to the bill. Except for in the instance earlier this year when the House considered the final fiscal year 2007 spending bill, which allocated $463 billion of taxpayer dollars while denying all Members of the House the opportunity to amend the bill, this rule continues a long-standing tradition of openness on spending bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill provides over $607 billion to support the Federal Government's role in labor, health and education programs. Of this total, over $455 billion, or 75 percent, is comprised of spending for government programs that grow automatically every year with little congressional review. For the next fiscal year alone, these programs will increase by an estimated $54 billion, nearly 12 percent, which I might add, Mr. Speaker, is three or four times the rate of inflation. 
   Without question, these programs pose the largest threat to our long-term economic health because they essentially run on autopilot with little accountability to the taxpayers writing the checks. If we want to get spending under control, it is vital that we take a hard look at these programs sooner rather than later. 
   The remaining money in this appropriations bill is set by Congress each  year. For the last fiscal year, $144 billion was provided to support the Federal Government's role in labor, health and education programs, but for the upcoming fiscal year, the underlying bill provides for $151 billion, an increase of $7 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I support some of the increases in the bill, such as an increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, I do have concerns with the overall increased spending level in this difficult budget year. I believe that Congress must always stop and remember that we are spending the American taxpayers' money when considering appropriations bills. Each time a decision is made to spend more money, taxpayers face a higher tax bill or the deficit faces an increase in leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill. Therefore, we must take a balanced approach that provides for the general welfare of our Nation while reducing the deficit. 
   It's important that taxpayers are aware that under the Democrat majority's budget plan, each taxpayer faces an average $3,000 increase in their Federal tax bill in order to pay for the Democrats' spending spree over the next 5 years, as reflected in their budget. 
   Throwing money at all of our Nation's problems will not make them go away. The American people expect more of Congress. They expect us to tackle the difficult issues, make tough decisions and lower the deficit through fiscal restraint. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Democrat majority approved what I consider an irresponsible budget plan that calls for more spending now followed by massive tax increases in the future. Their budget plan only called for one committee, the Education and Labor Committee, to find cost savings, and that turned out, Mr. Speaker, to be a mere $750 million over 5 years. 
   In comparison, when Republicans were in control, the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution called on eight House and Senate committees to find a total of $35 billion in savings over 5 years. As a result, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the Deficit Reduction Act, which saved American taxpayers $38 billion. 
   House Resolution 531 provides for the consideration of the Democrat majority's attempt to rein in spending, the College Cost Reduction Act. However, Mr. Speaker, this bill is nothing more than an illusion. While the bill does find savings, it immediately spends most of it, $18 billion, to create nine new entitlement programs. These entitlement programs, which grow automatically every year without congressional review, pose the largest threat to our long-term economic health. Essentially, these programs run on auto pilot with no accountability to the taxpayers writing the check. 
   Entitlement programs currently today make up well over half of the Federal budget and in the next decade will consume nearly two-thirds of our budget. History has proven that once an entitlement program is created, it lives forever, and even improving these programs has proven to be a very difficult task. 
   Taxpayers will be paying for the new entitlement programs created under this proposal for at least 5 years and likely for many years to come, thus wiping out any savings that may be achieved with this bill in the short term. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I share the goal of increasing access to higher education. Education in general  is very important to the future of our country. But there are many approaches the Democrat majority has chosen to take in this bill that shifts the responsibility for personal decisions made by students to the taxpayers. For instance, this bill guarantees that borrowers, no matter how much they borrow, will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their income in loan payments and allows the borrowers to have the balance of their loans disappear, disappear, Mr. Speaker, after 20 years and thus be paid for by the American taxpayer. This bill also requires those same taxpayers to pick up the outstanding student loan tab for public sector employees after just 10 years. Now, Mr. Speaker, while I agree we should encourage people to enter the public sector, I feel this approach places too heavy a fiscal burden on American taxpayers. 
   I believe that we must do all that we can do to make education more affordable for those who wish to pursue their education so that more Americans can achieve the dream of graduating from college. With tuition costs on the rise, students and their families are facing the inevitable question of how to pay for college education. The cost of attaining a college degree has increased over the years, and students are finding it increasingly difficult to pay for college without financial assistance. 
   So I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we must take a balanced approach that increases the transparency of higher education costs and targets aid to the neediest students while controlling spending and lowering the deficit.     
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will support the McKeon substitute amendment, which increases the maximum Pell Grant award by $350 next year and $100 thereafter and provides a plan for improved accountability with regard to tuition costs. 
   If the McKeon amendment is not adopted, I will oppose the College Cost Reduction Act, which increases a maze of Federal regulations and bureaucracy for students and parents to navigate, directs more resources to institutions of higher education rather than students, and creates new entitlement spending at the long-term expense of the American taxpayer. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, 19 amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee. Sadly, the Democrats only allowed one single amendment to be considered, as the ranking member pointed out. Even more concerning is that this rule provides that the Miller manager's amendment shall be considered as adopted once this resolution is adopted, if in fact it is adopted. 
   They have carefully chosen to self-execute this amendment which does  not allow for a separate debate or clarification on the amendment, and the maneuver prohibits Members from voting specifically on the Miller manager's amendment. Members should be aware that the Miller manager's amendment reduces the amount of short-term savings to taxpayers. 
   In addition, if this rule is adopted, the misdirected College Cost Reduction Act can be fast-tracked through the Senate and therefore protected from filibuster. 
   So I am asking my colleagues to not only vote ``no'' on this restrictive rule, but also to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can amend the rule to allow the House to consider the amendment offered by Mr. Castle of Delaware and provide the appropriate waivers. 
   As the ranking member pointed out, the Castle amendment would simply end the entitlements in this bill. I think that is a very important policy statement. Further, the savings from these entitlements would go to increase the Pell Grants by $100 in the next 2 years and $50 through 2018. So by defeating the previous question, we will give Members the ability to vote on the merits of the amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, there are two primary purposes to the rule that is before the House today. One purpose, legitimate, though unfair, relating to the defense authorization bill. The other purpose, a unilateral, partisan abuse of power by the liberal leaders of the House. 
   The first purpose. This rule provides for consideration of 58 amendments to the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. Of the 58 amendments that this rule makes in order, 42 are Democrat amendments. Just 14 Republican amendments were allowed. Two of those amendments have bipartisan support. 
   The Rules Committee has blocked two-thirds of the amendments submitted by members of the Republican Party. Reasonable, responsible amendments that raise legitimate national defense issues relating to the security of American troops and the American people are not being permitted to be debated on the House floor. 
   The defense authorization bill was approved by a unanimous bipartisan support, Mr. Speaker, of the Armed Services Committee. But that does not mean that that bill is perfect. Indeed, amendments to the bill were filed with the Rules Committee by both Democrats and Republican members of the Armed Services Committee. These members, who had worked in a bipartisan way in committee and who wanted to have their ideas for improving the defense authorization bill considered by the House, were denied that opportunity, and among those amendments that were blocked by the Rules Committee is the ranking Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, for whom this bill is named. 
   At the same time we are applauding those committee members for their bipartisan work, the Rules Committee steps in and shuts down what has been an open, cooperative process by blocking so many Republican amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House should recognize that when a committee works in an open and honest manner to produce a truly bipartisan bill, we should recognize that, especially because it has become a rarity in this Congress. 
   Despite the promises made by the Democrat leaders to run the most open and honest House in history, they have made it a matter of routine to close down debate, take away the ability of every Representative to offer amendments on the House floor, to defy rules,  and to ignore over 200 years of legislative precedents. Yet, Mr. Speaker, this House has never seen anything the likes of what the Democrat leaders did last night with the vote to override the President's veto of the farm bill. 
   Despite having full knowledge that the bill that the Speaker of the House certified with her signature and sent to the President was not the exact same bill that passed both the House and the Senate, Democrat leaders deliberately acted to have this House vote on overriding the President's veto. The bill that the Speaker sent to the President completely omitted title III of the farm bill. This is the entire trade section that runs several dozen pages. 
   It has been asserted that deletion of this title from the farm bill that the Speaker sent to the President was simply a mistake, an oversight, or a technical error. That may very well be. That may very well be, Mr. Speaker. Yet Democrat leaders deliberately acted yesterday to have the House vote to override a Presidential veto on a bill that the House had never, ever passed. They took this action in direct contradiction to the simple procedures established in article I, section 7 of the United States Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I have often spoken to elementary and high school students about my job as a Congressman and how Congress works. The most fundamental lesson I always convey is how a bill becomes law in this Congress. It's very simple. The House and the Senate must pass the exact same bill. It must be exact. No comma difference. When they do that, the bill is sent to the President to be signed into law or vetoed and returned to the Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, this did not happen with the farm bill. The bill passed by both the House and the Senate was not the bill that the Speaker of the House signed and sent to the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week I stood right here on the House floor and stated that while I believed that the farm bill was far from perfect, I would vote for the bill because of the positive provisions it included for specialty crop growers in my congressional district. 
   In my speech to the House and in my communications with my constituents, I specifically cited parts of the farm bill that helped convince me to vote to pass it. In particular, I spoke about the Market Access Program in reference to technical trade assistance for specialty crops, both of which help to break down unfair trade barriers and open new markets for farmers overseas. Both 
   of these programs are part of title III of the farm bill which passed the House and Senate but was not sent to the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, the farm bill I voted for, and the very reasons I voted for it, was not the bill that the House voted to override yesterday. 
   Democrat leaders of this Congress acted in an unconstitutional way in voting to override the veto vote yesterday. That the leaders acted unconstitutionally is not a matter of my personal opinion, it is a matter that has been ruled upon by the United States Supreme Court. In a 6-3 majority opinion written by Justice Stevens in the 1998 line-item veto case, Clinton v. The City of New York, the court concluded, and I quote: 
   ``The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a 500-page document that became Public Law 105-33 after three procedural steps were taken. One, a bill containing its exact text was approved by a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives. Two, the Senate approved precisely the same text. Three, that text was signed into law by the President. The Constitution explicitly requires that each of these three steps be taken before a bill may `become a law.' Article 1, section 7. If one paragraph of that text had been omitted at any one of those three stages, Public Law 105-33 would not have been validly enacted.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, last night it wasn't until Republicans objected that the Democrat majority took any action to speak on the floor and inform the House of what had occurred by the omission of title III of the bill. The Democrat majority then responded, as they have for the past 16 months, by choosing the path of unilateral, partisan action over working in a bipartisan way. Keep in mind, this farm bill passed by over 300 votes in a bipartisan way. 
   As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, there are two parts to this rule. The first makes in order amendments to the defense authorization bill. The second provides blanket authority for any bill relating to agricultural programs to be considered under suspension of the House rules. 
   The inclusion of this blanket authority to suspend House rules and consider bills was not even discussed with Republicans. I say that with the knowledge I have as I speak here today, right now, at 10:39 a.m. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that this is simply an effort to fix the farm bill. Mr. Speaker, I voted for the farm bill and I support getting it enacted into law. But this isn't just about a fix or finding the most convenient or face-saving way to act on the farm bill. It's about following the Constitution and holding Democrat leaders accountable for their deliberate actions yesterday, Mr. Speaker. 
   They knew the bill they put to an override vote yesterday had never passed the House in the version that it was presented to us for the override, but they did it anyway. The House should not gloss over an incident of this magnitude with such serious constitutional violations. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from California, I just want to make this point, and this is a very, very important point. Yesterday, prior to taking up the veto override of the farm bill, the Democrat leaders knew that title III was out of the bill. Therefore, it was not a bill that had passed either House. Therefore, the ultimate rule of this land, the Constitution, was violated. 
   It was at that point, Mr. Speaker, that there should have been discussions on how to remedy this in a way, but there was no discussions on that, at least with the leaders on our side. Yet we went ahead with the action of overriding a veto, overriding a bill that the House had not passed. 
   That is what the facts were yesterday, and it was not brought to the full House's attention until the leaders on our side stood up after the vote to ask what the procedures were for clarification. Had we known that ahead of time, we probably could have gone through regular order and got this resolved in such a way that would have been acceptable to all sides. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the namesake of the bill that we are debating later on, the Duncan Hunter Defense Authorization Act of 2009. The gentleman from California served as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He has been somebody that I have looked up to in my years in Congress. He probably, if not the most knowledgable person in this House on military affairs, he is certainly one of the most. 
   I yield 3 minutes to my friend from California (Mr. Hunter).

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I woke up today and heard on the news that oil is $137 a barrel on the worldwide market, and I think it's time for the House to debate ideas. I know there are a number of ideas in this House on lowering the cost of gasoline specifically. 
   So I'm going to ask my colleagues to vote to defeat the previous question so that this House can finally consider solutions to rising energy costs. When the previous question is defeated, I will move to add a section to the rule, not rewrite the entire rule. But that section would say it shall be in order to consider any amendment to the bill which the proponent asserts, if enacted, would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gasoline. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the previous question.

   Let me clear up this issue here about the time requirements. The rules of the House say there shall be a 72-hour, or 3-day layover on these bills. That was waived. That was waived by the majority party. Then as a courtesy in their ``new directions,'' they say it should be at least 24 hours. So here they are even waiving a promise of a waiving of a rule of 3 days. 
   So I wanted to clarify that. It is supposed to be 3 days, that is the premise from which we start, and then we come down to a promise of 24 hours. They are even waiving that promise.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I will say right up front I intend to support title I and the rules package, and I take literally what the gentleman, my friend from Florida, talked about what we can expect from the Rules Committee when we restructure, hopefully next week, as to the timing and so forth of the business that we take up. 
   But I want to talk about one issue that is not addressed in the proposed changes for the 110th that is in the 109th package, and that is, the requirement to have recorded votes in the Rules Committee. 
   What the provision in the bill and the proposed changes say is that the Rules members now will comply as the Ethics Committee does. I was the chairman of the Ethics Committee in the last Congress and the ranking member in this Congress, and we have recorded votes in those committees, but we have the option of making them public or not. 
   Under the proposed rules packages, for the life of me, I cannot understand why that needs to be extended to the Rules Committee. It is obvious for the Committee on Official Standards, it is obvious there. But why it is in the Rules Committee is beyond what I can understand. Now, I do understand one of the reasons is that if there are errors, then you would certainly want to be able to correct those errors. 
   My first term was the 104th Congress, and that is when we made some major changes in voting. Since that time, there have been 1,304 recorded votes in the Rules Committee; the number of errors in the rules report in those 12 years is zero. And I think one of the reasons why is because this is a committee of only 13. There are nine Democrats and there are four Republicans in this Congress. It was the reverse in the last Congress. As a matter of fact, I would suggest that you could probably, on most of those votes, predict what the outcome is going to be. 
   So why, for the life of me, we would want to take the transparency of the Rules Committee away from public knowledge is absolutely beyond me. It just simply doesn't make any sense. 
   So I enthusiastically support adopting the rules of the 109th Congress. It would be my wish that that would be the rules for the 110th Congress, but we are going to debate that later and we will see what happens. But, again, why we want to take transparency out of votes in the Rules Committee, and I understand there will be new members on your side, why they won't want to stand the transparency for their constituency is beyond me.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady and chairman of the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in just 5 days, fiscal year 2007 will come to an end and a new fiscal year will begin. I am disappointed that this rule and the underlying continuing resolution are on the floor today. Not one, let me repeat that, not one spending bill has been sent to the President for his signature this year. 
   Congress has a responsibility to fund the priorities of the government, and here we are, just days before the start of a new fiscal year, and not one of the 12 spending bills that must be signed into law have been signed. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I will support the underlying continuing resolution because I recognize the government must continue to be funded. It is my strong hope, however, that within the next 6 weeks, 12 separate conference reports will come before the House of Representatives. 
   I do not believe that omnibus bills are the best vehicles for spending billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, and I truly hope that that will not be what we end with on November 16. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a disappointing day for the American people. Here we are, nearly 9 months into this Congress controlled by the Democrat majority, and still the majority has failed to live up to their promises by denying every American taxpayer accountability when it comes to transparency of earmarks. 
   Just yesterday, a challenge was made to an earmark slipped into a bill 299 pages long that had not been disclosed. The Democrat majority certified the bill was ``earmark free,'' but then denied all accountability and scrutiny of this earmark. 
   It is vital that the House act today to allow the House to debate openly and honestly the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills, such as the SCHIP bill yesterday, and not just on appropriation bills. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that they may amend the rule to allow for immediate consideration of House Resolution 479, the Earmark Accountability bill. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House will be able to consider the continuing resolution today, but will also be able to address earmark enforceability in order to restore the credibility of this House. 
   By considering and approving House Resolution 479, we will send a strong message to the American taxpayers that this House will no longer turn its head the other way when it comes to transparency of earmarks. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the war on terror began, the Rules Committee has granted an open rule for every wartime supplemental spending bill brought to the floor, thus giving every Member an opportunity to offer an amendment and have their say on those supplemental bills. 
   In the Rules Committee last night, we heard passionate testimony from several Members on both sides of the aisle. Some Members spoke about the need to continuing funding our troops to complete our mission, while others offered hard deadlines for withdrawal, regardless of consequence. 
   In the end, over 50 amendments were offered to the Rules Committee to be made in order for consideration on the House floor today. Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, not one single amendment, let me repeat that, not one of the 50 amendments will be allowed to be considered by the full House. And, Mr. Speaker, I am truly disappointed with that. 
   The bill we have before us today contains restrictions on funding and conditions on what our troops are able to do that are simply, to me, unacceptable. We have military leaders for a reason. Making 435 Members of Congress commanders in the field is a formula for failure, which I am deeply concerned will have a long-term consequence on our security here at home. 
   By placing restrictions on funds, hamstringing our military and calling for an arbitrary withdrawal, this bill will jeopardize the ability of our troops to do their jobs to defend America. 
   A wartime spending bill, Mr. Speaker, should have, above all else, to provide the support that our men and women in uniform need to accomplish their mission. By placing conditions on funding, this bill fails to do that. Conditions on funding make it impossible for our military leaders and our troops on the ground to respond to ever-changing conditions on the battlefield. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill has more than just military funding. And I am disappointed now that it is only now, in an effort to attract votes for a bad bill that we know will never be signed into law, the Democrat leadership has decided to include in this bill an extension of rural county payments. 
   I tried earlier this year to attach an extension to another bill. That bill became law. I also tried to have a long-term extension brought up on a vote, but the Democrat leadership said no, time and time again. Allowing the extension to come to the floor only on a bill that we know will be vetoed amounts to nothing more than false promises. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, no one in this House takes more seriously than I do the rules governing confidentiality of matters before the House Ethics Committee. 
   Each of us privileged to serve on the committee signs an oath pledging not to disclose information related to our work in the committee except as authorized under our committee rules. 
   During nearly 8 years of service on the Ethics Committee, including 2 years as the chairman, I have never found it necessary to disclose committee documents or any other privileged information. Mr. Speaker, that changed yesterday when it became clear that the Democrat leadership would, indeed, force Members to vote on a proposed independent ethics entity. 
   You see, I knew, and Chairwoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones knew, something that the other Members of this House did not know. Several months ago, we had been advised by the nonpartisan, professional attorneys at the Ethics Committee that they believed the proposed independent ethics entity would infringe upon Members' due process protections under the rules of the House and that it would seriously hamper the Ethics Committee's ability to carry out its important responsibilities. 
   When the ranking member of the bipartisan task force, Mr. Smith of Texas, sent a letter asking for our committee's official comments on Representative Capuano's proposal, I took his request to Chairwoman Tubbs Jones and asked her to prepare a formal response with me to the ranking member of that task force. I did so because I felt strongly that the proposed entity would so greatly impact the work of the Ethics Committee that it would be irresponsible, Mr. Speaker, irresponsible not to share with task force members our official views of this plan. 
   Last night, in a Dear Colleague letter to every Member of this House, that was printed in the Congressional Record, it was printed in Roll Call, it was printed in other publications, Representative Tubbs Jones has attempted to rewrite the history on this issue. 
   For reasons that I have trouble fathoming, she now claims, and I quote, Mr. Speaker, ``Both Representative Hastings and I agreed that the Ethics Committee could not and should not give advice to the committee charged by House leadership with reviewing the ethics process itself.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. I could not possibly have stated more clearly to Mrs. Tubbs Jones my desire to respond fully and jointly to Ranking Member Smith's request for guidance on how the task force proposal would affect our committee. 
   Now I recognize the difficulty that she must have explaining to her colleagues why she did not believe that they should be made aware of the concerns expressed by our nonpartisan attorneys on the committee. But, Mr. Speaker, those attorneys don't work for her and they don't work for me. They work for every Member of this House. So, I don't understand, I didn't understand then and I don't understand now, why my distinguished colleague, the gentlelady from Ohio, sought to keep that information from every Member of the House, but she did. And I do not stand by and permit her to call into question my integrity on setting that record straight, as I did so with a letter I sent out to every Member, along with the e-mail of the attorneys on their advice on that issue. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, Members should be advised that this is not the first time that I have had to set the record straight following ill-considered public comments by Representative Tubbs Jones. Last June, she issued a press release declaring that the Ethics Committee would empanel an investigative subcommittee into the matter of Representative William Jefferson. Under the committee's rules, Representative Tubbs Jones had no authority to issue such a statement and lacked the authority to establish such a subcommittee. She not only knew that such an action would require a bipartisan vote of the committee, but she also knew that the committee had never voted on the matter. And she knew, Mr. Speaker, that I had pressed her for months to reestablish the Jefferson subcommittee which had lapsed at the end of the last Congress before it completed its work. And I said so, Mr. Speaker, when she issued that because she did not consult with me and ask me to give permission for her to release that statement. She simply did not do so. So, once again, I cannot fathom her reason for making such an inaccurate and irresponsible statement as I mentioned earlier. 
   Mr. Speaker, I make no apology to this House for insisting that Members benefit from the advice and counsel of the skilled attorneys at the Ethics Committee before voting on a proposed independent entity. After all, Mr. Speaker, this affects them. I'm a Member, also, of the Rules Committee. And at the Rules Committee 2 weeks ago, when we had testimony on this issue, I expressed my concern then as to what would come of this outside entity. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I resent the claim by Representative Tubbs Jones that I have violated the rules of the House and the Ethics Committee in this manner. As she no doubt intended, Representative Tubbs Jones' false allegations have now made their way into the news, bringing further discredit to the House. But most disturbing, Mr. Speaker, is her public threat to use her position as chairman of the House Ethics Committee to bring sanctions against me. Such a threat can only be motivated by a desire to intimidate and embarrass, while distracting attention from her decision to keep every Member of this House from receiving information that I think every Member deserved to have before we voted on that proposal last night. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think her action in calling into question and impugning my reputation, and what she did last night, is wrong, and I think she failed in her effort of trying to do that. 
   So I rise today, point of personal privilege, to point out the history of this, and my position, and the reason why I felt that every Member of this House had to have this important information, notwithstanding the fact that we had a very short time frame to even debate the matter at hand. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, with that, I appreciate your indulgence. And I would like to yield time to my friend from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that that was the response, because let me go back and again review this, at least chronologically on the issue that we debated last night and my involvement with that and my involvement with the professional attorneys that wrote their opinion on the impact this would have on the ethics process. 
   I was sent a letter by the ranking member, Mr. Smith of Texas, the first part of November. It was addressed to me. It was also addressed to the committee. We had our regularly scheduled meetings at that time, and I asked the chairwoman that I think that we should respond to this in a way, and in further fact, would you be interested, and she said no. I said okay, I respect that. But the attorneys went about their business, as was asked, and rendered their thoughts on what this would do to the whole committee process. 
   Now, this was in November, Mr. Speaker. That plan of this outside group was not made public until the end of December. There was time, I am not sure of the exact time frame, when those attorneys went down and consulted with the task force. There is a bipartisan group there, at least from a staff standpoint, I am not sure, because I wasn't a member of that task force, but I was advised that they went down and shared their concerns. So there was some involvement from our staff attorneys with the task force on the issue and the policy, and I want to emphasize this, Mr. Speaker, on the policy that would confront the House later on. 
   Now, two weeks ago when I was in the Rules Committee, I am a member of the Rules Committee, we had what I thought was a very, very good discussion when Mr. Capuano and Mr. Smith came up and testified on the merits or demerits of this outside bill. There was a lot of angst on the other side, I have to say. The distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee expressed her displeasure at that time, and my other colleagues on the Rules Committee did too. But we had a very, very open discussion. And I expressed at that time, Mr. Speaker, what I thought would be at least a partial remedy for the ethics process.     
   I felt that there needs to be more transparency some way while still keeping and not violating confidentiality. I thought that Mr. Smith's position was a very, very good position the way it was set up, and I felt that should have at least been debated on the floor. That's probably another issue. 
   But as this process moved forward, and the fact that, I believe it was 2 weeks ago the issue was pulled from the floor, the distinguished majority leader said new information has come to us. That information came in Mr. Smith's proposal. He said it deserves looking into. 
   At that time, if my memory serves me correctly, Mr. Wamp and Mr. Hill, Republican and Democrat, both stood up and announced that they too had a bipartisan suggestion that should be looked at. So I thought, well, okay, maybe this will go in a way that I think is very beneficial. 
   I have long felt, and I said at that Rules Committee meeting before, that when you do ethics you need to do it in a bipartisan way. It has been alluded to. My friend, Mr. Hulshof, made this observation earlier on. 
   I am absolutely convinced in this body you cannot, you cannot make ethics legislation unilaterally. It comes back to bite you because of the nature, I guess, of the issue. We painfully learned that, as Mr. Hulshof pointed out in his remarks. I have stated this a number of times upstairs in the Rules Committee when this issue has come up. 
   I thought this task force, frankly, moving forward, would be a way to settle that. But as we know, we had a great deal of problems on our side of the aisle with an outside group. It apparently couldn't come to an agreement on that. As a result it went forward unilaterally. 
   At that time, I felt that the information, the information that our professional attorneys downstairs had come up with the proposal, was worthy to be shared by everybody in this House so that we could make a determination as to what is the best course for the institution. Sometimes I truly believe that we think too much in 2-year cycles, which coincides with our term. I think we ought to think longer term. I really think that the rules change that we made last night was the wrong rules change, but that will be judged, I suppose in the future. 
   I came to the conclusion, knowing that this memo was there, and so I went, had a meeting with the distinguished chairwoman and, again, consulted with her. She, of course, disagreed with my position, and I said that I was going to do so, and I did. Now, before I released that, I might say, I asked my staff to contact the chairwoman's staff to let her know that I was going to go forward with this, which, of course, I did. 
   I was very surprised when I came to the floor and saw this letter that was sent out. Thus I felt that I needed to rise today on a point of personal privilege to explain my position. 
   I suppose, like all positions that we have, and positions that we take in this body, there is always more than what is on the surface. I felt that needed to be explained as fully as I possibly could. But I have to say if I am guilty of anything, that my motivation was to allow the Members of this body to get as much information as possible. I have had Members from the other side of the aisle last night and this morning  who came up to me and said I wonder why this information didn't want to be shared. Well, I don't know that. I don't have the answer to that. 
   But I felt absolutely within my rights, without violating the rules of the committee or the House, to share that with all of my colleagues. I did so, and I did so in a way that I think is in the best tradition of this House for as much openness as we can possibly have. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time. I thank the House for its indulgence, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   The procedures of the Ethics Committee are not perfect, and I firmly believe this House should make modifications to those procedures to better protect the integrity of the House and the faith of the American people. However, Mr. Speaker, this House must act carefully and deliberately in making any improvements, and it must be done in a bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker, that is not happening. 
   No consideration of a bipartisan reform proposal is permitted on the floor tonight. The House floor is shut down to any debate. No alternative is allowed to be considered. No amendment may be offered. No respect, Mr. Speaker, is offered to the concerns expressed by both Democrat and Republican Members of this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2005, at the beginning of the 109th Congress, Democrat leaders decried House rule changes that were written only by Republican leaders. Democrats demanded bipartisanship and a fair say in the rules that governs the ethics of House Members. Democrats weren't given any say then, and those one-way changes to the rules were ultimately reversed during the 109th Congress. It is now 3 years later, and the same Democrat leaders have abandoned their calls for bipartisanship and are refusing to work across the aisle to make bipartisan improvements to the ethics process. 
   Mr. Speaker, Republicans were wrong to do it in 2005 and Democrats are wrong doing it today. In fact, since the new Democrat majority took office a little over a year ago, this House has already had to go back twice and correct poorly written rules that Democrats passed without any input from Republicans. In both instances, Mr. Speaker, Democrat-written rules that the House had to go back and fix were ethics rules. 
   The House should learn from the mistakes of the past several years and not doom ourselves to repeat history by failing to insist that ethics changes be done in a bipartisan way. For the ethics process to work, bipartisanship is vital. Without bipartisanship, the process will fail. 
   Bipartisanship is not always easy, but it is absolutely necessary for the legitimacy of the entire ethics process. Without bipartisanship, the process degenerates into politically motivated actions, or witch hunts. 
   This proposal is not a good proposal, and no one, Mr. Speaker, is more disappointed than I. Because Members of the Ethics Committee are asked to do an unwelcomed job. We do it by the rules of the House. And by the rules of the House, we must remain silent, even when subjected to relentless and often inaccurate criticism and attacks on our actions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, improve the ethics process. Improve the ethics ability to police its Members. Improve our ability to provide timely information to the American people. Improve the bipartisanship that is central to the ability of the ethics process to function. But, Mr. Speaker, for the sake of this institution and for ensuring an ethics process that will function properly, do not act in a partisan way by supporting a proposal written solely by one party. Oppose this proposal and demand bipartisan improvements to the entire ethics process.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and namesake, the gentleman from Florida, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Sadly, the Democrat leaders today are not taking care of the business of this country. They've failed to get their work done because, in my view, they would rather play political games than do the job that Congress and all of us are elected to do. 
   The new fiscal year, Madam Speaker, began 37 days ago, on October 1. Yet not one of the annual funding bills to fund the Federal Government has been signed into law. You have to go back 20 years to find a record this bad. 
   This rule would provide for the consideration of two separate appropriation bills that have been combined together by the Democrat leaders. The Veterans funding bill and funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Education have been forced together in this conference report. These bills have nothing in common, or I should say the only thing they have in common is the fact that they are appropriation bills. 
   They do have one very, very important difference, the difference being callously exploited by the Democrat leaders. The difference is, Madam Speaker, the Veterans funding bill has the votes to pass this Congress and be signed into law, while the Labor, Health and Education spending bill will be vetoed because it increases spending by $10 billion over the President's request. 
   Democrat leaders are using the veterans to try and force through their plan of higher spending. Veterans benefits and veterans health care should not be held hostage. More than 400 of the 435 House Members and over 90 of 100 Senators voted for the veterans spending bill. Yet, Democrat leaders have blocked passage of this bill to be sent to the President since September. For 2 months they have kept the veterans waiting. 
   Madam Speaker, the Democrat leaders know full well this combined spending bill won't be signed into law, but they have chosen to waste our time by having the Congress vote on it anyway. The American people have had enough of this Congress not completing its work and not being serious about the business of this country. The Democrat leaders, in my view, need to stop posturing, stop the game-playing and get serious about doing its job in Congress. 
   Our veterans, Madam Speaker, have already carried a heavy burden for our country. They shouldn't be used by the new majority to carry the burden of passing this agenda of higher spending.     
   Separate these two bills. Let Congress pass a clean funding bill for our veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule that provides for the consideration of a combined conference report destined to be vetoed and sustained. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   My friend from Vermont raised an issue on the issue of combining these bills and suggesting that they are paid for. If the pay-for that they are talking about is what was reflected in the budget document, then that will result over time in the largest tax increase on American citizens in the history of this country. If it is not the largest, it is the second largest. 
   We will reserve the debate on that, because we are talking about appropriation process tonight, but we will reserve that debate for later on this week when there will be a tax extender bill coming to the floor. We can more fully debate how these pay-fors work.

   Mr. Wicker spent a great deal of time as ranking member saying how he worked hand in hand in a bipartisan basis, and all we are saying is that we know that bill has the votes to pass the Congress and be signed into law. I thank the gentleman for making the point, because that's the point we are making. 
   All we are saying is by linking these two bills together, you are going to prolong it because it's going to be vetoed. I will be offering later on a motion to defeat the previous question so we can separate that. I hope the gentleman will vote with us because now we can pass this bill that he extolled in such a very good way.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I have to say that I am disappointed, as I mentioned and others have mentioned, that the Democrat leadership refuses to let the House consider the veterans spending bill, funding bill, separate from funding from the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. 
   This rule provides for the consideration of one conference report that combines two separate spending bills that will be vetoed by the President, and that veto will be sustained. I believe Members of this House should have an opportunity to vote separately on these two distinct measures. 
   Therefore, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule and allow a separate vote on each of the spending measures.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this bill, H.R. 3997, is being considered by the House today and specifically that it includes language similar to the legislation, H.R. 2540, introduced by myself and Congressman Pomeroy. 
   Our legislation was written to assist the families of members of our military and National Guard who are killed while on active duty. It was developed after Congressman Pomeroy and I each met with Mrs. Victoria Johnson from my central Washington district. 
   While grieving the loss of her husband, Major Alan Johnson, Victoria discovered that State law treated her husband as a retiree rather than a brave servicemember. Victoria worked to change State law, and with her support, Congressman Pomeroy and I introduced legislation to ensure that servicemembers who die protecting our Nation will have their time on active military duty counted into their employer's retirement benefits. 
   This simple change ensures that the survivors of our brave servicemembers, like Major Johnson, receive the maximum amount of their loved ones' pension benefits, and are not penalized for their family members' volunteering to serve their country. 
   This is the right thing to do and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to consider a conference report that incorporates several similar measures that have passed the House and Senate authorizing funding for scientific research and increasing the number of students majoring in math, science, engineering and foreign languages. 
   The several bills that passed both Houses were approved by overwhelming bipartisan votes. The authorization level for all of these bipartisan bills combined a total $24 billion in the House. I am concerned, however, that the conference report today contains over $43 billion in overall authorizations, nearly double. 
   It is vital that the United States continue to grow more globally competitive in the areas of scientific research and technology. Federal and private investment in supporting research and development is essential to the health of our economy and our competitiveness as a Nation. 
   We must plan for the future by areas of basic research and science today. 
   However, there is also something we must do today, and that is update our Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act laws. This body has missed several important opportunities to consider changing our laws to account for technological advances, and now we are faced with a limited time remaining before Congress recesses for the August district work period. 
   You can all agree or disagree that our FISA laws need to be updated. All I will be asking my colleagues to do is to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that Members will have the opportunity to debate and consider fixing our outdated FISA law that currently requires our intelligence community to ask a judge permission before listening to telephone conversations of foreign terrorists in foreign countries who threaten our Nation's security. 
   Let me be clear also. If the previous question is defeated, the America COMPETES conference report will still be on the floor today. This is not an attempt whatsoever to delay this conference report. It is only an attempt to bring this issue to the floor as soon as possible, but, more importantly, before the Congress recesses.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2176, BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this bill deals specifically with Indian land claims settlements in Michigan and designating new tribal trust lands that will be used to open any new Indian casinos in two Michigan towns. 
   The Michigan delegation is split in their support and opposition to this legislation, with the two Representatives whose districts will become home to the new casinos being strongly in favor of this proposal. 
   Generally, Mr. Speaker, it has been my long-held view that when it comes  to matters that affect individual congressional districts that the House should give great consideration and deference to the views of the Representatives elected by the voters in those districts. 
   However, I know many of my colleagues join me in having various serious concerns about our Nation's broken Indian gaming law, as well as the troubling issue of Indian tribes seeking to acquire new, prime locations to open casinos where no business or interest would be allowed to do so otherwise, and doing this without the ability of the local community to have a say in the expansion of gambling in their community. 
   These aren't just matters affecting Michigan. They affect States across the Nation. Yet, this House is not being permitted to debate needed improvements to Federal Indian gaming law. 
   This totally closed rule blocks every single Member of this House from coming to the floor and offering an amendment to this bill. The House is being severely restricted and is spending its time refereeing a parochial Michigan dispute instead of addressing the larger, more serious matters confronting other States. 
   This violates the promises made by the liberal leaders of this House to the American people to operate in an open manner. This is not an open process, Mr. Speaker. It's a closed process. It's not open when debate is restricted only to Michigan when, in fact, there are very serious issues affecting many States all across this country. 
   Congress created the ability of Indian tribes to get special treatment in opening casinos, and we've got a duty to police this process. 
   The Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is broken and needs improvement. The simple fact the House is spending several hours today debating this Michigan matter is evidence that the law is broken. 
   If the House is going to spend time debating this subject, we should be fixing the larger problem. And if Congress is going to spend its precious time resolving a Michigan dispute, then we could use some real help in the State of Washington, my home State, where the citizens are seeing a dramatic expansion of Indian gaming, more casinos, bigger casinos, higher betting limits, with big profits being collected, and yet our State doesn't get one dime in revenue sharing. 
   One of the reasons the proponents of this Michigan legislation, including the State's Governor, argue in favor of creating this new tribal land and two new casinos is because it will bring in millions of dollars in more revenue to the government of Michigan. 
   Yet, in my home State of Washington, our State government gets nothing from Indian casinos that generate over $1.3 billion a year in revenue. In fact, there was a proposed revenue sharing of $140 million a year that the Governor of Washington State rejected without input from the citizens of the State or a vote of the State legislature. Some would say, well, your Governor made a terrible deal, and I would, of course, wholeheartedly agree. But there is something seriously wrong if a law allows giveaways of this magnitude to Indian casinos. 
   But instead of allowing the House to discuss and consider amendment on the larger issues of revenue sharing, compact negotiations, and off-reservation gaming, today's debate is restricted just to Michigan. 
   Meanwhile, the liberal leaders of this House continue to refuse to let Representatives consider and vote on solutions to lower the price of gas in our country. 
   Prices are skyrocketing. In Florida, the average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline is $4.03. In Michigan, it's $4.07. In my State of Washington, it's $4.33. That's 31 cents higher than just a month ago and $1.20 higher than a year ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation needs to produce more American-made energy. We have the resources and technology to do it now. Now we just need to get the will of Congress here to allow it. For far too long, our Nation's reserves have been off limits. We can't afford these policies anymore, Mr. Speaker. 
   America has abundant reserves in Alaska, in the West and offshore. Let's produce more oil and natural gas here in our country. 
   But of course, this isn't the only answer. We need to invest in more nuclear power, hydropower, wind, solar, and other new energy sources. But all of this needs to happen in addition to tapping our own oil and gas reserves. 
   Gas prices just keep going up and the liberal leaders of this Congress just can't say ``no'' to American-made energy anymore. 
   Let the House debate proposals to generate more energy here in America. Stop blocking a House vote on tapping into America's oil and gas reserves while the price of gasoline climbs higher and higher. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that the House can right away debate solutions to our higher gasoline prices. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, after I made my opening remarks, my friend from Florida stood up and said that I was on message, and I thank him very, very much for the compliment because I was talking about something that the American people clearly, clearly are concerned about, and that is the high energy costs and particularly the high prices of gasoline. So I think, Mr. Speaker, it's time for the House to debate ideas for lowering prices at the pump and for addressing the skyrocketing price of gasoline. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House will have that opportunity. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule, not rewrite the rule, just amend the rule, to make in order and allow the House to consider H.R. 5656, introduced by Representative Hensarling of Texas. 
   If this House has time to spend several hours debating Indian land claims and new casinos in Michigan, then it certainly has time to debate the high price of gasoline. It's time we start producing more American-made energy. Our country can't afford the knee-jerk, no-to-any-drilling-in-America approach that the liberal leaders of this House still cling to. The citizens of our country can't afford a Congress that does nothing. It's time for this House to act, and defeating the previous question will allow us to do so. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is being asked to swallow this colossal Senate lands bill without any Member having the opportunity to offer amendments or provide input. This is an abdication of our duties as elected Representatives and it means good legislation will continue to sit lingering and waiting for action in the Senate because it's not been included in this packaged bill. 
   There are parts of this massive bill that I do support. In fact, I am the sponsor and author of the bill, H.R. 386, that will convey certain buildings and land from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District. This measure will allow for greater local control of property that is already being used for irrigation purposes. It will also allow the irrigation district to make needed improvements. H.R. 386 passed the House by a vote of 417-0 in February, 2007 and I am pleased that the Senate finally acted on this bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   However, this package excludes many other House passed bills that have been awaiting Senate action, including two of which are of particular interest to me and communities in Central Washington state. 
   The first bill, H.R. 523, passed the House last October by a vote of 377 to zero. This bill would allow for the sale of several parcels of property from the Bureau of Land Management to the Douglas County PUD for both ease and efficiency of management, while ensuring environmental protections. Additionally, the funds generated from this sale would be put towards improving public access to existing BLM lands in Washington state. This creates an opportunity to address some long-standing needs to improve public access to public lands in my state, including for recreation at the Juniper Dunes area. Having passed the House over six months ago without dissent, and also being subject of a positive Senate hearing in February, there is no reason that this bill shouldn't be part of this package. 
   Second, I am frustrated that the Senate did not include H.R. 1285, the Snoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act. This legislation would help facilitate the construction of a modem fire station to serve both local communities and interstate freeway travelers crossing Snoqualmie Pass. The Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue is often the first to respond to emergencies through the pass. This heavily traveled area often sees major snowstorms as well as avalanches. This bill passed the House last July by voice vote and it merits passage by the Senate and to be signed into law. 
   Instead of action on these two bills, there is indefinite delay and no apparent plan for action. I will not be allowed to offer an amendment to add these two non-controversial bills to this Senate package. The House is only given the choice of passing this bill. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues in both the House and the Senate claim that this conglomerate Senate bill mainly includes bills that passed out of the House of Representatives and enjoy strong bipartisan support. Both H.R. 523 as well as H.R. 1285 fit both of those criteria. Why then were they not included in S. 2739 when other bills were included that have never passed the House or had prior Senate Committee approval? 
   I am frustrated and disappointed at the closed manner in which the House is being  forced to vote on this bill. Furthermore, I am concerned at the enormous expansion of federal land ownership and management responsibilities created by this bill when we are not currently able to meet our public lands existing maintenance needs. It is ironic that both of the bills that have been left out of this legislation would, in a responsible way, actually decrease and relieve these demands and stress on current capabilities. 
   For these reasons, I must vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, which I must note, Mr. Speaker, is more time than the entire House Intelligence Committee will be permitted to debate the legislative proposal covered by this rule. The Democrat Rules Committee is allowing just 20 minutes for the members of the Select Committee on Intelligence to debate this Democrat FISA proposal. 
   What is at stake is the safety and security of our Nation to protect us against foreign terrorists threats by modernizing the 1970s electronic surveillance law. The issue before the House is no less than our intelligence community's ability to protect American citizens by monitoring foreign terrorists communicating in foreign places. But the respective members of the Intelligence Committee are to be given only 20 minutes to debate this issue. 
   It appears that Democrat leaders are not content with their record of the most closed rules in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives in shutting down every Member from being permitted to offer amendments on the House floor. So now they are going so far as to restrict the time the House is even permitted to debate bills that they are trying to ram through this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the new Democrat majority took control of the House Rules Committee last January a year ago, they have approved rules that allow other committees far more time to debate matters of far less importance than FISA. For example, H. Res. 214 provided a rule allowing the Transportation Committee 1 hour of floor debate on legislation to ``authorize appropriations for sewer overflow control grants.'' 
   H. Res. 269 gave the Financial Services Committee 1 hour to debate housing assistance for Native Hawaiians. 
   H. Res. 327 gave an hour to the Science and Technology Committee to discuss scholarships for math and science teachers. 
   H. Res. 331 gave the Resources Committee 1 hour of time, not just 20 minutes, but 1 hour of time to debate restoring the ``prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free roaming horses and burros.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle care sincerely about the security of our country and our fellow citizens. But I fail to understand how it could be justified to allow more House floor time to debate overflowing sewers and the killing of wild burros than the members of the Intelligence Committee are allowed today to discuss the urgent needs of FISA. 
   The answer is that Democrat leaders are working overtime to block the  House from voting on a bipartisan compromise bill that has passed the Senate by a vote of 68-29. The bill passed the Senate over a month ago, and on February 12, the Democrat leaders refused to allow the House to even vote on that measure.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, earlier in this debate I put into the Record the January 28 letter from the 21 Blue Dog Democrats to Speaker Pelosi in support of the bipartisan Senate bill. And I'd like to quote from that letter, Mr. Speaker: 
   ``Following the Senate's passage of a FISA bill, it will be necessary for the House to quickly consider FISA legislation to get a bill to the President before the Protect America Act expires in February.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the Protect America Act has expired, as has the entire month of February. But House Democrat leaders have not acted, as these 21 Blue Dog Democrats have asked, on our national security needs. 
   I will quote again from the Blue Dog Democrat letter: ``We have it within our ability to replace the expiring Protect America Act by passing strong bipartisan FISA modernization legislation that can be signed into law, and we should do so. The consequences of not passing such a measure would place our national security at undue risk.'' 
   I regret to say, Mr. Speaker, that for 27 days, our country's national security has been put at undue risk because FISA legislation has not been passed because the Democrat leaders are blocking the House from voting, from even voting on the Senate proposal that passed the Senate by a 68-29 vote. 
   So let me be very clear about what I'm talking about when I'm going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, and why that will be an attempt, or will be a means, by which we can address the Senate bill for the first time in this body, because this, what I'm going to do, is not an ordinary motion. 
   By voting ``no,'' Mr. Speaker, on the previous question, I will seek to amend one specific clause of the rule, H. Res. 1041, so that the House will still be permitted to debate the FISA bill that this underlying rule makes in order; but if that bill, and if that proposal does not pass this body, then the House, under the provision that I'm seeking to amend the rule, will agree to the Senate bill; and, therefore, the bill would be sent to the President to become law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Now, the Senate had their proposal, as I mentioned, and as has been mentioned by our leader, passed by a big margin, 68-29. 
   The House has their version. There's nothing unusual with both Houses in a bicameral legislative body having two versions of the same issue. And the way you generally resolve that is to go to conference and work out the difference. 
   We have not had the opportunity, in this body, to go to conference with the Senate on this bill. Further, we have been denied time and time again to have an opportunity to even vote on the Senate amendments. By defeating the previous question, we will have that opportunity. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote to defeat the previous question so we can amend the rule to have an opportunity to vote and address the Senate bill that passed overwhelmingly. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3667, MISSISQUOI AND TROUT RIVERS WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, my colleague has spoken at length about the reasons--though not as long as I thought he would, let's put it that way--why he believes these stretches of the river in Vermont to be studied for the designation as Wild and Scenic, and it's very clear that he strongly believes in this bill to enact this study. He obviously has a great deal of love for his State when he challenges all of the other 49 States as not being as beautiful, at least indirectly, as Vermont. And I would just point out to him that in my State we have so much geographic diversity as far as beauty is concerned, from one area of the State where we have more rainfall than anyplace in a country--I'm not talking about Seattle; I'm talking about the Olympic Peninsula--to the area where I live, which is a desert area that has in some areas where I live less than 7 inches of rain. So I invite my friend any time he wants to come out to see what real beauty is in a short period of time, and he may want to ask me up there and I might respond to that. 
   But having said all of that, Mr. Speaker, I believe it's fair to say that the American people, frankly, are far less concerned about the rivers in Vermont and are far more concerned about the high price of gasoline and the fact that Congress is not acting right now on real solutions to lower energy costs. 
   The House of Representatives will spend over 2 1/2 hours today discussing rivers in Vermont but not 1 minute,  Mr. Speaker, not 1 minute, on actual legislation to lower the price of gasoline. I really believe that the priorities of this Congress since we have come back from the 5-week August vacation are wrong. High gas and energy prices are hurting American workers and it's hurting our Nation's economy.     
   With jobs at stake, Mr. Speaker, this Congress twiddles its thumbs and busies itself once again, as we did earlier in the year, naming post offices and, today, studying the value of rivers in Vermont, in all deference to my friend from Vermont. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House should be permitted to have a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on legislation to expand alternative energy sources and to lift the ban on drilling offshore, both coasts, Mr. Speaker, and in ANWR and other Alaskan lands in Alaska. But, unfortunately, the liberal leaders in this Congress have blocked, up to this point have blocked, a fair ``yes'' or ``no'' vote for months because I believe, Mr. Speaker, and I believe the majority of Members of this body knows that if we were to put the all-of-the-above energy plan up for a vote, that a majority of this House would vote for it. But we have been denied that opportunity time after time after time. Instead, they voted to go on a 5-week vacation in August to avoid working to lower gas prices, to protect American jobs, to make our Nation more energy independent. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that during that time since the adjournment for the 5-week vacation, a number of my Republican colleagues, 136 of my Republican colleagues, were here every day for several hours a day, trying to attempt to call the ask the Speaker to call Congress back in session. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. So now we are back here again on a regularly scheduled basis, and we will certainly have an opportunity to have a vote on the all-of-the-above, and I will talk about that more later. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, in the past, in the past, Senator BARACK OBAMA, Senator JOE BIDEN, Senator HARRY REID, and Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, they are the leaders of the Democrat Party here in the U.S. Congress. Yet the one thing, other than being Democrat leaders, the one thing they all have in common, Mr. Speaker, is that they have in the past always opposed offshore drilling and drilling in Alaska. I think the majority of the Americans feel contrary to that view. And they fight and block any action on that at every turn. They refuse to act and to allow a vote on a drilling and alternative energy plan that would ultimately lower gas prices. 
   To me, Mr. Speaker, I just simply have to say in this election year that it's clear that liberalism has been put ahead of the need to help American workers and families struggling with high gas prices. We need to end the stranglehold that they have on America's ability to produce more of its own energy and on American jobs and the economy. And we can do that, Mr. Speaker, very simply by opening the resources that we have in this country. We need to change their no, no, no stance on producing more American energy. 
   This Congress, Mr. Speaker, and we all know this, needs to vote on the all-of-the-above energy plan. In that plan it includes promoting alternative energy sources, like wind and solar power. I might add parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, that we have a nuclear plant in my district, we have hydro plants in my district, and we have wind machines in my district. I am all in favor of all of the above, and our all-of-the-above energy plan includes precisely that. 
   This plan recognizes the need for more nuclear power. As I mentioned, I have a nuclear power plant in my district. Of course, it protects the value of hydropower, and that is the most abundant energy source for us in the Northwest. But it also allows, while we transition to a new energy source in the future, it allows drilling offshore and in Alaska and on other Federal lands. 
   Mr. Speaker, it really is time for the liberal leaders of this Congress to stop blocking a vote on producing more American-made energy. It's time for Members of Congress to stop hiding and to start voting. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that we are not elected to avoid taking positions on tough issues. We are elected to stand up and resolve those tough issues for the American people. So it's time for Congress to set aside naming post offices; in deference, again, to my friend from Vermont, studying rivers. It's time to get serious about addressing the high cost of gasoline and voting yes or no on real solutions, including drilling offshore and in Alaska. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is the last speaker, and he is prepared to close. I know I have several Members that have asked for time. So, Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself such time as I may consume until other Members come to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned just briefly in my remarks that after the adjournment prior to the 5-week vacation and, by the way, that adjournment resolution was passed on a straight partisan vote. Every Republican voted against it because we felt we needed to stay here to help resolve the energy problem rather than go on a 5-week vacation. But there were a number of Members, I can mention 136 Members, that came down here and talked about the need for energy. 
   During that time, Mr. Speaker, the lights were off here, the microphones were off, and the cameras were off. Yet there were a number of tourists, as we always have coming through the U.S. Capitol, their Capitol, and they were invited to sit on the floor and talk with us, interact with Members that came down and spoke. 
   The 2 days that I was here, and I admit I was only here 2 of those days, the last 2 days, and I had private conversations with a number of tourists that came through here. I have to say they were not from the Northwest, although there were some from the Northwest, but there were some from the South, and they were all kind of perplexed as to why the people's House, the House of Representatives, probably the genius part of our Founding Fathers in making a representative body, of which all Members that have served there, and there are slightly over 11,000 Members that have served in this body and, Mr. Speaker, every one, every one of those Members have been elected to this House. There has never been a Member that was appointed to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Now why do I say this in the context of energy prices? The genius of our Founding Fathers was that the House of Representatives and the fact that every one was elected is probably more in tune to what the people's wishes are across the country. 
   And so they were, frankly, the people I talked to, perplexed. Well, if this is the people's House, why haven't you had the opportunity to have a vote, just a vote up or down, recognizing, listen, we know that a majority rules, and I am prepared to take the consequences of that if my position on any issue fails to get a majority vote. I recognize that. I think every Member of Congress understands that. But to not have the opportunity, not have the opportunity to even vote, even vote on a proposal, really perplexes the tourists that came through here the 2 days I was on the floor. 
   In talking to my other colleagues, some of whom were down here as many as 13 days, and more, they had what I would say were similar experiences with their conversations with people that came through here. 
   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that my district is the district that in central Washington that is a center of virtually--I won't say all, but a great deal--of electricity that is produced in the Pacific Northwest. Within my district, for example, probably the hydroelectric facility that most Americans can associate with is Grand Coulee Dam. Half of that dam is in my district and the other half is in my colleague's from the Fifth District, CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS' district. 
   But, in addition to that, I have up to 10 dams that are wholly within my district or I share with other Members of Congress, including my friend and colleague from across the river in Oregon, GREG WALDEN. There are three dams there where we share half of those dams.  
   That produces about 70 percent of the electricity in the northwest. It is renewable, Mr. Speaker. It is absolutely renewable, and we need to expand that, and a portion of expanding hydropower is in the all-of-the-above energy plan I talked about earlier that we have been denied a vote on. We have been denied a vote on. 
   Furthermore, I mentioned that I have wind plants in my district. Because generally in areas that I mentioned earlier on, that there was not a whole lot of rainfall in certain parts of my district, but the wind does blow. Now the wind, of course, is only good if the wind blows. But if the wind blows, it adds to the other facilities, like hydro, like hydro, or like nuclear. And I have a nuclear plant in my district. 
   What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, is that my constituents are well aware that we need to have a diverse energy portfolio. Without having an opportunity in the people's House to at least address the issue of all of the above, seems to me to be contrary, seems to me to be contrary to what this Congress is all about, and indeed what the House of Representatives is all about as it was envisioned by the Founders. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I have talked about what we did in August, and I have talked about the fact that up until August, and now we have a new session coming in after the break, that the Democrats have blocked and blocked any vote on lifting the ban. 
   But I have heard during the break that there are a number of brave Democrats who I think went home, talked to their constituents, and find out that their constituents were saying we need to become more energy independent. As a result, they proclaim that they support now offshore drilling to increase the supply of gasoline and oil and to make America more energy independent. 
   Well, listen. To all of my colleagues that maybe during the August break and having listened to their colleagues or to their constituents at home, I have a very positive message for you, and I have an opportunity for you, because by voting against the previous question, Mr. Speaker, all of my colleagues can prove that you are supporters of drilling and producing American-made energy. Of course, if you do not, that means that you side, of course, with Speaker Pelosi and you oppose drilling. 
   By defeating the previous question, Mr. Speaker, I will move to amend the rule to make in order H.R. 6566, the American Energy Act, and I have talked at length about what it is. This bill will reduce the price at the pump by enacting an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Once again, what it does, it increases the supply of American-made energy by using environmentally sound technology and innovations. It does so by improving conservation and efficiency and, Mr. Speaker, it promotes a diversity by renewing alternative energy sources, like wind that I had talked about, and solar. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I again ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that Congress, as they return from the 5-week recess--vacation, in some people's terms--and begin the work here in the fall before the election, so that we can finally vote, Mr. Speaker, on real solutions to the real and painful problem of high gas and energy prices. 
   American workers and families are hurting. Congress can help, can help today by voting on and passing this legislation, the American Energy Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's time to show whether you're really for lowering gas prices or whether you will continue to vote in lockstep with those against lifting the ban on offshore drilling and promoting alternative energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for yielding me this time to speak against this closed rule that bars every single Member of this House from offering an amendment to change this Democrat bill, a bill, Madam Speaker, which I am compelled to oppose. 
   This nearly 500-page bill is being rammed through the House with the Rules Committee meeting on this bill at 1 a.m. this morning and with no Members even being allowed to propose fixes or alternatives because we are told it is absolutely imperative that Congress act to provide government-run health care coverage to more Americans. 
   So I am compelled to ask: If the purpose of this bill is to provide more health care coverage for Americans, then why are the Medicare plans of over 8 million seniors in our country being put at risk by this legislation? 
   Why are over 150,000 Washingtonian State seniors going to have their Medicare Advantage health coverage put at risk by cuts in this bill? 
   Why are one in 12 seniors on Medicare in my congressional district facing a potential loss of their current coverage? How do you expand health care to more Americans if you are forcing the elimination of Medicare plans that seniors have chosen? 
   Madam Speaker, even more troubling to me is a provision in this bill that would force the closure of the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center in my district in Wenatchee, Washington. After reading the bill, this health center wrote a letter to me that states: ``Should section 651,'' of this bill, ``be enacted into law as written, we foresee the likely closure of the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center and our outlying facilities in the next few years.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to consider a conference report that provides for the conservation and development of water and related resources and authorizes the construction of various projects in order to improve rivers and harbors in the United States. 
   Our Nation's water resource infrastructure is critical to our economy, transportation system, power generation, flood control, and environmental protection and restoration. This is especially true in the Pacific Northwest. Our region's river system is a great resource, one that must be well managed and protected. 
   Hydroelectric dams provide clean, low-cost, renewable power. These facilities also provide a system of locks that allow for the efficient transport of tons of agricultural products to coastal ports, which reduces congestion on our highways and our rail systems. 
   The coastal ports that receive the river-barged goods and products are the gateways to overseas markets and also need very careful attention. The success of farmers and manufacturers throughout the Northwest depend upon these ports being navigable and appropriately maintained. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions of this conference report that are important to the communities and individuals that I represent in central Washington that I would like to highlight. Like the WRDA bill that passed the House in the last Congress and the one that passed in April of this year, I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes a provision to permit the Corps of Engineers employees working at the dams in the Pacific Northwest to participate in wage surveys that are conducted to determine their rate of pay. This important provision will allow these employees the same participation allowed to similar employees at dams in the region operated by the Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   This conference report also includes language that will allow the Corps to specifically give credit to the Port of Sunnyside in my district for funding it has invested to maintain progress on its wetland restoration and wastewater treatment project. This project is a creative initiative by the Port of Sunnyside to improve the river habitat and provide for greater economic growth in the local community. This provision ensures that the Port of Sunnyside gets proper credit for the funds it invests as it works with the Corps to make this project a reality. 
   Finally, this legislation lifts Corps restrictions on the development of several Port of Pasco properties. I am very hopeful that the elimination of these flowage easements will allow beneficial uses of this prime riverfront property to move forward for the betterment of the city of Pasco and the Tri-Cities. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I am troubled by a change in a law inserted into this final bill that expressly authorizes the Secretary of the Army to approve removal of small dams under the Corps of Engineers Section 206 program. 
   The House is expected to consider a Democrat energy bill at some point this week, and I believe it doesn't bode well that we start off with making the removal of dams easier in this country. Dams provide power, drinking water, irrigation, transportation, and flood control. We need to value these benefits and recognize that hydropower dams are a clean and renewable energy resource. 
   Mr. Speaker, this conference report provides regular review and updating of congressional direction to the Corps of Engineers and ensures that existing projects are maintained and that new needs are met. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. As the gentleman knows, because we're both from the Northwest, we have large dams that I alluded to in my remarks that provide hydroelectric power for all of the Northwest. And I know the provision in this bill does not apply to those dams. But, nevertheless, I think we in the Northwest need to be cognizant of the fact that, once you start these things, sometime in the future it may go up.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. A point that I am simply making is that that is a major part, those dams on the Snake River and the Columbia River are major power sources for all of our electrical power and, therefore, for our economy. And I am just simply concerned because sometimes we don't look longer term enough. But if we look longer term enough and we start putting provisions in where it is a regular thing of takeout dams, then perhaps in the future, I hope not, I will do everything I can, but perhaps in the future that all of a sudden somebody will take a shot at those larger dams. I think that would be detrimental to our economy in the Northwest. 
   I yield back to my friend.

Again, I am particularly sensitive, because of the nature of the dams that we are talking about on the Snake River and on the Columbia River in my State.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this closed rule and the underlying bill, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, no one supports violent acts of crimes committed out of hatred toward a person based on personal characteristic whether that is ethnicity, gender, religion, weight, height, age, eye color, profession, socioeconomic background, or political beliefs. If someone commits a crime, they should be punished for that crime. Period. 
   Instead, today, the Democrat majority has chosen to end equality under the law and to bring legislation to the House floor that creates special categories of people. Specifically, this bill allows Federal assistance to be given to State and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute felonies that are believed to be motivated by prejudice based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. 
   This bill also makes certain crimes a felony in cases where the perpetrator was believed to be motivated by bias and there has been a history of such bias-motivated violence. 
   Separate treatment is afforded for crimes based on hate against protected classes of citizens under this bill, as opposed to crimes against victims that are not in a protected category. As we learned decades ago, separate is not equal. 
   The Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a bad bill and should not be brought to the floor, but especially under the closed process that does not allow for any changes or improvements to the underlying bill. 
   Eighteen thoughtful amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee yesterday, and sadly, not one of these amendments was allowed to be considered by the full House of Representatives. I am disappointed the Democrat majority again has missed an opportunity to live up to their commitment of allowing input under an open process. 
   Mr. Speaker, how many special categories of people should this bill create? Have all characteristics for which there has been a history of bias-motivated violence been included in this bill? Should more categories be added and should some be excluded from this bill? 
   Under this closed rule, these questions will not be answered today by Members of the House through the amendment process. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Forbes of Virginia offered an amendment to this bill that would expand the list of protected categories of individuals to include members of the Armed Forces. If you believe the government should afford special treatment to crimes committed against special groups of citizens, then why not our military men and women? Why aren't those who volunteer to protect our country's freedom not afforded this protected status? 
   Mr. Gohmert of Texas offered an amendment that would add law enforcement officers to the list. There have been several instances where gang members and would-be gang members have targeted and killed law enforcement officers because of their hatred towards them for choosing to go to work each day to protect our communities. Is committing a crime against law enforcement officers simply because their job is to uphold our laws a crime not deserving of special assistance to investigate and prosecute that crime? 
   Crimes have been committed against senior citizens, and an amendment was offered to include them under the hate crimes legislation, but that amendment, too, was not allowed under this closed rule today. 
   The question remains, if the Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act creates special protection, then whom should it create special protection for? Because this bill is being brought up under a closed rule, Members of the House and the people they represent will not have an opportunity to voice their opinion on this question through the amendment process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this closed rule, which not only gags the minority party, but gags all Members of the House, who will be denied the right to offer improvements to this legislation. I urge my colleagues to oppose the gag order rule and the underlying bill that creates special categories of citizens and ends equality under the law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad rule because it's a closed rule, which has been demonstrated with the observations of Mr. Lungren and Mr. Gohmert. 
   Mr. Speaker, if someone commits a crime, they should be punished. Period. This is a bill that ends equality under the law by authorizing $10 million in grants over 2 years to State and local law enforcement to combat hate crimes targeted to special categories of people. It is a bad bill. This rule is a bad bill, not allowing for improvement, so I ask Members to oppose the rule and the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the National Science Foundation plays an important role in making sure that our Nation is a global leader in the fields of science and engineering. This Federal agency provides critical support for researchers, educators, and students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Specifically, Federal support allows American  scientists to pursue high-risk, high-return fields that increase our Nation's competitiveness and scientific knowledge, and it ensures we are able to attract the brightest minds to our colleges and universities. 
   One area in which the National Science Foundation is supporting U.S. leadership in the sciences is in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory Program, or ``LIGO'' for short. The LIGO program, which operates an observatory in Central Washington in my district, is trying to detect for the first time the existence of gravitational waves, which have been sought by physicists around the world since they were theorized by Albert Einstein. Their discovery would lead to a greater understanding of the makeup of the universe and would help solidify our Nation's lead in the field of physics and astrophysics. 
   The President's fiscal year 2008 budget provides for the expansion of LIGO and nearly doubles funding available for the LIGO Hanford Observatory to allow for more advanced research. I am pleased that the National Science Foundation Authorization Act supports this proposed expansion. 
   The LIGO program is not only an important investment in our Nation's science capability, but it also has been an instrument of learning for local communities. The LIGO's Hanford Observatory was recently awarded one of the first ever Science Education Advocate Awards by the Washington State Leadership and Assistance for Science Education Reform, a partnership of public schools and science institutions. LIGO is an excellent example of the National Science Foundation's dedication to funding world-class research while also helping to grow students' interest in the sciences. 
   Mr. Speaker, if America is to continue to lead the world in science and the pursuit of knowledge, funding for the National Science Foundation is essential. The underlying legislation authorizes the National Science Foundation for 3 years at strong levels needed to maintain and strengthen research through the foundation. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I am once again disappointed that the Democrat majority has once again missed an opportunity to provide consideration for the National Science Foundation Act under an open rule that would allow all Members of the House to come to the floor and offer an amendment during consideration of the bill. The National Science Foundation was last authorized in 2002, and at that time, the Republican majority allowed the bill to be considered under a truly open rule. I am disappointed that the Democrat majority has pledged a new era of openness but so far has not lived up to their commitment. Instead, it frankly has tried to change the definition of what an open rule is. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and the chairwoman of the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself as much time as may I consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee held a 3-hour hearing and took testimony from the appropriations chairman Mr. Obey and Members that brought forth amendments to the committee in hopes of having them debated and considered on the floor here today. 
   Many good ideas were presented to the committee. These ideas ranged from considering a true, clean continuing resolution to restoring the lapse Federal Government safety net for 4,400 schools and 780 counties in rural America, from helping farmers with natural disaster relief, to increasing funding for local housing authorities, to taking unspent money from a rain forest education project in Iowa and, instead, spending those moneys to help millions, to help our veterans. 
   But unfortunately, after listening to the thoughtful testimony from Members on their ideas for improving the bill, the Rules Committee rejected every single one of them and approved this closed rule by an 8-4 vote. 
   So this House will spend just 1 hour, Mr. Speaker, considering this bill with no amendments even allowed to be debated and no substitute bill allowed to be offered by the minority. 
   So why the rush and the closed process? We are not asking for much. Give us a few minutes to sort out confusing parts of this resolution that have not passed the House previously, but have magically appeared in this resolution, like a rewriting of the formula for the distribution of section 8 housing funds. This new formula will affect hundreds of communities all across the Nation. 
   In my district in Washington State, multiple communities are slated to have their grants cut dramatically. In one city, city of Kennewick, the housing authority alone there will have their grant cut by $1 million. That is roughly one-third of their total budget. This rewritten formula was not approved by the House in previous spending bills for this year and clearly needs more input and discussion before becoming law. Unfortunately, we are denied the opportunity to discuss that. 
   One major issue that is neglected on this bill is a continuing safety net for our schools and counties in rural areas that have large amounts of Federal land and, therefore, have a very limited tax base. Recognizing the importance of this safety net, Mr. Walden of Oregon came to the Rules Committee and offered a bipartisan amendment with Mr. DeFazio of Oregon that would have provided a 1-year extension of funding so that these schools could keep their libraries open, keep the teachers at least through the end of the school year, and help counties with necessary road repairs. Let me be clear. Last year, over 4,400 schools received $400 million, and with this bill, they will receive exactly zero. 
   After convincing testimony by Mr. Walden, three Democrat members of the Rules Committee agreed to join me and Chairwoman Slaughter as cosponsors of H.R. 17 which would fix the problem for an additional 7 years. Less than an hour later, however, the Rules Committee voted against even considering a bipartisan amendment that would provide 1 hour of relief for this problem, saying that it is not the right vehicle. 
   Mr. Speaker, please try to explain to school children when their libraries close because of insufficient funding that the Congress wanted to act but chose not to because they did not feel this was the right vehicle. 
   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, hundreds of unauthorized programs continue to be funded in this underlying resolution. We do not have a complete list of the unauthorized programs because the underlying measure is not a general appropriations bill and did not go through regular order. Therefore, there is no report which is required to list all unauthorized programs that are funded. 
   Mr. Speaker, I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle speak at length about the open process they would have when they were in charge. I want to believe them, I truly do. I have had discussions with my colleagues up in the Rules Committee every time we have met this year, but unfortunately, the actions simply do not match the promises that were made.     
   At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I heard my colleagues on the majority side say that after we wrap up our first 100 hours agenda, we will have an open process. It has now been nearly 4 weeks. The 100 hours are long past, and yet the House is yet to consider a bill under an open rule. Most have been closed out without any amendments. 
   I have to ask when, when will this House have the opportunity to debate and consider the bills? When will the minority be permitted to truly participate in this process? Because I can think of no better time than right now when we are considering the funding for our Nation's priorities and funding for almost the entire Federal Government. 
   Let us have a real debate on the $463 billion in this omnibus. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg). 
   Mr SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this closed rule and to the bill that comes to the floor under that closed rule. I think it is important to understand that this 137 page bill comes to the floor as a critically important piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that will control the vast amount of spending of the Federal Government for the balance of the fiscal year. 
   And yet the process by which it is coming to the floor is no less than stunning. The leaders on the other side said, as soon as the 100 hours are over, we will accord you procedural fairness. I have here the Boston Globe and the Washington Post in which each of them said, ``As soon as that is done, on January 18,'' the majority leader said, ``Republicans will enjoy more rights and power than they allowed Democrats in the entire 12 years the Democrats were in the minority.'' 
   Yet this bill comes to us under a stunning procedure. Indeed, this bill, these 137 pages, at the Appropriations Committee level received no hearing, no hearing whatsoever. At the markup level, no markup occurred. 
   What does that mean? That means no Democrat was allowed an opportunity at the committee level to offer an amendment, and no Republican was allowed an opportunity to offer an amendment to this bill. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, if you are represented by either a Member of the majority or a Member of the minority, you get no say in this bill. 
   So the bill then proceeded to the Rules Committee. Well, at the Rules Committee, the Democrats and Republicans in theory could offer amendments. Would you like to know how many amendments were made in order for the minority party? Answer: Zero. Not one. Not one. 
   How about the Democrats? Were they allowed to offer an amendment? 
   This is not a fair procedure, and this is not democracy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I mourningly lost not only a colleague but a very close friend. We all know that CHARLIE's unwavering dedication to his constituents and to our Nation inspired us who had the privilege of serving with him. He was known and was well-documented as a principled lawmaker who was absolutely committed to his values and to his work in this people's House. He was never afraid to stand up for his convictions. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak on a personal note, because CHARLIE and I were elected in 1994, and I see several of my colleagues here that are going to speak after me. My wife Claire and his wife Gloria became friends during the orientation. And while my wife doesn't come back here as often as Gloria was here with CHARLIE, whenever she came back we always made it a point as often as we could to get together with the Norwoods and have dinner. CHARLIE loved to try a lot of different venues: He was a steak man, and we ate steak. He liked Italian food, and we found several Italian places that we ate. He took me to a Korean restaurant. He liked Korean food after being in Asia. And we had great conversations. We talked about the patients' bill of rights; we disagreed. We talked about OSHA; we agreed. And so he and Gloria became good friends of Claire and me, and he even hosted my brother and I down at the Master's one year. My older brother and CHARLIE shared the same birth date, so they had a bond right off the bat. 
   If there is one legacy I think that CHARLIE will leave with all of us, it is the bulldoggedness and the determination with which he pursued legislation. But if there is one other legacy that will be left, it is the way he displayed the courage to fight this disease that he had. And I truly think, Mr. Speaker, that any lesser man would not have lasted as long as he did with the disease that he had. 
   CHARLIE will be very, very much missed, and our prayers go out to Gloria and the family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying this rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 2740, the MEJA Expansion and  Enforcement Act. This bill is an attempt to ensure that all Federal civilian contractors can be prosecuted for crimes they commit abroad. The issue before us today is not, Mr. Speaker, a policy decision to determine whether or not contractors should be in Iraq, but, rather, the issue is whether the principle of current law should be applied to civilian contractors. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Forbes, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security in the Judiciary Committee testified before the Rules Committee that while the intent of this legislation is right, this bill is very, very poorly drafted. During markup of the bill by the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Forbes and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee raised concerns with Members on the other side of the aisle. Republicans agreed that they would work to move this legislation forward because of assurances made by the majority members of the committee that their concerns would be worked out. Mr. Forbes testified before the Rules Committee that his main concerns with the bill were a lack of clear definitions, vague language and Federal mandates on the FBI without additional resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, a manager's amendment was submitted to the Rules Committee and it wasn't until after the Rules Committee amendment deadline had passed Monday evening that Mr. Forbes found that none of the concerns raised by Republicans were addressed in the manager's amendment. At this point, of course, it was too late for Mr. Forbes and other Members to submit amendments. Had they tried to submit amendments to the Rules Committee past the deadline, they likely would have been turned away at the Rules Committee door, just as many Members, including myself, have been this Congress. 
   Yesterday, the ranking member, Mr. Dreier, attempted to provide an open rule for consideration of this bill. An open rule would have allowed any Member of the House of Representatives an opportunity to come forward and amend the bill, and especially those members of the Judiciary Committee that felt that they were left out of this process. However, the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee rejected this idea on a party line vote of 8-4. 
   Mr. Dreier then attempted to allow Mr. Forbes to offer an amendment on the floor today to make changes to the bill in order to restore the commitment that was once made by the Democrat majority. But I am disappointed that this attempt was also rejected on a party line vote of 8-4. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee over 2 months ago and yet the Democrat majority failed to make good on their commitment to address the reasonable and entirely justifiable concerns raised by Republicans. 
   Mr. Speaker, contractor accountability is an issue that should be discussed and addressed in a bipartisan manner. But there are legitimate concerns with the way this bill was drafted. Unfortunately, this rule denies Members, including all Republicans, an opportunity to improve the underlying bill. Because the Rules Committee has once again chosen to stifle bipartisanship and deliberation by bringing forth this restrictive rule, I must urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, House Resolution 702. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding. She was in the committee yesterday when Mr. Forbes testified. I would hope that the gentlewoman would agree with me that when Mr. Forbes testified under questioning from me asking if he felt that he had assurances that these issues would be worked out from the time that the committee passed the bill out of committee in August until now, and he said that he felt that that commitment was a strong commitment, and therefore, he didn't offer any amendments. 
   Now, would the gentlewoman agree with me that that was what Mr. Forbes said?

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I appreciate the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say under questioning when I asked Mr. Forbes, because he stated that the deadline had passed when the manager's amendment which did not address their concerns was introduced, he then, of course, would be prohibited from offering amendments. I asked him if there were an opportunity in the next 24 hours, i.e., from yesterday until today, could they prepare amendments to address these concerns, he said, ``Yes.'' 
   I hope that the gentlewoman will agree with me that that is what he said yesterday in front of the Rules Committee.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to make the point once again, the reason that there were no Republican amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee is because there was a clear, clear understanding when the bill was passed out of the Judiciary Committee that the issues and concerns that were raised by the Republicans would be addressed in a bipartisan way, and the vehicle by which they would be addressed was a manager's amendment, which is a normal process when you bring bills to the floor. That commitment was apparently not fulfilled. 
   By the time that the manager's amendment was drafted, with the idea that supposedly in a bipartisan way these issues would be addressed, it was too late for any Republican to offer an amendment because it was past the deadline that was put in place by this new majority on the Rules Committee. Therefore, there was no chance for Republicans to submit any amendments. Therefore, there were no amendments that were submitted. 
   So I just wanted to set the record straight, Mr. Speaker, that the reason that there were no Republican amendments submitted to the Rules Committee is because a promise and a commitment was broken between August 2 and October 2, yesterday, when we met on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding for this exchange, because I think it is important. This issue is very, very important because we are talking about ultimately a portion of the security of our country, and I think we need to address that in a bipartisan way. 
   I am simply pointing out, in testimony yesterday in front of the Rules Committee, Mr. Forbes was given the assurance when the bill left the Judiciary Committee, and I don't think that the gentleman is on the Judiciary Committee, but he felt that he had a commitment that those concerns be addressed. 
   Now, having concerns addressed and being totally satisfied are two different things. If they weren't satisfied, then you could offer an amendment to make the adjustments and you could debate those issues. The point I am making is that Mr. Forbes felt that the commitment that was given to him to make those adjustments and those concerns were not fully addressed; therefore, he didn't submit any amendments to the bill. I am not suggesting that all of his concerns should be in the manager's amendment; I am simply suggesting that he was denied the opportunity, in his mind, to have these concerns addressed.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I just want to, Mr. Speaker, tell my colleagues that there was no Forbes amendment in front of the Rules Committee, so I can't even pass judgment whether it addressed the concerns that he had. He did not submit an amendment to the Rules Committee. He did not submit an amendment to the Rules Committee because he was given the assurances that the concerns that were raised when the bill came out of committee would be addressed. 
   While the gentleman is probably talking about a potential amendment, nobody on the Rules Committee saw the amendment, because the amendment was not submitted to the Rules Committee because he felt his concerns were not addressed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for allowing me to clarify that. When he talks about the Forbes amendment, there is, or was no Forbes amendment in front of the Rules Committee yesterday.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the previous speaker, my friend from Oregon, that the sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), is a very, very thoughtful individual. I have worked with him on some issues, and I would agree with that. I think Members would also agree with me when I say that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) is also a very thoughtful individual and somebody that you can work with on a bipartisan basis. 
   When somebody like Mr. Forbes comes to the Rules Committee and tells us that he was given a commitment about concerns that he felt needed to be addressed in this legislation and was given the assurances that they would be addressed, not necessarily solved but at least be addressed, I think you would have to say that he was acting in very good faith. I think this sends a very, very strong message for Members that want to work in a bipartisan way and then get treated as Mr. Forbes said he was treated. I think that is not good for the institution. 
   So I just want to, Mr. Speaker, reiterate once again what happened. The reason that there were no amendments substantive to the issue of the concerns that were submitted by Republicans to the Rules Committee is because the ranking member on the subcommittee dealing with this issue felt that the commitments that were given to him were not carried out. There were no, apparently, discussions of what was going into the manager's amendment. 
   Again, I am not suggesting Mr. Forbes would have been totally happy, but he could have offered an amendment to address those concerns. He was denied that opportunity simply, simply because he felt the commitment that was given to him when the bill came out of the Judiciary Committee was not carried through. 
   So it is for that reason, that reason that we probably won't have as robust a debate on this issue, and in all likelihood we won't have the kind of legislation that needs to go forward in a bipartisan manner on something where everybody agrees that the intent of this legislation is what everybody agrees on a bipartisan basis needs to happen. I regret that. It is for that reason that I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past several weeks my colleagues on the Rules Committee and I have called for a vote on the previous question and will be doing so again today. Why? Because we are concerned that the House rules are flawed when it comes to the enforceability of earmarks. 
   Republican Leader BOEHNER has a proposal that will improve the House rules and allow the House to debate openly and honestly the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills. I am asking that my colleagues vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately consider House Resolution 479 introduced by Republican Leader BOEHNER. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House will still be able to consider the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act today, but will also be able to address earmark enforceability in order to restore the credibility of the House. I am hopeful today will be the day my colleagues will defeat the previous question and, in doing so, will send a strong message to American taxpayers that this House is serious when it comes to earmark transparency.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, on September 28, 2006, the Republicans were in the majority and the Democrats were in the minority. I was managing a rule on the floor similar to what we are considering here today to allow specific bills to be considered under suspensions under the rule on a day that suspensions are not permitted under House rules like today. 
   During debate on that day in September 2006, the then-ranking member of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, stated, ``It isn't just what the Congress has done with its time that is so disappointing. It is also what the Congress has not done, all of the challenges it has not addressed.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the same can be absolutely said today about the Democrat control of the House of Representatives. Earlier this year, House Democrats approved a budget that included a tax hike of $683 billion, the largest in American history. Americans cannot afford the Democrat plans to cut the child tax credit in half, to reinstate the marriage penalty, and raise taxes on every single taxpayer. Instead of record-breaking tax increases, this Congress should work to make those tax cuts permanent. 
   I'm also dismayed that the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives has not acted to extend the State and local sales tax deduction to States that don't have State income tax. That tax expired on January 1 of this year. The State and local sales tax deduction is important for those States that don't have a State income tax, such as my home State of Washington. Extending this deduction is a matter of fairness that Congress must act to renew as soon as possible. 
   The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives have also failed to act to give our intelligence community the tools they need to protect our country from new terrorist threats by modernizing the seventies-era FISA laws. For over 74 days now, America has been hobbled in the vital work to monitor terrorist communications and detect new plots despite the fact that the Senate has approved a bipartisan plan and sent it over to the House. House Democrat leaders have refused to allow the House to vote on the Senate plan and have refused to go to conference with the Senate. 
   Madam Speaker, why, I ask, why is an issue of this magnitude being placed on the back burner by Democrat leaders, despite repeated attempts by Republicans to allow the House to vote on this bipartisan plan? 
   Madam Speaker, the Democrat-controlled House has also failed to address perhaps the most pressing issue on the minds of Americans today, rising gas prices.     
   Democrat leaders may not like to hear it, but since they took control of Congress in January of 2007, the cost of a gallon of gas has gone up by over 50 percent. In fact, the cost of gas has gone up by more in 16 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years. 
   Instead, they have spent hours giving speeches trying to blame the President and anyone but themselves for the fact that Congress has done nothing to address rising gas prices. But, Madam Speaker, facts are stubborn things. 
   And the facts are that gas prices have gone up over a dollar a gallon on the Democrat Congress' watch. The facts are that Democrat leaders promised the American people in 2006 that if they were to control Congress that they had a ``commonsense plan'' to ``lower the price at the pump.'' 
   It's been 16 months of this Democrat Congress, and the promise is nowhere to be seen. This Congress has put forward no plan, has taken no action, and passed no bills to lower gas prices. They promised relief at the pump to lower gas prices, and they've done nothing. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to insert into the Record an article by Investor's Business Daily posted April 29, 2008, and it states, ``This Congress is possibly the most irresponsible in modern history. This is especially true when it comes to America's dysfunctional energy policy.''  
   Congress Vs. You 
   Energy: President Bush let the Democrat-led Congress have it with both barrels Tuesday, lambasting lawmakers for fiddling while the energy crisis burns. It was a well-deserved takedown of do-nothing lawmakers. 
   We've said it before, but we'll say it again: This Congress is possibly the most irresponsible in modern history. This is especially true when it comes to America's dysfunctional energy policy. 
   The media won't call either the House or the Senate on its failures, for one very obvious reason: They mostly share an ideology with the Democrats that keeps them from understanding how free markets and supply and demand really work. Sad, but true. 
   So we were happy to hear the president do the job, calling out Congress for its inaction and ignorance in his wide-ranging press conference Tuesday. 
   ``Many Americans are understandably anxious about issues affecting their pocketbook, from gas and food prices to mortgage and tuition bills,'' Bush said. ``They're looking to their elected leaders in Congress for action. Unfortunately, on many of these issues, all they're getting is delay.'' 
   Best of all, Bush didn't let the issue sit with just generalities. He reeled off a bill of particulars of congressional energy inaction, including: 
   Failing to allow drilling in ANWR. We have, as Bush noted, estimated capacity of a million barrels of oil a day from this source alone--enough for 27 million gallons of gas and diesel. But Congress won't touch it, fearful of the clout of the environmental lobby. As a result, you pay at the pump so your representative can raise campaign cash. 
   Refusing to build new refineries. The U.S. hasn't built one since 1976, yet sanctions at least 15 unique ``boutique'' fuel blends around the nation. So even the slightest problem at a refinery causes enormous supply problems and price spikes. Congress has done nothing about this. 
   Turning its back on nuclear power. It's safe and, with advances in nuclear reprocessing technology, waste problems have been minimized. Still, we have just 104 nuclear plants--the same as a decade ago--producing just 19% of our total energy. (Many European nations produce 40% or more of their power with nuclear.) Granted, nuclear power plants are expensive--about $3 billion each. But they produce energy at $1.72/kilowatt-hour vs. $2.37 for coal and $6.35 for natural gas. 
   Raising taxes on energy producers. This is where a basic understanding of economics would help: Higher taxes and needless regulation lead to less production of a commodity. So by proposing ``windfall'' and other taxes on energy companies plus tough new rules, Congress makes our energy situation worse. 
   These are just a few of Congress' sins of omission--all while India, China, Eastern Europe and the Middle East add more than a million barrels of new demand each and every year. New Energy Department forecasts see world oil demand growing 40% by 2030, including a 28% increase in the U.S. 
   Americans who are worried about the direction of their country, including runaway energy and food prices, should keep in mind the upcoming election isn't just about choosing a new president. We'll also pick a new Congress. 
   The current Congress, led on the House side by a speaker who promised a ``common sense plan'' to cut energy prices two years ago, has shown itself to be incompetent and irresponsible. It doesn't deserve re-election.  
   Madam Speaker, we all know that we must work together, Democrats, Republicans, the House, the Senate and the President, to solve America's pain at the pump. Until this happens, however, we should not deny good ideas from being considered. 
   Therefore, I will be urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that I can amend the rule to make in order any bill that would ``have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas.'' Let's defeat the previous question and show America that Congress is serious about addressing the rising cost at the pump. 
   With that, I reserve my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. At this time, Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  
   Madam Speaker, Americans don't want a debate on the problems causing gas prices to dramatically increase. They want a debate on solutions. 
   Therefore, as I stated a moment ago, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that Members can offer solutions that have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas. 
   As I mentioned, 2 years ago, then-minority leader, now-Speaker Pelosi promised Americans a Democrat plan to lower gas prices at the pump. They have controlled Congress for 16 months, but we still have not seen this plan. Meanwhile, the cost of gasoline is setting record highs. The time is now for the House to debate ideas and solutions for lowering gas prices, and it is time for the Democrats to reveal their plan that they promised 2 years ago. 
   So, Madam Speaker, by defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow any bill to be offered and considered under suspensions of the rule that would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2895, NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. This rule provides for the consideration of a bill to establish a national affordable housing trust fund. Members of this House share in the commitment to meet the housing needs of lower-income Americans. However, we differ on how to best achieve this goal. 
   The bill that will be before us today creates a new, a new national housing trust fund, and, with it, a whole new level of Federal bureaucracy. There are already over 30 separate Federal programs designed to promote affordable housing. The new trust fund, created by the underlying bill, is modeled in large part on one of those existing programs, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. 
   Why create a new level of Federal bureaucracy to administer essentially the same program that is already being successfully administered by State and local governments closest to the problem? It seems to me that ought to be a big subject of the debate that we have today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this rule makes in order a substitute amendment offered by Mr. Neugebauer of Texas that would establish a national affordable housing grant fund program within the current HOME program. This proposal would meet the need and meet the goal of expanding rental and home ownership opportunities for low-income families without adding new layers of red tape. While I support the Neugebauer amendment being made in order, I am troubled that this is the only Republican amendment allowed to be considered under this restrictive rule. 
   A total of 15 amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee by the 10 a.m. deadline yesterday. One amendment offered by Representative Capuano of Massachusetts to change the short title of the bill to the ``Barney Frank National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007'' was withdrawn. Out of the remaining 14 amendments, seven were submitted by Democrats and seven were submitted by Republicans. This rule makes all seven amendments offered by Democrats made in order, but just one Republican amendment. If this rule is adopted, many thoughtful ideas will be denied the opportunity to be considered on the House floor today. 
   Unfortunately, shutting out amendments offered by Republicans has become the norm for the Democrat Rules Committee. 
   Americans want to see Members on both sides of the aisle work together to address the problems our Nation faces. Unfortunately, with this restrictive rule, the Democrat majority has chosen to deny millions of Americans a voice on several significant issues related to meeting the affordable housing challenges that lower-income Americans face. Therefore, I must urge my colleagues to vote against House Resolution 720. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   House Republicans believe that every earmark should be debatable on the House floor and that the House earmark rules are flawed when it comes to the enforceability of earmarks. 
   Earlier this year, Republican Leader Boehner introduced a measure to close loopholes in the rules and allow the House to debate openly and honestly earmarks contained in all bills. Currently, 196 Republicans have signed a petition to bring this proposal to the floor for immediate consideration. 
   Unfortunately, we need 22 more Members in order to get real earmark reform before this can be considered by the House. The House cannot delay action on this any longer. Each day we put off closing loopholes in the House earmark rules, American taxpayers are left to wonder what hidden earmarks are contained in bills before the House. It is time we act to prove to American taxpayers this House is serious about earmark transparency and enforceability. 
   I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately consider House Resolution 479 introduced by Republican Leader Boehner. By defeating the previous question, the House will still be able to consider the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act today, but we will also be able to address the earmark enforceability in order to restore the credibility of this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I have to say that it is astonishing to me to what lengths this liberal Congress will go to shut down debate and close the legislative process. 
   This House, Mr. Speaker, has become far more dictatorial and far less deliberative in the last 19 months than ever before. In this Congress, there have been 59 closed rules, which is more than in any Congress in the history of our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, a closed rule means Members are prohibited from coming to the House floor and offering an amendment to the bill that is being considered on the floor. An open rule allows Members to offer amendments to a bill that's being considered on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, it is simply as simple as that. 
   But Mr. Speaker, there hasn't been one single, solitary open rule this entire year in this body. For this entire Congress, going back to January of last year, there has been only one open rule on bills that were not appropriations bills. These facts present a stark picture of just how closed and restrictive this liberal Congress has become. 
   Yet the Speaker and Democrat-controlled Rules Committee aren't satisfied with having the worst, most closed record in history. They've decided to go even further to undermine the rules and traditions of the U.S. House of Representatives. With this rule, they've reached an absolute new low. They have chosen to breach the long-standing, bipartisan process of an open rule for the consideration of appropriations bills. 
   On what has been an open process on the House floor not just for years, not for decades, but dating back to the creation of the Appropriations Committee itself, this process is being closed down by this oppressive, liberal Congress. 
   This rule provides for consideration of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill for the next fiscal year. It is a bill that has always, Mr. Speaker, had strong bipartisan support. For example, last year it passed by a recorded vote of 409 in favor and only two against. And during that debate last year, there were just 15 amendments that were offered. And the total debate on the House floor was just 5 hours, which is a short time for appropriations bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no part of this record that justifies what is being proposed today to decimate this open process. There is simply no excuse for what is being done and proposed by this rule. 
   I can only conclude that this is a blatant political attempt to stifle debate on the House floor in order to hold onto political power. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, it is being done at the expense of the rules and traditions of the People's House, the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the new fiscal year begins on October 1; that's just 62 days away. Yet this House hasn't passed one single appropriations bill. At the end of the week, it will probably have passed one. By comparison, Mr. Speaker, in 2006, the Republican House had passed every bill except one by this point of the year. 
   It is a troubling, disappointing, and dangerous situation when those who control this liberal Congress are punting on their duty to pass the 12 annual appropriations bills while simultaneously undermining the open consideration of these very same appropriations bills, an open process that has been a bipartisan hallmark of this House since the inception of the Appropriations Committee. 
   And why is this being done, Mr. Speaker? Again, I can only conclude that it is because this liberal Congress refuses to allow open debate and votes on producing more American-made energy. Those who control this Congress have refused to allow a vote on lifting the ban on offshore drilling, at ANWR in Alaska, and on other Federal lands. 
   Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Barack Obama oppose offshore drilling and in ANWR, but they refuse to let Congress vote on this important issue while gas prices, Mr. Speaker, are at record levels and Americans are hurting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I listened very closely to what the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee said, and if I infer by what he said, this may be the end of open rules in this House. There have been many people that have said on the floor today that this rule is in fact an open rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not an open rule. It does not permit an open process that allows Members to come to the floor and offer amendments to this veterans funding bill. Instead, it restricts and closes down the ability, by limiting amendments to only those who preprinted their amendments in the Congressional Record. I didn't, Mr. Speaker, so I am prohibited later on today from offering an amendment if I chose to do so. This clearly violates the open process by which appropriations bills have long been considered in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. I would like to quote several statements from my Democrat colleagues in the past Congress and in this Congress. 
   On September 15, 2005, this is in the last Congress, Mr. Hastings of Florida made the following statement on the House floor about a preprinting requirement for a Coast Guard authorization bill. 
   Mr. Hastings from Florida said, and I am quoting: ``I am nevertheless disappointed that the preprinting of amendments was even required. Despite the majority's claims, this legislative process which they call 'open' is actually restricted. It is not an open rule because every Member is not permitted to offer any germane amendment.'' Mr. Hastings of Florida said that in the last Congress. 
   In a report prepared by Ms. Slaughter before becoming chairman of the Rules Committee, in this report, which is entitled ``Broken Promises: The Death of Deliberative Democracy,'' Ms. Slaughter and her Democrat colleagues stated, and I quote from page 26 of this report, ``Rules with preprinting requirements are not open rules.'' 
   Quoting further from the same page: ``Further, there is a significant difference between an open rule and a rule with a preprinting requirement. A preprinting requirement forces Members to reveal their amendments in advance of floor consideration, something that may assist the floor managers, but can disadvantage the Member offering it. In addition, a preprinting requirement blocks any amendment proposal that might emerge during the course of debate.'' That comes from a Democrat publication. 
   The rule before the House today is not an open rule, by their own definition. The long-standing tradition has been deliberately violated. But don't take my word about the past. 
   Quoting again from the Congressional Record, this is Ms. Matsui from last year, and she is a member of the Rules Committee, last year in the 110th Congress she states regarding the Energy and Water appropriations bill: ``As I mentioned at the outset of this debate, this bill is made in order under an open rule, which is our tradition. I hope that all Members will give that tradition the respect it deserves.'' 
   Where is the respect, Mr. Speaker? Where is the respect? 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert in the Record excerpts from ``Broken Promises: The Death of Deliberative Democracy,'' printed by the then-minority party of the Rules Committee. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this House has been blocked repeatedly for many months from being allowed to vote on lifting the ban on drilling. Congress needs to act now to produce more American-made energy. Congress needs to vote now on lifting the offshore drilling ban. By defeating the previous question on this rule, the House can vote on drilling offshore. When the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to make in order H.R. 6108, the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act of 2008.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, this rule allows for the consideration of the conference report to accompany the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This conference report is largely bipartisan, as it should be, and is an example of what Democrats and Republicans can accomplish when working together. 
   This conference report contains important authorizations for increases in force protection and retains provisions of the overdue Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. By passing these provisions, we will help provide the tools needed to protect our men and women currently deployed in the global war on terror. We will be setting up the improvements needed to ensure excellence in our military and veterans care system. 
   There are also provisions in this conference report that are important to those that I represent in central Washington. 
   This conference report authorizes $29 million for the Yakima Training Center. This funding will be used to increase the size of the Army's training space, allow for urban operation training, and support the digital systems used by today's Stryker forces. This new range is expected to be completed in August of 2009 and will provide critical training for our active duty and Reserve Army soldiers. 
   In addition, I am pleased that this conference report extends the operation of the Ombudsman for the Energy Employees Occupation Illness Compensation Program Act. The Ombudsman's office plays an important role in assisting workers at Hanford and other sites seeking illness compensation that they are due. I might add, Madam Speaker, this issue goes way back to the Second World War when we were involved, obviously, in atomic power. Hanford, which is in my district and a county adjacent to my district, played an important part of that and those workers that worked at those sites in many cases gave the ultimate sacrifice as our men and women overseas did, but in a kind of different setting. This compensation program, I think, is very important for those that worked at the Hanford site and other sites during the Second World War. 
   Madam Speaker, again, I would like to stress that this conference report was achieved in a bipartisan manner, and I hope to see more bipartisan conference reports brought to the floor as Congress wraps up its business in this first session of the 110th Congress. 
   As the first session of the 110th Congress comes to a close, I am disappointed that Democrat leaders are still intent on micromanaging the war on terror by blocking the funding requested for all our troops on the battlefield. At a time when both Democrats and Republicans are seeing recent progress in the war on terror, this approach, frankly, Madam Speaker, strikes me as unnecessary, divisive and dangerous. 
   If a supplemental spending bill is not signed into law soon, some Army civilian employees may get layoff notices before the Christmas holidays, and if this funding continues to be delayed, Department of Defense officials have reported that it could affect as many as 200,000 civilian employees and contractors. 
   Madam Speaker, I am also concerned that Democrat leaders continue to use delaying tactics to block a vote on a final bipartisan bill to fund veterans services.     
   This inaction is causing our veterans to lose critical funding each and every day. As I have done in the past, Madam Speaker, I will later be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question in order to appoint conferees and quickly approve a veterans funding conference report that, again, has strong bipartisan support and which is long overdue. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, understanding that the gentlewoman is prepared to close, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, I must ask once again my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately act to go to conference with the Senate on H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill, and to appoint conferees. 
   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that a final veterans funding bill is sitting waiting to be acted on and that the Democrat leaders have bent over backwards to prevent this Congress in this session from passing the final bill. Democrat leaders in the House have refused to name conferees, and instead have chosen to put partisanship and politics ahead of ensuring our veterans' needs are met. They have been stalling since September and have ignored the fact that the new spending bill began October 1 of this year, nearly over 2 months ago. 
   Since the beginning of the new spending year, our Nation's 8 million veterans have been waiting for their $37 billion in promised veterans benefits. Sadly, each day Democrat leaders choose not to act and move final funding forward, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million. Since the fiscal year began 73 days ago, our Nation's veterans are out $1.35 billion. 
   What is even more disappointing is that this bill has almost unanimous support, unanimous support, from Republicans and Democrats; yet we are not being allowed to pass it into law, and we are getting to the waning days of this session. Meanwhile, our Nation's veterans, who have sacrificed so much on behalf of our country, are left paying the price.     
   It is time, Madam Speaker, like in the underlying bill that this rule makes in order, to put partisanship and politics aside and work together to do what is in the best interest of our Nation's veterans. I see no better time than right now. By defeating the previous question, the House will send a strong message to our veterans that they have our commitment to provide them with the funding increase they need, deserve, and were promised. 
   Once Democrat leaders appoint conferees, the House can move forward and pass a stand-alone veterans funding bill, and it will pass with strong bipartisan support. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a tax bill that would raise taxes permanently to give 1 year's worth of tax relief. Let me repeat that, Madam Speaker. This rule provides for consideration of a tax bill that would raise taxes permanently to give 1 year's worth of tax relief. 
   The AMT was enacted in 1969 to prevent a small number of wealthy taxpayers from using, at that time, legitimate deductions and credits to avoid paying taxes altogether. Back then, the tax affected only 155 people, the super-rich. The AMT was never adjusted to match inflation. Therefore, the AMT is affecting more and more taxpayers today. Without fixing the AMT problem, millions of taxpayers will be hit by the AMT, costing the average taxpayer about $2,000. 
   When Republicans gained control of the Congress, we passed legislation to protect American taxpayers from the unintended consequences of the bracket creep of AMT. Unfortunately, this measure was vetoed by President Clinton. So here we are again today trying to temporarily protect taxpayers from the AMT. 
   The longer we wait to fix the AMT, the longer it will take for the IRS to make the necessary changes in the tax forms and to process tax returns under the changes in the law. That is for this tax year. As of right now, the Democrat majority's failure to pass an AMT fix will force the IRS to delay processing tax refunds until mid-March at the earliest. This is likely to delay returns for over 20 million taxpayers who currently would be subjected to the AMT but who, with the patch, would not have to pay the AMT. This comes out, Madam Speaker, to about a $75 billion interest-free loan to the Federal Government from the taxpayer and paid for by the taxpayer. 
   I support fixing the AMT trap, but it is a tax that was never intended to occur. It is going to affect millions of Americans. But the Democrat leaders in the House are making it nearly impossible to help these Americans. Let's just pass a bill to eliminate the tax. Stop using this tax relief bill to raise taxes by over $50 billion. 
   Just as disappointing as the tax increases included in the bill is tax relief that is not included in this bill, and I am talking about a particular loophole in the tax law. I am dismayed that an extension of the sales tax deduction is not in this bill, the sales tax deduction for those States that do not have a State income tax. It is a matter of fairness. The AMT fix is for 1 year. I think it is only a matter of fairness to extend the sales tax deduction for those States who don't have a State income tax for 1 year. 
   I attempted to offer an amendment in the Rules Committee last night, to allow me to offer an amendment to close this loophole or adjust this loophole on the floor today to extend the sales tax deduction again to those States that don't have State income taxes.     
   It was defeated unfortunately on a party-line vote of 2-8 with every Democrat voting to block allowing this amendment to be made in order, including two Members from Florida, which is one of the eight States affected by this legislation. 
   But there is another way, Madam Speaker, and the House will vote today on extending the sales tax deduction so it doesn't expire at the end of the year. If you are from Washington, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alaska, join me in voting ``no'' on the previous question. 
   I will then amend the rule so we can vote to extend the deduction and modify this loophole that I was talking about and ensure that our constituents in States that do not have a State income tax are treated fairly. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I know my friends on the other side of the aisle can say no, these are adjustments. If they are adjustments, I hope they will acknowledge with me that what I am trying to do on the previous question is to make an adjustment for those States, for the people in States that don't have a State sales tax, to make that adjustment so they can have fairness across the board of being able to deduct sales tax from their Federal income tax. I will be making that motion, Madam Speaker, on the previous question.

   That is, by the way, in your budget. You do it with a mechanism called the reserve fund which says you have to offset. 
   But I will say this, and I will talk about economic policy and tax policy. Because of the tax policies we have put in place with the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, we have seen an extraordinarily strong economy in this country. I think that is pretty hard to refute, and so I just want to point that out to my friend.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I yield myself 2 minutes, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for the previous speaker, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has always been one that believes that this House ought to do their work, and he has worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that this House does their work on the appropriation process. 
   But I find it ironic that in the gentleman's remarks talking about what happened with a bill that President Clinton vetoed is because, at least the inference is there's a lot of extraneous stuff on that bill. 
   My goodness, how history repeats itself, because here we are in the closing days of the first session of this 110th Congress, and what are we contemplating? There are so many rumors around here about an omnibus bill. And we know what omnibus bills are. There are so many things that are stuck in there to extract votes, generally they come out after the fact, embarrasses the institution, and yet we seem to be going down exactly the same path. 
   I appreciate the gentleman for acknowledging that President Clinton did veto a permanent repeal of the AMT, which was simply the point that I made in the outset of my remarks. 
   But I would just say, Madam Speaker, it seems to me we're going, that there will be a speech maybe later on this week, probably next week, about everything put into one package. And maybe we should take my friend from Wisconsin's remarks and just repeat them again, because history does repeat itself.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's put this thing in perspective. This Democrat tax plan essentially allows the State sales tax deduction for those States that don't have a State income tax to expire. 
   Residents of States with no income tax deserve to be allowed to deduct their State sales tax from their Federal income tax bill. To me, Mr. Speaker, it's a matter of fairness, which is why the Republican Congress acted in 2004 to restore the State and local sales tax deduction. This law provided tax fairness to Washingtonians and those who live in other non-income tax States for the first time in nearly 20 years. 
   Now, this deduction, Mr. Speaker, expires in just days, at the end of this year. But this House will have the chance to vote today, Mr. Speaker, to extend the State sales tax deduction by joining me in voting ``no'' on the previous question. I will then amend the rule to allow an amendment to be offered on the underlying bill to extend the State and local sales tax deduction for 1 year, just for 1 year, as a matter of fairness. 
   To all the Members from Washington, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alaska, vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can give State sales tax deduction fairness for our constituents. This is a bipartisan issue, and we can achieve an extension today with a bipartisan vote against the previous question. Our constituents deserve fair treatment; so let's give this to them. The underlying bill that this rule makes in order is going to raise taxes by $50 billion. The very least we can do is to extend the sales tax deduction out of fairness. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear because there has been a great deal of discussion on the floor today about PAYGO. I think PAYGO has a lot of merit. I happen to disagree as it relates to this particular tax plan in the underlying bill, but there has been a great deal of discussion about PAYGO. So let me make perfectly clear this previous question vote does not waive the PAYGO rule. If the previous question is defeated and my amendment is made in order, the PAYGO rule is not waived. If a Member then wants to raise, when the issue is on the floor, a point of order against that amendment, they are perfectly able to do that. So my amendment does not waive the PAYGO rule. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material in the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

Why is the House going to spend 2 hours today discussing a bill that could have been handled in just 20 minutes under suspension and ultimately passed by an overwhelming number of votes in this House? And why, if the House is going to such lengths and dedicating 2 hours to consider watertrails on the Chesapeake Bay, are Members being blocked from a true, meaningful debate on the issue? 
   This rule allows only one amendment to be offered, and that amendment would simply limit the extension of this existing Chesapeake Bay law for another 5 years, instead of extending it forever as the bill is currently written. If we are going to go through all the trouble of bringing this noncontroversial bill to the floor, why don't we have a real debate that allows every Member who has an amendment or an idea to improve this legislation to come to the House floor and have it discussed and voted on? 
   When the Democrat leaders took control of the Congress after the 2006 election, they promised the American people that they would run the House in a more open and honest manner. But ever since they made that promise, Democrat leaders have been doing just exactly the opposite. The Congressional Record shows that this Democrat Congress actually has the worst record, Mr. Speaker, the worst record on openness in the history of our country. In the past year-and-a-half, they have only allowed one bill, one bill, to come to the House floor and be debated under an open rule. As we see today on this Chesapeake Bay bill, they are even shutting down debate on even the most noncontroversial pieces of legislation. 
   Now, I might point out also that the Democrat leaders today convened the House early. Normally when you get to work early it is either because you have a lot to do or you want to go home early. Let's consider that the only two things the House is scheduled to do today is to spend 2 hours debating watertrails and the Chesapeake Bay and one hour of debate on a final budget that was supposed to have been done, Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago, and it is a budget that raises taxes by the largest amount in American history. At any rate, that is just 3 hours of time. 
   So why did we convene early? What are we going to do the rest of the day? It seems pretty clear that the House didn't get to work early today because they had so much to do, but rather it  is, I believe, so the House can leave early and go home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have another idea, and that is that this House get serious about the rising price of gasoline in our country. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote no against the previous question when they bring that up at the end of the debate to allow the House to debate ``an amendment to a bill which the proponents assert if enacted would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gasoline.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I first proposed this action on a similar previous question rule back on April 23. In the 44 days since, this liberal Congress has done nothing to address rising gas prices. According to information gathered by the AAA, the citizens of Washington State, my home State, who buy gas are paying the highest reported price for gasoline that has ever been paid in that State. It is at $4.19 per gallon. 
   Speaker Pelosi promised the American people that Democrats had ``a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' Speaker Pelosi also said that the Democrats have ``real solutions'' that would ``lower the price at the pump.'' Despite this promise of a plan and lower prices, since Democrats took control of the Congress, they have put forward no plan and prices have gone up, up and up to record levels.     
   And Democrats have blocked every try after try by Republicans to allow the House to debate, just simply to debate legislation to lower the price of gasoline. The only bill that Democrats have brought to the floor and passed was to file lawsuits against OPEC countries in the Middle East and to try to get them to produce more oil and to reduce prices. That is all, Mr. Speaker. 
   Democrats may believe that suing Middle Eastern countries and raising taxes is a plan to lower gas prices here in America, but common sense says that is just wrong. It is Republicans that have a plan to produce American made gas and energy and it is the Democrats who are standing in the way of these solutions. 
   Prices go up when demand goes up, and around the world the demand for oil and gas is going way up. Our country can either continue to sit here and be at the mercy of overseas Nations for our energy needs, or we as Americans can start taking matters into our own hands and start accessing the millions of barrels of known reserves right here within the United States. Our Nation's energy reserves have been put off-limits, and Democrats continue to block even exploring the possibility of producing more energy here in America. 
   With record gas prices at gas stations across the country, Americans can't afford to continue to rely on other countries in volatile parts of the world to sell us the gas and oil that we need. We need to produce this energy ourselves, Mr. Speaker. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question so this House can debate the serious issue of rising gas prices confronting Americans in our country and so we can start producing, producing, Mr. Speaker, American-made gasoline. 
   If the House is going to spend 2 hours debating authorizing the Chesapeake Bay Watertrails law for 5 years or not, we certainly I think, Mr. Speaker, can afford to dedicate some time to considering ways to reduce the rising price of gasoline. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5540, CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND WATERTRAILS NETWORK CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leaders today have put a noncontroversial Chesapeake Bay watertrails bill on the House floor, but what is first and foremost on the minds of Americans is gas prices, as we have talked about today. And it's also a huge concern in the Chesapeake Bay communities. 
   I venture to guess the citizens and families living around the Chesapeake Bay don't wake up in the morning worried about watertrails but they do worry in the Chesapeake Bay and the Chesapeake basin about the price of gasoline. 
   I would like to submit, Mr. Speaker, for the Record, several news releases here talking about the price of gasoline. This is from WJZ, a local Maryland station. And it says here, ``Watermen Feeling Pain At the Pump.'' It talks about the beautiful weather, but it also says that the price of gas is doubling and the price of seafood is going down, and that's a bad combination. 
   Here is another one: ``Gas prices force business owners to clamp down.'' And there's talk about a gentleman who has to spend $4,000 a month on gasoline. 
   And here is another one regarding the Chesapeake Bay community. It says, ``Gas prices fuel dip in fishing.''  
   Watermen Feeling Pain At The Pump  
   The weather is beautiful on the Chesapeake Bay. But things are downright ugly at fuel docks. 
   Alex DeMetrich reports gas prices are soaring and that's having an impact on those who depend upon boats and the bay to make a living. 
   Naming a work boat the ``Last Penny'' may have been a stab at humor once, but it's striking a little too close to reality at fuel docks around the bay. Diesel is at $4.50 a gallon and climbing. 
   ``The gas is doubling and the price of seafood is going down,'' said Waterman Bucky Murphy. 
   Working the water takes constant moving. But with crabs spotty and fuel high, watermen are trying to conserve. 
   ``They're hurting us bad. Its almost double in the past year, so it's taking a right good bite out of us.'' said waterman Wendell Lednun. 
   Joe Spurry buys crabs on Tilghman Island, but his truck might carry them as far away as New York. 
   Right now, crabs are selling for around $90 a bushel dockside. By the time they get to a seafood market in Baltimore, they could cost around $200 a bushel.   
   Gas Prices Force Business Owners to Clamp Down  
   Tom Campbell is spending $4,000 per month on gasoline. 
   The gas budget for Mr. Campbell's business Short Hop Moving Inc., an Annapolis-based moving company, increased $2,500 since the price of fuel reached an uncomfortable high. The company has since taken a financial hit because of the spike in gas prices. 
   ``In the past year, we cut our business literally in half,'' he said. 
   Skyrocketing gas prices forced Mr. Campbell to reduce his fleet from seven moving trucks to three, and to close a satellite office in Laurel. 
   The small-business owner said he can no longer give his employees company credit cards to use at the pumps. Instead he fills up the trucks himself each morning to monitor what he's spending on gas, which is inching toward $4 per gallon. 
   Gasoline prices have shattered previous records, reaching an average high of $3.72 per gallon in Maryland yesterday, said Ragina Avarella of the AAA Mid-Atlantic division. 
   Mr. Campbell said the strain of gas prices has extended beyond his business and into his personal life, as well. His daughter now walks to visit friends, and he and his wife cut down on driving by using only one of their vehicles, he said. 
   ``It's changing everything,'' he said. ``It's changing the way we do business completely.'' 
   The pain at the pump isn't limited to transportation with tires. Elevated prices are causing some charter fishing captains to want to jump overboard. Alex Schlegel, owner of Hartge Yacht Yard in Galesville, said he is selling gas for about $4.20 per gallon at his fuel dock and has noticed fewer small powerboats on the water. 
   Capt. Joe Richardson, of Dancer Sportfishing Charters, said he is trying to spend as little time at the pump as possible, and that means changing the way he does business. He said he isn't able to take his charters out as far into the Chesapeake Bay as he did previously as a means of conserving gas. 
   ``You have to change your game plan; you have to raise your prices, and you're afraid to price yourself out of the game,'' he said. 
   Mr. Richardson said he noticed people calling to make price comparisons more this year than ever before. 
   ``We might just end up sitting at the dock if the prices get too high,'' he said, explaining that bookings for his charter boat are already down from last year. 
   Capt. T.J. Johnson, owner of Tracy Lynn Charters out of Edgewater, said he has tried to stay at the same price for years. But this year, that's proven difficult as he was forced to raise rates by $25 for this fishing season because of fuel costs. 
   He said he fears raising rates too much will put him out of business. 
   ``If you go up too much, you're gonna be sitting at home every day and not doing any charters at all,'' he said. ``It makes it tough.'' 
   To conserve gas and save money, Mr. Johnson said he has taken advantage of fishing areas closer to his Edgewater dock, but will have to double the distance he travels from 5 miles to 10 or 15 miles later in the season. 
   ``I can't just take them out for sucker laps,'' he said. 
   Mr. Johnson said that before fuel cost went through the roof he ran between 85 and 90 charters a year. Last year, that number fell to 60 charters, and this year he said he has only taken about 10 trips out, half as many as this time last year. 
   Even regular clients are reducing their bookings already this season, he said. 
   Otis Elevator Co., a national elevator, escalator and moving walkway manufacturer, booked about 38 charter trips with Mr. Johnson last year. This year, Mr. Johnson said the company has cut back to 25 dates from now through October. 
   Though he couldn't name a specific reason why the company, among other regular clients, has reduced their charter trips, Mr. Johnson said he suspects it is combination of the sluggish economy and higher transportation costs that have people spending less across-the-board. 
   And the lack of business has affected how he and his wife use fuel at home, he said. 
   Mr. Johnson, who maintains the family vehicles himself, said he tries to keep oil changes up-to-date and has begun filling his tires with more air, sacrificing a smoother ride for better gas mileage. 
   ``I'm just gonna try to ride it out and do what I can. I ain't got much choice,'' he said. ``I'm doing a lot of things now that I never had to do 20 years ago.'' 
   For others, it's business somewhat as usual. 
   Sandi Latham owns Sandi's Flower Shop on King George Street and offers delivery services to her clients. So far, she said, she has ``absorbed the loss'' in hopes that the cost of gas will begin to drop. 
   Ms. Latham has taken the hit from all sides since the cost of her trash removal and delivery from wholesalers has spiked to make up for the increases at the pump. 
   She hasn't increased her own delivery rates, which she said are now hovering at about $10 for local deliveries. Ms. Latham receives her wholesale flower deliveries from companies in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., that charge from $9 to $12.50 to deliver flowers to the downtown florist. While she said those prices are ``very reasonable'' for the distance of the trip, the rate increases are becoming too much for her to absorb. 
   Ms. Latham said she fears raising delivery rates greater than $10 because she feels her customers will find anything higher ``frustrating.'' But she said most people are willing to pay for the convenience of delivery. Still, she wants to wait out the competition. 
   ``You hate to be the first guy that raises their rate,'' she said. ``But you also hope your customers will come to you for your product.'' 
   In the meantime, she said she is reviewing her own costs and considering mark-ups across-the-board for flower sales to make up for the steady increase in gasoline prices. 
   ``It's bearing down on me and I've tried not to raise it, but I'm just going to not have a choice,'' she said.   
   Outdoors: Gas Prices Fuel Dip in Fishing; Charter Operations, Bait Shops Feeling Economic Pinch  
   It's the economy, stupid. 
   So said Clinton aid James Carville in that future president's first and winning campaign against George H. W. Bush. It turned out he was right. Bottom line: It is the economy. 
   Anglers who don't daydream of skippering a charterboat or guiding once they retire are as scarce as drivers of big SUVs pleased with their fuel mileage. But, believe me, these days their pipe dreams would be nightmares. That is if they got any sleep at all. And no psychiatrist would be needed to interpret their dreams. 
   It's the economy, stupid. 
   This time around, Izaak Waltons can't blame fisheries administrators, regulations, publicity about blemished rockfish or the shortage of fish available. Repercussions from the escalating price of fuel are felt everywhere, sportsfishing is no exception. Neither is the business of chartering, headboating or commercial fishing.  
   The same applies to businesses associated with fishing; one big tackle shop proprietor told me the other day, ``I've got four people and myself working right now--and not a single customer in the shop. Haven't seen one in 10 minutes.'' 
   On weekdays, charter fishermen tell me they've never seen so few chartercraft on the Chesapeake; even worse is the number of private boats they encounter. If they see a dozen recreational boats during a trip that's a lot. Meanwhile, the fish appear to be staging for a good summer season. 
   The black drum, a few of which were caught earlier in Tangier Sound down Crisfield way, are now moving in at the Stone Rock off Tilghman Island; some fishermen are using white perch to catch stripers via live-lining, and the Norfolk spot arrival is picking up despite the bay's chillier waters. As soon as the bay gets a few degrees warmer the perch will leave the tributaries--and at the ocean, the big bluefish, tuna and sharks are already moving in. 
   Sorry, the same can't be said for fishermen, recreational or charter. No matter how they fish, they all share the same woe; the cost of fuel. A gallon of diesel can cost more than $5. A charter skipper can hike his price 25 bucks and what's he got? 
   He's got five more gallons of fuel, that's all he's got. And that won't take him far in a big charterboat. That's what Capt. Ed Darwin runs out of Mill Creek, Annapolis. His Becky-D purrs on gasoline, which is a bit less costly than diesel, so after considering the overall economy, he decided on only a $25 increase--and already finds fuel costs are outpacing him. 
   ``I raised my price $40 and the way fuel is rising, I already lose $20 every day,'' said Bruce Scheible of Scheible's Fishing Center at Ridge in St. Mary's County. ``No way can I get over the hump in fuel costs--not only that we've got good fishing, but less customers. Fortunately we've got bluefish (2- to 3-pounders) in the Potomac along with rockfish and with hardheads moving in--and that can save us money. We don't have to run all the way down the Potomac to the bay then to the fishing grounds below there. We have charters, but certainly not near as many as usual. 
   Fred Donovan, dockmaster at the Rod 'n Reel Docks, Chesapeake Beach, played a hunch. He didn't raise prices at one of the biggest fishing centers on the bay figuring it would give him a competitive edge and it worked in the always popular trophy season when everyone wanted to go. Now the dollar figures whirl by so fast on fuel pumps, soon his regular customers who haven't already booked their dates can expect a letter informing them prices are going up $50. He will honor lower agreed prices made in early bookings. 
   Fred's got a few other problems. Much of his clientele come from long distances, Pennsylvania and Virginia or further away, and it's getting so they now have to figure into expenses the driving costs to Chesapeake Bay. And, what to do about headboat prices? The big fuel thirsty headboat Lady Hooker has started headboat service out of the Rod 'n Reel with varying success (cool bay waters have slowed perch'n) and it's no longer financially feasible to sail with less than 15 customers aboard at $55 a head plus the dozen bloodworms each angler gets with the ticket. 
   Some trips have already been canceled like the one on the day I called when only 11 fishermen showed. The Lady Hooker sails at 8 a.m. and returns to the docks at 3 p.m., no more night trips. Perch, spot and hardheads are the usual catches with blues and stripers other possibilities. One has to be careful about raising headboat prices; headboaters are more cost conscious than charter fishermen. Fred advises anglers to call ahead at 800-233-2080 to inquire of the likelihood of sailing on a given weekday. 
   The economy isn't good, so they don't want to raise prices for fear losing customers, yet if they don't they can lose money by running. And like the rest of us, they have no idea how high fuel costs will peak. There has to be a limit, but where? Fuel prices impact every aspect of sportsfishing as they do everything else. 
   Others who cater to the fishermen are also in a bind. Rick Warren of Warren's Bait Box, Glen Burnie, is concerned about his business. His customers no longer shop; ``they know what they want when they come in--and that's what they buy, they don't look around to shop for anything else. Rising fuel costs, whether in vehicles to get them to fishing areas, fuel for boats to fish from and higher headboats or charterboat fees have them strapped for cash, there's little to spare,'' said Rick. 
   ``Higher end and more profitable tackle items like the better rods and reels aren't selling like they used to,'' said Charlie Ebersberger, proprietor of Anglers Sports Center just off of Route 50. ``Fishermen check prices carefully, they've become more cost conscious and now look for lower-end and mid-priced merchandise to save money for fuel-associated costs. I hope it changes when the fishing gets hot--and they still just have to go regardless of cost.'' 
   Capt. Stu Burgoon Sr., who with his son Stu Jr. fish a few charterboats out of Happy Harbor in Deale, have started to fish for black drum at the Stone Rock before or after they get their rockfish have made some changes in gears to their boats to increase fuel efficiency, but the longer run for drum is still costly. Once the expected live-lining at the False Channel gets hot in a few weeks, it will be a long run out of Deale to load up on stripers. 
   Capt. George Prenant, past president of the Maryland Charterboat Association who skippers the Stormy Petrel out of Happy Harbor, says the charter skipper who gets four or five bookings a week is quite lucky. 
   ``Customers have become `somewhat' timid,'' said George who endured the Kepone scare, Tropical Storm Agnes that muddied waters for weeks on end and other economic woes in his long career. ``Trophy season was good, but now that they've (customers) have got cabin fever out of their system, who knows what lies ahead. We'll just have to wait and see.'' 
   Most who board charterboats these days can expect to pay about $500 for a half-day trip, $700 to $750 for a full day--and that's at the moment. If fuel prices keep rising (lately they've been rising a few cents a day), expect to pay more. The prudent fisherman will book now at a given price and hope there are no additional surcharges for fuel as there well might be. 
   Meanwhile, more than a few marinas and fishing centers have vacant slips as some have decided not to use their boats this year. Some will fish selectively and charter--get a gang together--to save on bottom-line expenses. One yacht club always filled has 14 vacant slips. The expected run of bluefish aplenty could help a bit, blues spread out everywhere, which should mean shorter runs and small boats to catch fish, but 'most everyone demands rockfish. Close by perch, hardheads and spot are other alternatives. 
   No matter how one looks at it, fishing is going to cost much more this year--and at a time when the outlook is for great catching. Everything depends on priorities. Though dyed-in-the-wool Izaak Waltons place fishing high on their priorities, there's a limit. The vehicles they drive to work also need fuel in their tanks. A budget can be stretched only so much--and everything costs more because to transportation charges. 
   If you think things are bad in the bay, how would you like to be an offshore charter skipper trying to book parties for billfish and tuna in the distant bluewater canyons. The cost of fuel alone can be $1,000 to $2,000 depending on size of boat and canyon targeted what with diesel prices for many charterboats already above five bucks a gallon for those obliged to buy their fuel at the docks they fish from. If you have to ask the price for a charter you can't afford to go.  
   Mr. Speaker, it is really time for the House to debate ideas for lowering gas prices. I'm going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question, and I will move to amend the rule to allow that any amendment be made in order on the underlying bill that would have the effect of lowering the national average price of gasoline.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1332, SMALL BUSINESS LENDING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, the Small Business Administration was originally created to assist small businesses which are vital sources of job creation and economic growth here in America, but are often disadvantaged when it comes to access to capital. 
   The Small Business Administration's two largest small business finance programs, the 7(a) loan guarantee program and the 504 loan program, have assisted thousands of small businesses every year that otherwise would not have attained a commercial loan for the purpose, amount and on the terms that small business borrowers need. 
   The Small Business Lending Improvement Act enhances and streamlines these finance programs and makes the 7(a) program more affordable and accessible to borrowers and lenders by providing the Small Business Administration with the authority to use funds to reduce fees on both lenders and borrowers. This bill encourages increased lender participation in the 7(a) program by reducing application burdens for borrowers and lenders in rural areas and expediting the loan consideration time. 
   This bill was favorably reported by the Committee on Small Business by a voice vote, and it enjoys strong bipartisan support. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation's small businesses are the engine that drives our economy. Small business represents 99.7 percent of all employers and have generated 60 to 80 percent of new jobs annually over the last decade. Clearly, we must act to help our Nation's small businesses continue to grow and create job opportunities. 
   While I support the underlying Small Business Lending Improvement Act, more must be done to help small businesses overcome the challenges they face. Congress must act quickly to continue tax incentives for small business expenses that spur job creation and grow the economy. 
   In the last Congress, I supported the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act, which extended through 2009 the enhanced section 179 small business expensing allowance. In 2007 the maximum allowance will be $112,000. But in 2010, this maximum amount will plummet to $25,000 without an extension of the current law. 
   I am disappointed that the Democrat majority has chosen not to provide small businesses more significant tax relief in a form that has an opportunity to become law. We cannot afford to halt our Nation's economic growth and job creation opportunities by letting small business tax relief policies expire and become part of the Democrats' proposed largest tax increase in American history. 
   Congress must also act to provide regulatory relief and make health care more affordable for small business employees and the self-employed. 
   Madam Speaker, because of the way health insurance is priced and regulated, small businesses usually pay more for similar coverage than larger corporations, and I think this is simply unfair. It is currently estimated that 60 percent of those without health insurance work for or depend on small employers who lack the ability to provide health benefits for their workers. 
   The high cost of health insurance prevents many small business owners from providing health insurance to their employees, and we must look for ways to make health care more affordable. One way is to expand Health Savings Accounts so that individuals can choose a health plan that best meets their needs. Health Savings Accounts allow individuals to make their own decisions about their health care, while building, at the same time, savings tax free to pay for future medical expenses. 
   Another way to make health insurance more affordable and accessible is to allow small businesses to join together to use the marketplace to buy health insurance as a group. This would provide small businesses with greater bargaining power and lower health plan costs that larger companies now often afford. 
   We must also provide fairness to self-employed individuals who purchase their own health insurance, but yet are treated differently under the U.S. Tax Code than those who receive health insurance benefits from their employer. 
   So I call on this new majority to bring forth legislation to the House floor that not only makes improvements to small business lending programs, as this bill does, but that provides real tax and regulatory relief to small businesses and makes health insurance more accessible. 
   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that this House Resolution 330 is a structured rule. I am even more concerned that an amendment offered by my colleague from Indiana, Mr. Buyer, the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, was not made in order by the Rules Committee. In fact, it was rejected by the Democrat majority on a party line vote. 
   Mr. Buyer's thoughtful amendment would authorize Federal contracting officials to treat small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans under the same rules as those applied to businesses in SBA's 8(a) program. Under House Resolution 330, Members are denied the opportunity to consider a full range of ideas on this floor to the Small Business Lending Improvement Act. 
   Accordingly, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question and against House Resolution 330.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. 
   Let me first talk about the issue of the structured rule and about Mr. Buyer's amendment, which I am going to call for a vote on the previous question so we can rectify what we didn't do in Rules last night, and that is simply this: The Rules Committee exists to make rules for debate on the floor of this House. We, on a regular basis, waive the rules for whatever. In fact, we are going to have the supplemental budget on the floor, and line 1 of that supplemental rule talks about waiving rules. 
   So the point is this: If we had had an open rule, as I suggested last night, Mr. Buyer could have offered his amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me respond. I appreciate at least the short time that the gentleman yielded to me. I wish I could have made my point, but I will finish making it here. 
   And that is if we had had an open rule, Mr. Buyer could have come to the floor and attempted to offer his amendment. Somebody would have probably raised the germaneness issue under a point of order, and I have all the confidence in the world that the Speaker would have ruled it out of order because that is what the rules are. 
   But now, because we have established a policy here of going through structured rules, we want to give every Member in this body an opportunity to see if we should have this amendment considered that allows for disabled veterans who have businesses to be treated as others would under that section of the SBA Act. 
   The second point I want to make in response to my friend's talking about tax relief, he talked about this majority's attempt, and I think he used the word ``attempt,'' or intention to address the AMT. I agree it needs to be addressed. There is a huge cost, as the gentleman knows; so we, in the past Congresses, have addressed it. But the tax relief issues that I was talking about in my remarks are already in place. They are already in place. They have been acted on. They were voted on, and the American people have enjoyed the tax relief. And they are going to go away if the majority follows at least the proposed budget that was passed by this body. It would result in the largest tax increase in American history, not only in the one that I cited but in others. 
   So with that, the last thing I would like to mention to my friend, because he talked about veterans funding, we not only dealt with and resolved the concurrent receipt issue, but in the last 6 years, veterans funding has increased by 50 percent. We all know that it is important that veterans get their due care because of what they have given us and our freedoms. So I just want to set the record straight that in the last 5 years, there has been a great deal of increase. 
   So we will be asking to vote, Madam Speaker, on the previous question. I will be asking for a ``no'' vote so that I can amend this rule to allow the House to consider an amendment offered by Mr. Buyer and provide the appropriate waivers. As I stated before, the Buyer amendment would authorize Federal contracting officials to treat small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans under the same contracting rules as those applied to businesses in the 8(a) program. 
   Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, the Rules Committee met yesterday, and they rejected, on a party-line vote, making it in order. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 contains provisions that are important to our troops serving abroad, to our national security and to my constituents in central Washington. It authorizes more funding for force protection, including over $4 billion for vehicles designed to protect our troops from improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, in Iraq. 
   This legislation includes the Wounded Warrior Act, which passed the House earlier this year, that would help address the challenges that face our recovering servicemembers and families. This bill also extends the language enacted last year to prevent TRICARE copay increases. 
   In addition to providing the authorization levels that our servicemembers need, I am pleased that the language was included that emphasizes congressional support for the National Nuclear Security Administration's role in the 300 Area transition at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in my district and specifically at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
   The National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of Energy Office of Science and the Department of Homeland Security all signed a memorandum of understanding last year agreeing to funding commitments for this very important transition.     
   The committee has been helpful on this issue in the past, and I appreciate its continued support in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's 300 Area  transition. A successful transition at the lab will make it possible for nearly 1,000 scientists to continue their work and allow key national security related missions to continue. 
   Another issue that is an issue of great importance is the ongoing cleanup of the Department of Energy's Hanford nuclear site, which is a legacy going back to World War II. I am pleased this committee, like in recent years, has supported my request to authorize the full $690 million needed for the waste treatment plant next year. 
   Construction of the waste treatment plan is a critical effort to clean up some of our Nation's most dangerous legacy nuclear waste. I am pleased this legislation recognizes the importance of this project. 
   In addition to authorizing the funding needed for cleanup at Hanford, I am pleased that we are working to address the concerns of Department of Energy nuclear site workers who suffered health effects from their work at government sites. This bill includes language similar to a bill I recently cosponsored that extends and increases the scope of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Ombudsman's Office so that it is still better to assist workers seeking compensation. 
   The Ombudsman's Office assists workers who have filed for compensation under this compensation program. These workers, Madam Speaker, played a vital role in our Nation's defense during the hot war and the Cold War. If it is found that their illness has been caused by their work, they deserve just and prompt compensation. 
   I am also pleased that funding is authorized to upgrade and expand the training range at the Yakima Training Center in my district. $29 million will be used to increase the size of the training space, allow for urban operation training, and support the digital systems used by today's Stryker forces. The new range is expected to be completed by August 2009, and will provide critical training for our active duty and Reserve Army soldiers. 
   Madam Speaker, while H.R. 1585 is a good bill, it is not a perfect bill. This bill cuts nearly $800 million in funding for a robust, layered ballistic missile defense system capable of intercepting missiles at all stages of flight. Despite recent missile tests in North Korea and the intelligence community's belief that within the next decade Iran will have missiles capable of reaching the United States, the Democrat majority of the House Armed Services Committee rejected a proposal to restore more than $764 million to the Missile Defense Agency's budget. I don't believe now is the time to slow down the development of a strong missile defense system. As ballistic missile threats increase, we must be able to develop the capabilities necessary to protect ourselves. 
   This bill also cuts $867 million from the Army's modernization program, the Future Combat Systems, which helps keep our Armed Forces prepared for future combat scenarios. It is important to find new technologies to optimize information flow and combat systems in the future, but the severe cuts in this bill puts the modernization of the Army in jeopardy. This 1-year cut is greater than cuts in the last 3 years combined. 
   Congressman TODD AKIN from Missouri, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, put forward an amendment to the Rules Committee last night to restore $134 million for Future Combat Systems. But sadly, his amendment was rejected on a party-line vote by the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, a total of 135 amendments were allowed to be submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration, and this rule allows for consideration of 50 amendments on the floor today. I am deeply troubled that for the first time, the first time during my tenure in Congress and tenure on the Rules Committee, Members of Congress reported that they were actually prohibited, prohibited from submitting an amendment to the committee after the deadline. 
   Specifically, Congressman Akin from Missouri and Congressman Gingrey from Georgia attempted to offer second-degree amendments to an amendment offered by the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) concerning the morning-after pill. 
   These types of amendments by definition cannot be drafted until the text of the original amendment has been seen, and therefore, it was after the announced amendment deadline that each of those two Members, AKIN and GINGREY, attempted to submit their amendments. But the submission, the submission itself was denied by the Democrat majority. 
   While amendments to amendments are not the norm of the House, Members certainly have had the ability to offer such amendments to the Rules Committee, or at least they did, Madam Speaker, until this week. 
   So let me be clear. The Democrat leadership actually denied Members of Congress the opportunity to have their amendments presented and then denied by the committee because typically amendments that are offered late are denied. But they didn't even have the opportunity to submit them late. 
   All Members of Congress are elected to this body and they have the duty to represent their constituents through the legislative process. The manner in which these Members of Congress were treated was unnecessary. Madam Speaker, I certainly hope it never happens again. 
   I am also disappointed that the Democrat majority has chosen to go out of its way to be inconsistent and change the rules and definitions, leaving Members of Congress questioning what rules and norms they should follow. Democrats on the Rules Committee have chosen to strictly enforce the amendment deadline on some occasions, but on others they have made amendments in order that were submitted past the deadline. They have changed the definition of rules, and for the first time in at least a decade they have outright rejected Members of Congress from submitting amendments to the Rules Committee for consideration. 
   Last year, the Speaker and Members of the current majority pledged that this Congress would be the most open Congress in history. However, on several occasions now the Rules Committee has literally closed the door on Members and denied them the opportunity to submit an amendment to the committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I remain optimistic. I tend to have that in my nature. But so far, I must say the new Democrat majority, so far their actions have spoken much, much louder than their words. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. None. That is precisely my point. 
   My point is how can a Member offer a second-degree amendment until an amendment has been offered to which a Member could respond to. 
   So the gentlelady talks about 135 amendments. That tends to be somewhere near the norm for Defense authorization bills in the past. So there is nothing outside that norm. I thank the gentlelady for making the point. None of the 135 were second-degree amendments, and my remarks were specifically addressed to second-degree amendments.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. It is true we, the minority members of the  Rules Committee, offered secondary amendments, but they are secondary amendments, and we had asked unanimous consent of the full committee to break the order because they were denied to be submitted on regular order. 
   So while, yes, we offered them and they were defeated on a party-line vote, had they been offered, they would have had a notation that they were late and they probably would have been rejected. 
   My point is you broke from tradition. You broke from tradition by not allowing a Member to submit an amendment late. That is my whole point. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, I will be asking for a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that I can amend section 2(c) of this rule after ``shall not be subject to amendment'' and insert ``(except the amendment numbered 43 in the report, to be offered by Representative Michaud of Maine, or his designee).'' 
   By defeating the previous question, Members will be able to offer amendments to the Michaud amendment, and a full and wide range of views can be discussed. Those rules were denied because we were not allowed to offer secondary amendments, at least, to the Rules Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (DOCTOR-OWNED HOSPITALS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, on June 8, the New York Times published a story that raised questions about Senators that amended legislation to protect home State hospitals from a new move in this Congress to ban doctor-owned hospitals. The article labeled these actions as ``special interest'' and questioned their appropriateness. It cited specific Senators, including a senior Senator from my State of Washington. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm not familiar with the circumstances surrounding each hospital in the article, but I am very familiar with Wenatchee Valley Medical Center and efforts being undertaken by those who represented in Congress to protect this institution from the threat of a government-forced closure or sale. 
   The criticism leveled against the Washington State Senator in the New York Times article is unjustified and totally without merit. Senator Murray's action to protect the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center was entirely appropriate. In fact, it's what this Nation's citizens should expect from their elected representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's troubling that the targets of scrutiny are those who are standing up and who are protecting their constituents and not those seeking to force the closure or sale of a hometown hospital system simply because it is doctor-owned. 
   The Wenatchee Valley Medical Center and its seven clinics serve a rural population, in my State, of a quarter of a million people in an area the size of the State of Maryland. The medical center accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay, and it has a long record of providing quality care. Today, it is jointly owned by 150 doctors. For this simple reason, it is a target for some who think doctor ownership should be banned. 
   Twice in this Congress House Democrats have passed bills that would outlaw the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center as it exists today, not because of any poor care or bad behavior by its doctors but simply because it is owned by doctors. I offered amendments to both bills. Some of my amendments would have stopped the ban on doctor-owned hospitals. Others would have altered the ban to protect the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center. Unfortunately, House Democrat leaders blocked every one from even being debated and voted on the floor of the House. These same House leaders also swept aside the objections and concerns of at least eleven Democrats who have spoken out against this proposal and the harm it would cause to their local hospitals. 
   When I last spoke on the House floor against such legislation, I asked the Democrat chairman of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee if he would work with me to exempt the few existing doctor-owned hospitals that would be impacted in both Democrat and Republican districts. He replied, ``The answer is no.'' 
   The Democrat chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health  was quoted by the New York Times as saying, ``He would prefer not to exempt any doctor-owned hospitals.'' 
   When the Federal Government dictates that doctors can't own a hospital, Mr. Speaker, this is a step towards a Canadian-style, government-run health care system under which the Federal Government decides where, when, how, and even if Americans get care. This means Americans could be faced with waiting lists and rationing and bureaucrats, not doctors, making decisions about their health. 
   With those who control the House intent and insistent on banning doctor-owned hospitals, at a minimum, protection must be given to allow existing facilities like the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center to continue serving patients like it has, Mr. Speaker, for 60 years. 
   Being 1 out of 100, the powers of an individual Senator are considerable. Senator Murray used her committee position to add language protecting the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center to legislation that included the ban on doctor-owned hospitals. 
   Mr. Speaker, she has done the right thing. Despite what may have been printed in the New York Times, I will keep working with Senators Murray and Cantwell and Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers to fully protect the Wenatchee Valley Medical Center. I reject any notion that what Senator Murray has done is anything but appropriate and necessary, and I commend her for her actions.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6049, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule marks the 60th time that the leaders of this Congress have totally closed down the House floor by refusing to allow any Member of this House to offer an amendment to a bill pending and have it debated and voted upon. This is more closed rules than any Congress in the history of our country, which is exactly the opposite of the promise that the Democrat leaders made to the American people when they promised to run the most open and honest House ever. 
   The House is not open when no amendments are allowed to be offered and when a Republican alternative is blocked from even a minute of debate and denied a vote on the House floor. And it is not in the most honest House when the Rules Committee Democrats block the Republican plan to prevent tax increases from being considered, using the excuse that it doesn't meet House PAYGO rules, especially, Mr. Speaker, when it was just one week ago that the same Democrats were blatantly violating PAYGO rules by billions of dollars in the farm bill. Under this liberal Congress, it is only okay to break the House rules, apparently, when you are increasing spending by billions of dollars, but not by preventing tax increases on the American people. 
   The Republican plan that was denied, that the Democrats refused to allow the House to vote upon, would provide the following: 1 year of relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax, or the AMT; a 2-year extension of the State and local sales tax deduction for those States that do not have a State income tax; 2 more years for the research and development tax credit; 2 years for the tuition tax credit; and extensions for more expiring tax provisions. 
   This Democrat bill, for example, does absolutely nothing, nothing at all, to fix the AMT tax for 2008. Twenty-one million middle class individuals will pay an additional $61.5 billion in higher taxes next April if the AMT is not fixed and addressed. That is an average of over $2,800 per affected taxpayer, Mr. Speaker. The Republican plan fully fixes it, but today that fix is not even allowed to be considered on the House floor. Instead, the House is given one choice, and that is a fool's choice bargain to raise taxes by $54 billion in order to simply extend existing tax policies that are due to expire. 
   Mr. Speaker, current provisions in tax law are expiring, and Congress needs to act to keep these taxes from going up. But, Mr. Speaker, we all know that is no excuse to raise other taxes by billions of dollars. 
   I and many of my Republican colleagues support a great number of the tax relief extensions included in this bill, including the State and local sales tax deduction, the research and development tax credit, education and tuition tax credits, tax credits for teachers, and several renewable income tax credits. These low tax policies have been law for many years, Mr. Speaker, and they have been extended multiple times, multiple times, and always without raising taxes. 
   My Democrat colleagues will try to defend their tax-raising ways by invoking the PAYGO rules they ignored just last week. They will claim that this is just being responsible and it is not about increasing the national debt, that it is about government living within its means. 
   If only that were true, Mr. Speaker. But it is not. All you have to do is to read the final budget plan for next year that this House will vote on later today. Their budget reveals this Congress as what they truly are, and what they truly are, Mr. Speaker, is old time tax-and-spend liberals. In their budget, spending increases by $250 billion over the next 5 years. They increase the debt limit in 2008 by $654 billion, which is the largest increase in history, and they raise taxes by $683 billion, which is the largest amount in American history. More spending, higher debt, record tax increases. That is obviously the plan of this liberal Congress. 
   Now, my Democrat colleagues will also try to claim the tax increases that are in this bill aren't really that bad. But the facts are the facts, and the facts are that this bill unnecessarily increases taxes by over $50 billion. And that is just the beginning. Remember that their budget would increase taxes by over two-thirds of a trillion dollars. If they aren't raising your taxes this time in this bill, I can assure you, your time is coming. They will get you the next time. 
   When this liberal Congress imposes the largest tax increase in American history to pay for more government spending, don't think that you can escape permanently their tax-and-spend ways. Their tax increase plans include cutting the child tax credit, cutting that in half; reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax; and a tax increase for every single American taxpayer. It would even levy taxes on low-income workers who currently pay none. 
   But if there is a ray of sunshine, and there always is a ray of sunshine in bills, there is a newly created tax break, one that will put a big smile on the faces of some in this country, and it is worth over $1.5 billion.     
   The only problem, Mr. Speaker, is that this new tax break is only for trial lawyers. So the only people who will be smiling are the trial lawyers and presumably the Democrats that they give tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions to each year. 
   Under this bill, the American taxpayers will be subsidizing speculative lawsuits by trial lawyers to the tune of $1.5 billion. This special interest tax break will allow trial lawyers to make special arrangements that essentially allow them to gamble on lawsuits where they get paid on contingency fees if they win. Meanwhile, taxpayers will be footing the bill for trial lawyers writing off the expenses of conducting these ``sue them and see what we can win'' lawsuits. Count me among those, Mr. Speaker, who believe we already have too many lawsuits in this country and that we shouldn't be inventing new special tax breaks that may and probably will encourage more lawsuits. Our justice system can operate fairly, as it has done so for many years, without having to give special tax treatment to trial lawyers. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically mention the extension of the State and local sales tax deduction that is included in this bill. For nearly 20 years, Americans who paid State income taxes could deduct those taxes from their Federal tax bill, while Americans who paid State sales taxes but had no State income tax were not allowed to do so. 
   In 2006, the Republican Congress restored the sales tax deduction after years of bipartisan effort from the congressional delegations of the affected States, including my home State of Washington. The initial reinstatement of the deduction was for 2 years, 2004 and 2005. In 2006, the Republican Congress extended the sales tax deduction for 2 more years, 2006 and 2007. That deduction has now expired, and this deduction does not exist for this year, 2008. 
   Efforts last year to extend this deduction and ensure it didn't expire were unfortunately blocked by the Democrat leaders. I regret that the extension provided for the sales tax deduction in this bill is for 1 year only. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a step backwards. This deduction has been extended 2 years each time in the past, and it should be extended 2 years now. Otherwise, we face expiring in about 6 months from now because, as I mentioned, there is no sales tax deduction for the calendar year 2008. So if we are to pass this and it were to be signed into law, we would have 6 months on it  from right now. The bipartisan Senate bill introduced last month by the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee includes a 2-year extension of this sales tax deduction. 
   The Republican plan that House leaders and the Rules Committee last night blocked from being considered and debated on the floor today provided for a 2-year extension. An amendment was filed with the Rules Committee by Mr. Brady of Texas which also would have extended the deduction for 2 years, but that too was blocked by the Rules Committee from being debated on this floor. 
   It is very unfortunate that this bill moves sales tax deduction fairness backwards, not forwards. Taxpayers in income tax States have a permanent tax deduction, and taxpayers in sales tax States that have no State income tax deserve, in my view, equal treatment. The sales tax deduction should be made into permanent law. Even though I think a 2-year extension is better than 1, it should be made permanent. At the very least, they deserve at least a 2-year extension. 
   What really is more upsetting, Mr. Speaker, is that this bill could have provided very easily under existing PAYGO rules a 2-year extension. The over $1.5 billion cost of the tax deduction given to trial lawyers could instead have been used to give a 1-year extension of the sales tax deduction for those States. 
   So this bill chooses to create a new billion-plus-dollar tax cut for trial lawyers over tax fairness for the millions of residents in the State of Washington, my State, the State of Florida, the States of Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have supported every bill that has passed this House to reinstate and extend the State sales tax deduction, but none of these bills, none of these bills that extended that was being held hostage for another tax cut for another special interest. 
   Restoring and continuing the State sales tax deduction is a matter of fairness. The residents of sales tax States shouldn't have their fair treatment conditioned upon passing huge tax increases. 
   The rule that is currently before the House and the underlying bill reveal this Congress for what it really is. The rule is totally closed and does not allow debate or a vote on any amendments or an alternative Republican plan. It violates Speaker Pelosi's promise to the American people to run an open and honest House. The bill itself is just the opening act of a move to impose the largest tax increase in history on the American people. Mr. Speaker, under this liberal Congress the only tax bill allowed on the floor of the House is one that will raise taxes. Under this liberal Congress, tax relief is a myth and tax increases are a certainty. Mr. Speaker, under this liberal Congress, Americans will be sending more and more of their hard-earned dollars to Washington, DC so this Congress can increase spending and the size of the Federal Government. 
   My colleagues should oppose this closed rule and this tax increase bill. We should demand a clean tax relief extension bill that doesn't include new tax breaks for trial lawyers and over $50 billion in tax increases. This bill we know will never pass the Senate, and it will never be signed into law, if on the slim chance that it should pass both Houses and be sent to the President. Raising taxes right now on the American economy is simply the wrong thing to do, Mr. Speaker. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   In response to my good friend from New York's response, let's set the record straight. We are talking about tax extenders. By definition, tax extenders mean we are extending existing tax relief for people. These are in law already. They have been extended many, many times in the past and always been extended without raising taxes on the other end. 
   Now the gentleman says that the provision they have in this bill may or may not have bipartisan support. I'm not going to argue with that point. It probably should be looked at on its merits. 
   But my point in this and the whole part of this debate is that these are extending existing tax relief for the American people, and you don't have to start setting the principle of raising taxes in other areas to continue tax extensions that are already in law. That's the point that I was making. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. In that case, Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm going to ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so we can address the issue of high gasoline prices. But before I make my motion and explain what my motion would be if we defeat the previous question, I want to quote several parts of an editorial that was written by Tracy Warner who is the editorial writer for the Wenatchee World newspaper in Wenatchee, Washington, in my district. He kind of hits some of the issues of what we are doing, or probably I should say not doing, on the head.  
   Irrational Policy Part of the Show  
   The Keystone Cops of Congress wave their truncheons, circle and bump and wriggle their mustaches, then rush to the paddy wagon in search of greedy oil companies. In this time of hardship, this will have to suffice for energy policy. 
   The goal of the troupe is to somehow make the price of gasoline lower. High gasoline prices are extremely unpopular. If they could be forced downward, this would please Americans at an advantageous time on the political calendar. If that is not possible, and likely it is not, then complaining loudly will do. Or, for a real show of statesmanship, you can dole out financial punishment to the companies that make the product you want more of. 
   The most recent gesture was a vote Tuesday to have the government cease stockpiling oil in the strategic petroleum reserve, where some 700 million barrels are kept for national emergencies. This halt, passed by the Senate 97-1 and the House 385-25, will reduce federal petroleum purchases by 70,000 barrels a day. The hope is this will affect world oil markets, which are based on global production of 87 million barrels a day. Congress has increased supplies by 0.08 percent. We should be grateful. 
   In a very small way this shows our representatives have some understanding of economics. Oil markets are mainly a supply-and-demand issue. Raise supply and the price should drop, if demand is steady. Raise supplies by 0.08 percent and the price will drop, maybe by a like amount. We will watch with great anticipation. 
   The other legs of the constantly evolving federal oil policy are not so easily explained. Congress remains adamant that we will not attempt to affect supplies by drilling on a few thousand acres of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where production could exceed 1 million barrels a day. The reason given is this is part of an ``oil friendly policy'' and we cannot ``drill our way'' to ``energy independence'' because the effect of a million barrels is so small. So we deny ourselves a million barrels a day because it is so little, and then demand the federal government cease purchasing 70,000 barrels a day, because that is too much. 
   Some propose sending the Justice Department to file an antitrust case against OPEC, because its members scheme to limit the supply of oil and thus drive up the price. So, we do not wish to drill ourselves, because that would be wrong, but we demand OPEC sell us more, and if they don't we will send lawyers. And oh, we want ``energy independence.'' 
   And with lawyers after OPEC, the cops will still be after the oil companies. The line is oil companies get ``tax subsidies'' they do not deserve. So the House has voted to rescind a tax break for the five largest oil companies. The ``subsidy'' to which these congressmen refer was no special deal. It was a two-point corporate tax cut given to all manufacturers in 2004. In the meantime, oil companies pay taxes. According to the Tax Foundation, based on data from the Energy Information Agency, it is only in the last three years that after-tax profits of the oil industry have exceeded its taxes paid to federal and state governments. In the last 25 years, oil company taxes were nearly double oil company profits--government makes twice off oil what oil companies make off oil. 
   On we go. Newly popular in Congress is a windfall profits tax, to collect for government the oil profits government considers ``obscene.'' Oil company profit margins are less than many other industries, but setting that aside, what would be the effect of confiscating them? When this was tried in 1980, oil companies stopped selling the product from which only government would profit, and we went from expensive gas to no gas.' 
   And, we can make price gouging a crime, even though it already is a crime in most states. Make it a crime to sell fuel when prices are high. Won't that increase supplies? 
   The sum of all this policymaking is astonishing incompetence. Playing for the crowd usually leads this way.  
   Let me just make a few points here that he raised that I thought were rather interesting. 
   He talks about what Congress is doing or not doing, and he says then, and I will quote verbatim, Mr. Speaker, from his editorial, ``The most recent gesture was a vote Tuesday to have the government cease stockpiling oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where some 700 million barrels are kept for national emergencies. This halt, passed by the Senate 97-1 and the House 385-25, will reduce Federal petroleum purchases by 70,000 barrels a day. The hope is this will affect world oil prices or oil markets which are based on global production of 87 million barrels a day. Congress has increased supplies by 0.08 percent.'' 
   He then goes on to say, after I quote there, he goes on to talk then about things that we probably are not doing and should be doing otherwise. He goes on to compliment Congress by saying that ``at least they have some understanding of economics.'' If you're going to not put oil in a reserve, you presumably have more supply. 
   He then goes on to talk about what we haven't been doing, which of course is looking at more known reserves we have in our country to be energy independent. Again I would like to quote, then, verbatim as he makes, I think, a very good point: 
   ``Congress remains adamant that we will not attempt to affect supplies by drilling on a few thousand acres of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where the production could exceed 1 million barrels a day. The reason given is this is part of an `oil friendly policy' and we cannot `drill our way' to `energy independence' because the effect of a million barrels is so small. So we deny ourselves a million barrels a day because it is so little, and then demand the Federal Government cease purchasing 70,000 barrels a day, because that is too much.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, he goes on to talk about other things here, but they make a very good point. The bottom line is our energy policy is not looking at the supply side of it. We import so much of our crude oil and we aren't energy independent in that sense. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so I have an opportunity to amend the rule. 
   Since the Democrats took control of Congress in January of 2007, the cost of gasoline has risen to record-setting prices. According to a report from just 2 days ago by the AAA in my State of Washington, the price of gasoline is at a record $3.86 per gallon. That's 24 cents higher than just last month. The average price of a gallon of diesel is $4.69, which is $1.61 higher than a year ago. In the Tri-Cities where I live, a gallon of gas is $3.83. In Yakima, in the central part of my district, it's $3.84.  
   AAA: Average Gallon of Gas in Washington Hits $3.86 
   The AAA auto club says the average price of a gallon of gasoline in Washington continues to climb into record territory at $3.86. 
   That's up 24 cents in the past month and 42 cents in the past year. It's seven cents higher than the national average. 
   The AAA survey for today found that the average price of a gallon of diesel in the state is $4.69. That's up 29 cents in the past month and $1.61 in the past year. 
   The AAA says the highest gas prices in the state are at Bellingham at $3.93 and the lowest in Spokane at $3.70. 
   Prices in some other cities, according to the AAA: Olympia $3.89, Seattle $3.88, Tacoma $3.87, Vancouver $3.84, Tri-Cities $3.83, Yakima $3.84.  
   This increase in prices is causing real strain on family budgets, farmers, and for small businesses. This Congress needs to act, and we can't afford to sit and do nothing while prices continue to climb. The American people deserve action. 
   Speaker Pelosi made a promise that the Democrats had a ``commonsense plan'' to ``lower the price at the pump.'' But this Democrat Congress has done nothing but see fuel prices rise. 
   One of the most important things that this House can do is recognize a  basic economic principle of supply and demand. Mr. Speaker, the laws of supply and demand cannot be changed by wishful thinking. At times, I get the distinct impression that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that wishful thinking will actually lower gas prices. 
   I support proposals to invent and to develop new sources of energy. I think we should have a diverse portfolio of energy, and I believe a vast majority of my colleagues do as well. But gas, diesel, and oil are absolutely vital to our economy and our way of life and our future. 
   The problem we are facing at the gas pump is one of high demand and limited supply, and it's part of a global economy and a global product. With India and China suddenly consuming enormous amounts of oil, the price of it is being bid up around the world. The way to combat rising prices due to high demand is to increase supply. And yet proposals to increase oil and gas production and exploration in our country have faced years and years in opposition. Mr. Tracy, in his article, points that out as it relates to ANWR. 
   We've been stymied by Democrats in the House, blocked by Democrat Senators, and vetoed by a Democrat Senator specifically with ANWR. This liberal Congress is continuing to say ``no'' to developing energy in our country, to block any bill from being considered or voted upon that would allow for oil and natural gas exploration in Alaska or in the oceans on the Outer Continental Shelf, while at the same time they pass bills threatening to sue foreign countries to produce more oil. That doesn't increase supply, Mr. Speaker. 
   We are now paying the price for so many years of repeated refusal to make use of our country's own natural resources. Not only are we seeing gas prices going up and up, but our country is even more dependent on foreign sources of oil. Often the response to this argument from the other side of the aisle is that even if we approve production in ANWR or coastal reserves today, it wouldn't come on line for years and wouldn't really help much. 
   The hollowness of this argument in my mind, Mr. Speaker, is astonishing. We are paying the price today for their years of opposition to real solutions, and they want to keep saying ``no'' and blaming somebody else. 
   America can't afford to keep sticking its head in the sand when it comes to building more refineries and developing our own oil and gas reserves. It's time for the House to act. It's time for the House to debate ideas for lowering prices, and it's time for the majority to reveal their promised plan. 
   By defeating the previous question, Mr. Speaker, this House can finally consider solutions to rising energy costs. When the previous question is defeated, I will move to add a section to the rule, not rewrite the rule, that would lower the gas prices of unleaded gasoline. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which was approved by the Armed Services Committee by a unanimous vote of 61-0, as my friend from Florida mentioned, would make a number of very positive improvements to our armed services, and I think this entire House should be particularly proud of the committee's bipartisan efforts to improve the quality of life and safety of those serving our country in the armed services and their families. 
   This legislation would authorize $600 billion in spending for our Nation's Armed Forces, including $530 billion in spending for defense programs at the Pentagon and Energy Departments and $70 billion to bolster the success of ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for part of 2009. 
   It would authorize $783 million for continued procurement and enhancement of current body armor systems; $1 billion for the training and support of the Iraqi security forces; and nearly $2 billion for unfunded readiness initiatives as requested by the services. 
   It increases Active Duty Army personnel, Mr. Speaker, by 7,000 and Active Duty Marine Corps personnel by 5,000, while also providing our uniformed servicemembers with a much-deserved pay raise of 3.9 percent. 
   And for our active duty troops and veterans who have already done so much to serve our country, it prohibits increased copayments and premiums for TRICARE recipients, and expands suicide prevention efforts. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation also requires the Secretary of Defense to provide an annual report on Iran's nuclear capabilities so that this Congress can take a proactive role on recognizing the potential of this threat and be made aware of the threat that these capabilities pose to America and our allies. 
   While this legislation does a great deal to improve our armed services and to provide them with the resources that they need--and it accomplishes much of this in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion--there are a few areas that I think could still be greatly improved. 
   While the Rules Committee has not yet reported out a rule governing amendment debate on this legislation--we will do that this afternoon--I want to take this opportunity to make clear that there are a number of areas that I and a number of my Republican colleagues believe can be used to improve this bill through the amendment process. 
   First, it is my hope that the amendment process for this year's authorization bill, while it will be a structured rule, will still be as open as it has been under Republican majority, when between 30 and 40 amendments were regularly allowed to be debated and decided by the entire House of Representatives. 
   Of particular concern is the reduction in funds and focus that the Armed Services Committee chose to provide in this bill for protecting America from the threat posed by ballistic missiles. 
   In the Armed Services Committee, my colleague TERRY EVERETT from Alabama offered amendments to both authorize the President's request fully for missile defense and allow procurement to go forward and to restore half of the $10 million that the committee eliminated from the request for the study of a space test bed. 
   Congressman TRENT FRANKS of Arizona, a fellow cochairman of the Missile Defense Caucus, offered his own amendment to add $100 million to a program to launch multiple interceptor missiles at once to defeat multiple incoming missiles or decoys in the event of an attack. 
   While these amendments, Mr. Speaker, were defeated in committee, I believe that the entire House should have the opportunity to hear their arguments and make their own decisions on these issues, as well as the amendment by my Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Sessions of Texas, to state the sense of Congress that we need to support the development, testing, and fielding of the capability to intercept ballistic missiles in their boost phase to protect America's interests. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, while this rule provides for 2 hours of general debate on the bill, there are areas that this House needs and deserves to address through the amendment process. That will be addressed in the second rule that we will discuss in the Rules Committee tonight and will presumably be on the floor tomorrow. I certainly hope that the House is given a full and fair chance to consider these issues that I've highlighted, as well as others. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (DOUGLAS COUNTY, WASHINGTON, PUD CONVEYANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 523, legislation I introduced to convey certain Bureau of Land Management land to the Douglas County Public Utility District in Washington state. The Douglas County PUD operates the Wells Hydropower Project on the Columbia River, in North Central Washington. The PUD manages the Wells Hydroelectric Dam and the associated reservoir for multiple purposes, including power generation, fish and wildlife protection, and recreation. Almost all of the land encompassing the project area is owned by the PUD, with the exception of several small BLM holdings. 
   Passing this legislation enables the PUD to manage the project in a far more efficient manner. It also allows the BLM to concentrate its limited resources elsewhere, in areas where there are large contiguous blocks of BLM land. It is clear that we can achieve a better and more efficient management of our resources with this land conveyance. 
   In addition, since the Douglas PUD is a public agency under Washington state law, this conveyance simply moves land from the control of one public agency to the control of another agency. It is also important to note that the Douglas PUD has a stellar reputation as a steward of the environment. They worked diligently with federal and state agencies, tribal governments, and environmental groups to develop a model Habitat Conservation Plan for salmon and steelhead. The PUD also protects other forms of wildlife and provides public access wherever possible. 
   As my colleagues may recall, similar legislation passed the House last year under suspension. There is one important addition to the legislation this year. H.R. 523 calls for the proceeds of this land sale to be used to improve public access to existing BLM lands in Washington state. I am pleased that I was able to reach a consensus with members of the Natural Resources Committee to ensure that the proceeds from this sale will stay in the state where the land conveyance occurred--my home state of Washington. I am also pleased to note that these funds will go towards increasing the ability of our constituents to access their public lands. 
   It is my intention to see that these funds go towards projects like the Juniper Dunes Wilderness Area in Washington state. Due to its close proximity to the Tri-Cities, Juniper Dunes is a highly popular recreation area for serious hikers as well as families who are looking for an interesting place to explore with their children. Despite its popularity, it is extremely difficult for the public to visit Juniper Dunes. The Dunes are currently surrounded by private lands. Therefore, in order to visit the public area, one has to cross private property. H.R. 523 gives the BLM the financial resources and the flexibility they need to improve access to Juniper Dunes. 
   Finally, I am pleased that I was able to work with the Resources Committee to include language clarifying that the BLM will retain authority under the Federal Power Act for the current FERC relicensing of the Wells project. This authority will remain with the BLM until a new license is in place, which is expected in 2012. 
   I want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee, specifically Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Young and Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and Subcommittee Ranking Member Bishop and their staffs for all their hard work on this legislation. H.R. 523 will benefit the Douglas County PUD, the BLM as well as improve vitally needed public access throughout Washington state. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (FISH STOCKING IN NORTH CASCADES NATIONAL PARK SERVICE COMPLEX LAKES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3227, legislation to allow for the continued stocking of fish in certain alpine lakes in the North Cascades National Park Complex, including the North Cascades National Park, Ross Lake National Recreation Area, and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. 
   Many of these lakes have been stocked since the turn of the 20th century, long before they became part of the National Park complex. For decades, volunteer groups, working with the State of Washington, have stocked trout in a number of lakes in this area under carefully constructed management plans written by State and Park Service biologists. In addition, congressional consideration of the creation of the North Cascades National Park points to allowing fish stocking. 
   In order to protect this longstanding practice in the North Cascades, I introduced H.R. 3227 to ensure that fish stocking can continue. While I believe the original text of this bill provided the clearest path to the protection and continuation of fish stocking, I am also confident that this amended text also fully ensures the stocking of fish in these lakes.  
   I would like to briefly mention two of the changes to the legislation. First, the amended version of H.R. 3227 reduces the number of lakes that can be studied from 91, which is the number of lakes that have historically had fish stocking, to 42. I believe this reduction was unnecessary but am supporting it to ensure the advancement of this legislation. In my view, it should be left up to scientists in the Park Service and the State of Washington to decide which lakes should be stocked. Congress does not have the proper science to study which lakes are best and, therefore, we should not be arbitrarily limiting the number of lakes that can be studied. 
   The changes made in the Resources Committee also limited the type of fish that can be used to stock the lakes. After working with the National Park Service and the State of Washington, my original legislation was drafted to allow fish that are either native to the watershed or functionally sterile to be used. The version before us today states that the fish have to be both native to the Cascade Range and functionally sterile. The one word change from ``or'' to ``and'' puts a needless burden on those who stock the lakes. Those involved with fish stocking want to ensure that the lakes and the surrounding area are kept in pristine condition. In addition, the National Park Service and the State of Washington are the only entities with the authority to stock the lakes. Again, it is my view that these decisions should be left up to science and the people working in the North Cascades to decide what fish are both safe for the environment and the best for stocking. This change will only serve to increase the cost and the effort needed to stock the lakes of the North Cascades--but such a compromise moves this bill forward. 
   Despite my disagreement on the wisdom of changes made to this legislation, I am pleased that the House has the opportunity to pass H.R. 3227 today. Although the version before us is far from perfect, it does allow fish stocking to rightfully continue in the North Cascades. Compromise is never easy, and at times it produces a diminished product. That is the case today. However, I can support it as a result of bipartisan negotiations and agreement. But, more importantly, I can support it because it provides firm protections to continue fish stocking where it was always intended to be allowed. 
   Finally, I would like to thank many of my Washington state colleagues who cosponsored H.R. 3227, including RICK LARSEN, NORM DICKS, and CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, BRIAN BAIRD and ADAM SMITH. I especially would like to note the assistance provided by NORM DICKS, whose involvement in this issue goes back to his time as a staff member in Congress. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation to make sure that my constituents and many other residents of Washington and our surrounding States can continue to enjoy the recreation opportunities created by fish stocking in the North Cascades.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, it is vital that the United States continue to grow more globally competitive in the areas of scientific research and technology. Federal and private investment in supporting research and development is essential to the health of our economy and our competitiveness as a Nation. We must plan for the future by investing in areas of basic research and science today. 
   The underlying bill, H.R. 363, reaffirms our Federal commitment to increase America's global competitiveness in the areas of science, technology, research and innovation by supporting America's future scientific leaders. 
   The central Washington area that I represent is home to the Pacific Northwest National Lab in Richland, a state-of-the-art research facility. The PNNL hosts a diverse staff of outstanding scientists, engineers and support professionals. Many of these individuals in the past have received the highest levels of recognition for outstanding achievements and discoveries in their field. 
   At this lab, researchers use their expertise in the fields of environmental, radiological, biological and computational sciences to make important contributions to the scientific advancement of our Nation. The development of fuel cell technologies, biomass systems and radiation portal monitors are just a few of the areas where lab researchers are leading efforts to solve our national security and energy security challenges. 
   I am pleased that this legislation includes efforts to help encourage collaborations between scientists and national labs. Specifically, this legislation allows the National Science Foundation grants to be used in collaboration with our national labs, which means more researchers at our labs will be eligible for Federal support. 
   Madam Speaker, the underlying legislation enjoys strong bipartisan support, and this rule makes in order all amendments that were submitted to the Committee on Rules. However, Madam Speaker, I question the need once again for a structured rule when an open rule could have been granted for consideration of this bill. 
   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate his acknowledgment that this is a structured rule and, therefore, Members cannot come down to the floor and ask for amendments to be made in order. 
   But I just want to make this point, and we talk about it a lot in the Rules Committee. A lot of these bills have strong bipartisan support, and, yes, there may or may not be Members that are clamoring for amendments. But it would just seem to me to keep the process in a way where all Members, if they desire, should have an opportunity to come down because maybe something was said in debate, maybe a point that was made that was overlooked, to at least have the opportunity to change. When bills have strong bipartisan support, that is probably the best time to have an open rule. 
   I respectfully tell my friend that there has been a change in definition of what open rules are. We could probably discuss that further because you have not had the open rules that we have had based on everybody having an opportunity. 
   I would just simply say that bills like this, if you are going to have them on the floor under the regular order of a rule, then it should be an open rule. Otherwise, it seems to me that it should be on a Suspension Calendar, like we pass so many pieces of our legislation.     
   That is just simply the point I am making. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and granted a structured rule for consideration of the bill 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. Only two amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee and both were offered by the underlying bill's lead sponsor and the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon. 
   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed the Democrat majority rejected, on a party-line vote, an open rule for consideration of this measure, thus denying Members of the House of Representatives the opportunity to come to the floor and offer his or her amendments to this bill. And I frankly view this as another opportunity of the promises made by the new majority that were wasted with this bill. 
   However, the underlying bill mirrors the Science and Mathematics Education for Competitiveness Act, which was approved by the House Science Committee unanimously in the last Congress. The underlying legislation aims to increase K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics or ``STEM'' teachers annually by 10,000. Specifically, the bill authorizes competitive awards through the National Science Foundation to institutions of higher education to improve the training of STEM teachers and provide scholarships to students in STEM fields who commit to teaching after graduation. 
   I applaud the Science and Technology Committee for working in a bipartisan manner to help address the need for America to be more globally competitive in math, science, technology and engineering fields by focusing on increasing the number of quality math and science teachers in our Nation's classrooms. Our students and educators certainly stand to benefit from this bipartisan bill which I support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. The gentleman stated that in his mind this is an open rule. An open rule historically in this body has been where the committee of jurisdiction marks up the bill, takes it to the committee, and then the Rules Committee, with no restrictions, allows Members that are not on that committee to come down if they wish and submit their thoughts or improvements to the bill. 
   The bill we are about to vote on is a structured rule. Only two amendments were offered. Actually three, and one was withdrawn. Two amendments were made in order. Those amendments were sponsored by the chairman of the committee that has primary jurisdiction on this and the sponsor of the bill, to which it has strong bipartisan support because, as I mentioned in my remarks, this mirrors a bill passed out of the Science Committee last year. 
   This bill very easily could have been amended in the committee by the chairman, because he is the one who wanted to have the amendments, and it could have been on the Suspension Calendar. It would have passed with strong bipartisan support. 
   So with due respect to my friend from Vermont, this is not an open rule. This is a structured rule where Members are denied the opportunity if they wish to come to the floor of the House and offer amendments or improvements to this bill.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I will simply say that a requirement of an open rule is not necessarily to have amendments submitted to the Rules Committee. The committee of jurisdiction is the one that marks it up and they take a lot of give-and-take within the committee. That is how we break this down, we break this whole cumbersome process down so committees can work in specific ways. 
   It is after that process, when it goes to the floor, that Members should have an opportunity to submit whatever they wish. And there is no requirement, never has there been a requirement on something like that where they have to go to the Rules Committee and essentially ask permission to offer an amendment on the floor. 
   So with this rule, contrary to the promises your party made going into the election, this is a closed process. Only two amendments are made in order. So Members are denied an opportunity to offer their thoughts on the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, authorizing the necessary resources for our Nation's intelligence community is one of the most important responsibilities of Congress. The attacks of September 11, 2001, showed us that we must be vigilant against the threat of terrorism, and our intelligence community is a critical part of protecting America from its enemies abroad. 
   I have strong concerns about what appears to be an unfortunate and utter lack of bipartisan work on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   In addition to failing to incorporate Intelligence Committee Republicans in the development of this bill, the bill also fails to consider the input of Armed Services Committee Republicans. 
   Serious concerns exist about the bill's mandate that all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies be governed by the U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogation designed to cover combatants picked up in the battlefield. The Army manual was never designed to cover America's most dangerous enemies, such as Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. At a minimum, we deserve to know, Madam Speaker, how these new standards would impact intelligence operations and, ultimately, U.S. national security before rushing to attach them to this legislation. 
   Proponents of this new requirement view this as a simple application of one organization's set of rules onto every other entity engaged in the activity. Madam Speaker, this isn't simple; I believe it's simplistic. And it could have dire consequences on our national security. 
   To illustrate the logic at work here, why not require the NBA and Major League Baseball to play by the NFL rule book and use a football in their games? They all use a ball, after all, and if a football is good enough for the NFL, it should work for the NBA and for Major League Baseball. We all know that that would be a disaster, Madam Speaker, and before we require all Federal agencies to adhere to the Army manual, we should be certain it won't create a disaster for protecting our country in the war on terror. 
   This bill also includes provisions that are questionable as to whether or not they will help improve America's security. Specifically, the House Democrats included language to fund and pursue research into an intelligence assessment of global warming. At a time when our Nation is engaged in a global war on terrorism, our intelligence community should not be required to focus on reports about climate change. 
   I am also concerned that, despite bipartisan passage of a motion to instruct conferees that earmarks should not be included, this conference report contains more than $75 million worth of intelligence earmarks. Intelligence funding should be based on national security, not potential special interests. 
   Instead of funding global warming studies, earmarks, and mandating Army Field Manual provisions, House Democrats should be taking steps needed to ensure that our intelligence officials are able to monitor foreign terrorists overseas. 
   House Democrats have stalled the passage of a permanent update on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The bipartisan Protect America Act expires in less than 2 months, and the American people deserve a permanent bill as soon as possible. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, on December 4, Mr. Hoekstra offered a motion to instruct conferees that earmarks should be eliminated from a final conference report. This motion passed by a bipartisan vote of 249-160. However, despite bipartisan agreement that earmarks should not be included, this conference report contains more than $75 million worth of intelligence earmarks. Intelligence funding should be based on national security, not on special interests. 
   I am concerned with the level of earmark funding in this authorization conference report, and I am concerned that the House rules are flawed when it comes to the enforceability of earmarks. House Republicans believe every earmark should be debatable on the House floor, and for the last several months we have made repeated attempts to close loopholes in the House rules as they relate to earmarks. 
   So, Madam Speaker, today I will again be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately consider House Resolution 479 introduced by Republican Leader BOEHNER that would improve the House rules and allow the House to debate openly and honestly the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills. 
   We must defeat the previous question so that American taxpayers are no longer left wondering what hidden earmarks are contained in bills before the House and this Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I want to thank you and I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, both, for your work on this not only in this Congress, but your yeomen's work at the end of the last Congress to try to get this problem resolved. And I apologize for coming down late. I wanted to participate more fully, but the Rules Committee is meeting, as we are speaking, on the Iraq issue. So I was up there and didn't have a chance to come down. 
   But let me make a couple of points here. This really is about keeping a commitment that was made by the Federal Government to the counties. And you just made the point there that States with counties in the western part of the United States have a lot of Federal ownership. I have two counties that I just want to talk about in my district where over 80 percent of their land is owned by the Federal Government. Now, by definition that means that 80 percent of the taxable land that the county commission would have is not subject to taxation. 
   The decision was made over 100 years ago for these national forestlands, which is principally in my area. I know you have some development lands in yours. But since they don't have taxation, they said okay. Deals were worked out many years ago that you can have the revenue from harvesting the timber, which worked out very, very well. So that is the Federal policy that was made. The Federal Government owns the land in these counties; so, therefore, they can't tax it. It is Federal policy. In the early 1990s, another Federal policy or interpretation, I should probably say, of a Federal policy has led to a decline in timber receipts, as you can see here by the chart.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. When President Clinton, to his credit, tried to come up with a forest plan, the current level at that time of timber harvest was 4 1/2 billion board-feet, and the promise was that you could at least harvest 1.1 billion, 25 percent of it. We are not even close to that. We are not even close to that because the interpretation of that law and the ensuing lawsuits have kept any activity in these multipurpose areas. And I should make this point: This is national forestland. National forests were created to be multipurpose, including commercial activity. If you want to lock it up and not have any activity at all, the way to do that is put it in a wilderness area. This is not wilderness. Some de facto policies, unfortunately, in the past have led to sometimes this being treated as wilderness areas but it is not. So as a result of this, as a result of the timber receipts going down, these counties who relied on the Federal receipts from timber because they couldn't tax land now are facing huge, huge cuts. 
   Chelan County in my district, one of the counties that has 80 percent ownership by the Federal Government, will have severe cuts in education, road maintenance, search and rescue, and this is a big tourist area up there, and the forestry education programs. Skamania County, a small county in the southern part of my district, loses 40 percent of its school budget. Forty percent of its school budget. And here we are and that 40 percent starts at the end of last year and they have to get through the end of the year. 
   So this is something that needs to be resolved, and I really appreciate your allowing me to come down to participate in this. Both of you have been really champions on getting this through. And, hopefully, we will be successful sooner rather than later, because these counties and these communities in our States simply can't wait.  
   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues here this evening to urge this Congress to take action now and extend the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, commonly referred to as the county payments bill. This bill is an essential lifeline of support for rural communities throughout the country that are impacted by federal forest land ownership. 
   I thank my colleagues, Greg Walden and Peter DeFazio, for their steadfast efforts to address this problem. 
   What we are talking about here tonight is keeping a promise--a promise made to county governments a century ago in what was then still the early years of the National Forest system. County governments, of course, cannot tax the Federal Government. However, they still must provide for schools, roads, and emergency services. The Congress recognized this reality when it promised these communities that they would get a fair share of revenue produced from federal forest lands as compensation for the tax exempt status of federal forest lands. This revenue sharing, which Congress made permanent in 1908, served all parties well and was for many years an equitable solution to the problem. 
   Unfortunately, since the early 90s, special interest groups that oppose federal timber sales have used the Endangered Species Act to bring harvest activities in the Pacific Northwest to a standstill. The Clinton administration attempted to resolve the crisis by brokering the Northwest Forest Plan in 1994, which called for setting aside 80 percent of the federal forests in the Northwest and allowing for a modest level of continued harvest on some of what remained. This was supposed to produce a steady and reliable level of timber to help meet the growing U.S. demand for building materials and wood products. 
   However, even this compromise was not good enough for the radical environmentalists that have continuously used litigation to sharply limit federal harvest levels. What resulted is the closure of hundreds of mills throughout the Northwest--leaving thousands of people without family wage jobs and many counties with little or no compensation for the impact of federal land ownership. Today, we import more wood products than we ever did before, and the spotted owl--which was supposedly what all the litigation was about--isn't any closer to recovery as a result of our de facto zero harvest policy. 
   Fortunately, the Congress at least recognized the dramatic impact to local governments caused by the sharply declining Forest Service timber receipts. This is why we passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in 2000. This law, which expired at the end of Fiscal Year 2006, enabled local governments to either remain with the traditional receipt sharing system or take a payment based on historical harvest levels. In addition, it authorized funding for local governments to work 
   in cooperation with interested stakeholders to carry out special forest restoration projects. These payments made the difference for many county governments that would otherwise not be able to provide essential services. 
   Today, however, the future of these payments is in doubt. Despite the many efforts on both sides of the aisle, we were unable to secure an extension of this bill before the 109th Congress adjourned. I am proud of the fact that the House did at least identify and act upon a couple of legislative items last year that would have helped offset the cost of the reauthorization. However, the situation remains that we need to find a way to get the county payments extension through the Congress and on to the President. Time is quickly running out for these rural communities. 
   Let me give you examples of what will happen to two of my counties if we fail to act now. 
   Chelan County, which is almost 80 percent federally-owned land, will face severe cuts in education, road maintenance, search and rescue operations and many other county services. In addition, they would be forced to eliminate the Forestry Education Program, which takes ``at risk kids'' from several local rural school districts and involves them in hands on habitat restoration projects during the summer. This program is administered with the help of Washington State University and local employees of state and federal agencies and has been recognized by the National Association of County Officials. 
   In Skamania County, which is more than 80 percent tax exempt federal land, the local school districts will lose 40 percent of their current budget. That means the loss of dozens of teachers and support positions, the shuttering of school buildings, and dramatic cutbacks in classes and extracurricular offerings. The county government would be forced to cut more than half of their law enforcement personnel, road workers, and court employees. These people will likely have to leave the county to find alternate employment, taking their families with them and further eroding the county's economy.  
   Mr. Speaker, these are just a couple of examples of the kinds of the consequences to real communities if we fail to act. I again urge the leadership of the Congress to move the extension of the county payments bill on the next available legislative vehicle. Let's keep our promise to these local governments and reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act before it's too late.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 386 is a pretty straightforward bill. This legislation would authorize the transfer of about 9 acres of Federal property along with a few associated structures from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District in central Washington. 
   The irrigation district has fully repaid its obligations to the Federal Government related to these properties and now simply pays the bureau for their operation and maintenance. This conveyance would enable the irrigation district to make needed improvements, while allowing the bureau to focus its limited resources where they are more urgently needed. 
   This legislation is based on a formula agreement negotiated between the bureau and the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District in 2004. I commend the irrigation district and the staff of the bureau for working together at the local level to resolve the concerns of the parties involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, this same legislation passed unanimously during the previous Congress, but didn't get through during the final parts of the session. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill again today so that we may move it on to the other body. 
   I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young of the Natural Resources Committee and their staff for their assistance in expediting this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule allows for the consideration of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, aimed at reforming mortgage lending practices in order to prevent subprime mortgage problems in the future. 
   I support efforts to better protect homeowners through simplified borrower disclosure, greater focus on deceptive practices, and enhanced education, training and oversight of lenders. 
   While I recognize that several significant changes were made to address some of the most concerning parts of this legislation during the committee markup, additional improvements and clarification are still needed. Consumers must have protections without unduly restricting credit opportunities or creating enormous liability for the mortgage lending industry. 
   We must improve the mortgage process to empower consumers to make good choices among competitors, not limit options for them. Also, we must ensure that this bill does not hurt the consumers that it is intended to help, especially those consumers with less than perfect credit histories that hope to achieve the American Dream of homeownership. 
   The current climate of rising defaults and foreclosures, especially in the subprime market, has shown us that poor lending decisions and abusive lending practices must be addressed.  And while we must deal with the bad actors in the lending industry, let's not forget about the good lenders and investors that have helped thousands of families successfully purchase their homes. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction, but improvements should be made as this legislation moves forward. I was hoping that the Democratic-controlled Rules Committee would see fit to provide an open rule for consideration of this bill. Under an open rule, Members could come to the floor and offer amendments in their effort to perfect this bill. While this rule allows several amendments to be offered, it is unfortunate that this restrictive rule also prevents Members of Congress from offering amendments on the floor during debate of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I yield myself 2 minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to my friend from Massachusetts when he outlined the amendments that were made in order and the substance of some of those amendments to be debated and also suggesting that he would oppose some and accept others. I have always admired that in him when he comes up to the Rules Committee and feels that that's part of the legislative process. 
   The point that the gentleman from Texas was making, apparently he had two amendments, and one of them the gentleman from Massachusetts is going to work with him on; so that one will be resolved. But the gentleman from Texas felt very strongly that the amendment that was not made in order, really the only amendment that had any substance was not made in order, was his amendment, and we don't get a chance to debate it. I think that's a valid argument from his perspective. And I know the gentleman from Massachusetts had nothing to say obviously about that. 
   So I just wanted to make that point, that, yes, there are a lot of amendments that were made in order. Some of the amendments that were made in order will be addressed later on. But I wanted to make the point of what the gentleman from Texas had made that his amendment was not made in order.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it really is time for Congress to act and pass a stand-alone veterans funding bill.

   We have heard comments from Democrats that when Republicans were in charge that we did not get our work on the veterans funding bill completed on time. So I would ask my Democrat colleagues, if you don't like the way things were run then, then why are you exactly on the same path? Mr. Speaker, a final veterans funding bill is sitting waiting to be acted on. The Democrat leaders have bent over backwards to prevent Congress from passing the final bill. The stalling is costing our American veterans $18.5 million a day. Since the fiscal year began 46 days ago, our Nations's veterans are out $851 million. The veterans funding bill passed the House this summer with over 400 votes and passed the Senate with over 90 votes, and the President will sign the bill. So let's stop delaying, and let's defeat the previous question so that we cannot just say that we are committed to providing for veterans the funding increase that they need, but we actually get this increase to them.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee held a second hearing to consider a second rule to provide for consideration of H.R. 3773, the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective, or the RESTORE Act. As you may recall, a month ago the House considered and approved a closed rule for the RESTORE Act. Not only was it a closed rule, prohibiting any debate on amendments, but it also denied Members the opportunity to cast a separate vote on a manager's amendment and changes to the amendment which became part of the base bill once the rule was adopted. 
   Mr. Speaker, here we go again. The result a month ago was that the Democrat majority recognized the RESTORE Act was insufficient and decided to pull the bill from the House floor without a vote. Rather than spending a month working in a bipartisan manner to strengthen the bill, yesterday the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee was at it again, rewriting and denying Republican Members the chance to even offer input or suggestions and prohibiting every single Member of the House from offering amendments and alternatives. The Democrat majority's take-it-or-leave-it strategy on this bill is dangerous and is destined to fail, Mr. Speaker. It will not close our Nation's intelligence gap. In fact, it could widen it. 
   In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to establish a procedure for electronic surveillance of international communications. As enacted into law, FISA had two principles: first, to protect the civil liberties of Americans by requiring the government to first obtain a court order before collecting electronic intelligence on U.S. citizens in our country; second, the law specified how intelligence officials working to perfect our national security could collect information on foreign persons in foreign places without having to get a warrant. 
   The intent of the original FISA law was to enhance American security, while at the same time protecting American privacy. Recognizing that no responsibility of the Federal Government is more important than providing for the defense and security of the American people, Congress should be doing all it can to ensure that FISA continues to reflect the intent of the original law. 
   In August, Congress, in a bipartisan manner, took an important step forward to close our Nation's intelligence gap. The Protect America Act passed only after repeated attempts by Republicans to give our Nation's intelligence professionals the tools and the authority they needed to protect our homeland. This action was long overdue, and this law marked a significant step forward in improving our national security. The Democrats forced the security tools that we passed in August to expire after 6 months. 
   Now Congress must act again to renew this law by early next year before the Democrat expiration date arrives and our national security once again will be at serious risk. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today does not provide the security we need to protect our Nation from a potential future terrorist attack. It is a retreat, Mr. Speaker, from a law enacted in August, and jeopardizes the safety and security of Americans from foreign terrorist threats. 
   I am concerned that not only were final changes to the bill given to the minority just yesterday afternoon, but it was stated in our hearing that the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee got the revised text just moments before we did. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mr. Conyers' willingness expressed in his testimony before the Rules Committee to work with Republicans and perhaps even postpone consideration of a rule until the bill could be properly reviewed and Republicans had a chance to offer a substitute or changes to the bill. Sadly, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee overruled Mr. Conyers and expressed her intention to move this bill without any alternatives, amendments, or possible improvements being considered. 
   The action of the Rules Committee in October and again yesterday to completely shut down the legislative process shatters the promises made by Democrat leaders a year ago. The distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee on December 27, 2006, was quoted in the New York Times, Mr. Speaker: ``We are going to give people an honest and contemplative body they can be proud of once more. We are going to have a much more open process.'' 
   House Majority Leader Hoyer, on December 5, 2006, was quoted in Congress Daily PM as saying, Mr. Speaker: ``We intend to have a Rules Committee that gives opposition voices and alternative proposals an ability to be heard and considered on the floor of the House.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, actions obviously speak louder than words. The modernization of foreign intelligence surveillance into the 21st century is a critical national security priority. It is alarming that the Democrat majority wants to move full speed ahead on a bill that weakens Americans' privacy protections, while at the same time strengthening protections for our enemies in the war on terror. I must therefore urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule so that we can make absolutely certain that we are making our laws more, not less, effective in our constant battle to prevent a future terrorist attack against our Nation. 
   If this rule is adopted, Members will only have the choice to vote for or against a seriously flawed bill that threatens, not strengthens, our national security. The Democrat take-it-or-leave-it strategy shuts down all voices from being heard, and ultimately every American can suffer the consequences if this bill and the rule are adopted. 
   Enacting the Protect Act last August, which was a major accomplishment of this Congress, which has chosen to spend, frankly, more time debating and enacting legislation naming post offices and Federal buildings than real policy, it is ironic that the Democrat majority now wants to pull the rug out from under this successful accomplishment. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot about  process here on this very, very important issue. Everybody on both sides of the aisle has talked about the need to make sure that we have the right intelligence, and yet through this process there are a number of questions, I think very legitimate questions, that were raised; because if this rule is adopted, then we will have no opportunity to even vote on the manager's amendment. It will be self-executing. 
   It seems to me like it is a process by which, because we all know pretty much that rule votes are party votes. So it is like denying anybody an opportunity. If somebody on the other side has some questions about the questions that were raised here, they will be denied the opportunity because you have got to stay with the party and support the rule. Mr. Speaker, I just simply say that is a very, very bad process. 
   Mr. Speaker, we also need to pass the stand-alone veterans funding bill. It has now been over 150 days since the veterans funding bill was approved by the House. The Senate passed a similar bill and appointed its conferees 2 months ago. Sadly, Democrat leadership in the House has refused to name conferees and instead has chosen to put politics and partisanship ahead of ensuring that our veterans' needs are met. 
   Once the Democrat leaders appoint conferees, the House can move forward and pass the stand-alone veterans bill. Mr. Boehner took a positive historic step in that direction; now Speaker Pelosi must follow. Therefore, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately act to go to conference with the Senate on H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Funding Bill and appoint conferees.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act, which would authorize $1.25 billion to create three new regional commissions and replace two other regional commissions. These five regional commissions would be Federal-State partnerships that would provide grants to State and local governments to promote infrastructure and economic development. 
   While I believe that comprehensive, regional approaches to addressing infrastructure and economic development needs often can be beneficial, I am not convinced that creating five commissions and the layers of bureaucracy associated with them is necessary to provide grants to communities most in need. 
   The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act was originally considered by the House on September 17 under suspension of the rules, which limits debate, bars amendments and requires a two-thirds vote for passage. Bills typically considered under suspension of the rules are bills and resolutions to name post offices and Federal buildings, congratulate sports teams and to raise general awareness of other issues. 
   Generally, bills authorizing $1 billion in government expansion are not considered under a process with limited time for debate and no opportunity for amendment, but that is what the Democrat majority chose to do with the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act last month. 
   Because of concerns either with the underlying bill or with the way in which this bill was originally considered, it failed to garner a two-thirds vote and did not pass under suspension of the rules. This closed rule does provide for more time to debate the merits of the underlying bill, but, unfortunately, it also shuts Members out from offering amendments to make this perhaps a better bill.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from California for yielding me the time. 
   I have to say that I stand here in opposition to this bill, and I am one that generally supports fair trade liberalization efforts. I believe that when properly structured, trade agreements can benefit all parties involved. But, Mr. Speaker, the Andean Trade Preference Act is not a trade agreement. This is an agreement to give access to the U.S. market in return for reduced drug production by certain Andean countries. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. This is an agreement to give access to the U.S. market in return for reduced drug production by certain Andean countries. 
   The original idea may have been a noble one, and it probably still is, but the Act has proven to be a failure, and as a result, American asparagus growers have paid the price. In practice, the Andean Trade Preference Act has resulted in higher South American drug production and a steep loss of acreage and processing of asparagus in the United States, as reflected by this chart where in the last 16 years the amount of acreage has been reduced by 50 percent. 
   A recent International Trade Commission report found that asparagus was the domestic commodity most negatively affected by the Act. Unlike other sectors, American asparagus growers were not provided a transition period before tariffs on Peruvian imports were unilaterally eliminated. Since implementation of the Andean Trade Preference Act of 1991, imports of Peruvian asparagus have increased by more than 20 times. These duty-free imports have decimated U.S. asparagus growers and closed domestic asparagus processing plants in my district. 
   Now, perhaps, Mr. Speaker, if you are not from an asparagus production area in this country, you may be thinking this trade-off is worth it because it results in less drug production. The unfortunate reality is that this Act is a failure in that regard too. The latest studies confirm that cocaine production in the Andean countries is actually higher today than when the Andean Trade Preference Act was adopted in 1991. 
   In other words, we have exported jobs from rural America to these Andean countries and we are still seeing narcotics production going up. Nevertheless, we are here asking American farmers to sacrifice their livelihoods to perpetuate a wholly unrelated and unsuccessful anti-narcotics strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also regret that we are considering an extension of this flawed policy under a process that denies Members the opportunity to amend the bill, the text of which was not even available until a couple of hours ago. This is being rushed to the floor with no time to debate or offer amendments. The markup of this bill in Ways and Means was cancelled. The bill has not gone through the Rules Committee. The House should have an opportunity to have a full and fair debate on this Act, which has a profound negative effect on my constituents. 
   So I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill. 
   I will insert into the Record an article from the Seattle Times that more fully points out the dilemma that asparagus growers have suffered, and,  also, I will insert into the Record an article from the New York Times regarding the plight of asparagus growers as a result of this Act.  
   New Hope for Asparagus Growers 
   Washington asparagus growers might get a break in the new Democrat-controlled Congress. 
   They sure need it. 
   The industry has been decimated by a U.S. drug policy designed to encourage Peruvian coca-leaf growers to switch to asparagus. Passed in 1990 and since renewed, the Andean Trade Preferences and Drugs Eradication Act permits certain products from Peru and Colombia, including asparagus, to be imported to the United States tariff-free. 
   The act was set to expire Dec. 31, but Congress approved a six-month extension to make time to negotiate a proposed free-trade agreement. 
   We believe world markets should be more open and barriers to trade should be lowered. But this trade preferences act, when it comes to asparagus, is a one-sided deal that does only harm to the U.S. industry while failing miserably at its stated intent of reducing drug production. 
   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Web site currently notes that the Peruvian coca acreage, mostly in the highlands, is the highest it has been in eight years. 
   Meanwhile, the small country has become a powerhouse in asparagus production along its Pacific Coast lowlands. Peruvian asparagus production has multiplied 18-fold. The industry has developed a vigorous market and attracted sizable capital investment. 
   Meanwhile, the Washington industry is a shadow of its former self. Acreage has been cut by 71 percent to just 9,000 acres. In 2005, Seneca closed the world's largest cannery in Dayton, Columbia County, and shipped its state-of-the-art equipment to--no surprise--Peru. So did Del Monte, when it closed its Toppenish plant. 
   Is it any wonder the U.S. asparagus industry hopes the preferences act will be allowed to lapse in June? 
   That's not to say the Washington Asparagus Commission has its head in the sand over the global economy. In particular, the commission is willing to support a proposed free-trade agreement with provisions common to other free-trade agreements. 
   The industry wants the tariff re-imposed on Peruvian asparagus but only during the U.S. growing season--roughly April through June in Washington--and then phased out over a period of years. The tariff on U.S. production would diminish also. 
   That would be a long, overdue solution for an industry decimated by a drug-reduction policy that failed miserably.   
   War on Peruvian Drugs Takes a Victim: U.S. Asparagus  
   After 55 years of packing Eastern Washington asparagus, the Del Monte Foods factory here moved operations to Peru last year, eliminating 365 jobs. The company said it could get asparagus cheaper and year-round there. 
   As the global economy churns, nearly every sector has a story about American jobs landing on cheaper shores. But what happened to the American asparagus industry is rare, the farmers here say, because it became a casualty of the government's war on drugs. 
   To reduce the flow of cocaine into this country by encouraging farmers in Peru to grow food instead of coca, the United States in the early 1990's started to subsidize a year-round Peruvian asparagus industry, and since then American processing plants have closed and hundreds of farmers have gone out of business. 
   One result is that Americans are eating more asparagus, because it is available fresh at all times. But the growth has been in Peruvian asparagus supported by American taxpayers. 
   ``We've created this booming asparagus industry in Peru, resulting in the demise of a century-old industry in America,'' said Alan Schreiber, director of the Washington Asparagus Commission. ``And I've yet to hear anyone from the government tell me with a straight face that it has reduced the amount of cocaine coming into this country.'' 
   Government officials respond that it was never their intent to hobble an American industry. But they say a thriving asparagus industry in Peru stabilizes the country and provides an incentive to grow something other than coca leaves, the raw material of a drug used regularly by about 2.8 million Americans. 
   ``Apologies to the people affected,'' said David Murray, special assistant for the White House's drug policy office, ``but the idea of creating alternative development, countrywide, does serve our purposes.'' Mr. Murray said that net cultivation of coca leaf in Peru had fallen considerably, but that it was unclear how much of a role the alternative crop incentives had played. 
   Here in Washington, the nation's second-leading asparagus producer, after California, about 17,000 acres have been plowed under since a 1991 trade act prompted a flood of less-expensive Peruvian asparagus, a 55 percent decline in acreage. 
   During the same period, Peruvian asparagus exports to the United States have grown to 110 million pounds from 4 million pounds. 
   Two of the biggest asparagus processing factories in the United States have closed. The Del Monte plant in Toppenish is still packing other vegetables, but it buys and packs its asparagus in Peru. The other factory was in Walla Walla. 
   Peruvian asparagus is sold without tariffs under terms of the Andean Trade Preference Act, signed in 1991 and renewed in 2002. The United States also spends about $60 million a year in Peru to help farmers grow and develop their industry for asparagus and other crops seen as alternatives to coca. 
   Many American farmers still compete, saying they offer a better-tasting and fresher product. But others have abandoned the crop. 
   When the American factories closed, Washington farmers were left without a buyer for millions of pounds of asparagus. Among them was Ed McKay, who has given up on asparagus, a crop that takes three to five years to mature, and then grows perennially. After growing it for 50 years and employing more than 100 people at the height of the season, he turned over his 225 acres in central Washington near Othello last year, and now plants some in corn and wheat, and lets other land go fallow. 
   ``We're a victim of the drug war,'' said Mr. McKay, 73. ``It seems like we still got plenty of cocaine coming into this country, but now we got cheap asparagus as well.'' 
   Acreage devoted to asparagus has dropped by a third in California, and the crop has nearly disappeared from the Imperial Valley, once a huge source of asparagus. Growers blame imports from Peru, but also cheaper asparagus from Mexico, which benefits from the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   In Michigan, the value of the industry has fallen by 35 percent since the Andean trade agreement. Michigan and Washington have been hit the hardest because they lead the nation in production of canned or frozen asparagus, a segment that has been in particular decline with the year-round Peruvian crop. 
   ``The irony is that they didn't plow under the coke to plant asparagus in Peru,'' said John Bakker, executive director of the Michigan Asparagus Advisory Board. ``If you look at that industry in Peru and where it's growing, it has nothing to do with coca leaf growers becoming normal farmers. Coca leaf is grown in the highlands. The asparagus is near sea level.'' 
   In a letter to the State Department in March, Peru's government said the asparagus industry employed 50,000 people and 40 percent came from coca-producing regions. 
   ``It is important to understand that the war against drugs is another face of the battle against terrorism, and will be successful only if new legal jobs are created as an alternative to illegal activities,'' the Peruvian Asparagus and Other Vegetables Institute said in the letter. 
   Yet United States auditors, in a 2001 report to Congress, said the Foreign Agricultural Service ``does not believe that Peruvian asparagus production provides an alternative economic opportunity for coca producers and workers--the stated purpose of the act.'' 
   Mr. Schreiber, of the Washington asparagus board, said he had made two trips to Peru and doubted many coca growers had turned to asparagus. 
   ``I don't fault the Peruvians,'' Mr. Schreiber said. ``We're in this situation because of what our government has done to us. They say it's a national security issue. Well, the cost of it has been borne on the back of the American asparagus grower.'' 
   The 2001 report by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, found that the value of the asparagus processing industry in the United States had fallen by nearly 30 percent, which it attributed to Peruvian imports. The industry was valued at $217 million in 2000. 
   Asparagus is labor intensive, and some industry experts have said Washington's high minimum wage of $7.16 an hour has contributed to the industry's decline. But Mr. McKay, the farmer, said he was able to pay high wages and even give workers housing, and still make a profit before Peruvian asparagus was given trade preference. 
   Mr. Bakker of the Michigan asparagus board said about 300 farmers in his state had lost a total of about $25 million because of the cheaper Peruvian imports. The government has bought some Michigan asparagus, but farmers there and in Washington say money that is supposed to be available to industries hurt by free trade pacts is difficult to get, because of a formula that takes prices rather than job losses into account. 
   ``Our industry will disappear before we qualify for any trade assistance money,'' Mr. Bakker said. ``And it's not like Michigan farmers are against the war on drugs. There are certainly social benefits from trying to curb cocaine production, but why should one industry take it on the chin for it?''

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR ADOPTION OF S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule is redundant and totally unnecessary. The House doesn't need to pass this rule to go to conference with the Senate. Democrats already have all the power they need to go to conference on the budget. The Budget Committee chairman already has the ability to make a motion to go to conference, and a rule that this House passed 2 months ago also provides that authority. We have already done this with the rule, H. Res. 1036, which my very, very, very good friend, Mr. McGovern, managed only a couple of months ago. There is no reason for the House to be considering this rule, except perhaps one, Mr. Speaker, and that's so that the Democrat majority can deny Republicans their rights as the minority party. 
   Democrats are going to get their way at the end of the day; majorities always do that. But in putting this rule on the floor, Democrats are saying that they needn't even bother with respecting minority rights. This rule exists solely as an abuse of power. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Democrats won control of the Congress in 2006, they promised the American people that they would run the most open and honest House in history. They would seek to work in a bipartisan manner. Instead of keeping that promise, the Democrat majority has stooped to depths and gone to extremes that no previous majority in the House has ever dared. When it comes time to shutting down debate, silencing ideas, restricting minority rights, ignoring rules they themselves wrote, and running the House in a top-down, shut-up, sit-down manner, this Democrat majority has no peer. 
   The Democrat promise to run the most open, honest House in history has been revealed as a hollow charade. They have passed more closed rules that block all amendments and debate than any House in history. They wrote new rules to prohibit votes from being held open to change the vote's outcome, and then violated that rule time after time. They passed new rules to ensure House and Senate conference committees are more open and public, but instead they turn around and retreat even further behind closed doors. They almost totally abandon even holding conference committees. 
   Mr. Speaker, why is this rule suddenly on the House floor today? Why the sudden interest of Democrats in the House to go to conference with the Senate on a budget? The House passed their version of the budget on March 13. The Senate passed their version on March 14. Today is May 14. Why didn't we go to conference 2 months ago? Never mind, of course, that the law sets April 15 as the deadline for Congress to pass a final budget resolution. The facts are that this House could and should have gone to conference 2 months ago. But Democrats have instead hid behind closed doors to negotiate, bargain and cut deals to write a final budget. 
   By reading media reports, Mr. Speaker, it appears the Democrat majority in the House and Senate have reached a final agreement on the final budget for fiscal year 2009. That agreement will apparently increase spending by billions of dollars and include the largest tax increase in history. So now they apparently are going to go to a phony conference after all the true tax and spend work has been done in secret. Mr. Speaker, they aren't doing this to be more open and honest. They are doing this to force through their plan to massively increase taxes and increase government spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, the news media also reports that the Democrat majority has abandoned another of their promises it made to the American people when they wrote the new law for the House that is known as PAYGO. This is a rule that was sought by the Blue Dog Democrats. This rule places a blanket requirement that any bill that lowers taxes or increases spending must be correspondingly offset. Under the secret budget agreement, it appears that the Democrat PAYGO rule was jettisoned. 
   Blue Dog Democrats have given up on their rule and their PAYGO principle. They traded an enforceable House rule for a meaningless promise from a Senator. It's meaningless because everyone knows that this one Senator will in all likelihood be overridden by his Senate colleagues. Mr. Speaker, one can respect my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle for standing on principle, but this is a principle that's being abandoned. 
   This rule isn't necessary. The Democrats already have all the power they need to go to conference. So the only reason we are here is because the majority is trying to restrict the rights of the minority to be heard and for the Republicans to have a fair opportunity to offer alternative proposals to legislation Americans care about most, taxing and spending. 
   We are being blocked, shut down, and unfairly restricted in our rights. And as a result, our constituents will potentially be subjected to higher taxes and more government spending. I really don't think Americans want that. 
   When it comes to Democrat plans for billions of dollars in new government spending, Republicans have the right to protest, to demand votes in the House, to have the voices of Members representing almost half of this country to be heard.     
   We especially have the right to protest the Democrat majority's writing of a $200 billion appropriations bill that just completely skips over any hearing or markup in the Appropriations Committee. Instead of passing a bill to fund our troops who are fighting to protect America, Democrats are short-circuiting the legislative process, shutting out Republicans and larding the bill up with billions and billions of dollars of unrelated spending. 
   Right now, Mr. Speaker, upstairs in the Capitol on the third floor, the House Rules Committee is meeting to consider this massive $200 billion supplemental spending bill. The text of this bill was just released an hour before the committee met. It never went before the Appropriations Committee. Republicans have obviously just had minutes to read the bill. This is wrong and is abuse of power by the Democrat majority. The American people deserve to have a more open process on how their tax dollars are spent. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I repeat again that this rule is totally unnecessary. Democrats already have the power to go to conference. They're just 2 months late in doing so. The Democrats have broken their promise to the American people to operate the House in an open and honest manner. They are conspiring in secret to write a budget that increases taxes by the largest amount in history and use a vital troop funding bill to try to pass billions and billions of new dollars in unrelated government spending. 
   So for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR ADOPTION OF S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, of course, which we already did on H. Res. 1036, which my good friend managed on the floor here just a couple of months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me talk about an issue that's been talked a great deal about here on the House floor by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I certainly hear about it when I go home. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the Democrats took control of Congress in January of 2007, the cost of gasoline has risen to record-setting prices. In fact, the cost of gasoline has gone up more in 16 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years. According to a report from just 2 days ago by AAA in my State of Washington, the price for a gallon of gasoline is at a record $3.80. That's 26 cents higher than it was just last month. The average price of a gallon of diesel is $4.53, which is $1.46 higher than a year ago. 
   Speaker Pelosi made a promise that the Democrats had a ``commonsense plan'' to ``lower the price at the pump.'' But this Congress has done nothing and has only seen fuel prices rise. 
   Mr. Speaker, I really believe it's time for the House to act. It's time for the House to debate ideas for lowering prices, and it's time for the Democrats to reveal their promised plan. 
   So by defeating the previous question, this House can finally consider solutions to rising energy costs. When the previous question is defeated, I will move to add a section to the rule, not rewrite the entire rule, just to add a section to the rule, that would allow the House to consider H.R. 5984, the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008, introduced by Representative Bartlett of Maryland, as well as ``any amendment which the proponent asserts, if enacted, would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel by increasing the domestic supply of oil by permitting the extraction of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States is the only developed nation in the world that  forbids safe energy production on its Outer Continental Shelf. This puts our country and economy at a disadvantage to other countries. According to the U.S. Minerals Management Service, America's deep seas on the Outer Continental Shelf contain 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 86 billion barrels of oil. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. The Outer Continental Shelf contains 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 86 billion barrels of oil. That's 86 billion barrels of American oil that sits waiting while we import a little over 4 1/2 billion barrels from foreign countries each year. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about addressing gas prices and energy costs in America, we need to get serious about accessing our country's energy resources. 
   Some will declare that it's unsafe to produce energy from reserves beneath the ocean in the Outer Continental Shelf. But other countries do it safely all around the world. As a matter of fact, our country utilizes deep sea production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Mr. Speaker, this technology was severely tested, severely tested, and proven safe when two back-to-back category five storms hit the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Almost 3,000 offshore platforms were in the direct path of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some experienced 5 to 6 hours of sustained winds at 170 miles per hour and gusts over 200 miles per hour. 
   Now, to be sure, production was halted and platform workers were evacuated during these terrible hurricanes; so there was no loss of life. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, do you know how many of these rigs ruptured? The answer is zero. Zero. Some tops fell off but no platforms ruptured. So I think we must make a distinction between concerns that production can be done safely and scare tactics that oppose efforts to make use of America's resources and reduce imports from foreign nations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a final farm bill, a farm bill that is over 7 months late. It was supposed to be completed last September when the old farm bill law expired. It's long past time for Congress to be voting on a final farm bill, and the one the House will consider today is far from perfect. 
   It spends billions more than it was supposed to. Mr. Speaker, in fact, despite this being called the farm bill, nearly 75 percent of the spending in this bill doesn't even go to agriculture or farming. It goes to pay for government food assistance programs. Mr. Speaker, let me repeat that. In fact, despite this being called a farm bill, nearly 75 percent of the spending in this bill doesn't even go to agriculture or farming. It goes to pay for government food assistance programs. To me, that is very concerning. 
   There's also considerable dissatisfaction with the income limitations being too high for farmers who may receive payments under this bill. 
   There are also concerns that while commodity prices in the marketplace have risen since the last farm bill, the guarantees in this farm bill have also gone up. 
   There are also special interest provisions that are unrelated to farming or food stamps that have been stuck on this bill. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I agree that this farm bill is very far from perfect, but like many of my colleagues in the House, I must measure this bill by the impact on my constituents in my district. 
   And as the representative of one of the most diverse and productive agricultural areas in this country, I will vote for the farm bill because it does more to support the specialty crops that are grown in my district than any other farm bill in history. 
   I must point out that the assistance provided for the specialty crops grown in my district are not direct subsidy payments or handouts. What matters most to farmers and growers in central Washington are research dollars and help in opening up new markets abroad. Specifically, I'm pleased that the farm bill includes a new initiative to fund research projects for these specialty crops. 
   The conference report also expands the successful fresh fruit and vegetable SNACK program to children in all 50 States. This worthwhile program provides fresh fruits and vegetables for schoolchildren. 
   The Market Access Program is also very important in central Washington and something that I've worked very hard on to support for many years. The Market Access Program, or MAP, assists our agriculture community in expanding access to markets overseas. 
   For far too long, American farm products have had difficulty getting into foreign countries, and sometimes are unfairly blocked outright. Fair market access and fair trade agreements help our farmers compete, and the MAP program has proven this to be very successful. 
   While I will vote to pass this farm bill, Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this unfair rule because it shuts down fair opportunities for debate and votes on the House floor and because, Mr. Speaker, it waives new anti-earmark and PAYGO rules written just last January, a year ago last January, by the Democrat majority. 
   And already today, Mr. Speaker, we have had a great deal of discussion on PAYGO and the ramifications. We heard it says it complies with the spirit of PAYGO and so forth. 
   Let me just make a point of what happened last night in the Rules Committee. In the Rules Committee, there is a provision in this rule that waives all points of order. We had discussion up there on PAYGO. So the ranking member of the Rules Committee, Mr. Dreier, offered an amendment to keep all the waivers, all the waivers in the farm bill with the exception of the  PAYGO provision that was adopted just a year ago last January by the new majority. That amendment simply said if there's no problem with PAYGO, then why not keep that provision in there. It was voted down, Mr. Speaker, on a direct party-line vote. 
   So it appears what has happened here in this instance--because I think the rules are very clear. I think Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin pointed out exactly where we are on this and what the procedures are. Apparently what we have done--and this to me I think is probably unprecedented--we have adopted Senate rules in the House for consideration of the farm bill. Maybe that's a pattern that we will see hopefully in other things that we'll debate, like, for example, maybe having more debate on issues because the Senate does have unlimited debate under their house rules. So, if we're going to start adopting Senate rules, maybe we ought to do that on the debate area. 
   Mr. Speaker, a conscious decision has been made to break the PAYGO rules to increase spending by several billions of dollars. 
   The farm bill, Mr. Speaker, is long overdue, and I'm disappointed that a bill that provides new levels of recognition to specialty crops, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, from central Washington is coming before the House with so many other questionable provisions within the bill. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for a farm bill that is 7 months overdue, and I want to again commend Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for their persistence in bringing this product to the floor. 
   But there is another concern for farmers in our country that this Democrat Congress is totally neglecting, and that's addressing skyrocketing gasoline, diesel and energy costs. The cost of running a tractor, trucking products to market, and running a farm has risen dramatically since Democrats took control of Congress, and they have done nothing to help farmers, truckers or millions of Americans hurt by rising fuel costs. 
   One of the principles of the farm bill is ensuring that America does not become dependent on foreign nations for our food supply. We, as a country, have fertile fields that can produce as much food as our country needs to eat and even export billions of dollars of foodstuffs overseas. But we, as a country, are not using our energy sources like farmers use our fields. 
   For decades, our country has been handicapped by not tapping into our existing oil reserves. The effort to develop just a tiny portion of ANWR has been fought and blocked to the detriment of America's energy independence and with high prices that we are now paying at the pump. 
   Today I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider solutions to rising energy costs. By defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule, not rewrite it, just amend it, to allow for consideration of H.R. 5984, the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008, introduced by Mr. Bartlett of Maryland, as well as ``any amendment which the proponent asserts, if enacted, would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel by increasing the domestic supply of oil by permitting the extraction of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.'' 
   With diesel and gasoline prices going up and American farmers having to cope with these skyrocketing costs, it's time for Congress to act. The Democrat majority has refused time and again to act. We can act by defeating the previous question. 
   Defeating the previous question will be simply to allow the House to debate rising energy prices. The farm bill will still be considered and voted upon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (ELWOOD ``BUD'' LINK DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of H.R. 2245, my bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Wenatchee, Washington in honor of Elwood ``Bud'' Link. 
   Bud joined the Navy in 1941 and served on the destroyer USS Tracy that aided U.S. forces at Guadalcanal, Okinawa, and elsewhere in the Pacific. He was one of many residents of north central Washington who were called to serve their country during World War II. However, Bud's support for his Nation didn't stop when his military service ended. 
   As an active member of the local Cashmere Veterans of Foreign Wars post, Bud was a dedicated advocate for increased hometown health care. He experienced firsthand the long distances north central Washington veterans had to travel for even the most basic health care. In 2001, the Cashmere-Leavenworth VFW passed a motion to research the need for a VA clinic, and Bud quickly took the lead. He became a tireless proponent of bringing a veterans outpatient clinic to north central Washington. 
   Bud was instrumental in keeping the local veterans motivated, active and informed about how to successfully make a clinic a reality. He championed the clinic until his death in 2003. 
   For several years I worked with Bud Link and local veterans to make the case for a new clinic in north central Washington and press the VA when the project faced delays. Our hard work paid off in 2006 when the Secretary of Veterans Affairs approved a new clinic. And, in 2007 I was very proud to attend the grand opening of the new VA clinic in Wenatchee. 
   As a tribute to Bud's work to support hometown health care for rural Washington state veterans, Senator PATTY MURRAY and I introduced legislation to name the clinic in Bud's honor. 
   This bill has the endorsement of the local community, the entire Washington state Congressional delegation, the Washington state Chapters of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Vietnam Veterans of America. 
   By officially naming this clinic in Wenatchee after Bud, we are paying respect to a local veteran who fought for the quality care his fellow veterans deserve. 
   I would like to thank Bud's wife, Helen, for her steadfast support of Bud's efforts. I would also like to thank the members of the Cashmere-Leavenworth VFW for their work to organize the local community in support of the clinic. Finally, I would like to thank Chairman FILNER and Ranking Member BUYER for their work to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2245. Through this bill we are recognizing the heroic efforts of Bud Link and his work to improve the health care of his fellow veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the largest overall industry in my State is agriculture and food processing. I represent the central part of Washington State where a wide variety of agriculture products are produced, including apples, cherries, pears, wheat, dairy hops, wine grapes and potatoes, just to name a few. In addition, our farmers and ranchers are stewards of the land, and many of them participate in conservation programs that fall under the farm bill. For these reasons, my constituents have a lot at stake when it comes to farm policy. 
   The Committee on Agriculture has historically worked in a bipartisan manner, especially on such important issues as the farm bill. Just over a year ago, I was pleased that the Agriculture Committee came to my district and held a farm bill hearing in Yakima, in my district. Mr. Cardoza, now Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte were all there. I appreciate their having traveled to my corner of the country to hear directly from the farmers in central Washington. 
   They heard firsthand the importance of specialty crops, fruits and vegetables to the overall ag economy. I'm pleased that the underlying bill, the Farm, Nutrition and Bioenergy Act, as approved by the committee, recognizes the needs of specialty crop producers by increasing investments in the Market Access Program, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, the Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program, and establishes a much needed National Clean Plant Network. These are all important steps in the right direction. 
   Unfortunately, all of the good things in this bill and the spirit of bipartisan cooperation were completely overturned by a last-minute addition of a multi-billion dollar tax increase. This surprise offset is totally unacceptable because it will cost American jobs, and it has completely bypassed the public process of discussions and hearings in the respective committees of jurisdiction, and it has disrupted the tradition of bipartisan cooperation on farm policies. 
   I have many speakers, Mr. Speaker, on my side who will be discussing the impact of these surprise tax increases, again, that were not subject to hearings or markups by the appropriate committees. The full scope of these tax hikes and fees just appeared at the Rules Committee this morning at 8 a.m., with no one willing to testify about them or disclose the full impact of these measures on our economy. And we are talking about multi-billion dollar increases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take this opportunity to express my disappointment that a bipartisan amendment I submitted to the Rules Committee with the support of Mr. McNerney from California, Mr. Hoekstra of Michigan, was not made in order to help American asparagus growers. Under the Andean Trade Preferences Act of 1991, the Congress gave Peru duty-free access to the U.S. market on a unilateral basis. This was done in the hope that it would encourage the Peruvians to develop alternatives to growing narcotic-producing crops. 
   Unfortunately, it led to a flood of Peruvian asparagus imports, which has devastated the asparagus growers and processors in my home State of Washington, Michigan and in California. The U.S. International Trade Commission has repeatedly cited U.S. asparagus as the one farm commodity substantially harmed by the Andean Trade Preferences Act. 
   My amendment would have simply given the Secretary of Agriculture the option of providing transition payments to these growers. After all, American asparagus growers were not harmed by their own actions, but rather by government's antidrug policies. They should not have to pay the full brunt of the price. 
   Unfortunately, the leadership of this House has decided that these growers don't deserve a place at the table. We are poised to give billions away under this bill, but the House leadership can't find time to help these small farmers who were harmed by their own government. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rule denies Members the opportunity to represent their constituents by coming to the floor and offering amendments to this bill. It prohibits a separate vote on whether or not to include billions of dollars in tax increases, and it denies open debate on those issues. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this restrictive rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee held a hearing to consider a rule for H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act. At the outset of the hearing, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee did something that Republicans would not have even contemplated when we were in the majority. 
   Before Members of Congress even had an opportunity to testify before the Rules Committee, the chairwoman announced that the rule would be closed. She further went on to say no notice was sent out seeking amendments from Members, yet at least 27 amendments on a bipartisan basis were submitted to the committee. I guess, Mr. Speaker, we know now that no amendment announcement is code for no opportunity for meaningful, open debate. While surprising, this action is, unfortunately, not unprecedented for this Democrat-controlled Rules Committee. 
   I would like to thank all Members for submitting their thoughtful amendments on behalf of those they represent. And I especially would like to thank the Members who chose to stay and testify despite learning from the very start that their amendments would not be made in order. 
   It is sad that yesterday the minds and ears of the Democrat members of the Rules Committee were closed to even allowing for the consideration of amendments and alternatives to legislation, important legislation aimed at closing loopholes and strengthening our national intelligence capabilities. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1978 Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to establish a procedure for electronic surveillance of international communications. As enacted into law, FISA had two principle purposes: First, to protect the civil liberties of Americans by requiring the government to first obtain a court order before collecting electronic intelligence on U.S. citizens in our country. Second, the law specified how intelligence officials, working to protect our national security, could collect information on foreign persons in foreign places without having to get a warrant. 
   The intent of the original FISA law was to enhance American security while at the same time protecting American privacy. Recognizing that no  responsibility of the Federal Government is more important than providing for the defense and security of the American people, Congress should be doing all it can to ensure that FISA continues to reflect the intent of the original law. 
   In the nearly 30 years since FISA became law, we have seen tremendous advances in communication technology such as the Internet, cell phones and e-mail. However, under the original FISA law, our intelligence officials are not free to monitor foreign terrorists in foreign countries without a court order because of advances in communication technology. It is clear that our FISA laws are outdated and must be modernized to reflect changes in communication technology over the past three decades. 
   In August, Congress in a bipartisan manner took an important first step forward to close our Nation's intelligence gap; but, unfortunately, only for a 6-month period. The Protect America Act passed only after repeated attempts by Republicans to give our Nation's intelligence professionals the tools and the authority they need to protect our homeland. This action was long overdue and this law marked a significant step towards improving our security. 
   Now Congress must act again to renew this law by early next year before it expires or our national security will once again be at risk. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today, the RESTORE Act, does not provide the security we need to protect our troops and our Nation from a potential future terrorist attack. The bill also weakens Americans' privacy protections and fails to permanently close our Nation's intelligence gap. 
   Specifically, Mr. Speaker, the RESTORE Act does not go far enough to reform outdated FISA regulations that burden our troops in the battlefield. It contains no provision for third parties to challenge FISA court orders. The bill also creates a centralized database that could actually increase the risk of privacy violations. Another major concern is that the RESTORE Act contains yet another sunset provision that forces the bill to expire on December 31, 2009, unnecessarily leaving our intelligence officials without the tools they need to protect Americans. 
   It is alarming to me that this rule brings a bill to the House floor that goes so far as to weaken American privacy provisions while at the same time strengthening protections of our enemies in times of war. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, nearly 30 amendments were submitted by Members on both sides of the aisle to address these and other concerns with the Democrat majority's failed attempt to update our current FISA laws. However, none of these amendments, which ranged from permanently strengthening our FISA laws to acquiring communications of foreign terrorists in foreign countries without a FISA court order, were allowed to be considered on the House floor today under this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is truly disappointing to me that every Member of this House is prohibited from offering changes to this bill that could make it more effective in our constant battle to prevent a future terrorist attack against our Nation. After all, if we cannot come together and work in a bipartisan manner on issues as important as improving our national security, then what can we work together on. 
   Sadly, because the Democrat majority has chosen to consider the RESTORE Act under this closed process, working together in a bipartisan manner will not be possible. Instead, if this rule is adopted, Members will only have a choice to vote for or against a seriously flawed bill that threatens, not improves, our national security. Sadly, this closed process shuts out all American voices from being heard and, ultimately, every American could suffer consequences if this rule and bill are adopted. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow for a substitute amendment to be offered by Mr. Hoekstra of Michigan or Mr. Smith of Texas. This will give the House an opportunity to consider additional views that were denied with this closed rule in the Rules Committee last night. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, September 28, 2006, we had a debate on this issue last year, and I'd like to quote a Member and what he said on the House floor. And I quote: ``You beat with rulemaking that which you know you cannot beat with reason.'' 
   And he goes on to say, ``I know what you say: Do as you say, not as we do. For today, in the people's House democracy has been eviscerated by those who recommend it to others. I have said it before. The way the majority runs the House is shameful. It is undemocratic. It happens every single day that we have a closed rule.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5959, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the underlying intelligence authorization bill that this rule makes in order generally has bipartisan support in this House. This support comes in part from a number of Republican amendments that were adopted during the Intelligence Committee markup. 
   Among the adopted amendments was one offered by Ranking Member Hoekstra to eliminate all earmarks from the bill and to strike the provision transferring $39 billion to the Department of Justice for an entity known as the National Drug Intelligence Center. 
   This appropriateness of earmarking intelligence funds, and controversy surrounding this earmark in particular, was a serious issue during last year's consideration of this bill. 
   By adopting the Republican ban on earmarks in committee, such controversies are diminished, but Mr. Speaker, the larger need for earmark reform across Congress still remains. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support a 1-year earmark moratorium for all Members to allow for reforms to take place. Key among these reforms should be a definition of what is an appropriate allocation of Federal funds and what is an abuse of taxpayer dollars that assumes no essential or relevant Federal Government need.     
   Republican efforts to institute a 1-year ban on earmarks and to allow for a reform have been stymied by opposition from Speaker Pelosi and the other liberal leaders of the House. 
   While it is a small sign of success that earmarks have been stricken from this bill, a great deal more needs to be done to restore the American people's faith on how Congress spends taxpayers' money. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, on the rule itself, I would like to make two points. First, the rule is unnecessarily restrictive and only makes in order half of the 20 amendments filed with the Rules Committee; just 10 amendments will be debated on this bill. There were other relevant amendments that were offered by Representatives on both sides of the aisle that were blocked by the Democrat Rules Committee. 
   In this instance, Mr. Speaker, the best that can be said about this unfair rule is that it at least treats both Republicans and Democrats unfairly by  blocking an almost equal number of amendments from Representatives of each party. However, Mr. Speaker, restricting debate on both sides of the aisle is not what the American people were promised by those who now control this House. They promised an historic level of bipartisan openness, not the record-setting shutdown of debate on the House floor that they've been practicing for the past year and a half. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this rule waives the PAYGO rule written and passed by the liberal Democrat majority in January of 2007. Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may rush to say that they had to waive PAYGO rules because this is an intelligence bill and there is a classified section that isn't public, so it can't be read to make a parliamentary ruling on whether PAYGO has been violated. That's what the argument will probably be. Yet, Mr. Speaker, this is a false excuse. 
   The fault here rests not with the need to keep secret the classified information in the bill, it's that the Democrat majority chose to write the new House rules--initially--behind closed doors without consulting with the whole House or with Republicans. In doing so, they have made error after embarrassing error. On multiple occasions, this House has had to go back and fix mistakes in the rules that Democrat leaders made by refusing to work or even consult with Republicans. They had to do it on charitable fund raising, plane travel, and banning Members from flying their own airplanes. 
   And when it comes to PAYGO, not only was the rule written poorly to apply to classified parts of the bill, but it's a rule that Democrat leaders have decided to ignore for politically expedient reasons. 
   There is a great deal of talk from the liberal majority on their allegiance to PAYGO, yet they've just ignored it time after time when it suits their purposes; for example, on the farm bill, on unemployment insurance extensions, and on fixing the alternative minimum tax. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's inconsistent to use PAYGO as an excuse to block proposals and amendments you oppose and then ignore PAYGO on a bill that you really want to pass. PAYGO is simply a smokescreen, Mr. Speaker, that this Democrat Congress is trying to use to cover for the largest proposed tax increase in American history and tens of billions of dollars in higher government spending. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. With that then, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   This rule provides for the consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Bill for the next fiscal year. This legislation is important to our national security, and it deserves the attention of this House. However, this Congress also needs to address the issue of skyrocketing gas prices that affect both our economic and our national security. 
   For months now, Democratic leaders have blocked debate and votes on legislation that would produce more American-made energy, which would open parts of Alaska, Federal lands and offshore to oil and gas drilling. As a result, in the long run, it would lower the price of gasoline. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans are hurting and Congress needs to act. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow for much needed energy legislation to be considered on this House floor. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House can finally vote on this vital economic and national security issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this unfair rule and the underlying bill that makes a mockery of our Nation's Wild and Scenic River law. 
   First, this rule unfairly restricts Members from being able to offer amendments on the House floor. It's not the first time. It's a continuing pattern that we have seen over and over and over again. While every Democrat amendment filed with the Rules Committee was made in order, this rule allows only two out of 15 Republican amendments to be offered on the floor. 
   Seven attempts were made in the Rules Committee meeting on Monday to allow more amendments to be offered and to allow the House to consider the bill under an open rule allowing every Member of this body an opportunity to offer amendments on the House floor. Yet Democrats on the Rules Committee voted to block each and every attempt to allow a more open consideration of this bill. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may attempt to argue that some of the amendments weren't allowed for technical reasons, but those excuses ring hollow, Mr. Speaker, when they block every single attempt to allow for a more open debate. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, to the underlying bill to designate the Taunton River in Massachusetts as a wild and scenic river. Mr. Speaker, I openly admit that I have never visited this river myself. But as they say, ``a picture is worth a thousand words.'' Mr. Speaker, I could say nothing at all, but a picture does say a thousand words. Here I have a photograph with me of a portion of this river that is anything but wild and scenic. 
   Now, a simple glance at this photo would be enough for the House to just halt consideration of this legislation. Such a heavily developed and industrialized riverfront, with its multilane roadways, massive bridges and fuel storage tanks should disqualify, should disqualify this section of the river from being labeled wild and scenic. 
   Now it's argued that the reason this portion is included is because it's ``recreational.'' Mr. Speaker, honestly, it's hard to imagine that one would choose to go swimming or enjoy a peaceful canoe trip through this portion of the river. Quite simply, this portion of the river simply should not be afforded among the highest environmental protections possible under Federal law by designating it as a wild and scenic river. Mr. Speaker, quite bluntly, if this qualifies, if this qualifies as a wild and scenic river under the intent of that statute, then downtown Manhattan can be a national forest and Six Flags can be a national park. 
   This bill was scheduled to be considered by the House last week, yet it was postponed and rescheduled again for this week. This delay was caused when questions were raised that the true purpose of the bill, to name this river as wild and scenic, was to block a liquefied natural gas, or LNG, plant that has been proposed to be sited there. With record gas prices and high energy costs, Mr. Speaker, this is a serious question, because passage of this bill would block the proposed LNG plant from ever being built. 
   Now my colleagues will argue, as they have already argued, that it already won't be built because the Coast Guard and others have raised objections and there are difficult hurdles under current law to overcome. However, the fundamental point is that today the law allows, the law allows today, for an LNG plant to be built if it can meet the necessary requirements. If it can't meet them right at this minute, then over time they may meet them. Or as the need for this energy becomes more apparent, then maybe the groundswell of support could allow this project to go forward. But if this law passes, Mr. Speaker, it will be impossible to build an LNG plant if this bill becomes law. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, at a time when the liberal leaders of this House block any effort to increase energy production right here in America, when gas prices are skyrocketing and Americans are hurting, now is not the time, is not the time, to make energy more difficult to get or more expensive. 
   Now the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Frank, testified before the Rules Committee on Monday. And Mr. McGovern in his remarks elaborated on this facility. He asked that the wishes of the  Massachusetts delegation be respected in naming this a wild and scenic river because it only applies to them in Massachusetts. Well, Mr. Speaker, I must note with irony, with irony, that a request coming from the Massachusetts delegation to respect their wishes on this river, this bill, in opposition to this LNG plant. The argument is that this is in their backyard. And yet, Mr. Speaker, members of the Massachusetts delegation have repeatedly, repeatedly, voted to oppose the wishes of the Alaska delegation. On what you might ask? Well specifically on Alaska's wishes to develop the oil reserves in ANWR. Mr. Speaker, the folks of Massachusetts may have big backyards. But they don't stretch thousands of miles away to Alaska. 
   We must recognize that if this industrial riverfront is permitted to be added to our Nation's wild and scenic rivers list, then truly all qualified rivers are diminished. This doesn't just affect Massachusetts. It affects every State in which there is a wild and scenic river. And in my home State of Washington, there are several. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and oppose this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Reclaiming my time, when I asked the gentleman if this in fact was a picture of the Taunton River, the gentleman responded in the affirmative. Now there may be some changes, but he did say this is the Taunton River. 
   Now in my remarks I said that this diminishes the wild and scenic rivers that are in every place in this country. I said that there are several of them in my State. So I would just ask my colleagues this one simple question: Are we going to change the wild and scenic designation in this country to look like this? Or like this? This is a picture of the Klickitat River which is a wild and scenic designation in my State. 
   So if we are going to argue on the merits of wild and scenic, and making something that is urban like this as wild and scenic, we need to take into consideration what it historically has been, like the Klickitat River in my State. 
   That is a fundamental argument that is going on here today. There are others things that enter into it, and I would be more than happy to engage in that later in my remarks. But this is a fundamental difference, and what they are trying to do with this wild and scenic designation in an urban area compared to what has been done all across the country, including my home State of Washington.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   A lot has been said here just recently in the last exchange about plans. I have here a Boston Herald editorial called ``Cold Water on River Plan'' dated the 10th of July. I will read parts of it here: 
   ``Bay State pols have a long tradition of using the law rather creatively to further their own political aims. But the effort by U.S. Representative Barney Frank to transform a stretch of industrial riverfront in Fall River into a 'wild and scenic' resource is as shameless as it gets.'' 
   They go on to say, ``It is the latest attempt to kill a controversial plan for the Weaver's Cove liquefied natural gas terminal.'' 
   I repeat once again, it's not people from other parts of the country talking about this. This is the Boston Globe. Or the Boston Herald.  
   Cold Water on River Plan 
   Bay State pols have a long tradition of using the law rather creatively to further their own political aims. But the effort by U.S. Rep. Barney Frank to transform a stretch of industrial riverfront in Fall River into a ``wild and scenic'' resource is as shameless as it gets. 
   Think ``A River Runs Through It'' and you can picture the waterways that typically win ``wild and scenic'' designation. But until Republicans intervened Frank was close to securing that protected status for the Taunton River, limiting development along the river and its ``immediate environment.'' 
   It is the latest attempt to kill a controversial plan for the Weaver's Cove liquefied natural gas terminal. A vote was canceled yesterday, with Frank's office suggesting Republicans wanted to make it a ``national issue.'' 
   Well, they HAVE pointed out the irony of top Democratic leaders (Sens. Kennedy and Kerry sponsored the bill in the Senate) going all out to kill a plan that would ease the delivery of natural gas to New England customers. ..... 
   Yes, environmentalists have been seeking a special designation of the river for years. But if anyone believes it would have gained this kind of momentum without Weaver's Cove, well, we have some rusty container ships, fuel storage tanks and warehouses along the Taunton River you might be interested in. 
   The amusing thing is none of this seems necessary, given that the Coast Guard has already rejected Weaver's Cove based on quite ligitimate concerns about navigation and safety. Guess you never can have enough insurance.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 415, TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We have had a discussion in several areas on this project. Let me start with the most fundamental area, and that's the designation of wild and scenic. I pointed out, by making this river, which is industrial--and I might add, by the way, that the initial study called for studying the wild and scenic designation only on the upper stretches, as I understand, of the Taunton River, not the lower. But the final report came back, because, as the report said, if the river could talk, this would be what they wanted. 
   My goodness, we are listening to rivers. I would like to see that testimony to see what the river exactly said. 
   But at any rate, the bottom half was put into this wild and scenic designation. 
   As I pointed out, this is dramatically different, dramatically different from other wild and scenic designations across the country like the Klickitat River in my district. We talked about the issue of power and siting energy plants. 
   The gentleman from Louisiana, where there are a lot of natural gas areas, among other energy producers in that State, is certainly knowledgeable when it comes to that. There is a lively exchange on this. 
   Also, the Boston Herald, as I pointed out said, editorially, a week ago, less than a week ago, that this is a shameless way in order to take this issue off the table. 
   But here is the final component, and we really haven't talked about that yet, but I do want to talk about that. 
   I have an article here from The Herald News, which is the Fall River Herald News, and it's an article, the byline is by Mr. Will Richmond, it was written on the 15th of July, which was yesterday. 
   The headline that I see here is ``Scenic Designation Could Sink Riverfront Businesses.'' I bring that up in this context because my friend on the other side of the aisle was making the argument that this designation would be  good for the economy and so forth, presumably from the standpoint of tourism and so forth, but there are some businesses that are located right in this area, and they have some real doubts. 
   Let me read a couple of excerpts, if I may, out of this article: 
   ``With the U.S. House of Representatives scheduled today to vote on the designation of the lower Taunton River as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, shipbuilders and other businesses located on the banks of the waterway are anxiously watching. 
   ``The designation would hamper businesses, they say, possibly even leading to closures.''     
   Now before I go on, I would just say, how does that help the people that live in this area by this designation? 
   And I go on to quote, and I'm quoting a Mr. Donald Church, who is with Seaboats, Inc. He is the owner of Seaboats, Inc. And he says, ``It's all great to be touchy and feely, and it's great to protect the environment. But people in this city have got to have jobs.'' 
   He goes on to say that because of this, there is some question, and it ``could easily lead to him selling his business,'' which, I might add, has a $5 million annual payroll. 
   On the other side of the river, there is another shipbuilder, Gladding-Hearn, and their president, Peter Duclos, and I hope I say that correctly, said, and I quote, ``Our feeling is that it's a stretch to be applying a noble environmental act on this part of the river,'' Duclos said. ``This area is industrial historically. Fall River wouldn't be here without a deep water part. I'm not sure this legislation is in the best interest of the businesses along the river.'' And he's talking about potentially adding 50 new jobs, but they have some real concerns about this designation. 
   Now, I might say, Mr. Speaker, from my experience in the western part of the United States, where we have these ``nice'' environmental designations, wild and scenic being among them, you have, our experience in the West has been, a restriction of use on these rivers, rather than an expansion. And this is precisely what these shipbuilder owners are saying with this potential designation on the industrial area of this river. 
   So we have three aspects to this, as I mentioned. We have the aspects of undermining what the intent was of wild and scenic designation as it was put in law to really protect wild and scenic. We have the issue of energy. That has been well discussed, especially when we have energy prices going up, and we have a potential here to locate an LNG plant. And then we have the issue of jobs in this area where there is concern in this area. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would say that, if for no other reason, it is a reason to defeat the rule, it is a reason, actually, to defeat the previous question so we can talk about energy; and I will be offering an amendment to that effect. But it is about defeating the rule so maybe the Rules Committee can go back, make an open rule and perfect this legislation to make it more palatable, not only to the Members of this House, but also to people that live in that area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, with that then I will yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of considering a bill to designate industrialized riverfronts as wild and scenic to block an LNG energy plant from ever being built, this Congress should be debating bills that result in more energy and more energy production within the United States. Instead of bills that could result in higher energy costs, like this one, Congress should be working to lower gas prices and decrease the cost of energy. America needs to produce more oil and gas and energy using our own abundant reserves. 
   It is time for the House to debate and vote on bills to open ANWR, our oceans and Federal lands to drilling. If we were to increase the supply of oil, then the price of oil will decrease. Instead of allowing these proposals to be given a fair vote, the liberal leaders of this House are bending over backwards to block ideas to produce more American-made energy. Today, every Representative will have a chance to break Speaker Pelosi's blockage against bills aimed at lowering gas prices, and they can do that, Mr. Speaker, by voting no on the previous question. By voting no, we can end this obstruction and we can get to work. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will simply amend the rule to allow the House to consider H.R. 2493, the Fuel Mandate Reduction Act, which will reduce the price of gasoline by removing fuel blend requirements and onerous government mandates if they contributed to unaffordable gas prices. This is a commonsense bill that will help lower gas prices by ending government mandates and manipulation that increase the cost to everybody's pain at the pump. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this restrictive rule. 
   The Intelligence Authorization Act generally receives strong bipartisan support. But let me be clear that the underlying bill does contain bipartisan provisions that are important to protecting our national security, make no bones about that. 
   However, the bill also contains a number of provisions that are of concern and could weaken our national security and intelligence capabilities by providing less than adequate resources and placing restrictions on our intelligence operations. 
   I am concerned that the Democratic leadership chose to include section 407 in the underlying bill. My friend from Florida talked at length about that provision, which would require our Nation's intelligence community to direct  its limited resources to a National Intelligence Estimate on global climate change. 
   I have to ask, what message are we sending to our allies and our enemies when Congress instructs our intelligence experts to stop what they are doing on issues that threaten American lives and, instead, focus on theoretical risks from global warming. 
   Furthermore, earlier this year, this House created a new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming to focus on the risks of global warming. This is in addition to several Federal agencies that are already analyzing climate change. Congress should let this panel that was created, and existing Federal agencies, focus on climate change so that our intelligence analysts can focus on materials of classified information and work to prevent threats against American lives. 
   But I am pleased, I have to say, with the Rules Committee last night because they made in order an amendment to be offered by the ranking member, Mr. Hoekstra, of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, that will strike section 407 and allow our spies to be spies. I think we can have a very good debate on that. I think we ought to have that debate. I am pleased that the Rules Committee made that amendment in order. 
   However, the Democratic leadership did deny several thoughtful amendments offered by Mr. Castle, Mr. Flake, Mr. Rogers of Michigan and Mrs. Wilson of New Mexico. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule, which only allows 10 out of 433 Members of the House to offer their ideas on how to better strengthen our intelligence community. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a ``no'' vote on the previous question so  that I can amend this rule to allow the House to consider an amendment offered by Representative Heather Wilson of New Mexico and provide the appropriate waivers for that amendment. 
   The Wilson amendment would modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to enhance the ability of our Nation to protect itself in times of war and elevated national security threats. And I think that point was made very, very eloquently by the gentlewoman from New Mexico. 
   Yesterday, the Rules Committee met and rejected on a party-line vote the Wilson amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to advise my friend from Florida that I just got a request for time here, and that is being discussed right now, that I was not aware of.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in the 107th, 108th, and the 109th Congresses, the House considered and passed legislation to provide for conservation and development of water and related resources, and to authorize the construction of various projects in order to improve rivers and harbors in the United States. 
   Unfortunately, differences could not be resolved with the other body, and these bipartisan bills, therefore, did not become law. The legislation before us today mirrors legislation that was approved by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House in the last Congress, and I am confident it will enjoy large bipartisan support today. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's water resource infrastructure is critical to our economy, transportation system, power generation, flood control and environmental protection and restoration. This is especially true in my area in the Pacific Northwest. Our region's major river, the Columbia River and its tributaries, is a great resource, one that must be well managed and protected. 
   Hydroelectric dams provide clean, low-cost, renewable power. These facilities also provide a system of locks that allow for the efficient transportation of tons of agricultural products to coastal ports, which reduces congestion on our highways and our rail systems. 
   The coastal ports that receive the river-barged goods and products are the gateways to overseas markets and also need careful attention. The success of farmers and manufacturers throughout the Pacific Northwest depend on these ports being navigable and appropriately maintained. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions in the Water Resources Development Act that are important to individuals and communities that I represent in central Washington, and I would like to highlight those provisions. 
   Like the WRDA bill passed by the House in the last Congress, I am particularly pleased that the committee has included language in the manager's amendment to permit Corps of Engineer employees working at dams in the Pacific Northwest to participate in wage surveys that are conducted to determine their rate of pay. This important provision would allow these employees the same participation allowed to similar employees at dams in the region operated by the Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation. This is a matter of fair and equal treatment, and I appreciate the committee agreeing with my request on this matter. 
   This bill also includes language that would allow the Corps to officially give credit to the Port of Sunnyside for funding it has invested to maintain progress on its wetland restoration and wastewater treatment project. This project is a creative initiative by the Port of Sunnyside to improve river habitat in the Yakima River, and provide for greater economic growth in the local community. This provision ensures that the Port of Sunnyside gets proper credit for funds it invested as it works with the Corps to make this project a reality. 
   Finally, this legislation lifts Corps restrictions on the development of several Port of Pasco properties. I am very hopeful that elimination of these flowage easements will allow beneficial uses of this prime riverfront property to move forward for the betterment of Pasco and the Tri-Cities. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must keep our commitment to sustain and enhance our Nation's water resource infrastructure, and that requires a regular review and updating of congressional direction to the Corps of Engineers to ensure that existing projects are maintained and that new needs are met. 
   I am hopeful that this necessary legislation will soon become law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking and time is running out. At the end of the year, many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow will expire. Unless Congress acts and gets a bill to the President that he will sign into law, workers, families and small businesses will face a tax increase this year. 
   Congress can either accomplish this the easy way, by working together in a bipartisan manner, or it can be done the hard way, by dragging out the process, passing a bill in the House that the Senate won't even consider and the President has threatened to veto, only for the Democrats then to rush a bill to the floor at the last minute that no one has had time to read and that should have been considered in the first place. 
   I'm disappointed that the Democrat majority has chosen the hard way on this and so many other pieces of legislation this year. 
   The parts of this bill that prevent tax increases are good, and I support most of them, Mr. Speaker. I support ensuring over 20 million Americans are not caught up in paying the AMT. Over the years, this tax burdens more and more middle-income Americans, clearly an unintended consequence of the original bill. 
   I support extending the State and local sales tax deduction so that taxpayers in my State of Washington and other States without a State income tax will continue to be able to deduct State sales tax from their Federal tax bill. 
   I support extending tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education, which will help more middle-income students access post-secondary education. 
   I support extending an important above-the-line deduction to help teachers contain the costs of out-of-pocket classroom expenses like books, supplies and computer equipment. 
   I support, Mr. Speaker, extending the research and experimentation tax credit in order to allow the United States to remain a global competitor. 
   And I support keeping taxes low for small businesses. 
   These are reasonable parts of the bill, and I have supported them in the past, I support them being extended this year, and I support seeing that they become made into permanent law. 
   However, I cannot support a bill that temporarily stops certain tax increases by permanently raising other taxes. Let me repeat that. I cannot support a bill that temporarily stops certain tax increases by permanently raising other taxes. It's not right and it's not fair. But the Democrat majority is using temporary tax relief as an excuse to permanently raise taxes. 
   Under this bill, you may get to keep one of your hard-earned dollars in your right-hand pocket, but the Federal Government is right there taking a dollar out of your left-hand pocket year after year. This is the wrong approach. 
   Unfortunately, if Democrats have their way, every American will face a tax increase sooner or later. If not this year, then next. If not next year, then certainly in 3 years when tax relief enacted by the Republican Congress will expire, tax relief that lowers rates for every single taxpayer in America. If these tax cuts expire, taxpayers will be forced to pay $3.5 trillion more to the Federal Government over 10 years, and the Democrats plan to spend every dime of it on more government spending. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, don't take just my word for it. Look at the budget the Democrats adopted earlier this year. When Democrats were faced with the choice of how best to balance the Federal budget, they flat out rejected the option of spending less and declared their allegiance to raising taxes. The Democrat budget would impose the largest tax increase in American history.     
   Their budget doesn't extend relief from the marriage tax penalty. It doesn't extend the $1,000 child tax credit, it doesn't end the death tax, it doesn't fix the AMT for middle-class families, it doesn't protect the lowest tax rate, and it will force lower-income Americans who today pay no income tax, thanks to the Republicans' tax relief, to start paying taxes again. 
   The Democrats will call this tax relief bill a tax relief bill. They will deny that they are raising taxes, but the plain hard facts are this bill that this rule would make in order would raise taxes by over $80 billion. 
   Congress doesn't need to be raising Americans' taxes to pay for Democrat plans to pay for more and higher government spending. Don't raise taxes; reduce spending. 
   Several of my Republican colleagues that serve on the Ways and Means Committee submitted amendments to the Rules Committee to make this a better bill, a bill that would pass the House on a strong bipartisan basis, pass the Senate and could be signed into law. Amendments to increase the teacher tax credit from $250 to $400, permanently repeal the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, and strike tax increases from the bill that were denied by the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee. 
   I am especially troubled that an amendment offered by my colleague from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) to strike language in the bill that gives special treatment to State legislatures was not made in order. It is difficult to understand why this Democrat bill would allow State legislators to earn tax-free income. 
   For example, in my State of Washington, the State legislators in Olympia have increased spending by 33 percent since 2005 and raised taxes by $500 million, not exactly behavior that deserves rewarding them with a special Federal tax break.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past several weeks, my colleagues on the Rules Committee and I have highlighted the need to pass a stand-alone veterans funding bill. Today is our last opportunity to pass a veterans funding bill and get it to the President before Veterans Day. 
   The veterans funding bill passed this House this summer with over 400 votes and passed the Senate with over 90 votes. A final veterans funding bill is sitting, waiting to be acted on, but Democrat leaders have bent over backwards to prevent Congress from passing the final bill. They have been stalling since September and have ignored the fact that the new spending year began October 1 this year. 
   Every day the Democrats choose not to act to move this bill forward, our Nations's veterans lose $18.5 billion. Since the fiscal year began 40 days ago, our Nation's veterans are out $740 million. It has now been nearly 150 days since the Veterans funding bill was approved by the House. The Senate passed a similar bill and appointed its conferees 2 months ago. Sadly, the Democratic leadership in the House has refused to name conferees and instead has chosen to put partisanship and politics ahead of ensuring our veterans' needs are met. 
   Once Democrat leaders appoint conferees, the House can move forward and pass the stand-alone Veterans funding bill. Three weeks ago, Republican Leader BOEHNER took a positive step towards naming House Republican conferees. Now, the Speaker must follow suit. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately act to go to conference with the Senate on H.R. 2642, the MilCon and Veterans Affairs funding bill, and appoint conferees. 
   By defeating the previous question, the House will send a strong message to our veterans that they will have our commitment to providing them the funding increase they need, deserve and were promised. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bipartisan bill to update our Nation's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Since the Protect America Act expired in February, our Nation has been relying on an outdated 1970s law to monitor foreign persons in foreign places who seek to do our Nation's citizens harm. At long last, Madam Speaker, the House will be permitted to vote on a bipartisan bill that our Nation's intelligence leaders are confident will allow them to do their jobs without costly delays and mountains of paperwork. 
   This bill is not perfect, but it takes vital steps to modernize FISA to reflect 21st century cell phone and Internet technology, and to protect our Nation from today's determined and sophisticated terrorist threats. 
   In February, 68 Senators voted to pass a bipartisan compromise. Yet, ever since that overwhelming bipartisan Senate vote, the liberal leaders of this House have refused to allow a vote because they knew a majority would pass it. Republicans tried for months to advance the bipartisan Senate compromise to a vote in the House, but we were blocked time after time. Today, this blockade will be broken when Democrats join Republicans in voting to pass the bipartisan FISA modernization bill. 
   So Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, there are two ways to balance a budget, whether it is your family budget or the Federal budget. You can either, one, reduce the amount of money being spent or, two, increase the amount of money coming in. 
   Madam Speaker, the Democrats have flat-out rejected option number one of spending less and declared their allegiance to option number two of raising taxes; and they have done both with a fervor that our country has never seen before. 
   The Democrat 5-year budget plan would spend more money each and every year and at a rate faster than the inflation rate. This means that each year the size of the Federal Government will grow bigger and more rapidly than the American economy. To pay for the record levels of spending in their budget, the Democrats plan to raise taxes on the American people more than at any other time in our country's history. That is right, raising spending to record levels and to pay for it with the largest tax increase in American history.     
   This budget does not extend tax relief from the marriage tax penalty. It doesn't extend the $1,000 child tax credit that many young families use. It doesn't end the death tax. It doesn't fix the alternative minimum tax for middle-class families. It doesn't protect the lowest tax rate, and would again impose taxes on lower income Americans who right now pay no taxes, thanks to the 2001 tax relief law passed by the Republican Congress. 
   This tax relief should not be repealed or allowed to expire to pay for more government spending. This tax relief that was passed in 2001 and 2003 should remain permanent for the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, on important priorities for my State, like the extention of the State and local sales tax deduction from the Federal tax and county payments for rural schools, the Democrat budget falls short. It offers only promises, but no real action. The Republican plan, on the other hand, sets  aside real dollars to extend the State and local sales tax deduction for another year. So I encourage all Members who believe in sales tax fairness to think carefully about this when casting their vote. 
   On the issue of payment to rural schools in counties with Federal forests, this budget allows an extension, but it takes no real steps to make it happen. As I have said before on this issue, I am disappointed that the Democratic leadership denied the opportunity to attach an extension of this legislation to another bill, a bill that has, in fact, been signed into law. 
   Madam Speaker, the Republican plan I will be supporting holds the line on spending, sets priorities and allows taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money and invest it as they see fit, not how the Federal Government sees fit. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the budget resolution offered by the Democrat majority and support the substitute offered by Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform routinely risk their lives to protect ours. Along with their families, they make many sacrifices in service to America. There is no question that they deserve the very best care that our Nation can provide. 
   The situation at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center was unacceptable to all Americans, and I am encouraged that immediate steps have been taken to address the problems there. But it is just as important to take action to prevent similar problems from happening at any of our military health facilities. 
   Under Republican leadership, Mr. Speaker, recent Congresses have increased spending per veteran, expanded the concurrent receipt, written budgets that nearly doubled funding for veterans health care, and enhanced benefits for those returning from the war on terror. 
   Now, Congress is taking another step forward, and a proper step forward, in improving services for both our active military and our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill before us today makes commonsense improvements to ensure that our military men and women have access to the care that they have earned and to help maintain excellence throughout our military health system. 
   For example, this legislation creates a new toll-free hotline for reporting deficiencies at military health care facilities, calls for a study to identify infrastructure needs, and authorizes funding to support wounded warriors and their families. It assigns a medical case manager and a patient advocate to each servicemember receiving outpatient care and makes sure that these professionals are properly trained. 
   The process currently used to determine if a soldier can return to active duty is improved so that wounded servicemembers are afforded an opportunity to have input into the decision on whether they should retire from the service. Provisions are included to provide those separating or retiring from service with a seamless transition into the VA system, and the number of doctors at VA hospital facilities is increased. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is impossible to talk about military and VA health care systems without mentioning the unique challenges faced by veterans in rural areas. My district in central Washington has one of the highest concentrations of rural veterans in the Northwest. Although I am working with the VA to get a new outpatient clinic up and running in the northern part of my district, access to health care remains an issue of concern for me and my constituents who all too often are forced to drive hours and sometimes wait months to even get the most basic care. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I am particularly disappointed that an amendment offered by Mr. Pearce of New Mexico was rejected last night in the Rules Committee and will not be allowed to be considered on the floor today. We are missing an opportunity to make a good bill even better by improving care for our rural veterans. The Pearce amendment is based on a bill that I have cosponsored that would enable the VA to partner with existing hospitals and local communities on a case-by-case basis so that veterans in many rural areas can be cared for closer to home. This to me, Mr. Speaker, is a commonsense approach to get top-notch care to veterans without delay. I am at a loss to understand why anyone would oppose this improvement to caring for our veterans. 
   Similarly, Mr. Moran of Kansas had an amendment that I also support; and,  unfortunately, it, too, was rejected by Democrats on the Rules Committee. 
   Our support for improving veterans health care should not be a partisan issue. I am pleased that both Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services Committee have made the underlying bill, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, a priority and that the committee approved it by unanimous vote. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill that this rule makes in order is a good bill. It passed the Armed Services Committee unanimously. It is something that is needed now that we need are engaged in this war on terror. Bills like this, in my view, deserve an open rule, so that you can give the opportunity for Members on both sides of the aisle to try to improve this good product and make it better. I cited two examples for the Rules Committee to not make in order two bills that dealt specifically with our veterans in rural areas. 
   While I support the underlying bill, I am opposed to the rule, because I think the rule could have allowed more amendments to have been in order or, for that matter, have made this an open rule. I think that ought to be the standard when we have strong bipartisan support for legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I want to thank my friend and colleague on the Rules Committee from Dallas for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the third time the House has considered legislation to renew the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It is the third time that it is being considered under a closed rule that denies each and every Member of this House an opportunity to offer an amendment to improve it. It's the third time that we Republicans first saw the text the night before it comes up for debate. It is the third time that the Rules Committee has met at all hours of the night on these suddenly appearing bills. 
   Last night, it was almost until midnight. The second time we met, it wasn't until almost 10 p.m. And the first time we met on this bill, it was from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. in the morning. It is the third time the Democrat bill allows thousands of adults to sign up for children's health care. It's the third time it moves those with private insurance into a government-run program. And it's the third time it doesn't focus on caring for thousands of the poorest kids in our country who are eligible for coverage today but who haven't been signed up by the individual States. 
   Last night, from 9 p.m. until nearly midnight, the Democrats claimed this bill was really different, that they had changed it to address the problems. But the nonpartisan analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says that they are flat wrong. 
   Under this bill, we would have more adults on children's health insurance than we do today. SCHIP would actually cost more than the previous bills while covering less kids, and that several million enrollees in the program today would leave their private insurance for tax-funded programs. This bill isn't a true effort to reach a new accord to renew SCHIP. It is a political game being played out at its political worst. 
   Speaker Pelosi, who just spoke very eloquently on the floor, her Web site still has a statement on it, and I quote from that statement, ``Under Democratic leadership, this Congress is changing the way we do business in Washington--restoring accountability and working together to get the job done.'' I wish this promise wasn't being broken every time the SCHIP bill is brought to the floor of the House, but it is a promise that is being broken. 
   I want to go on, since the Speaker spoke so eloquently. In her ``New Direction for America,'' she states, ``Regular meetings between Chairs and ranking members of committees and staff should be held.'' That didn't happen on this bill. That's another promise that was broken. 
   Further, in her ``New Direction for America,'' she states, and I quote, ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' That's another promise that was broken. 
   To my Democrat friends, I must say that you can't reach an agreement by only talking to yourselves. You don't work together by ignoring Republicans, hiding the text of the bill from the Republicans until the night before the debate, shutting down any opportunity for amendments to be made in order to improve the legislation on the floor. 
   In 1997, a Republican Congress and a Democrat President actually held discussions on creating SCHIP. They talked together, worked together and reached an agreement to provide health insurance to the poorest kids in  our country. That approach was successful, and it created this program. That is the right approach to reach agreement to renew SCHIP and to keep the focus on caring for kids that are most in need. 
   The tactics last night and today by Democrat leaders aren't about bipartisan talks; they are about partisan posturing. To me, it's terribly disappointing. SCHIP should be renewed, and it will be renewed as soon as an honest effort is made on a bipartisan agreement. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. I thank the majority leader for yielding. 
   Talking about procedure today, I think probably the easiest way to resolve this is we're going to be debating the rule, and of course, if the rule goes down, then that would end the business of the day, and that would be the preferred option from this Member's point of view. 
   In the event that doesn't happen, and we in fact then debate the SCHIP bill that we saw last night in Rules for the first time, I think it was filed at 7:17, but my point is that we could debate that, and we have 50 Members that are missing. There is a potential for you to roll the vote, not have the vote today but, in fact, roll the vote until next week. That way the debate will have been done. As my friend from Texas said, the issue does not expire until November 16. 
   So that is an option, it seems to me, to ensure that everybody would have an option to at least vote on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for yielding me the time. 
   I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, last night the Rules Committee voted along party lines to not allow the U.S. House of Representatives, this body, to even consider two amendments that I offered that would have helped school districts whose tax bases are significantly reduced by the presence of tax-exempt Federal lands. 
   This bill would drastically expand the Federal Government's role in school construction and maintenance, activities historically funded at the State and local level before. But they're doing this before the Federal Government meets its existing responsibilities to schools that are impacted by Federal land ownership. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 33 percent of my district in Central Washington is owned by the Federal Government; making 11 school districts eligible for Impact Aid programs. I know all too well the consequences of Federal land ownership and the impact it has on the ability of schools to make needed improvements. 
   In the Grand Coulee Dam area in my district, students attend classes in buildings that are more than half a century old and that are literally falling apart. While the local residents in those districts have agreed to pay one of the highest school levies to maintain current levels in the State of Washington, the school district remains unable to secure a bond to make improvements on physical facilities because the community is surrounded by Federal lands and, therefore, has a limited tax base. 
   The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that no child's education is shortchanged because of Federal land ownership. And, in my view, it's only fair that the Federal Government take care of federally impacted schools before launching a brand new spending program costing billions of dollars that's aimed at schools that aren't federally impacted. 
   I offered two amendments in the Rules Committee. The first would have required that our commitment to federally impacted schools be met through full funding in the Impact Aid program before funding is spent on new Federal spending in this bill. 
   My second amendment, which I offered along with my colleague, Robin Hayes of North Carolina, would have simply given preference, preference, to federally impacted schools as the new construction and maintenance funds were distributed. 
   Unfortunately, Democrat leadership blocked both of my amendments from being debated or voted on today on the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Federal Government cannot meet its current responsibilities to federally impacted schools, then it certainly has no business creating a brand new $20 billion spending program for other schools. Rather than passing this massive expansion of the Federal Government's role in school construction, we should refocus our efforts on fulfilling existing obligations to schools and children impacted by Federal actions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and against the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, to report on a plan for fulfilling its infrastructure commitments at our national laboratories. 
   I want to thank my two Washington State colleagues, Mr. Norman Dicks and Mr. Dave Reichert, a member of the committee, for their co-sponsorship of this amendment. 
   This amendment ensures that national laboratory infrastructure changes will not interrupt security programs needed by DHS. 
   When DHS was established, it inherited facilities around the Nation and from other agencies, some of which were aging and in need of repair. These capital facilities include critical components involving radiological and nuclear countermeasures, threat vulnerabilities and threat assessments, as well as work on biological and chemical countermeasures. In order for DHS to carry out its mission to protect our Nation, it is critical that the Department have the facilities that it needs. 
   At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, in Washington State, critical DHS research and development will be transferred to new facilities as existing labs are torn down for environmental cleanup activities at the 300 Area of the Hanford Federal nuclear site in my district. 
   In 2006, the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology signed an MOU with the Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration that established funding commitments for the agencies involved in the transition of PNNL's facilities from the 300 Area to new lab space. This MOU underscores DHS's critical role in making sure national security related work at PNNL will not be interrupted by this transition. 
   This amendment I have introduced is not only important to the State of Washington and my constituents but also to our overall national security. I understand that this has been accepted on both sides, and I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for agreeing to agree with that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we must do all that we can to make education more affordable so that more Americans can achieve the dream of graduating from college. This year alone over $90 billion in Federal financial aid is available to students. However, with tuition costs on the rise, students and their families continue to face the inevitable question of how to pay for a college education. I believe a balanced approach is needed, one that increases transparency of higher education costs and targets aid to the neediest students while simplifying the financial aid process and addressing the growing  number of burdensome reporting requirements colleges and universities face. 
   I share the goal of increasing access to higher education, but I have a number of concerns with the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, and I believe improvements to the bill are needed. Mr. Speaker, apparently Members on both sides of the aisle also share this view because over 60 amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee before the deadline. 
   The last time that this House considered a comprehensive higher education reauthorization bill was in 1998. At that time, the Rules Committee reported a modified open rule, and as a result, all Members of the House had an opportunity to preprint their amendments in the Congressional Record and offer them on the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that this time the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee chose a closed process to consider a long overdue reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Unfortunately, by reporting out a closed rule, Democrats on the Rules Committee once again chose to deny over 400 Members of Congress the opportunity to offer amendments to improve the bill. Furthermore, this rule makes in order five times as many Democrat amendments as Republican amendments. 
   Reauthorizing the Higher Education Act is important, but by adopting this closed rule, an opportunity will be missed to make the underlying bill even better. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, much has been talked about about this unfair closed rule dealing with this underlying issue, and that seems to be a recurring pattern, and I wish that it would change, but I don't hold out any hope that that will happen. But, Mr. Speaker, since House earmark rules were changed just last year, loopholes and concerns have been raised. Questions remain such as what is and what is not an earmark; when do earmark rules apply and how are earmark rules enforced? We have seen examples of Members trying to enforce earmark rules only to be told they can't because the rules don't apply, and we have seen earmarks repeatedly air-dropped into bills at the last minute that were not subject to transparency or scrutiny. 
   Time and time again, Republicans have come to the floor advocating for additional earmark reforms, including stronger transparency and enforceability. Taxpayers also recognize the earmark process is broken and are outraged with wasteful spending. This has lead to an erosion of public confidence in Congress and could explain part of the reason why Congress' approval ratings are so low. It is clear Americans want Congress to act now and fix the broken earmark process. An earmark timeout is needed in order to get our fiscal house in order and restore public confidence. 
   In January, House Republicans united together and called on House Democrats to join us in an immediate moratorium on earmarks and the appointment of a bipartisan, bicameral joint committee to reform the earmark process and eliminate wasteful spending. House Democrat leaders were invited to join with Republicans and take the sensible bicameral course of action and reform a broken earmark process, but Democrats have remained silent and chosen to continue the broken status quo. So, today, I am going to give all Members an opportunity to show their support for a bipartisan solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately consider House Concurrent Resolution 263, which would establish a Joint Select Committee on Earmark Reform. The Joint Select Committee on Earmark Reform would hold hearings and make recommendations for the comprehensive reform of the earmark process. The resolution would also prohibit bills, resolutions, and conference reports containing earmarks requested by Members of Congress or the administration to be considered until the joint select committee has filed its report. 
   Considering and adopting House Concurrent Resolution 263 today is a sensible, bipartisan solution that will bring genuine accountability and transparency to the spending process and will restore taxpayer trust and the integrity of Congress. 
   Let me be clear: with my motion, every Member of this House will have a chance to publicly vote and take a stand and end earmark abuse and earmark secrecy. Every Member will vote on whether they believe the earmark process must be reformed. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we will do all that we can on our side to challenge the  leaders to adopt this resolution. Until a moratorium or bipartisan committee is in place, House Republicans have adopted already a series of earmark reforms standards that we will adhere to, including barring Members from using taxpayer money named after themselves and prohibiting earmarks from being air-dropped into bills at the last minute to avoid transparency. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment, the letter sent from the Republican leaders to Speaker Pelosi on January 25, 2008, and extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, last week on July 4, our country celebrated its 232nd birthday, and this week the liberal majority in the House of Representatives marks the worst record in our country's entire history when it comes to allowing open debate, following the rules, treating each Member with respect, and acting in an honest way. 
   When control of the U.S. House changed a year ago last January, Democrat leaders promised, they promised, Madam Speaker, the American people that they would run the most open and honest House in history. They've not  kept that promise. In fact, they've done the exact opposite of what they promised the American people. 
   Democrats have passed, to date, 59 closed rules, rules that prevent every single Representative from even being allowed to offer an amendment on the House floor. There are no amendments, Madam Speaker, allowed under a closed rule, as you know. That means open deliberation is nonexistent, and the bill is just forced through the House. 
   These 59 closed rules are more than any Congress in the history of the United States, and every time we have a closed rule in the future, and we will, this liberal Congress will be setting a new record. 
   The rule that the House is currently debating allows only two amendments to be offered by just two Members of the House. It closes off any opportunity for the other 433 Representatives to come to the floor and offer an amendment to modify or improve this legislation. 
   Even more egregious is the fact that the Rules Committee set a deadline of 10 a.m. last Tuesday for Members to file amendments they may wish to offer on this bill. Yet, it wasn't until 4 hours later, 2 p.m. on Tuesday, that the actual bill and report were filed in the House. 
   But this pales in comparison to the Rules Committee action regarding an amendment that Mr. Bishop of Utah filed actually before the 10 a.m. Tuesday deadline. 
   Mr. Bishop's amendment was aimed at protecting the second amendment rights of Americans along the new 600-mile trail that this bill would create. Instead of allowing Mr. Bishop to offer his amendment on the House floor, the Democrat Rules Committee took Mr. Bishop's amendment, altered it, then automatically added it to the bill without ever, ever consulting Mr. Bishop. This is not only an offense to Mr. Bishop, it is a threat to every Member in the House. 
   Because Democrat leaders refuse to allow open debate under an open rule on the House floor, Members have only one way to get an amendment looked at, and that is for them to offer and submit an amendment to the Rules Committee for advance review. 
   But now, Madam Speaker, it appears that all Members must be aware that the Rules Committee may take, co-opt, edit or otherwise pilfer and steal their amendments and ideas. Sadly, Representatives of this House may need to get a copyright on their amendments before submitting them to the Rules Committee. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, to many across America this may seem like legislative inside baseball or petty parliamentary quarrels. But what this is really about is that the Democrat leaders are breaking their promise to the American people to run the most open and honest House in history. Instead, they are running the most closed and unfair House in our Nation's history. 
   Yet, Madam Speaker, these broken promises should not distract us from the even more pressing matter on which Democrat leaders have also broken their promise. It was on April 24, 2006, that then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a press release claiming that the House Democrats ``have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   Two weeks later, in May 2006, Nancy Pelosi said that the Democrats have ``real solutions'' that would ``lower the price at the pump.'' 
   Nancy Pelosi has now been Speaker of the House for over 18 months, and this plan, this promised plan, is nowhere to be seen. Gas prices continue to set record highs, and this House has been and continues to be blocked from voting on legislation that would lower gas prices by producing more American-made energy. 
   Today, instead of voting on legislation to lower gas prices, the House is debating the bill to create a new 600-mile long scenic trail recognizing the Revolutionary War. 
   Speaker Pelosi and other liberal leaders who control this House may oppose drilling in Alaska or offshore, they may oppose more nuclear power, they may oppose hydropower dams, and they may oppose other ways of making more American-made energy--and holding these positions, of course, is their right as Members of this House--but they should not, Madam Speaker, have the right to block the House from even having a debate and a vote on this important issue. 
   Record gas prices are hurting Americans. It's hurting families. It's hurting seniors on fixed incomes. It's hurting college students. It's hurting small business owners and their enterprises. It's hurting schools who have to figure out how and what services to reduce to afford gasoline for their school buses. Yet these liberal leaders of this House refuse to allow an open debate on ideas to lower gas prices. They continue to block votes on drilling for oil in America that will increase supply and lower prices at the pump. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation needs to invest in more nuclear power. We need to invest in more clean and renewable hydropower, as well as wind and solar energy, and we need to foster development of biofuels, hydrogen fuel cell technology, and the invention of other potential clean energy products. 
   Yet, Madam Speaker, we must recognize the fact that gasoline and diesel cannot be replaced overnight. New technologies and energy sources take time, sometimes years or decades to fully develop. Our economy is dependent on oil for Americans to get to work, for food to go from the farmer's field to the grocery store, to get kids to school safely and back home, to deliver the mail, to fly airplanes, to operate construction equipment, for police to patrol neighborhoods, and ambulances to transport patients. 
   The price of gas has an enormous impact on the lives of Americans and families in every town, in every county, in every State in this country. 
   Madam Speaker, I spent last week visiting school districts and small businesses throughout my central Washington district.     
   I listened to the heavy impacts that gas prices are having on my constituents in Yakima, Wenatchee, Cashmere, Moses Lake, Orondo, Richland, Union Gap and Pasco. Madam Speaker, the message I heard was loud and clear, that Americans are hurting because of high gas prices and this Congress needs to act. Americans can't afford a Congress that does nothing to increase the supply of American-made energy. If there is price gouging, Madam Speaker, it must be fully prosecuted. If speculators are trying to unfairly profit, we must stop them, also. And yet we must also tap into America's enormous oil and gas reserves. 
   We have the resources right here in this country that can increase the supply of oil and reduce the price of gasoline at the pump, but our Nation's deep reserves have been put off-limits. With the national price of gas well over $4 a gallon--and it's over $4.29 a gallon in my district--Americans can't afford this off-limits policy any longer. 
   Madam Speaker, consider this: Alaska's ANWR region contains an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil; that's more than twice the proven reserves in the State of Texas. The oceans off America's coastline contain 240 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 86 billion barrels of oil. Federal lands contain an estimated 31 billion barrels of oil. Simple economics tells us that the way to combat rising prices due to high demand is to increase the supply, and obviously it is to tap into these known resources. Yet proposals to increase American oil and gas production have faced years of opposition. Drilling in a tiny portion of ANWR in Alaska, for example, has been blocked since President Bill Clinton vetoed a like proposal back in 1995, and we are now paying the price. 
   It's time to stop saying no to solutions and start saying yes, not only to drilling for gas and oil, but to all parts of the answer, as I mentioned this previously, so let me repeat what I said earlier. 
   We need to license and build more American refineries. We need to expand wind, solar, hydrogen fuel cells and other new energy sources, reduce fuel blend mandates that increase costs, and invest more in nuclear and hydropower. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, it's interesting, some say we shouldn't bother because all of this will take years to produce results. Yet these same people claim that the answer is new Federal mandates, government control of the kind of car you want to drive and how far you can drive it, and pinning everything on the hope that a new technology breakthrough will eliminate  our dependence on oil. But Madam Speaker, that, too, takes time. But more importantly, such a course of action is not the American way, and it's a dangerous gamble that puts our economy at serious risk. We need to increase the supply of oil to decrease the price of gasoline, it's as simple as that. And we need to do it here in America. The longer we postpone producing more oil here, the longer we will pay higher gas prices. 
   Americans are hurting, and yet there is not a single solitary piece of legislation that this House will consider this entire week that even remotely relates to producing more American-made energy and lowering gas prices. 
   Americans are feeling the pain, and the liberal leaders of the House simply are not listening. They not only do nothing to help, but they block every attempt made to bring legislation to the floor that would help lower gas prices. 
   So, Madam Speaker, once again, I will attempt this morning to bring energy legislation to the House floor for debate and vote. If my colleagues will join me in defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow a debate and vote on legislation that will help produce more American-made energy. The House apparently has time to debate the creation of the 600-mile trail about the Revolutionary War, so let's make time for the House to vote on solutions to lower gas prices. 
   Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, we acknowledge that there is a practice of self-executing rules. That's been done. Principally they are done, however, on technical grounds but admittedly they are done on substantive pieces of legislation. But the fact is already in this Congress there have been more self-executed amendments by this Democrat Rules Committee than there was in the entire last Congress. Already. And we still have 6 months to go before this session is over. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 3 minutes to my friend from California, the gentleman from  the Sacramento area, the former attorney general, Mr. Lungren.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. With that, Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, it's time for the House to debate ideas for lowering gas prices. By defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow the House to consider a bill that will help produce more American-made energy, H.R. 2208, introduced by Mr. Boucher of Virginia and Mr. Shimkus of Illinois, the cosponsors of that bill.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Madam Speaker, this House is on a course to complete its work by early this afternoon. The only legislation the House is even considering is this bill to consider a 600-mile scenic trail about the Revolutionary War. Tomorrow, the House won't even be in session. The House was originally scheduled to be in session, working tomorrow, but that was canceled yesterday. 
   The Democrat leaders of this House are choosing to do nothing for a day and a half, today and tomorrow, that was scheduled, and of course, do nothing about gas prices. They decided to just stop working and go home early rather than vote on legislation to lower gas prices by producing more American-made energy. 
   The House needs to confront the skyrocketing price of gasoline. It shouldn't be clocking out early and calling it a week. It's time right now for Congress to act on gas prices. 
   So, once again, Madam Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can amend the rule to take up serious legislation, bipartisan legislation, to bring down gas prices at the pump. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Wow. I couldn't help but listening to my friend from Massachusetts state at least his interpretation of history, but the fact is, just when the American people think that Congress can't sink any lower, the liberal leaders of the House and Senate prove that they are up to this challenge and they are finding another way to do it. 
   I have only 30 minutes to speak today, and that's simply not enough time to detail each of the many broken promises that the Democrat majority made to the American people in the election of 2006, and they have promptly done exactly the opposite. For brevity's sake, let me just list some of the more egregious: 
   Democrat leaders promised the most open House in history. That means allowing Members the open opportunity to offer amendments on the House floor to change and improve legislation. Instead of a record of openness, the Democrats have delivered the most closed down, sit-down-shut-up record in the history of this country. That's not  an exaggeration, it's a fact. Sixty-three times the Members of this House have been totally blocked from offering even one amendment on the House floor. They have not just set the record for closing down the House, they have shattered it and left it in the dust. They promised one thing to get elected in 2006, and then promptly have done another thing. 
   In addition to shutting down the House and taking away the ability of Members to offer amendments and alternatives on bills, they perfected a procedure that should be known as the Pelosi ping-pong. It's a trick, it's a gimmick, a game that allows the House and Senate to just ping-pong a bill back and forth between the two Chambers while writing in secret the text of the final legislation that will eventually become law. 
   They play the Pelosi ping-pong to bypass and sneak around the normal process of holding conference committees where the House and the Senate work in public to bridge differences and publicly write final texts of new laws. By playing Pelosi ping-pong, Democrats keep Members of the House, Members of the Senate and the American people in the dark while they work in a back-room way cutting deals, stuffing in unvetted earmarks, and hiding the process from public scrutiny. 
   Despite their loud complaints and protests about conference committees not being properly followed when they were in the minority just 2 years ago, Speaker Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid have abandoned them almost completely in this Congress for this far more abusive and secret game they are now playing. 
   Speaker Pelosi promised that if the Rules Committee met in the dead of the night, after 10 p.m., that the House would not act on that bill the following day. Yet here we are, early this afternoon, considering a rule and a bill that the Rules Committee didn't even begin meeting on until after 11 p.m. last night. It's another broken promise to the American people. 
   Speaker Pelosi and the liberal leaders of this House promised that a bill would be available for 24 hours before the House would vote on it. This would allow Members to read it and know what they are voting on. The text of this massive bill was not made available to the Rules Committee until 11 p.m. last night. It's over 1,100 pages long, yet the 24-hour waiting period promised by Speaker Pelosi has been abandoned. This massive bill is being rushed through the House. 
   The rules of the House were also unilaterally rewritten by Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to block a vote on a fair trade agreement with Colombia, which is America's strongest ally in South America. The rules don't say there has to be a yes vote on the agreement, only that it hold a fair yes-or-no vote in a timely manner. 
   Yet instead of respecting our best ally and holding a vote on the agreement, Democrats chose to, instead, change the rules. So this fair trade agreement is essentially being held hostage and is locked away someplace, probably in the basement of the Capitol. 
   The fact is, Colombia already has open access to sell most of their goods into America. It's American farmers and businesses that face tariffs and hurdles to be able to sell their crops and goods into Colombia. This trade agreement is about fairness for American farmers and American workers. 
   The people that Democrats are hurting by blocking a vote on this fair trade agreement are Americans. Colombia has one-way access to our country, which Democrats have overwhelmingly voted on to give them. By passing this agreement, we would be making it a two-way street and give Americans fair access to Colombia. That should be what fair trade is all about. 
   Also, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat leaders promised that earmarks would be scrutinized and be subject to debate and challenge on the House floor. Yet this 1,000-plus page bill contains an untold number of earmarks that have never seen the light of day. They have not been through a public review of any kind, no committee hearing, no debate on the House floor, no Senate and House conference committee review. 
   And today the House is going to spend a grand total of 1 hour reviewing this bill.     
   Mr. Speaker, that is not a broken promise, it really is irresponsible. 
   Now, the reason why this liberal Congress finds itself in this mess is because the fiscal year ends on September 30, and they have yet to pass a single one of the 12 appropriation bills needed to fund the Federal Government starting October 1. This Congress has totally failed in its most basic job. 
   They shut down the work of the Appropriations Committee. In fact, in the middle of a working markup, they literally gaveled the committee to close, got up and left the room and just quit working. I should qualify that, they quit working in public because Democrats have been working feverishly behind closed doors to write this massive spending bill. 
   But why did Democrats punt on their basic responsibility and retreat to work in secret and walk out of a markup? It is because Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats are doing everything they possibly can to prevent us from lowering gas prices by producing more American-made energy with offshore drilling. 
   Democrats are so opposed to drilling offshore that they shut down the work of the Appropriations Committee. But the good news, Mr. Speaker, on this issue they have failed. Republicans have succeeded in forcing the ban on offshore drilling to be lifted despite the massive battle that Democrats waged for months to try and block it. With passage of this bill, the moratorium on offshore drilling will be lifted. 
   Yet, of course, this is just the first step. Democrats have shown the incredible lengths they will go to to block drilling. While they have been beaten this time, Americans, Mr. Speaker, should not be fooled. Democrats have chosen to play possum because election day is approaching and they want to hide from voters who support drilling offshore. There is much more to do, both now and after election day, to ensure that offshore drilling becomes a reality. But the reality is, Mr. Speaker, that Democrats and their allies will continue to use lawsuits and other tactics to block America from becoming more energy independent. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this Democrat Congress has broken promise after promise to the American people. It has failed to do the most basic job to pass 12 funding bills by October 1. It is now jamming through a bill that was only made public at 11 p.m. last night, a little over 13 1/2 hours ago. It is a bill that is over 1,000 pages long. It is a bill written in secret, spends hundreds of billions of dollars and includes untold numbers of earmarks that haven't been publicly vetted. The House will debate this monster piece of legislation for just one hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, for these many reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am talking about unvetted earmarks in this bill, and I would be happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts if he would tell me that he has, and stake his reputation, and he is a very valuable member of this committee, that there are no unvetted earmarks in this massive bill. 
   I will yield to the gentleman if he will give me a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the normal process for appropriation bills are for them to come to the House floor and be debated under an open rule with the earmarks that are in the bill being open for everybody to look at them. 
   Now I find it rather interesting, when other Members were talking I saw my friend and his staff from Massachusetts frantically going through this 1,100 page bill to try to find earmarks. Well, if we'd gone through normal process, we would have known what those earmarks are. I have always said that I am one that is not necessarily opposed to them, but I think there ought to be transparency to this whole process. And there hasn't been any transparency, because only one, Mr. Speaker, only one of the appropriation bills was passed by the House, and that was not done under an open rule. 
   Had we had the normal process, all these earmarks would have been vetted, asked about, explained and so forth. But here we are, 1 hour to debate this 1,100-page bill of which there are three appropriation bills a part of this CR, and no real process to look at what the earmarks are. That's my whole point. Nothing more than that. 
   Yet because we aren't going through the regular order as we say, open process, in fact we go through 63 closed rules, Members don't have an opportunity to find out how the taxpayers' money is being spent on particular earmarks that all Members of this House have an opportunity to put in these bills. Mr. Speaker, I just wonder what the qualms are over there. It's their process, they run this place, and it hasn't been open. 
   I reserve my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question because, by defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to ensure that the Congress will not adjourn, Mr. Speaker, until a comprehensive energy legislation bill has been enacted. 
   What this means, Mr. Speaker, is passing an all-of-the-above energy plan that, in addition to drilling offshore, we need to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, and shale oil reserves in other parts of our country. We also need to extend renewable energy incentives. We need to streamline approval of new refining capacity in the United States and nuclear power facilities in the United States, and we need to encourage advanced research and development of clean coal, coal-to-liquid, and carbon sequestration technologies. 
   And finally, we need to minimize drawn-out legal challenges that unreasonably delay and prevent actual domestic energy production, because I had mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that while the offshore is now open on October 1 to exploration, I'm almost sure that the lawsuits will ensue. The bill that I will be amending this rule to contemplate takes care of that provision. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous materials inserted into the Record prior to a vote on the previous question.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, when most people think of the State of Washington, they imagine a cloudy day with a good chance of rain. However, much of the eastern part of Washington that I represent is very dry and very arid. In fact, my hometown of Pasco averages only 8 inches of rain a year, which is even less than the Central Valley, where my friend from California resides. This part of the State is also noted for its irrigated agriculture, which is the foundation of our rural communities. 
   Water is a valuable and limited resource that is critical for farmers and our agricultural economy. Two areas of my district in particular know the value and importance of water: the Yakima River Basin and the Odessa Subaquifer of the Columbia Basin. The Bureau of Reclamation is examining both areas for potential additional water storage, and I hope this Congress will continue past commitments to finding solutions that protect the farmers and the communities in these areas. 
   I also recognize the need to develop alternative sources of usable water for drinking and for agriculture purposes. By exploring innovative approaches such as membrane-filtering technologies and aquifer storage and retrieval, we can ensure that kitchen faucets and irrigation lines won't run dry in the future. Fresh water is a scarce and valuable resource and certainly one that we cannot afford to lose. 
   The underlying legislation continues a pilot program under the Clean Water Act that provides grants to encourage water reclamation and reuse. The bill would increase authorized funding for this program by $50 million without any fiscal-year limitation. However, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to point out that this program has never been funded. Therefore, the real question of whether this program warrants Federal funding will be left up to the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee in charge of water spending to decide. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this modified open rule, and I hope that we can continue this openness in future legislation, including the supplemental spending bill, the budget resolution, and the Water Quality Financing Act that is expected to be on the floor later this week. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from San Dimas for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House Resolution 219. I am disappointed that a bipartisan amendment that I offered, along with the chairman of the Ethics Committee, Chairwoman TUBBS JONES of Ohio, to the Rules Committee was not made in order under this closed rule. 
   The amendment that we offered would simply set the funding levels for the Ethics Committee at the level that was requested by Chairwoman TUBBS JONES and by me, the amount that we jointly determined was necessary to effectively carry out the Ethics Committee's responsibilities. 
   Regrettably, the budget we requested was not provided by the House Administration Committee. Yesterday, the Rules Committee refused to allow the House to vote on whether the Ethics Committee will have the resources it needs to fully fund its responsibilities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee is responsible for two primary tasks: one, educating, informing and advising members and staff about their ethical responsibilities pursuant to the House rules; and, two, enforcing those rules firmly and fairly without regard to friendship, favor, or political party. 
   Two years ago in a bipartisan fashion, I requested a substantial increase in funding to better fulfill these responsibilities, and I was pleased that 2 years ago the House Administration Committee supported and approved the full funding that was requested. However, as the Speaker and Members know, the 110th Congress passed significant changes to the House rules that we are living under in this Congress. Those rules require, Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat, require that our committee take on additional responsibilities that we haven't had in the past in areas of gift, private travel, mandatory ethics training, and public disclosure. 
   Our budget request this year, $6.11 million, and it is the lowest of any standing committee in the House, would provide the additional staff to improve the quality of advice, authorize detailees from the Government Accountability Office to help process public disclosure office, increase ethics training for Members and staff throughout the country, and enhance the communication of the new ethics rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the need to live under a tight budget. Yet the budget requested by the Ethics Committee for this Congress is not arbitrary. It is the amount of funds needed to do the work that we are asked to do by a vote of the House. Limiting the Ethics Committee budget limits the Ethics Committee's ability to do its job. I do regret that this matter has reached the House floor, and I know that the chairwoman and I seek simply to have the resources we need to serve Members of this House and to uphold the integrity of this institution. 
   I am committed to working hand in hand with the chairwoman, and I know that she is sincerely dedicated to carrying out the committee's responsibilities. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I must ask my colleagues to join me in voting against the rule and against the previous question so that the amendment providing the Ethics Committee the necessary funding can be considered by the full House.
