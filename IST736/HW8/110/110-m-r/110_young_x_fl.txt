   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time to me, and I am here to comment on the defense part of the package, the request by the administration, the issue of procedure. 
   Chairman Murtha was very outgoing and worked together with the minority and me, as the ranking member, in drafting this bill. We have always done that. When I was chairman, we did that. When he was chairman, we did that. The defense part of this bill is a good package. That's amendment No. 1. 
   As a matter of fact, we actually followed the process, and we went to the subcommittee, and the subcommittee members had a full discussion of the defense part of this bill, and the subcommittee members on both size of the aisle agreed that we had produced a pretty good bill, and it met most of what the administration had asked for. 
   Then we reported it on to the full committee. That's where the process broke down. The process up to that point, while it was at the subcommittee level, the process worked fine, regular order, just like it was supposed to. 
   But then all of a sudden the process did break down. I don't know to what extent any other Members might have been involved, but this Member, as the ranking member on the subcommittee, was not involved. 
   There were subsequent meetings, despite the fact it hadn't gone to the full committee, it hadn't gone to the floor of the House so that the Members could express their interest, either by amendment or by debate. There was a meeting between the leadership in the House and the Senate on the defense  package where it was actually conferenced, a conference agreement was reached. There was no conference, but a conference agreement was reached, and that is my understanding of what is in this bill today. 
   As Mr. Lewis has said, we just got the actual language of what is in this package last night. So it does take a little time to read all of these bills and to understand. 
   But I think the defense part of it, there may have been an additional change after that preconference conference, or whatever it was, I don't know that. That might have happened. 
   But I support amendment No. 1, and I believe that we have done a good job in providing for our troops. 
   The largest portions of amendment No. 1 will deal with pay, military personnel costs, what it takes to maintain the lives of our members of the military and their families. The other very large part of this package is operations and maintenance, something that is essential to keep the military going. 
   So I support this package, but I really am concerned about the process as well. I like the package, but there may be some Members on this side of the aisle or on that side of the aisle who would like to see some changes, who would like to have an opportunity to debate what is included in that package, who might want to offer an amendment that could be productive, that may be something we would all support. 
   But we all know, because the opportunity to do that just isn't there. It is a little strange place. 
   My friend--and I think everyone knows that Mr. Obey and I are friends, and that we have a strong respect for each other, and we have worked very well together in our respective positions--but he mentioned early on that we moved very quickly after September 11, 2001, after the attacks on the World Trade Center, and the airplane that flew into the Pentagon, and the airplane that flew into the ground in Pennsylvania in Mr. Murtha's district that very likely was directed at this United States Capitol, where the Defense Subcommittee was in session working on the Defense appropriations bill. But we didn't know what was happening there. We didn't know what was next. 
   If you recall, all of the airplanes flying in and around the United States were grounded because we didn't know if additional airplanes had been hijacked, we just didn't know the extent of the attack that we were experiencing, the terrible, vicious terrorist attack against an innocent Nation. So we did move quickly, and we appropriated $3 billion----

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the gentleman. 
   So we did move quickly, and on the third day after September 11, we produced a bill. Mr. Obey and I wrote that bill together, we consulted with each other, we had a couple of disagreements, we worked those out. We had some accountability in the bill. 
   We then had a meeting with Senators, and on the third day we had worked together, Republicans and Democrats, to produce a bill that sailed through the House, sailed through the Senate, signed by the President. That's the way it was done. The process was not the regular order, but it was a process done in consultation with both parties and any Member that wanted to be included. 
   While I do support amendment No. 1, I think the process is terrible, I think the process is inexcusable. I cannot support the process, but I think we have a good package on amendment No. 1, which is to pay for the national defense requirements in this supplemental.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the passion of the introducer of this amendment. I understand his arguments. I should. We have talked about them at least twice a week for the last 3 or 4 years. 
   I agree with a lot of his argument, but the problem is that this amendment wouldn't solve most of those problems. It really isn't directed at those problems. 
   In the outer continental shelf, there are vast areas of the outer continental shelf that are available for drilling for oil and for gas. 
   But in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, there are some very environmentally sensitive areas that have been protected by this Congress since 1983. This amendment would undo those protections. In recent years, something very important has come about, and this is the military mission line. The Defense Department, the Air Force and the military who exercise and train in areas of the Gulf of Mexico tell us that east of the military mission line it would be disastrous for their training if we allowed drilling for oil or for gas. 
   Congress spent a lot of time this last year on this very subject, and Mr. Peterson was part of the effort to come to a compromise. We came to a compromise finally. It wasn't easy. 
   Mr. Peterson didn't really like the compromise, and I give him credit for standing up for that, but he agreed to it. 
   Now, this amendment would undo the compromise that Congress worked so hard on last year. This amendment is not going to solve the problems that the introducer of this amendment suggests exists today, problems that we are all pretty much aware of. 
   But this amendment could be a disaster for environmentally sensitive areas of the Gulf of Mexico and certainly would cause the degradation of necessary military training east of the military mission line in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   So I think that while Mr. Peterson is very passionate, and he certainly understands the issue of natural gas, and the benefits of natural gas, I don't think that he really understands the need to protect certain areas from drilling for oil and for natural gas. 
   So I would hope that the Congress would once again step up to the plate on this issue, defeat this amendment, and let's get on with this good bill.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the gentleman yielding me the time. 
   This amendment is aimed at the military mission line in the Gulf of Mexico. The only place that has a larger area of Outer Continental Shelf in the moratorium. Where the military mission line runs through the Gulf of Mexico.  
   Mr. Moran spoke earlier of the flights that are training around Oceana in Virginia. I will speak to the training areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are used very, very effectively by the United States Air Force to train pilots in some of the newest, highest-technical aircraft that we have. That is what this amendment is about. It goes to violate the military mission line that we agreed on last year. 
   I don't get offended very often, but I am a little offended by this, for this reason: many of us in this Chamber voted for that bill last year, and we voted for it because it protected the military mission line in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the environmentally sensitive areas. We voted for it because it provided a permanent solution to this issue of moratorium. 
   Now if the Peterson amendment passes, it hasn't been very permanent. By the way, Mr. Peterson, and Mr. Abercrombie, who is one of the architects of this agreement, agreed to this, and so we agreed to it as well because we thought that having a permanent solution was a good idea. But now this amendment goes back on the agreement. 
   That does offend me somewhat. When I make an agreement, I keep it, and most everybody in this House Chamber, when they make an agreement, they keep it. But these two Peterson amendments violate the agreement that brought most of us to vote for this bill last year. 
   Just one more point: if anybody thinks that drilling another well, and there are vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf still available for drilling for oil and for gas, if anybody thinks another oil well in The Gulf of Mexico is going to bring down the price of gasoline, drive up to your gas station. Mr. Peterson himself mentioned the fact that no matter what the supply would be, that the Wall Street traders control the price. 
   What are you paying for a gallon of gasoline today? A lot more than we ought to be paying. One more well, two more wells, 10 more wells aren't going to make a difference in the price of gasoline at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I want to say that I am very, very proud to be working with Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member Wicker as a member of this very important subcommittee. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs is going to have much more responsibility as the months go by, probably more than they realize. One of the reasons is that military medicine has gotten so much better. Medicines are better, medical techniques are better, the ability to evacuate a wounded soldier from the battlefield is much better, and we have intensive care units on our aircraft today so better medical care can be provided to the wounded soldier, marine, and the wounded heroes.     
   Because of that many of our heroes are living today who would have died in previous wars and previous battles. But also because of that some of them are hurt worse than normal, and the Veterans' Administration is going to eventually have the responsibility once these heroes leave their military medical facilities at Walter Reed or at Bethesda or some of the other military hospitals. 
   One of the things that this bill does, and it does a lot of good stuff, and I'm strongly in support of this bill, it increases funding for the Inspector General for the Department of Veterans Affairs. And I know that oftentimes we think that the Inspector General just looks at dollars and figures and decides if the money is being spent or accounted for. 
   The Inspector General from the Department of Veterans Affairs does a really great job, not only in doing that, checking the dollars, but also in checking for fraud. And it is amazing how much fraud the IG has uncovered in the last couple of years, costing upwards of hundred of millions of dollars to the taxpayer, and taking it away from the veteran who needs it and the hospitals and the medical professionals who need this money to care for the veterans. 
   But also, another part of their responsibility is the care that the veteran receives in the VA hospitals. They look at this very closely, and if and when the medical care in the hospital is not appropriate and not proper, they report this to the proper authorities. 
   The investment that Chairman Edwards has made in the Inspector General's Office in this bill will pay us back many, many times over in what they recover than we have invested. So this is a good bill. 
   If you wanted me to pick out something that I didn't like about it, I'm sure that I could. But the part that relates to the Department of Veterans Affairs, this is a good bill, and it deserves our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud Chairman Obey for the statements that he has made since the beginning of this session of Congress that we are going to pass all of the appropriations bills individually, separately, and send them to the President, individually and separately. I think that is a great idea. As a former chairman of this Appropriations Committee, I wish I could have done the same thing. 
   I understand the frustration that Chairman Obey has in not being able to move the bills the way that he wants to move them. I experienced the same frustration. Mr. Obey is right. We did have omnibus bills during the time that we were the majority party. The reason we had the omnibus bills is because our partners in the Senate refused to pass their bills. 
   Now, Chairman Obey has said so many times that we just didn't do our job. In the House, we did our job. In the House we passed our appropriations bills just like Chairman Obey did this year, but it takes two Houses to approve a bill and to send it to the White House. 
   The frustration is that without appropriations bills, the government shuts down. It's pure and simple. Article I of the Constitution of the United States, section 9, says that the administration can't spend any money that has not first been appropriated by Congress. So in order to meet that constitutional responsibility, we have had, on occasion, the need to create an omnibus appropriations bill because the Senate refused to pass their bills. Now, I will concede that during our chairmanship the Senate was a Republican Senate. It was controlled by the Republicans. 
   Today, the United States Senate still refuses to pass all of their appropriations bills, and today the Senate is controlled by the Democrats. So it just seems like the Senate is the Senate, no matter who controls them politically. But in the case that we are debating today, there is absolutely no good government reason to combine these three bills. Combining these bills will slow them down. 
   It has been suggested by some of the speakers we ought to move ahead. The Defense appropriations subcommittee was scheduled to conference tomorrow morning to send the bill to the Senate and to the White House. I understand the Labor-HHS Subcommittee was also scheduled to conference tomorrow. These bills could have been conferenced and, by the way, the Military Construction Veterans' Affairs Committee was also prepared to conference, and the President said that he would sign that bill, he would sign the Defense bill. He expressed his concern about the Labor-H bill. 
   I voted for all three of them. I voted for the Defense bill, I voted for the Military Construction Veterans Affairs bill, and I also voted for the Labor-HHS bill. I think we ought to handle these bills individually to speed up the process, not to slow it down. 
   By combining these three bills, we all know that it will slow down the process. How long would it slow it down? I don't know, but I do know this, that there is already talk about conducting the appropriations process on these bills on a continuing resolution if it gets slowed down too much. That's not good. 
   We have done CRs, and we know that, and we know the reason for them. But there is no good reason to put these bills on a CR. They are ready to conference. They are ready to come back to the House and go to the Senate and go to the White House. They are ready. There would be no delay. 
   It's just not right because there is no good government reason to do this. It's just not right to do it. I suggest that we should join in supporting Chairman Obey when he says that these bills should be done individually, separately and sent to the President in that fashion, individually and separately. 
   I support this motion because, if this motion does not pass, and if we appoint Labor-HHS conferees to conference the Defense bill, I mean, they are all very, very talented members, and they all  have great knowledge, but, you know, none of them sat through the hearings. None of them sat through the justifications. None of them sat through the markups. 
   So to have the Labor-HHS members who are outstanding members on both sides of the aisle, to have them conferencing a large bill as complicated as the Defense bill, that's just not right. It's really interesting that the bills that the leadership would add to the Labor-HHS bill make up 80 percent of the dollars to be appropriated.     
   The Labor-HHS bill, which becomes the vehicle, is only 20 percent of the appropriations. 
   This is not right. I'm not going to suggest why the majority leadership made this decision. But I'm going to say, emphatically and without fear of contradiction, there is no good government reason for combining these three bills, because they are ready to be conferenced and sent to the President without any delay whatsoever. 
   And I thank the gentleman for yielding and for the good job that he does in his role on the Appropriations Committee.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when Puerto Rico kicked us out, yes, kicked us out of our training areas for the Air Force and the Navy in Vieques, we had to move that specialized type of training into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. We established a military mission line and said there would be no drilling platforms or drilling ships there because it would not be compatible with the type of training. 
   The type of training that we are doing there with the Air Force and the Navy aviation, as well as the naval surface ships are hypersonic weapons, supersonic aircraft, long-range missiles, stand-off missiles like AMRAAM, and we are talking about Patriot missiles. We are talking about all types of ordnance being used to train our pilots and our ship crews, a very specialized training. 
   For those of us who are determined to make sure that our forces have the best training possible, this is the only place, according to a briefing that I had with the Deputy Secretary of Defense this week, the Air Force this week, the Navy this week, this is the only place east of the military mission line where this type of training can take place in America. 
   So those who are concerned, those of us who are concerned about this, are curious as to what will the motion to recommit have to do or speak to this area east of the military mission line? 
   It's very important to us. It's very important to our national security and to those fighter pilots who are going to be doing their training here before they get into a combat situation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, throughout the evening, we have heard some very, very interesting speeches. I listened with great respect to all of them. I agreed with some, I disagreed with some, I wasn't sure about some. Nevertheless, it was a good debate at a high level. I paid special attention to the very distinguished Speaker of the House because in her opening comments, she talked about how Monday, Veterans Day, America honored our veterans. She spoke about the Veterans appropriations bill in great, glowing terms. I agree with that. It is a really good bill. It provides a lot of benefits for the veterans. There are 400,000 veterans claims backed up. That bill provided money to hire additional adjudicators to get rid of that backlog and get the veterans what they need. 
   The problem is that as she spoke about the importance of this bill and what a great bill it was and great bill it is, she failed to say that the House passed it on June 15, the Senate passed it in September, and here we are in November still waiting to get that bill on the House floor. 
   I say, Madam Speaker, let's vote on the VA appropriations bill. 
   I mentioned the fact that there were great speeches. But, Mr. Speaker, tonight we will not be voting or be recorded on how those speeches went, or what those speeches said, or what those speeches included. We are not going to be voting on opinions. We are not going to be voting on politics. We are going to be voting on what is in this bill. What has been said about this bill is not necessarily what is actually written in the bill. But we are going to vote for what is written in that bill. We will be held accountable for our vote on what that bill says, not on what some speaker said about it. 
   One of the things that I mentioned in my opening comments that I was really offended by is that this legislation gives constitutional protection to terrorists, the same constitutional protection that all of our constituents enjoy. I refer to page 3 of the bill itself, ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the rights under the United States Constitution of any person in the custody or under the physical jurisdiction of the United States.'' 
   Now, that gives terrorists the same protection that your constituents have. And that's just not right. By giving them that protection, do we give them for example, do we have to read them their Miranda rights if we capture them on the battlefield? Do we have to allow them to pay bail and get out of jail or get out of detention? What kind of rights will we be giving to terrorists with just this one sentence that says they shall have rights under the Constitution? These are terrorists, Mr. Speaker. These aren't even people who are signatories to the Geneva Convention. They don't play by any rules. They do whatever they must do, and they have killed thousands and thousands of Americans, and they have killed thousands and thousands of the Muslim populations. 
   Now, something about this bill, on page 6 of this bill, ``After the conclusion of the reduction and transition of United States Armed Forces to a limited presence as required by this section, the Secretary of Defense may deploy or maintain members of the Armed Forces in Iraq only for the following missions.'' Now, pay attention to this because this is what you will be allowing. For those of you that think you're getting troops out of Iraq, this is what this bill will permit. The Armed Forces in Iraq can be there for the following missions: ``Protecting United States diplomatic facilities, United States Armed Forces, and American citizens.'' We do that now. That is one of the things that we are doing right now. 
   So you think you're getting out of that. This bill keeps you in that. The next paragraph, ``Conducting limited training, equipment, and providing logistical and intelligence support to the Iraqi Security forces.'' We're doing that now. So if you think this bill is going to change anything, it doesn't because you are allowing them to stay  to do the same thing that they are doing now. 
   The next paragraph, ``Engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda, al Qaeda affiliated groups, and other terrorist organizations in Iraq.'' Mr. Speaker, we're doing that now. 
   On page 12, we go to the Iraqi Security Forces Fund provided in this bill. ``For the `Iraq Security Forces Fund', $500 million, Provided, that such funds shall be available to the Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the purpose of allowing the Commander, Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq, or the Secretary's designee, to provide assistance, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to the security forces of Iraq.'' Mr. Speaker, we are doing that now. So if you think we're making a change here, read the bill. 
   It goes on to say, ``Including the provision of equipment, supplies, services, training, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation, and construction, and funding, and to provide training, reintegration, education and employment programs for concerned local citizens, former militia members and detainees and former detainees.'' Mr. Speaker, we're doing all that now. 
   So this bill doesn't make very many changes if you think this gets you out of Iraq. It doesn't. If you read the bill, you will see that it doesn't. Now, these are things that we would be allowed to do under this bill. But if this bill were successful, and it will not be because I have an idea the President would veto it in its present form, we would have to do all of these same things that we are doing today but with a smaller force, a smaller force, minus the surge, for example. The change in policy that we all demanded early on came about, and it was called the ``surge.'' The surge has had many positive effects. When you get to the point that The New York Times and the L.A. Times and the Washington Post are writing stories about the positive effects of the surge, you have to admit there is something real there in the surge. So do you want to go back and have to do all of the same things we are doing today with a smaller force? I don't think so. 
   We will have a motion to recommit. And if that motion to recommit is successful, we will have a bill that we can all vote for and that I believe the President would be willing to sign. So let's vote based on what is in this bill, not what the speeches say about it, not about the politics, not about the opinions, but let's actually vote on what is in this bill and let's support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and anywhere else in the world where they might be deployed. We owe them no less. This bill is not a good bill today. Let's vote against it tonight and vote for the motion to recommit.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is a simple forthwith motion. That means a vote for this motion will allow the House to immediately vote tonight on a bill that can pass the Congress and be signed into law. That means that our troops in harm's way will get the funding they need before Congress leaves town for a 2-week Thanksgiving recess. 
   The motion would amend the bill to strike the provisions which have nothing to do with providing for our troops and are nothing more than political gamesmanship. The motion would strip the provisions that give our enemies a complete blueprint and timeline for troop withdrawal. The motion would strip the provisions in the bill which signal to our troops and our enemies that Congress will not provide any more funding for our troops, except for withdrawal. The motion would strip the provisions in the bill that substitute politicians' judgments on troop deployment for the judgment of our military commanders in the field. 
   At the same time, we leave intact the $50 billion in critical funding included in the bill. We leave intact the prohibition on torture, which has been adopted previously by this Congress and Congresses before. But we strip the new provisions which could give terrorists killing our soldiers and our citizens constitutional protections under our legal system. 
   We modify provisions to more clearly express Congress's commitment to our troops and to bringing them home safely in victory as soon as possible. We leave intact a new requirement that the President submit to the Congress within the next 3 months a comprehensive, long-term strategy to achieve stability in the Middle East over the next 5 years. 
   As events of the last few months have shown, the situation on the ground has, and we all hope will, continue to improve dramatically. Congress has and will continue to debate the proper course of the war, as it should. However, we should not and cannot vote to hold troop funding hostage to that debate. The only ones hurt by that are our troops and their families. 
   As we go home to enjoy the holidays with our families, how can any of us look our soldiers' families in the eye and explain to them that we are withholding their funding so that we can score political points. That is just wrong. Our soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen and their families deserve more from all of us. 
   I urge adoption of this motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the majority chairman of the committee bringing this bill before the House because we do need the money, not for our troops at home, not for the basic bill, because that basic bill was signed by the President yesterday. What we need is to make sure that our troops in the field have the equipment that they need, the force protection measures they need, the body armor that they need, the MRAPs that they need, the ammunition they need, whatever they need to take on the enemy to accomplish their mission, to protect themselves while they are doing it. So I want to speak directly to the bill rather than to the politics or the history of the political aspect of this legislation. 
   Fifty billion dollars is a good number. I wish it would have been a little higher because I don't think it takes us all the way to where we need to be for a supplemental next spring as far as what we are doing in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the $50 billion that is in this bill, the dollars are good. What is provided by those dollars is needed for our troops in the field. That has to be the important decision that we make tonight: Are we going to fight a political battle here on the floor while our soldiers overseas are facing the enemy of terrorism? I don't think that is what we are here for today. I think we are here to pass this bill. 
   The gentleman from Wisconsin mentioned a policy change; that this bill is going to bring about a policy change. There was a policy change earlier in the year. Most everybody referred to it as the surge, and many Members of this body opposed the surge. But if you listened to the briefers this afternoon in the Rayburn building, that policy change has produced a lot of very positive effects. 
   So there was a policy change. But, nevertheless, whether you still support the policy change or not, that is up to everybody's individual decision. Despite what your position is on the war, on the battle, you have got to be prepared to provide for the troops that are there, whether you like the fact that they are there or not. I want them home. I want them home as soon as we can get them home. 
   Along with Chairman Murtha of the subcommittee, I have seen too many wounded soldiers and marines in our military hospitals. We have both attended too many funerals of our war heroes who were sent home after having lost their life on the battlefield. So I want this war over and I want our troops home as soon as we can get them home in victory; victory in a war that didn't start on September 11 and it didn't start in March of 2003 when we went into Iraq or Afghanistan. It started back in 1983, October 23 of 1983. Terrorists bombed our Marine barracks in Beirut. Those marines were there as peacekeepers, not as part of any other expeditionary force, other than to keep the peace, and 241 of our military marines and soldiers lost their lives there. 
   In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed; in June of 1996, the home of the airmen in Saudi Arabia in the Khobar Towers were bombed, and 19 of our airmen lost their lives. In August of 1998, our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by terrorists and 11 Americans lost their lives and hundreds of others were injured. In October of 2000, the USS Cole, on a peaceful mission off the shore of Yemen, was bombed by terrorists and 17 lives were lost. All this started before September 11, and of course I don't think anybody denies what happened to us on September 11. So this war started a long time ago, and this threat is basically the same threat that we saw starting in 1983. 
   I am pleased that sufficient funds are included for the Army operation and maintenance account to allow for 6 months of war operations. Other accounts would apparently allow for only 4 months of operations, however. The size of the package is secondary to the policy provisions that have been attached to the bill. Many Members have stated they cannot vote for war funding without language requiring a withdrawing from Iraq. The reality is most of them have already done that. 
   When we passed the Defense appropriations bill, the basic Defense appropriations bill for 2008, we provided transfer authority, large amounts of transfer authority so that if we didn't get a bridge fund passed, if we didn't get a supplemental passed, the Services could reach into their basic accounts to pay for fighting the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   So those who voted for that bill have already voted to fund the war, whether they like it or not. That legislation has now been signed into law, so the money is there to borrow. We are going to start hearing about cuts in services at military bases here in the United States if we don't pass a supplemental or a bridge fund and the Services will have to borrow from their basic funds. We don't want that to happen. We don't want the Services to run short on anything that they have to do to provide for the security of our Nation. 
   So whatever your position on the war, whatever decisions are going to be  made about withdrawal from Iraq, this money, this $50 billion and more will be needed in the next 6 months and it needs to be passed. 
   This bill was only filed last night. Some of the provisions have not been sufficiently reviewed, in my opinion.     
   I have read this bill twice, word for word, and I am concerned about some of the sections of this bill. 
   Section 102 regarding interrogations says in part that ``nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the rights under the United States Constitution of any person,'' and I will repeat, ``any person in the custody or under the physical jurisdiction of the United States.'' 
   Now, to me, that means that terrorists who we capture on the battlefield, who have been killing our own American soldiers on the ground, I read that to mean that they will be given the same constitutional protections as any citizen of the United States of America. And I object to that. I don't think they deserve the protection of the Constitution. 
   I wonder, does that mean we have to read the terrorists their rights under the Miranda ruling? Can they be released on a technicality? Can they get out on bail? Those are protections guaranteed to American citizens. Are we going to give terrorists that same right? Well, this bill says that we are going to give terrorists that same right. Terrorists go by no rules. They do not subscribe to the Geneva Convention and they do not deserve the same protection under our Constitution that our constituents enjoy. 
   I think this bill needs a lot of repair work before it can become law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds just to point out, and I agree strongly with Mr. Murtha's statement about torture. I don't think Americans want to be known as a Nation that do torture. 
   But we have put prohibitions on torture in our Defense appropriations bills almost from the beginning of the war, and so we have made it very clear that we are opposed to the use of torture. We just wish the other side would go by the same rules.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Chairman, earlier this week the Appropriations Committee filed the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill and report. There were no minority views on this bill, because it is broadly supported by both Democrats and Republicans in its current form. 
   The bill totals over $459 billion, and is $3.5 billion below the President's request. However, it is $40 billion above the fiscal year 2007 level. 
   The fiscal year 2008 war supplemental request of $147 billion is not included in this bill. That package will be marked up and brought to the floor in September. At that time we will also be addressing the President's new request of $5.3 billion for additional MRAP vehicles for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I strongly support this bill as reported. It provides for a number of Presidential and Congressional priorities, including: $6 billion in equipment to grow the Army and Marines; Restoration of the $1.9 billion cut in the Defense Health program associated with proposed increases in insurance co-payments that have not been authorized by Congress; An additional $925 million in equipment for the National Guard and Reserve which is important for disaster response throughout the country, including the Gulf Coast; Full funding for the Congressionally I proposed 3.5 percent pay increase for the military; $4.1 billion for continued development of the Joint Strike Fighter and $3.1 billion to procure 20 F-22 aircraft; Procurement of nine ships for the Navy, including initial funding for the next generation aircraft carrier; and $1.1 billion to outfit a new Stryker brigade, either for the National Guard or the active Army. 
   To summarize, unlike many bills we're dealing with this week, I can state that this bill has broad bipartisan support. 
   I appreciate the cooperation and courtesy shown by my chairman, Mr. Murtha, throughout this process. We keep trading places as chairman of this subcommittee; perhaps in the next Congress we'll trade places again. Whatever happens, I know we will continue the bipartisan partnership that has been the hallmark of this subcommittee. 
   I also want to thank the members of the Defense subcommittee for their contributions to this bill, especially those on the Republican side of the aisle. Mr. Hobson, Mr. Frelinghuysen, Mr. Tiahrt, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Kingston, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis, all made important contributions to this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, again I want to say that I strongly support this bill, and urge its adoption by the House.

   I take this time to advise the chairman of the subcommittee that under the unanimous consent agreement, a number of amendments were listed. I advise the chairman that some of those amendments will not be offered.     
   Other amendments we will be able to accept. Others will go to a vote, and there are several that will be subject to a point of order. 
   But in order to facilitate the evening and allow the House to conclude action on this bill, I just took this time to state that.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. The gentleman caught my attention when he said St. Petersburg, Florida, if that's where that company is located. I assume that it is because when I submitted the request in full transparency, I said it was from St. Petersburg, Florida. 
   This is a program that is important to the military. This is a defense-related issue.     
   What this program is, is providing water for our troops in the field where there is no water. We have reverse osmosis. To do that, you have got to have some kind of liquid. We have desalinization. To do that you, have got to have saltwater. But how about getting water where there is none present? How about getting water out of the atmosphere? Because there is water in the atmosphere. And this company has proved they can do it. And this company's product is being tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds by the United States Army. 
   Now, I suggest to the gentleman, do we really want to deny our troops the opportunity to have a system that provides water from the air? And it works. It is working in Aberdeen. Do you really want to deny troops the opportunity to have a portable unit that will provide water for troops that are deployed in outrageous places where there is no water? If that is what you want to do, then you should vote for this amendment. I am opposed to the amendment.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Let me give you the type of question you are asking. Last year, I was chairman of this subcommittee. Last year, we had a request through the administration for a supplemental of $70 billion. We asked the administration, what would you like to include in that $70 billion? What did you need? We didn't get an answer. 
   We didn't get an answer, so after repeated requests we had to go to the services who were fighting the war and say to them, what do you need? And we identified those items and we put them in that $70 billion supplemental, which most of us voted for. So I was responsible for and got credit for a $70 billion earmark. Everything is not black and white in this world. 
   And so I say to the gentleman, I appreciate his tenacity, but I would like to have an opportunity to debate with you the many good things that have been done to defend our Nation and support our troops that have been done created by the Congress, not requested by any administration. 
   One of the very best earmarks that I can give you an example of off the top of my head is the Predator, the Predator that the Iraqi terrorists really hate because it hunts them down and it kills them. The Predator was a congressional earmark. The administration, the Defense Department didn't ask for it, didn't give us any support. We said we need this capability, and we  got the capability. And it is one of the best things we have going for us in the war against terror. 
   So I hope that begins to give the gentleman a little bit of a response about our responsibility in providing things that our military needs and our national defense needs. And I thank my friend for yielding.

One of the best programs this Congress ever created in the health field was the National Bone Marrow Donor Program, which has saved thousands of lives, a proven system. It was created by this subcommittee with an earmark many years ago, and it saved thousands of lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of children and older Americans this afternoon because I have supported and initiated many legislative efforts in this House to provide health care benefits to both groups. 
   Yet I must oppose this legislation today because the process under which we are considering it is a disservice to young and old alike. We have before us a major expansion of a Federal entitlement program, a $54 billion tax increase, and the largest cut in the history of the Medicare program under a procedure that allows no member--Republican or Democrat--to offer an amendment to improve this bill. This is the people's House, and yet only a handful of our 435 members have had a chance to write this legislation. Two major committees--Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce--had primary jurisdiction over this matter, but the Energy and Commerce Committee did not even hold public hearings on this important issue. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was established with my support in 1997 through a bipartisan effort of this Congress. It has been an unqualified success in providing life-saving medical care to children throughout our Nation. The SCHIP program in Florida now covers children in families with annual incomes of up to 200 percent of the poverty level. In the 10th Congressional District I have the privilege to represent, 21,779 families, or 34 percent of all families with children under the age of 18, are already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. 
   While we could have extended the current, very successful program and modified it to make some program improvements in the coverage of those children who have no insurance, those who wrote this legislation seek to expand the program to include children who come from families that already have health insurance. Children from families with incomes as high as $82,000 could become eligible for health care benefits. And the authors of this legislation pay for this new coverage by cutting Medicare benefits upon which thousands of seniors in my district rely on for their health care needs. It is estimated that these cuts total upwards of $194 billion over the next 10 years. 
   This would cut funding for the 42,843 seniors in my district who are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Program. 
   This legislation cuts payments for seniors' hospital and inpatient care by $2.7 billion. 
   This legislation cuts payments for seniors' inpatient rehabilitation services by $6.6 billion.  
   This legislation cuts payments for seniors' skilled nursing facilities by $6.5 billion. 
   This legislation cuts payments for seniors' home health care services by $7.2 billion. 
   This legislation cuts payments for those of all ages with End Stage Renal Disease by $3.6 billion. 
   This legislation would impede the mobility of seniors by making them wait a full month to receive Medicare coverage for a motorized wheelchair. 
   And this legislation would reduce the amount of time seniors can receive Medicare coverage of home oxygen equipment from 36 to 13 months. 
   Mr. Speaker, my district is home to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. My wife Beverly and I have spent countless hours there with children and their families, as well as with their doctors and medical staff. You can be sure we understand the special needs of children, particularly those without health insurance coverage. The program we established 10 years ago was a major improvement in expanding the health care options of children. It also provided important reassurance for their parents. 
   There is no doubt that we could have improved this legislation by working together. Republicans and Democrats alike support providing health care coverage for children and seniors. Instead, this reauthorization of what was a major bipartisan health care initiative has been rewritten with the input and ideas of just a select few members without the opportunity of amendment by all the members of this House. 
   In fact, the last changes to this legislation were made at 3 this morning. Those changes even wrote into this bill specific program carve outs for 36 hospitals identified by name or location. None are in Florida. How were those hospitals selected? 
   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to providing health care for young or old alike we should work together in a bipartisan manner to create the best program possible. The best ideas do not reside in just one committee or one political party. We should all have the opportunity to contribute to this legislation, to debate amendments, and to vote on those amendments. A majority of members, not a majority party, should determine what is best for the American people. 
   While I will vote against this legislation today in large part because of the procedure under which it is being considered and my concern about the negative impact it will have on older Americans, it is my hope that when it returns from the Senate and a conference between the House and Senate, it will be something that I can support, that the majority of my colleagues can support, and most importantly that Americans of all ages can support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the funding recommendations for accounts under the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee. 
   The House approved the conference report on the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2007 on September 26th, 2006 by a vote of 394 to 22, and the President signed the bill into law on September 29th. However, several important accounts that were previously within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life have been transferred back to the Defense Subcommittee, and therefore are addressed in this continuing resolution. 
   Two of the most important of these are the Basic Allowance of Housing for our active duty members of the military, and the Defense Health Program. 
   I am pleased this continuing resolution provides the minimum funding level necessary for both these activities. This legislation provides an increase of $500 million for Basic Allowance for House above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level, and an increase of $1.2 billion for the Defense Health Program. 
   However, we need to recognize that both programs will need additional funds during the rest of this fiscal year. Rates for Basic Allowance for Housing were increased late last year following the normal survey of market housing rates. This has created a shortfall of $1.4 billion. 
   In addition, due to inflationary increases in health care costs and an Administration proposal for an increase in insurance co-payments that was not approved by the Congress, the Defense Health Program faces an additional shortfall of at least $700 million. 
   We must address these funding shortfalls later this year. Our highest priority in the Defense budget should be for the well-being of our military personnel, and I know my Subcommittee chairman shares my concerns. This continuing resolution is just a first step toward meeting that responsibility in fiscal year 2007.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a member of the subcommittee presenting this appropriations bill tonight, I rise to strongly support the bill and to compliment and pay a special tribute to Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member ZACH WAMP, who have done such a great job in leading this good subcommittee to present this exceptional bill. 
   I am particularly pleased that the Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital at Bay Pines, which is in my district that serves the veterans of Florida, will be able to expand the type and quality of care that it can provide through this bill. Work will begin next year on a major $17.4 million expansion of the Bay Pines Hospital that will provide enhanced mental health and posttraumatic stress syndrome services with funds included in this bill. The new facility responds to an urgent need for additional space and resources to provide mental health and posttraumatic stress counseling and services which are so badly needed. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I do rise in support of this bill. There are so many other parts of the bill that have already been discussed and that will be reported in the written legislation, but I just want to say that I believe that it meets the needs of today's military, the members of our military. It meets many of the needs of yesterday's military, and it meets many of the needs of tomorrow's military. It's a good bill. I hope we can expedite its passage and get it to the President, get this bill signed so that the money can start to flow to care for our veterans and to provide necessary facilities for the members of today's military.  
   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill and it is needed now. While conducting a foreign war, our military continues to realign to meet current requirements around the globe and continues to aggressively work the base realignment and closure plan. I am glad that it has finally been brought to the floor of the House. 
   In total, this bill authorizes a total appropriation of $24.8 billion for needed military construction efforts around the world. This total is $400 million over the President's requested budget. 
   In addition, the bill appropriates a total of $3.2 billion for military and family housing projects for the families of our service members who are bearing the bulk of the sacrifices of this Nation's ongoing military actions around the world. This is an increase of $300 million over the fiscal year 2008 level. 
   The bill authorizes $336 million to continue a quality of life initiative that was begun in the 2008 Supplemental. This sum includes $200 million for new trainee and recruit housing, and $136 million for medical military construction and upgrades to certain medical treatment facilities. The President did not request this funding in his budget. 
   Equally as important are the funds supplied in this bill for our continually increasing veterans population. This bill includes a total funding level of $47.7 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This total is $2.9 billion over the President's request. We owe our past, our present and our future veterans the finest care possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious matter. We have been discussing this now for days here in the House, but I want to tell you that I am opposed to this resolution, because it doesn't do anything. 
   I want to see our troops home, and I want to see our troops safe. I would venture to say that, with the exception of, maybe, Mr. Murtha, I have seen and visited more wounded troops, soldiers and Marines at our military hospitals than anybody in this Chamber; and I don't want them to be in harm's way any longer. 
   The problem is, I have strong recollections of September 11; and even before September 11, I remember the bombing of the USS Cole where our military, our sailors were killed and wounded. I remember the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. I remember the bombings of the Khobar Towers, where American airmen were housed in Saudi Arabia. I remember the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon. I remember the hostages taken by terrorists and held for 444 days in Iran. 
   I remember all of that, but what I remember, that I will never, ever get out of my mind, is September 11, being on the highway immediately next to the Pentagon when the airplane hit the Pentagon and killed many of our friends and colleagues. 
   I remember going to Ground Zero just a few days after September 11 to deliver satellite telephones to the police and the firefighters because their existing communications didn't work due to all of the confusion, because of the disruption to the communications lines. 
   I remember the smoke was still rising, the dust was still flying. 
   I remember the American people demanded that something be done. They were tired of us being subjected to terrorist attacks, Americans being killed, and nothing being done about it. 
   The American people demanded that something be done, and they demanded through our Congress that something be done. The President was under this pressure and demanded that something be done. Congress debated then and two-thirds of the Members who were here at the time voted to give the President legal, lawful authority to do whatever had to be done. 
   This Congress should be prepared to do whatever has to be done to eliminate the terrorist threat. I don't care whether it is in Iraq, whether it is in Afghanistan, whether it is in Somalia, whether it is in Mogadishu, wherever it is, we have got to protect Americans from the threat of terrorism and from terrorist attacks; and we need to support our troops who are out there on the front line making sure that we at home are being protected. 
   Now these soldiers have been promised by the Commander in Chief that they are going to have some reinforcements, that they are going to have some help to fight this fight, the aggressive fight that is now finally taking place. The Maliki government was finally pressured to allow us to attack the targets that were real targets, to allow us to attack whether they were politically harmful to the Maliki government or not. 
   What about the soldiers in the field who were expecting that they would get some reinforcements and that maybe, with those reinforcements, they might get an extra night's sleep? 
   What about the soldier who had hoped that reinforcements would allow him or her to sit down to a hot lunch, rather than having to grab an MRE and eat that MRE on the run? 
   What about the soldiers in the field who hoped that reinforcements would allow them to find time to read their mail or send a letter to their loved ones back home? 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious issue. If this House is serious about Congress bringing home our troops, then do it right. This resolution doesn't bring any troops home. It doesn't provide any safety or security for our troops. It doesn't provide anything to help with the mission in the global war on terror. 
   If you want to do it right, bring a resolution out here to the floor that does it right, that brings them home, that stops whatever it is that we are doing there in Iraq. 
   But, if you know anything about what our military troops are doing, you know that once you get into a battle, once you get into a fight, it is easy to get into a war. You can almost slip into it without recognizing you are getting into it. But once you are in the fight, getting out is not easy. 
   Once you are in the battle, you have several options. You win or you lose or you surrender or you retreat or you negotiate. Who do we negotiate with? Negotiating would be nice if we could end this by negotiations. Who do you negotiate with? You can't even find Bin Laden, if, in fact, he is alive. 
   The problem here is, once you get into the fight, which we did with the support of the American people and with the support of this Congress, once you get into the fight, it is just not that easy to get out of it unless you win or you lose. Winning is better than losing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, first I want to make the point as strongly as I can that I want our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and anyplace else in the world where they are in harm's way as soon as we can possibly do it without risking the security of our own Nation and the security of our own people. 
   Mr. Murtha and I have been partners in this business for many, many years, and he and I have both stood by the bedside of too many wounded troops and have attended too many funerals, and we want this over. 
   As a matter of fact, the legislation before us, the appropriations part of this defense bill is a good package. Mr. Murtha and I met prior to him submitting this to the full Appropriations Committee and we agreed. Basically I told Mr. Murtha that these are about the same numbers that I would have recommended if I were still the chairman. But we did agree to disagree on the issue of the restrictive language on the conduct of the battlefield. 
   My memory takes me back, as we discuss this legislation now, to October of 1983, where terrorists attacked the Marine barracks in Beirut. The Marines there on a peacekeeping mission and 241 of our troops were killed. In February of 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed, as Chairman Lewis noted in his comments. Six lives were lost.     
   In June of 1996, Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, where our airmen were being housed, was bombed. Nineteen American lives were lost. August of 1998, our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by terrorists again. Two hundred fifty-nine lives were lost. October of 2000, the USS Cole off the shore of Yemen was bombed by terrorists. Again, 17 American lives lost, and almost every crewman on the ship injured. 
   But all this time nothing happened except a lot of rhetoric. Well, we talked a lot. We were going to hunt them down. And you can run, but you can't hide. 
   But finally, after September 11, the people of America were so incensed by what they saw with the airplanes flying into the two World Trade Centers, the airplane flying into the ground in Pennsylvania, in or near Mr. Murtha's district, and the airplane flying into the Pentagon right across the river, killing some 3,000 innocent people. The people of America were incensed. They demanded action. The President of the United States promised action, and the Congress provided action. And subsequently, our troops are in Afghanistan and are in Iraq. And it is essential that we provide whatever they need to carry out their mission and to protect themselves while they are carrying out the mission. 
   But now, what about leaving today or tomorrow or March or July, as some of these restrictions provide? 
   One of our great successes was Desert Storm. In Desert Storm, we attacked Saddam Hussein's armies successfully, and we annihilated, basically, his army. At least they ran away. They ran for cover. They surrendered. A lot of them lost the battle because the United States was aggressive and our coalition partners. 
   But here's where we made a mistake. Once we had Saddam's armies defeated, we left. We left before there was anything else there to provide a reasonable, logical government for the people of Iraq. 
   And what happened? Saddam responded in a vicious attack upon his own Iraqi citizens to continue the genocide that he began in earlier years. After we left from Desert Storm, he killed thousands of Shia Iraqis. 
   What General Petraeus and our American troops are trying to do is to give the Iraqi government that has been elected by the people, Constitution approved by the people, a parliament elected under the new Constitution by the people; General Petraeus said that the Iraqi security forces were growing in number, were growing in capability. Even the Sunnis are starting to join up with these security forces in Iraq to show a Sunni-Shia coming together. Not much, but a little bit. 
   But to let this government exist so that we didn't have another situation where we left, we didn't leave anybody in charge, and the bad guys took over again.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, and I want to congratulate Chairman Obey and Mr. Lewis for having worked out what appeared on many occasions to be an impossible solution. They did a good job. 
   I compliment Mr. Murtha, the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee for a good job on amendment No. 1. It is not quite as much funding as we thought that there should have been, but we're okay with that. It's a good plan. We're going to vote for it. We're going to vote for the whole package. It just proves, Mr. Speaker, that when we finally settle down and decide to work for the country, we can do it. We can work together and we can make good things happen. 
   And so the last time we discussed this, I stood here and extended my support for the package, but it didn't pass. This time, I'm indicating my support for the package. At least most of us are going to vote for it, extending our thanks and our appreciation to those who are serving in our military in far-off places around the world--and as we talk so much about defending our freedoms--defending our safety, protecting the safety of the American people here, at home, and abroad. 
   So it's a good package. I support it strongly, and I compliment all of those who were involved in the negotiations to make this happen. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.  
   Today the House is finally considering funding for the 2008 and 2009 Global War on Terror requirements of the Department of Defense. 
   The deal on this bill could not have been reached at a more critical time. The Department will very soon be out of money ..... literally. 
   While I support everything we are doing for the Defense Department in this bill, I do wish that we could have provided all of the requested funding. This bill is almost $4.2 billion below the President's request. More important than this reduction, however, is the fact that we are finally getting the Department the funding they urgently need. 
   Morale is suffering. This Congress's inability to act has created frightening uncertainty among the men and women of the Department who are not sure they will receive their next paycheck, and placed an inexcusable burden on those professionals trying to execute the finances of the Department during a time of war. It is time to get the Department the money they requested almost a year and a half ago. 
   Let me reiterate, I have no argument with the substance of the Defense spending in this bill. I support this bill, as I did the previous version that was considered on the House floor. This one, however, I plan to vote for. 
   Let's pass this supplemental bill, and complete the work of supporting our military and their families. 
   While there have been numerous votes in the House and Senate on this issue as we negotiated our way to this agreement, this is the critical vote and the meaningful vote as we conclude our work on this Supplemental Appropriations Bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I think this is a very good bill. 
   As has been mentioned during the debate on the rule, maybe someone else might have written it a little bit differently. I don't think any legislation is ever totally perfect, but this is a good package. It's a good bipartisan package. The subcommittee worked hard; had many, many hearings; required the military to justify the requests; and we have come up with a pretty good bill. 
   Chairman Murtha has chaired this subcommittee before we became the majority, then I chaired the subcommittee for 6 years, now he is chairman again. We have always worked this bill together in the best interests of the United States of America and the troops who provide our defense and that support us. 
   Mr. Murtha mentioned the pay raise. Yes, we did give a pay raise. We wish we could have given more. But the 3.5 percent was more than was requested in the budget request. 
   We are also providing funding for increasing the size of our military. And I don't think anyone would deny the fact that our military is tired. They are being used and deployed a lot. And so I think it is appropriate that we increase the size of military, especially the Army and the Marine Corps.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the amendment to provide funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
   These funds should have been provided much earlier this year. They are vital if we are to ensure that our troops have the support they need until enactment of a full-year supplemental appropriations bill for the Global War on Terror. 
   As I've said before, engaging in a debate on war policy is a legitimate and proper role for the Congress. However, we should never put ourselves in the position of threatening funding for our troops in the field. They deserve our full, unrestricted support. 
   With passage of this amendment, both the Army and the Marine Corps will have the funds they need to continue war operations for the first half of fiscal year 2008. However, we need to move quickly next year to provide full funding for our soldiers and marines, and for all our men and women in uniform. Let's not hold them hostage to Congressional debates ever again. 
   In conclusion, I strongly support this amendment and urge that it be adopted by the House. Then we can truly wish all our military a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding the time. And I rise in very strong support of the warfighting supplemental. Mr. Murtha and I have worked together very closely to make sure that the numbers were what our soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines and Coast Guardsmen were what they needed as they continue this battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The suggestions that I have seen today in the media that this political group lost or this political group won, I don't believe either one, any of those. The victory goes to the members of our military who are going to have the funding that they need to make sure that they have the equipment that they need and whatever else that they need. 
   Something else that it does, it proves that the Constitution is good. It proves that, by legislators working together along with the executive branch of government, that we can come to a solution. 
   Mr. Murtha and I strongly support the dollars. We did disagree, and there was no secret about that, on the language that he had originally inserted. But we all worked that out. And during our many conversations, we both agreed, and we both knew that we had to come to an agreement, not only here in the House and in the Senate, but with the White House. And that's what we've done. 
   And I think this is a good package, and I hope that for those who might be wavering and thinking that they're not going to vote for this warfighting supplemental, think about that, because it is a good package, and it's one that I strongly support. 
   And I commend leadership on both sides for having been able to come to this agreement and this compromise on a very good piece of legislation. 
   I'm not sure if that's going to be amendment No. 1 or amendment No. 2, but whichever amendment it is, I hope that all of us will vote for it and support it sincerely and aggressively.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (MICHAEL BILIRAKIS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPINAL CORD INJURY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4264, legislation to designate the ``Michael Bilirakis Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center'' at the James A. Haley Hospital in Tampa. 
   First, I want to commend my colleague from Florida, Jeff Miller, a distinguished member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, for introducing this legislation to honor our former colleague and my friend Mike Bilirakis. 
   There is no member of this House who devoted more of his time and energy to improve the quality of care for our Nation's veterans than Mike Bilirakis. Long a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, he made the establishment of the Spinal Cord Injury Unit at Tampa one of his highest legislative priorities. 
   As a result of these efforts, we have at Tampa the finest center of its kind anywhere in our Nation taking care of seriously injured veterans. We are thankful that Mike had the foresight to pursue this project as it has become a critical center in taking care of returning heroes from the war against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Naming the Spinal Cord Injury Center for Mike Bilirakis will be a lasting tribute to a man who never forgot our Nation's commitment to our veterans. It is also a special honor to a member of this House who did not seek acclaim or recognition. He just worked hard every day for the people of his district and for the veterans who wore the uniform. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join in approving this legislation to honor one of this House's quiet heroes who is a champion of those who bore the uniform in the past, do so now, and will into the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for yielding the time to me. 
   I rise in strong support of the legislation to provide relief in response to the tragedy surrounding the collapse of Interstate 35W Bridge spanning the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. 
   The people in my area of Florida remember this type of grief, and we share the grief of the people of Minnesota. It was during a violent storm at 7:38 a.m. the morning of May 9, 1980, that a freighter, the Summit Venture, slammed into the Sunshine Skyway Bridge which spans Tampa Bay to connect my district to Manatee County in the south, across Tampa Bay. Thirty-five people in their vehicles fell more than 1,200 feet into the waters of Tampa Bay that morning, fell to their deaths. 
   The Sunshine Skyway is a Florida landmark. The scenes of the mangled bridge missing 1,260 feet of the center span of the southbound lanes of the bridge was a daily reminder of the tragedy, and we remember, and we remember for the people of Minnesota. 
   Only two people survived the accident in Florida, one whose car skidded to a halt at the bridge's edge and the other who survived his pick-up truck's fall into the water and swam to safety. 
   For 7 years, the damaged span stood as a constant reminder. Congress, however, began the healing process very shortly after that tragedy, as we do today for the Minnesota tragedy. 
   I thank and compliment and commend Chairman Oberstar and Mr. Mica, my good friend and colleague from Florida, who worked so hard on all of these issues and for moving this legislation quickly in a bipartisan way to bring support for the people of Minnesota. 
   The House responded to my request for funding to help rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge quickly in the same type of fashion. So, as I said, we remember and we share the grief that you suffer today because we went through it back in 1980; and this Member stands ready to help in any way that we can to not only pass this authorization bill but to pass the appropriations that go along with it. 
   I thank my friend, Mr. Mica, for yielding the time to me. He is an outstanding leader in our delegation; and he does, I think, an exceptional job for all of us.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. I didn't intend to speak on this until I read the bill, and I didn't have much chance to read the bill because it didn't go through any committee, and it was only introduced last night. 
   But this bill is an illusion. It is not what it is proposed to be. It is one of those situations where you giveth on one hand, and you take away with the other hand. 
   I am looking specifically at subsection (e). After saying that we have to remove our troops out of Iraq within so many days, subsection (e) says, ``the Secretary of Defense may retain''--in other words, keep troops in Iraq--``for the purpose of providing security for the embassy, the U.S. embassy''; we do that now. And ``other United States diplomatic missions in Iraq''; other diplomatic missions in Iraq; we do that now. ``Protecting American citizens''; we do that now. ``Including members of the Armed Services serving in roles consistent with customary diplomatic positions''; we do that now. 
   Listen to this one: ``engaging in targeted special actions limited in duration and scope to killing or capturing members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations''. My goodness, that is what we are doing now. 
   ``Training and equipping members of the Iraqi Security Forces.'' That is what we are doing now. ``And may retain in Iraq members of the Army Corps of Engineers and Defense contractors engaged in reconstruction projects in Iraq.'' We are doing that now. 
   Subsection (h) on page 4. ``Prohibition on the use of funds to further deploy United States Armed Forces to Iraq.'' The funds may not be obligated or expended to further deploy units or members of the Armed Forces to Iraq, including through participation in any multinational force, except as provided under subsection (e), which is the subsection that I just referred to. 
   And then it goes to subsection (i), assistance to Iraqi security forces. ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of funds available to the Department of Defense for the purpose of  providing financial assistance or equipment to the Iraqi Security Forces or multinational forces providing security or training in Iraq.'' We do that now. 
   You have to get out of Iraq, but you are allowed to stay to do all of these things that we are already doing. 
   Vote yes if you want to. Vote no if you want to. That is not up to me. But I just wanted to point out the fact that, if you think this bill gets you out of Iraq, think again. Read subsection (e), because it doesn't accomplish what we are told that it does. 
   So I say again, this is an illusion. It gives with one hand, but it takes away with the other.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, as we conclude debate this afternoon on H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, I want to include for the benefit of my colleagues today's editorial from my hometown newspaper The St. Petersburg Times that warns the House to be careful with the passage of this legislation. 
   In Rx: dose of reality, the editors say ``that Democrats should walk away from this fight. House Democrats may think they can heal the Medicare drug program in one easy congressional dose, but their Senate counterparts are wise to take more time. Seniors have had enough of empty political promises already. They deserve affordable coverage.'' 
   Indeed, I support making prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans, and in particular older Americans who are enrolled in the Medicare Part D program. If this legislation did that, I would be the first to support it. But as the editorial I have cited as well as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found in analyzing H.R. 4, this bill will result in no meaningful savings to consumers or to taxpayers. 
   Following my remarks, I will include a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated January 10, 2007 which says that H.R. 4 would have a ``negligible effect'' on federal spending and drug prices because the federal government would not have the authority required to negotiate lower drug prices. The primary reason the Congressional Budget Office found is that ``without the authority to establish a formulary, we believe that the Secretary  would not be able to encourage the use of particular drugs by Part D beneficiaries, and as a result would lack the leverage to obtain significant discounts in his negotiations with drug manufacturers.'' 
   If, in fact, this legislation had given the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to limit the availability of certain prescription drugs or even broad classes of prescription drugs, I also would have opposed it. Doctors should determine the best medicine for their patients, not Congress or the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
   Mr. Speaker, there may have been a way to amend this legislation to solve some of these problems so we could have achieved the goal of lower drug prices while at the same time not limiting the range of covered drugs. However, under the procedures we consider this legislation today, there is no opportunity to amend this bill. We only have the option of voting yes or no. Given that option, I believe the best vote today is against H.R. 4 with the hope that we can reject this bill and send it back to the committee with the goal of fixing some of the flaws identified by The St. Petersburg Times and the Congressional Budget Office.   
   Rx: Dose of Reality 
   Democrats who thing they've found a simple fix for the nation's costly, convoluted Medicare prescription plan need to be careful. They are entering a pharmaceutical quagmire full of restrictive formularies, big-ticket coverage gaps and institutional resistance. 
   The fight is a worthy one, and the precipitous veto threat by President Bush only underscores the stakes. But Democrats won't win with campaign rhetoric. The bill set to move through the U.S. House today provides little more than an edict that the secretary of health and human services ``shall negotiate'' lower drug prices, as though the government itself is the one buying. Unfortunately, drugs are bought and dispensed under the 2003 Medicare law by a maze of some 1,875 private drug plans. 
   The Democratic plan is, at best, incomplete. The current law does, absurdly, outlaw any negotiation of drug prices, which has the principal effect of fattening pharmaceutical bank accounts. But the kind of savings the Department of Veterans Affairs has been able to negotiate for its prescription drugs is not merely the result of its collective bargaining power. The VA, which filled some 120-million prescriptions last year, also restricts the kinds of medicines that are available to patients. 
   As James R. Lang, former president of Anthem Prescription Management, told the New York Times: ``For this proposal to work, the government would have to take over price negotiations. It would have to take over formularies. You cannot do one without the other. There's no leverage.'' 
   Democrats are not being honest about the tradeoffs, and the possible need for some restrictive formularies to help reduce costs. They are also offering a misleading pledge to eliminate the so-called ``doughnut hole.'' To save money, Republicans created a peculiar gap in coverage that nabbed as many as 4-million seniors last year. Under the coverage gap, Medicare recipients pay 100 percent of drug costs each year after the total has reached $2,400 until they pay an additional $3,850 out of pocket. 
   During the midterm elections, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the prominent Democrats promising that the savings from lower drug prices would be plowed back into the program. ``We will use that money to fill the doughnut hole,'' she said at one campaign stop, ``so that seniors will have affordability, they will have reliability, and will not be caught in this trap of the doughnut hole.'' 
   The Congressional Budget Office has projected, however, that eliminating the coverage gap would cost roughly $450-billion over 10 years. Few, if any, Democrats are now claiming those new costs can be offset purely by savings from price negotiation. An estimate of drug price reductions prepared by Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., pegged the 10-year savings at roughly $96-billion. 
   The point here isn't that Democrats should walk away from this fight. The current Medicare prescription plan is indeed incomplete, needlessly complex and indefensibly profitable to the pharmaceutical industry. But the plan is also in effect and generally well-received by many seniors. Problems of this magnitude won't be fixed just by ordering a Bush administration bureaucrat to negotiate. 
   House Democrats may think they can heal the Medicare drug plan in one easy congressional dose, but their Senate counterparts are wise to take more time. Seniors have had enough empty political promises already. They deserve affordable coverage.  Hon. JOHN D. DINGELL, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Florida. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Defense part of this bill is a very important part of the package, although it's only one of three appropriations bills. 
   It's a good bill. The Republican members and the Democratic members of the subcommittee all played a part in drafting this legislation and coming to the final product. 
   I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Murtha for the fact that he included us in every step of the way. I have had the privilege of chairing this subcommittee on two different occasions. Mr. Murtha is serving as chairman the second time in his career. Whether he was chairman or I was chairman, all members, Republican or Democrat, were included in the process. We were this year as well. 
   The problem is, once we finished our part of the process, the process broke down. This bill, for the first time, as long as I can remember in many years, did not go to the full committee for the committee to review it, did not go to the floor, did not go to an official formal conference. Nevertheless, the product is a good product. It's a good bill. 
   Chairman Murtha has explained the highlights of this bill. I agree with what he said about the importance of all of those issues. 
   Another one of these bills is the bill that provides for military construction and for our veterans, and I have the privilege of serving as a member of that subcommittee. I would say that under Chairman CHET EDWARDS, the same thing happened. The Republicans and the Democrats all had a chance to be players in making a decision on what was included in that bill. 
   Chairman Edwards had the good fortune to get his bill to the full committee, and it was reviewed and adopted almost the way he wrote it. Then it came to the floor, and it was passed here on the floor with all Members having an opportunity to discuss it, to debate it, and offer amendments if necessary. The bill, a good bill, passed. You have got the Veterans bill and you have got the Defense bill as part of this overall package, and I strongly support both of them. 
   But I do have to speak out against the procedure. I just don't think that it's right that all of the Members have not had an opportunity to review these bills when they could debate them, when they could offer amendments to the bills. It probably wouldn't have changed either one of these two bills very much, if any, because they are both good bills. So I stand here objecting to the procedure, but I stand here supporting those two bills. From what I have heard, I am not a member of the Homeland Security subcommittee, but I understand that it is also a good bill. 
   So I have no objection. I support the bills, but I do object to the process. We need to vote this package today. The end of the fiscal year is rapidly approaching. In 5 more days, the fiscal year is over. We don't want the Defense Department and the soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines, who are protecting this country, to go without knowing what they are going to have by way of funds for training, by way of funds for equipment, by way of funds for protective gear for themselves. This is a commitment that I think all of us in this Chamber have made. 
   We want to guarantee that our military troops, our heroes who protect this Nation, have the best equipment that is possibly available to them to do their job and have the best training on how to use that equipment and use it effectively to do their job and have the best protective gear to protect them while they are doing their job. So all in all, I suggest we vote for this package.
