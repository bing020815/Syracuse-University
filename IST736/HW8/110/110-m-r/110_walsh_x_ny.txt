   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
   Section 1221 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is an abridgement of the rights of State and local governments to influence Federal policy as it pertains to their communities. In fact, section 1221, regarding the siting of overhead electricity transmission lines, permits the FERC to outright ignore State decisions and local considerations. 
   We are elected to represent a select constituency and our States, to advocate for their needs, and to advance our national interest. In this instance those responsibilities collide. 
   I recognize that the Federal Government can and should do more to modernize our Nation's aging and congested electric power infrastructure. But the Northeast corridor proposal negatively impacts the environment, decreases property values, poses health risks, and hurts local property tax revenue. What is worse is that it provides State and local regulatory agencies no ability to involve themselves. 
   By failing to support this amendment, Members of Congress will, in essence, allow unknown bureaucrats in Washington, huddled around a faceless map, to make critical decisions that affect the lives and financial well-being of thousands of American families. Surely that wasn't our Founding Fathers' intent. There has to be a better way than to circumvent a State's decisions and disregard property owners' rights. By supporting this amendment, we create time to find that better way.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALSH of New York. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGRESSIONAL CEMETERY -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my distinguished friend from Utah (Mr. Bishop) for yielding me time, and to the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall, for the courtesy of bringing this bill up on suspension, and also my colleague and good friend from California, SAM FARR, for cosponsoring this bill. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 698, a resolution commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Congressional Cemetery. Nineteen Senators and 71 Representatives are interred at the cemetery, located at the corner of 18th Street and E in southwest Washington, as well as monuments to 120 Members of Congress who died while in office. 
   Congressional Cemetery, older than the more well-known Arlington National Cemetery, served as our Nation's  first unofficial national burial ground. In 1997, my good friend, Jim Oliver, who worked for many, many years in the Republican cloakroom and provided great service to this institution, brought the cemetery's poor condition to my attention, and at the same time, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named this cemetery one of America's most endangered places. 
   After personally visiting the cemetery back then, I understood why. Headstones were turned over, grass was 2 feet tall, trees had fallen onto buildings, and headstones had damaged the integrity of this sacred place. As chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I was in a position at the time to do something to save this piece of history from becoming history. 
   In fiscal year 1999 appropriations, the Congress appropriated $1 million for the creation of a special Congressional Cemetery trust fund to restore and sustain this treasured landmark. Money was raised to match these funds in the private sector, and that fund now pays for the constant maintenance in perpetuity for this cemetery. 
   Some of America's great historic figures are buried in Congressional Cemetery, including Vice President and Declaration of Independence signer Elbridge Gerry, whose name is carried into my home district of Elbridge, New York; civil war photographer Matthew Brady; composer John Philip Sousa; and perhaps the most famous, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover is also buried there. 
   This legislation recognizes the work of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, charged with management and preservation of this historic site, and pledges that this body will never again forget the cemetery's important role in the development of our Nation's government and cultural foundations. I urge its adoption, and I thank the Chair and the ranking member for their courtesy.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for yielding me this time. 
   I have the greatest respect for the gentleman from Wisconsin. He is a good Member of this body. He is my chairman on the full committee. He is the chairman of my subcommittee, and on that subcommittee we work very well together to address the key issues of our country. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, the bill before the House today is a phony bill for many reasons. The rules have been thrown under the bus. No markup, no conference with the Senate. First and foremost, this product is the product of a couple of people in a body of 435. It does not reflect the best ideas of bipartisan membership of the Appropriations Committee. And when it leaves this Chamber, it will not reflect the best ideas of the 435 Members of this House. 
   While I often disagree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, Senator Byrd, at least he stood up for his committee and for the regular order and for the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate. 
   I have heard over the last several days the assertion that Members of the minority were offered an opportunity to participate. I must have missed it; I don't remember any consultation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am embarrassed that the committee on which I am so revered and on which I have been so proud to serve for so many years has been reduced to this phony exercise. 
   The reality is that the majority knows that this bill is going to be vetoed. Staff representing the Democratic leadership were quoted yesterday in the press as saying: ``Oh, yeah, it will be vetoed. That's the whole part I forgot.'' 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there is a time and place for fun, but not here and not now. The Democratic leadership, by virtue of that flippant remark to the press, a remark made quite clearly without regard to the needs of the men and women who risk their lives every day in service to this great Nation seems to me to recognize that they are playing politics with our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor this morning with my good friend and colleague, RICHARD NEAL of Massachusetts, to draw attention to the Northern Ireland peace process. 
   Many remember Northern Ireland's troubles with the endless bombings, bullets, bloodshed and continuous cycle of violence. The fight was for civil rights and national aspiration. The combatants made a conscious decision to end the killing and reach a compromise. 
   Thanks to the efforts of the British, Irish and American governments and the political leaders of Northern Ireland, we have had peace for about 10 years. But they are still struggling to implement the Good Friday Agreement that provides for power sharing, proportional representation and self-governance. 
   Over the years, in the face of significant criticism, Sinn Fein has delivered on every commitment outlined in the Good Friday Agreement. 
   We now look to Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party to step up and deliver on behalf of the Unionist community. It is time for the DUP to validate their word given at St. Andrews by unequivocally committing to a devolved power sharing government with Sinn Fein. They must make good on their word and consummate their remarkable achievement. An historic moment is dawning on the island of Ireland. It is time to act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. I am entirely familiar with the long-standing practice of Congress to fully fund the section 8 voucher program to be sure all vouchers could be used but recognizing that this rarely happened and that excess funds would be recaptured and rescinded in the next fiscal year. 
   I am also very familiar with the fact that HUD programs serve the most vulnerable of our populations, and that veterans are one of the most impacted by the HUD programs in general, and especially the homeless program. 
   I was disappointed to hear that this cycle has been broken, that this Congress has decided that keeping the funds at the public housing authorities is more important than funding facilities for low-income elderly and disabled. But that is exactly what this bill does. It imposes a rescission of a magnitude that would be in excess of the section 8 program need each year, and then precludes the recapture of those funds. The report specifically tells HUD that section 8 funds are off limits for rescission or recapture. 
   To put this in perspective, section 8 voucher funding is 40 percent of HUD's entire project. So HUD is now forced to take the entire amount of the $1.3 billion from a small universe of programs. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the motion to recommit and protect the poorest in our communities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. I thank my friend from California for yielding time, and I rise in strong support of this motion to instruct conferees. 
   Before I do that though, I'd like to comment, just make a couple of comments on some of the debate that's occurred, specifically, the notion that the Republican Party, when we were in the majority, did not pass our military quality of life and veterans bills. And I know the chairman knows this, but we did. In the House, we did. We passed our bills overwhelmingly. And we ran into a little problem with the other body. And I know the chairman feels our pain there because he has been and will continue to be running into problems with the other body, and I will work with him on those. But we did conscientiously work to resolve these issues here in the House. And I think historically, at least in my brief time here, we have done that. But the Senate is the Senate, and they do what they do. We do it our own way, and I think we do it very effectively regardless of the party in power in the House. 
   I would also mention, because the chairman did a little bit of crowing about the things that they are doing in this bill and they've done in the other bills, we passed, year after year after year, record increases in veterans health care spending. And they were needed because we have so many veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan with severe injuries, both physical and mental. But we stepped up to the plate and we did it in a bipartisan way. And we passed record increases. I think, on average, 10 percent increases per year; faster growth than any other budget in the Federal Government. So we are second to none in our support of veterans. And we will continue to support those bills that the other party passes if they are truly bipartisan. And I think this one, the Military Construction and VA bill is. 
   Back to the motion to instruct the conferees. Quite simply, what this motion says is that the conferees on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations bills should not add material to the conference report that was not approved by either House or the Senate. This should not be controversial, but based on what has happened here today, it is. 
   The reality is that this majority should not be combining a bill that has received a veto threat with two other bills that have not. 
   I've supported the Labor-H bill throughout this process. Chairman Obey has been fair, and I've worked with him shoulder to shoulder to bring this bill forward. He has fought for Republican and Democratic initiatives  and measures equally, and I thank him, and he has my respect for that. But I was not consulted when it came to putting these three bills together. 
   I voted for the Military Construction-VA bill. I voted for the defense bill. They are all good bills, in my humble opinion. The Senate has passed all three bills, as has the House. There is no reason why these three bills cannot be conferenced individually, sent to the President individually and accepted or rejected individually. But most assuredly, by combining them, they are all doomed to fail. If the President vetoes any of the three freestanding conference reports, we in the House, and our colleagues in the other body, will have an opportunity to override that veto. 
   Frankly, I see the effort to attach the Defense and Military Construction-Veterans bills to the Labor-HHS bill as nothing more than posturing and, in fact, brinksmanship. 
   Madam Speaker, the resulting bill would represent everything that is wrong with Washington. The confusion that will ensue in the country will only serve as a shining example of why this Congress today enjoys its lowest approval ratings in generations. 
   The people of New York's 25th Congressional District sent me to Washington to represent their interests and to solve problems. This effort to combine these bills creates a problem. 
   This Congress has produced less than a handful of bills in 10 months, and no appropriations bills to date. We can pass and have signed two bills easily, the Veterans bill and the Defense bill. But instead, by combining these bills to Labor-H, we will bring them all down. It is a plan to fail, just like the SCHIP bill was. 
   As I said, I support the Labor-HHS bill and I will likely continue to support it as a freestanding bill. 
   I understand politics and I understand political strategy, but putting funding for veterans health care and our military at risk to score points is beyond the pale. 
   I know there are some Members of Congress and some individuals in the White House who would like to see this government continue to operate on a continuing resolution as we have this past year. I don't. We can pass these bills stand-alone, but we can't pass them lashed together. 
   This process hurts the credibility of the Appropriations Committee, a committee that has historically been nonpartisan and task oriented. 
   Mark my words, if we continue along this path, we will be operating on a CR again in 2008. And for a third year in a row, no Member requests will be honored in the Labor-HHS bill, and for a third year in a row, the Appropriations Committee will fail to meet its responsibilities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'd like to begin my remarks by thanking Chairman Obey for his willingness to accommodate many of the programmatic requests that we made. I appreciate his attention to the concerns important to my constituents and to my State. 
   As you know, this is a very complex and demanding bill, and Chairman Obey's staff has done a fine job supporting him in this task. I also would like to recognize Steve Crane and Anne Marie Goldsmith from the minority office for their attention to detail in this legislation. 
   Let's make no mistake. This bill spends a great deal of money, approximately $6.5 billion more than last year in discretionary funding. But this bill addresses many of the most critical issues confronting our Nation--our families' health care, our children's education, our retirement security and our own workplace protection and job training needs. 
   If I were chairman, and I had this allocation, I'm not sure I would have written the bill a whole lot differently. 
   Specifically, this bill provides needed increases for community health centers. It advances my long-time efforts to advance funding for graduate medical education, of which my State, New York, trains 20 percent of the doctors in the Nation. So it is of critical importance to our teaching hospitals. And also the need for our Nation's poison control centers. 
   It funds important biomedical research, telemedicine and electronic medical records, which in the long run will dramatically reduce the cost of medical expenses.     
   It recognizes the need to provide seniors and those on fixed incomes with assistance paying high utility bills through the LIHEAP program. It continues Republican-led efforts to boost Federal funding for elementary and secondary education in support of the No Child Left Behind bill and also supporting programs for youth at risk. And thanks to my committee colleagues' support, the bill includes my amendment to boost funding for special education. 
   As most of you know, when the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act passed in 1977, Congress authorized annual Federal expenditures of 40 percent to help cover the cost of education for children with special needs. But in 1995 the Federal Government paid only 7.8 percent of those costs for our children with disabilities. That puts an additional burden on our local school districts. If we are only paying about 8 percent of the cost, that means they are forced to cover the other 92 percent instead of the 60 percent that we had told them they would have to cover. With this increase, we will provide just under 18 percent of the cost in 2008, or about half of our commitment. At least it is progress in the right direction. 
   This increased Federal support is important. Back in my home State of New York, the instructional expense for regular education for a student in 2003 and 2004 was $8,177 per student. For a special education student that cost was about double, $17,600. This bill boosts the maximum Pell Grant award to make a college education more attainable for more Americans, and it supports initiatives for senior health and wellness. 
   I am grateful to Chairman Obey for including funds to take care of the health needs of those who responded heroically, and in many cases putting their own health and lives at risk, to the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. 
   And I thank the chairman for responding to my request and attending to an issue of growing importance to more and more young American families: the emerging threat of food allergies. Food allergies more and more are affecting families across the country, and nobody really understands what is going on, why these allergies are occurring, but they do put these young people's lives at risk. This bill provides a new line of funding for research and outreach to parents of children with food allergies. While it is only a small amount of money that is necessary for the effort this year, the impact it will have is dramatic. 
   In addition, I have some concerns with the additional $2 billion in advance funding that was provided by the Budget Committee. My concern is that advance funding can cause serious problems if future allocations for this bill are not as robust. 
   With that said, again I would like to congratulate Chairman Obey and his staff for what I think on the whole is a well-written bill. I want to reiterate my appreciation for his willingness to work with us. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I couldn't agree more with my colleague, the chairman of the subcommittee. It's difficult to oppose an amendment that increases funding for treating and dealing with tuberculosis. It's a very serious disease all across the Third World. And there is the potential for it coming into our society and creating real problems. 
   Having said that, there is an increase in the budget, it's $14 million above  what the President requested, a pretty substantial increase, a 10 percent increase in the budget. And while I respect the gentleman's desire to strengthen our country against the disease, it's not proper to take that amount of the budget of the Department of Labor for this purpose. That would hamstring the Department of Labor. It would not cut the fat, it would cut the muscle, it would cut the arms out. It would cut the eyes out of the Department of Labor, and I don't think anybody wants that. 
   So, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I reluctantly rise to oppose my friend and colleague's amendment. I certainly support the intent to provide more money for TRIO, and I also championed additional funds for the geriatric programs in the 2007 continuing resolution. But I can't support this cut to AmeriCorp. 
   Like my colleague from Connecticut who just spoke, I was a Peace Corps volunteer. The point was made you are not a volunteer if you get paid. Well, nobody gets rich at these jobs. You have to have some money to live, to pay the rent, to buy your food, and to call home on occasion.     
   So you still can be a volunteer and receive a small portion of income to maintain your livelihood while you're providing this service, but this program gives young Americans the opportunity to express their idealism, to give something back and to learn and to round themselves out and to broaden their horizons. 
   In fact, since AmeriCorps was established back in 1993, it has demonstrated some pretty remarkable results. Eighty-one percent of former members have volunteered. Additionally, after leaving AmeriCorps service in other areas, 89 percent of former members became employed in the public sector, and Lord knows we need good people working in the public sector. Ninety percent of organizations said AmeriCorps members helped their involvement with other organizations in the community. 
   Young people are idealistic. They want to do something positive in their lives. This is one of the few programs that we have in the Federal Government that gives them that opportunity. So I would again reluctantly oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

It is a professional staff, and it is needed.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I thank the gentleman for his comments. 
   I think it's interesting to note that there are three returned Peace Corps volunteers here today, one Democrat, two Republicans. In the Congress, there are three of each, three Republicans, three Democrats. 
   But, more importantly, our appetite for public service was not whetted just by Peace Corps. It certainly broadened our lives. I joke with people. I never crossed Main Street in Syracuse from the east side to the west side until I was 16 years old. I went to college, went into the Peace Corps. The world got a lot bigger. 
   I have come back, and I have met people in every walk of life who were Peace Corps volunteers. I suspect the same will happen with AmeriCorps volunteers. In fact, 90 percent, almost 90 percent of former AmeriCorps volunteers come back and volunteer on their own. They continue to provide, to work in public service. They continue to support organizations in their own community. This is a citizen-building organization. So few of our young people today focus on what they can do for their country. This is a great way to get them to focus on it. 
   It's $250 million, a lot of money, but it's an investment. You hear that a lot, but you can see the investment. Whether you agree with our politics or not, you can see the investment paid off, in that individuals like ourselves from very different backgrounds wound up here at the highest level of public service. 
   My hope is that this program will continue to produce young Americans who are idealistic, but realistic enough to know that they have to work hard to serve their community and give back something to their society. So I have great respect for my colleague and my friend from Arizona. I just strongly disagree. Volunteerism is alive and well because of programs like this. We need to maintain it and retain it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, we have been down this road before. I believe public television has an important role to play both culturally and, more importantly, educationally. And as my colleague from Oregon mentioned, this is an essential and growing aspect of our public safety system and our ability to communicate. 
   In Rochester, New York, WXXI is using its digital signal to provide a network for local public service organizations, public safety organizations, first responders, not only for communication but for training, and also to help in coordinating large-scale emergency activities so that everyone is communicating within the same network and on the same bandwidth. So it is a very flexible system.  
   I have had my issues with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I had a very serious disagreement with them over the publication of what I thought was a very important movie regarding the lack of response by moderate Muslims to the radical Islamic fundamentalist zealots who are around the world today. The story I thought was a very well-told story, and it wasn't resolved certainly in my favor and in my view. But that aside, this would be a mistake to support this amendment, and for other reasons I oppose the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, and I do so knowing full well that this earmark issue is a very, very controversial issue these days. 
   What prompts me to oppose the amendment is that I believe, having served here for now my 19th year, that the Constitution was very clear. The power of the purse resides in the Congress, in the House of Representatives. The Appropriations Committee is responsible for allocating those funds. Members of Congress know their districts and the needs of those districts better than anyone else does. 
   Now, historically the administration has, through its budget director and its department heads, directed spending through the budget resolution in conjunction with Members of Congress and the budget committee. And I respect that. 
   But they need to respect our priorities also. And I think all Members should respect the priorities of those individual Members who know their districts best. 
   I think, as the chairman mentioned, this is a very small percentage of the overall Federal budget, remembering that the discretionary portion of the budget is only one-third of the entire Federal budget. And earmarks are a small percentage, less than 1 percent, I believe, of that discretionary portion of that one-third of the Federal budget. 
   But these dollars make a difference in communities. They help with economic development; they provide housing where the Federal programs just don't fit. 
   I came here as a city councilman. I saw all kinds of Federal programs that did not work for my community. And I said to myself, if I ever get to Washington and I have the ability to affect Federal policy, to make it more flexible, to make it work for my community, I will do that. 
   Now, my dad served as mayor of Syracuse and then came here and served for three terms. He was here when revenue sharing began. Revenue sharing was all about helping local communities direct spending so that it better suited their needs. That was under the Nixon administration. It was a breakthrough. It was Federalism taken to its lowest common denominator so that the cities and the counties had the ability to make a difference and get some of those taxpayer dollars back and put them to work in their communities. 
   So I think that the chairman is making a point here. I hope Members will oppose this amendment. 
   And let me just say this: for the 40 years that the Democratic Party controlled the Congress, they may not have had earmarks in these bills, but they were not pure as the driven snow, Madam Chairman. The way they did it in the old days was the old bulls, who were primarily from the southern part of the country, who served as Chairs of the full committees and subcommittees on appropriations, and were here for 25, 30, 40 years, they would just put the money in the bill. They knew where the money was. The chairman of that Department knew where the money was; and after the bill was signed, the chairman called up that Department Secretary and said, here's where you're going to spend the money. 
   Now, what we did, I suppose, is we made a mistake by democratizing this process. We opened it up. We Republicans opened it up so that all Members would have the same opportunity, maybe not as much money, but the same opportunity to help their local communities. 
   And, yes, there has been abuse. But the Members who've abused this, by and large, go to jail, and that's as it should be. If they break the rules, if they benefit themselves, if they stoke their own greed with taxpayers' dollars, they belong in jail. 
   But let's not bring this whole appropriations process into question, because there is a rotten apple in every barrel, and we've got to find them out, and we do. And the system works in that respect. 
   So let's oppose this amendment. We'll take votes on the individual earmarks. There's going to be lots of amendments to talk about. Those Members will come and they will defend them and, hopefully, make good arguments for them. 
   But let's defeat this amendment and get back to work. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I think this amendment is somewhat inappropriate, and I say that at my own peril. I have great respect for the chairman of the Commerce Committee. He is a wise man, far wiser than I. He has been here for many, many years. He knows how to make a point. I think he has made it. 
   I'm aware that this appointment is somewhat controversial, but the best way to get the Social Security Administration to perform as the Congress wishes is to pass laws and to bring them in for oversight hearings. I don't think that a rifle-shot cutting of one individual's salary is the right way to proceed. 
   I'm not intimately familiar in this case, but this type of amendment does cause me some pause. I can't recall in my years here any time when an amendment like this passed, although the chairman, who has been here far longer than I, could probably cite them. 
   If we want to deal with this issue of recess appointment, let's do so in an authorizing bill and not in this manner. And for that reason, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I rise in opposition to this amendment on behalf of the gentleman from Virginia's Sixth Congressional District, Mr. Goodlatte. He is involved in the markup of the Agriculture bill this evening, and so I would like to place this statement in the Record on his behalf. 
   Madam Chairman, for Members not familiar with Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest in Bedford, Virginia, the House was designed in 1806, and the grounds are located about an hour south of Charlottesville in the heart of central Virginia. 
   This investment of Federal funds will allow the landmark to open to the public 50 acres of hallowed ground once roamed by this farmer, diplomatic, meteorologist, President, and author of the Declaration of Independence; indeed, America's first Renaissance man. 
   Poplar Forest was an important part of Jefferson's life, a private retreat situated far from the public scrutiny and demands on our Nation's third President. It was his most personal architectural creation and landscape, a place where he came to find rest and leisure, to rekindle his creativity, and to enjoy private time with his family. 
   Poplar Forest was also a working plantation, critical to his efforts as a farmer. In fact, the area around Poplar Forest is where Mr. Jefferson was forced to retreat while being pursued by British troops. 
   Today, scholars and historians work on restoring the home to its original design and conduct archeological research on the farming, landscaping and slave life of the grounds. While the staff at Poplar Forest continues to restore the historic land and house, they  are working on the first steps of developing the retreat for public use. 
   As is the case with other historic Presidential sites, it will take time to tap the extraordinary potential of Poplar Forest to provide even more insight into one of America's most influential and public figures whose ideas still influence world debate and even govern rules of decorum on the House floor this evening. 
   Madam Chairman, while I share the gentleman's desire for fiscal responsibility, I will inform him that the private sector has furnished 84 percent of the funds it has taken to bring Poplar Forest's rescue and development through the initial stages. However, given the clear national role that Thomas Jefferson's legacy plays in our cultural heritage, I believe that Federal investment is prudent. It is vital to preserve this national treasure, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, so that all Americans can continue to learn about Jefferson's life and his vision for the future of our country. 
   I offer this for Mr. Goodlatte. I'm sure he would be here, but duty calls at the Agriculture Committee. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind my good friend and colleague from New York City that I too am a New Yorker and that I was there with a number of Members of Congress and the President after the attack occurred, and I spent a good deal of time talking with the workers, construction workers, the telephone company people, the police and firemen. And the impression of their sacrifice and their commitment to those people who were lost that day was burned into my memory. Ever since that day, it has been a priority of mine to make sure that those individuals were provided for in every way possible. 
   So I just want to remind my colleague from New York City that I, as a member of the New York delegation from Syracuse, care very deeply about those individuals and providing these funds in this bill was a very high priority of mine, and I thank the chairman for working with me on that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I certainly appreciate the chairman's dilemma. I have it also. But I would like to take just a moment to congratulate VERN EHLERS and RUSH HOLT for their leadership. When you come here, there are certain things that are important to you, and when you have an opportunity to effect them, you should. They are consistently supportive of this issue. 
   This is a national crisis that we have. They are only trying to prepare our kids for the future. And as I understand it, we have already cut the Labor Department by about $4 million. This would be another 15, so approximately an 8 percent reduction in their overall $400 million budget. A slight increase in this, I think, is worth a slight decrease on that side, so I will support the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to my friend's amendment. 
   The gentleman's amendment really is unnecessary, and it duplicates work that the Justice Department is engaged in under the Prescription Drug Monitoring Grant Program. 
   I understand that primarily, as a result of the efforts of Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, the Justice Department has been operating for several years, running a grant program to assist States in building and enhancing prescription drug monitoring systems, facilitating the exchange of information among States, and providing technical assistance and training for effective State programs. 
   The Office of Justice Programs runs this grant program, along with the assistance and technical expertise of the Drug Enforcement Administration and is currently funded at $7.5 million. 
   From all accounts, the Justice Department effort is well run and effective. For that reason, I ask Members to oppose this amendment, which would set up a competing and duplicative program. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I will be very brief, Madam Chairman. I absolutely agree with the chairman's statement. It is a responsible statement. We can't continue to do the nice things on the one hand by looking like we are putting more money into a program, and at the same time cutting the fat, muscle and limbs of the departments that are supposed to administer these programs. So I support the chairman's contention. We will deal with this in conference.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I certainly can't support further cuts to the Reading First program. It's been cut by $629 million. Further cutting this bill adds insult to injury. 
   There have been problems with the program. There have been abuses. And if laws have been broken, the Inspector General will bring charges against those violators. But we shouldn't punish small children and their teachers for those abuses. 
   We have a need in this country to teach children how to read. I don't think anyone could deny that. 
   So Madam Chairman, for that reason, I will not support any further cuts to a program that teaches those kids to read. And, in fact, I suspect by the time we get to conference, when some of these issues are clarified, we'll be adding money back to this program. 
   For that reason, I oppose the amendment.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, my amendment, which I intend to withdraw, is very simple. It would prohibit the Department of Education from counting test scores for English language learners against school districts until after the student completes 3 years of English language instruction. 
   In our subcommittee's hearing, with Secretary Spellings, I raised some concerns regarding English Language Arts Test that student learning to speak English as a second language were given this year. 
   In my home State, there are over 192,000 immigrant students learning English, the majority of whom are in kindergarten through third grade. In the city of Syracuse, my hometown, we have an elementary school in which 43 percent of the kids are English language learners learning English as a second language. 
   I recognize that there are benefits to monitoring ELL student achievement on an annual basis. But school systems should not be penalized for student scores after only 1 year of instruction. 
   I'd like to state emphatically that we need to make sure that all of our kids speak and read English proficiently. It is essential to their ability to compete in a very competitive society and a very competitive world. And it is essential to the long-term viability of the American culture that we can all speak to each other in the same tongue. 
   But I've learned other languages myself, some better than others, and it took me more than 1 year to be considered proficient. 
   Let's not punish our schools, declaring them failing, before they've spent enough time to teach English thoroughly to our kids. So although I intend to withdraw this amendment, it would be my hope that Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon are aware of this problem and will take steps to address it when we reauthorize No Child Left Behind.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak in support of this amendment. I hadn't intended to, but I think it's a good amendment, partially because it provides additional funds to IDEA. 
   In committee, we amended the bill to add $335,000,000 more to IDEA. This is a small one, but it's helpful. More importantly, this concept of community schools is a wonderful concept. But that's what we have committees for, committees of jurisdiction, to vet these ideas. 
   In my hometown of Syracuse, there's lots of talk about community schools. Remembering that primary and secondary education is a responsibility of the municipality, the county and the State and not of the Federal Government is an important thing to consider. A community school in Syracuse is very different than a community school in Maryland or California or Arizona. 
   But more importantly than all of that is that our schools, especially our inner-city schools, are having a very difficult job graduating the kids now. In fact, many of our urban schools aren't even graduating 50 percent of the kids who start in ninth grade. That's a fact. No one is comfortable with that fact, but it is a fact. 
   So why would you provide or require or suggest to a school that is already only attaining 50 percent of its responsibility with its primary task, why would you give them additional work? Why would you give them additional responsibilities? Maybe there's good reason for that, but there is certainly a committee structure. The education committee has plenty of experts and staff to try to determine the best way to approach this. 
   I admire the author of the concept's ingenuity, but this really needs to go through committee to have proper authorization. Absent that, I think this is a good idea. Ten million dollars will go into a program that everyone knows needs more money, that we are putting additional burdens on those local school districts by not providing this money. It would provide some relief to them to meet their primary task of educating our kids. So I think this is a very good amendment. I strongly support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield at this time to the author of this amendment such time as she may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALSH of New York. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE NEW POWER-SHARING GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. I thank my good friend and colleague from Florida for giving me time to speak on this issue, and to my colleague from California, who brought this resolution to the floor, and my colleague from Texas. 
   This is a wonderful celebration of a great success for mankind, not just for the Irish, but for all of mankind. And it's an important and significant foreign policy success for the United States of America. 
   About 12 years ago, then-Speaker Gingrich asked me if I would be willing to chair the Friends of Ireland, an ad hoc organization within the Congress that had been begun by Tip O'Neill, and the tradition continued through Speaker Wright and Foley and then Gingrich. Historically it had been a Democratic Congress, and I was the first Republican to chair it. But we never missed a beat. The Democrats and the Republicans worked side by side. Both Houses, Senators KENNEDY and DODD, MCCONNELL and CONNIE MACK worked hand in hand with RICH NEAL, PETE KING, myself, Ben Gilman, and so many others. 
   There is a real paradigm here for American foreign policy. If we can get everybody working together, we can solve I think pretty much anything in the world. But we played a part in this. The significant players were the British, beginning with John Major, and certainly Tony Blair, who focused on this all through his entire career. And also on the other island of Ireland, going all the way back to Elbert Reynolds and John Bruton, and then Bertie Ahern for the last 10 years. Every one of them, and again, different parties, different leaders, different philosophies, the same with the United States at the White House with President Clinton and then President Bush. Regardless of party, regardless of nationality, people all focused on what needed to be done. 
   I remember when I first took on this assignment, and what a labor of love for me, as an Irish-American, son of an Irish mother and an Irish father, when I first met David Tremble and I asked him, what do you expect to get from all of this? He said one word, Peace. And then subsequently, a day or so later, I had the chance to meet Gerry Adams and I asked Gerry Adams, what do you expect from all this? He said in three words, Peace with justice. And so I think both men showed remarkable patience and persistence through this process. And certainly now we have a government that combines the republican forces of Northern Ireland, Adams, McGuinness and others, and the loyalist forces led by Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson, Jeffrey Donaldson and others. It's a remarkable achievement. It's almost like having Sunnis and Shia working together in Iraq. Imagine that. It's possible. 
   But we should celebrate this victory as Americans, and as members of the family of man, because it is a great victory. We have taken a very, very dangerous place on the Earth and made it a peaceful place. We have seen the people of Northern Ireland, loyalists, nationalists, Catholic and Protestant, come together in one exercise, a democratic legislation. And it was that election, the election this spring, that really provided the coup de grace to violence and established democracy because all the parties participated and the people provided ultimately the leadership that was required to make this happen and gave their leaders the strength and the political capital to form this government. 
   So TIM MURPHY and I and a number of others, RICH NEAL, were in Ireland to watch Ian Paisley walk across the sidewalk in Dublin and shake hands with Bertie Ahern, say, I've got to grip this man's hand, give him a good grip. It was astounding. And the pictures of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson and Ian Paisley meeting together was an astounding picture that sent hope out to the entire world. So credit everyone. Victory has a thousand fathers and mothers. And we should all celebrate that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Lewis, for his hard work in providing this response, this very, I think, respectful response. 
   I would submit to you that any sacrifice any American has made in Iraq is a worthy, worthy sacrifice. 
   Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Thus far in the 110th Congress, the House has considered two pieces of appropriations legislation. Thus far, we have twice done so under rules that stifle debate and amendment. 
   First, we operated under a closed rule on the 2007 continuing resolution, limited debate, no amendments, a bill that spend hundreds of billions of dollars. Now we are doing the same thing with a war supplemental. Let me be clear about what is happening here tonight. 
   The majority does not want a vote to remove the egregious and unconstitutional provisions restricting the Commander in Chief's authority over our Armed Forces. They do not want to allow us the opportunity to strike the unprecedented deadline for withdrawing our troops. Never before has a Congress in our history written into law a date for the withdrawal of American troops in a war. 
   They won't allow us that opportunity because Republicans and Democrats would vote bipartisanly to strike that deadline. They have proposed a rule that will prohibit Members from offering amendments that could modify the bill in such a way that the President could sign it. 
   Let's be clear: by proposing a closed rule, the Democratic leadership signals it wants this bill vetoed. In short, the majority would rather play politics than find a solution to the problem. And who will lose this game of political chicken? The troops who stand in harm's way as we talk; the troops, who are relying on this Congress to provide the necessary funds before the end of May so they can complete their mission successfully and as safely as possible. 
   This bill should be rejected out of hand and the majority should immediately bring back a clean supplemental so we can ensure that our troops will have the resources they need. Let's stop the posturing and pass a clean bill. That's the bottom line.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank my chairman, Mr. Obey, for the hard work, the energy and the thought that went into this bill, and both the minority and the majority staff for the hard work that they did in preparing us for the culmination of this work. 
   But I have to say, Madam Speaker, as someone who supported both of these bills that are contained in this conference report before us, I must admit to no small measure of frustration and disappointment with respect to where we stand today. I'm disappointed because this exercise embodies what is wrong with Washington. 
   By lancing these two bills together, we ensure a Presidential veto of both. By combining these bills, it makes certain that neither will advance in a timely fashion. And tying them together guarantees that we will further delay vital and noncontroversial spending for our veterans; funding to provide our wounded warriors needed health care; funding to reduce the backlog in the processing of claims benefits; and funding to invest in our veterans hospitals and defense facilities, both here at home and abroad. 
   I've said over and over, I can't figure out how anyone thinks that holding the veterans funding, which we all support, hostage to a bill that is going to be vetoed is good public policy. The fact is, everyone knows it's not good  public policy; and, frankly, it's not even good politics. As former Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young asked, Give me one good government reason why joining these two bills makes sense. 
   I supported both the Labor-HHS and the Military Construction-Veterans Appropriations bills when they came to the House earlier this year. I think they're both good bills, and they're both well designed by the chairmen and the ranking members. 
   Chairman Obey and I have worked shoulder to shoulder on the Labor-HHS bill for several months now, and I am satisfied with this bill as it has been produced over the last several weeks. I think it is a fair compromise. Knowing the President is not going to sign the bill, I am optimistic that he will negotiate with us in good faith in the coming weeks so that we can produce a final product that he can sign and we can pass that preserves the important bipartisan priorities this legislation seeks to address. 
   I am incredibly disappointed that leaders of this committee have been forced to yield to the political whims and flippant strategies of party leaders advancing this needless game of partisan one-upmanship. 
   Appropriations has always been a committee of principle, a committee of good governance. Appropriators have traditionally cast aside politics for policy. Tonight, Madam Speaker, this committee has become the primary sponsor of a partisan stand-off, and that's a shame. 
   My constituents sent me here to develop good policy. They sent me here to do the right thing. And the fact is that delaying vital funding for our veterans is not the right thing. 
   I regret that we're here discussing this. I regret that we haven't seen the Military Construction-Veterans bill go to the White House. It's a bill that could have been sent a month ago. 
   If the Senate sends the Labor-HHS bill back to us as a stand-alone conference report, I will vote for it. As importantly, I will be among the first to vote for a stand-alone Military Construction-Veterans conference report as soon as the House decides to appoint conferees, but the process that has been used to bring us to this point leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in an attempt to set the record straight with respect to recent history of funding for these important veterans programs. Certain speakers over the past several days have made statements that have, in the least, inferred that the manner in which we are being asked to vote for the veterans portion of this package before us is consistent with past practice. This is simply not the case. 
   The facts of the matter are these: In 7 of 12 years of previous Republican control, funding for veterans was approved in stand-alone bills. In five of those cases, the conference report containing veterans funding was approved in September or October. In one case, the conference report was approved on November 8, and another was approved on November 18. 
   In 4 of the remaining 5 years, veterans funding was included in multiple omnibus bills. But in all but one of these cases, the House had approved the stand-alone veterans bill. In all but two cases, the Senate passed a stand-alone bill. In one case, fiscal year 2003, the election year in which the Senate switched its majority, neither body approved a stand-alone bill. 
   In every one of these 4 years, the omnibus bill that was finally approved was both fiscally responsible and negotiated openly by the House and the Senate bodies with full awareness and agreement of the executive branch. In the final circumstance, last year, the House approved a veterans bill before the beginning of the fiscal year and waited until the day before Congress adjourned for the Senate to appoint conferees. 
   Unfortunately, such appointment occurred too late to act. As we saw, when we had the majority in the House, there was a tremendous amount of frustration with the other body in closing some of these conferences out. I suspect my good friends on the other side of the aisle are experiencing similar frustration this evening. 
   Although funding for our veterans has found its way to these deserving Americans in more than one manner, the real point here is that not once in the past 12 years or even before that, as far as I am aware, has such funding for veterans been placed in jeopardy in the manner that it is being placed tonight. Never has it been paired with a bill that everyone is certain will be vetoed. Never has it been used as a pawn to force the President to choose veterans over other programs, no matter how important they may be. 
   Madam Speaker, as many of my friends are wont to say, people are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. In the debate regarding the funding for our veterans, it is particularly important that the facts are not distorted for political purposes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment because, if nothing else, it points out the essentially beneficial nature of public-private partnerships. Just as the Federal Government paid for the marvelous water projects in the West which helped Mr. Flake's State to grow and prosper, these research dollars have made the United States the global power in agriculture. 
   The Agriculture Research Service established the Grape Genetics Research Unit in Geneva, New York, at the center of New York's grape-growing region in conjunction with Cornell University.     
   The goals of this program are to reduce losses to crop yield and quality that result from disease, pests and environmental stress, and to improve grape and grape product quality and utilization. 
   The genetic research unit's primary research areas are development of resistance to pests and diseases, superior adaptation of grapes to growing conditions and tolerances for environmental and weather-related stress, and improved product quality through enhanced knowledge of genetic factors governing color, flavor, aroma, sensory characteristics and yield. 
   The grape genetics research unit works with growers both in New York and nationally to develop root stocks and grape varieties that are pest and disease resistant. 
   The explosive growth that my friend from Arizona mentioned is a direct result of the research that is being done here and elsewhere in the United States thanks to the support of the American taxpayer. The plant genetic research unit in Geneva works very closely with farmers in all parts of the country. In fact, 1,200 varieties of grapes are growing at the Geneva ag station today. 
   Nationally, it is a $30 billion industry, the wine industry. There are 23,000 growers; 5,000 wineries; and in New York State, it is a $7 billion industry. This industry is paying back to the Federal Government, the State and communities $17 billion in taxes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would like to begin by acknowledging the work of Chairman Obey and his staff in consulting with us on the Labor-HHS chapter of this bill. I know the gentleman from Wisconsin, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has been put in a difficult position. A position we in the House lamented all last year when the other body neglected to schedule time for our bills. 
   But I would remind everyone that under Chairman LEWIS' leadership, we completed work on every bill but one by July 4 of last year. 
   This process insist my view is beyond the pale. First of all, this is a continuing resolution in name only. For all practical purposes, it is an omnibus bill. To my knowledge, not one Member of the House other than the bill's sponsor saw this product in its entirety until Monday night. Let us be clear. This is not an inconsequential bill. It provides roughly half the money needed to run the government for an entire, and we are going to whisk it off the House floor in a grand total of 2 hours. The Appropriations Committee has not met to discuss the contents of the bill, let alone to offer amendments that could improve it. And Members of the House have had only slightly more than one day to decode the unorthodox language contained in this 137-page document. Furthermore, the bill before us is not amendable by the body as a whole. I cannot recall the entire time I have been a Member of the House a single appropriations bill that has not been open to amendment at some level. 
   The American people who watch this debate will see us spend $463.5 billion of their money with a grand total of 2 hours of discussion, 1 hour on the rule, 1 hour of general debate. If you do the math, that is $3.8 billion per minute of public debate. Frankly, that is a travesty, and the American people deserve better.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALSH of New York. (EARLY HEARING DETECTION AND INTERVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Deal from Georgia, for yielding time and his leadership on health issues. I would also like to thank my colleague from California, Lois Capps, who's done such a marvelous job of leading the Hearing Caucus for the past several years. 
   I would like to recognize, also, my cochairs along with Congresswoman Capps, Vern Ehlers, and Carolyn McCarthy, who also worked long and hard on this issue, as well as the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance, the National Center of Hearing for Assessment and Management. Without their hard work, this important legislation would not have been possible. 
   In the year 2000, Congress authorized the Children's Health Act which, among several initiatives, provided the necessary authority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to begin addressing the screening  and intervention needs of newborns and children with hearing loss. Indeed, when this program began, there were pilot programs in the country, probably back about 12 or 13 years ago, 3 percent of the children born in the United States were tested. Today, it's well over 95 percent of the entire universe of newborns born in the United States today are being tested. 
   As we all know, the first 3 years of life are the most important period for language and speech development. It is essential that hearing impaired infants and young children be identified and an intervention begun in order to take full advantage of the developing sensory systems. If unidentified, these children will lose out on the crucial period of speech and language learning. 
   Auditory impairment can impact social, emotional, cognitive, and academic development leading to personal, vocational, and economical defects. Delayed identification in management of severe to profound hearing loss can impede a child's ability to adopt to life in a hearing or deaf community. 
   The early hearing, detection, and intervention programs include screening, audiological evaluation, and early intervention to enhance communication, thinking, and behavioral skills needed to achieve academic and social success. The EHDI programs are serving a critical need in a successful manner. 
   Today, I call upon Congress to continue the success that has been experienced since the year 2000 and enact legislation to reauthorize EHDI programs. H.R. 1198 builds upon the EHDI authorization from the year 2000 to address areas of continuing challenge. 
   First, it would provide authority to address those children who are falling through cracks and not receiving necessary care after a screening that shows they have potential hearing loss. 
   Second, it is clear that family-to-family support is critical in the first months after a child is identified with hearing loss. Excellent family-to-family support programs developed by state EHDI programs and other organizations are not yet wildly implemented. This legislation would provide the agency authority to support and disseminate such programs that are working for parents and their children. 
   Third, it is clear that more research and study is needed in the area of hearing detection and intervention.

   Finally, H.R. 1198 provides the agency the authority to address the shortage of trained health professionals and other personnel necessary to make certain that every child who is screened with a hearing problem gets access to appropriate interventions needed to succeed. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Again, I thank my cochairs on the caucus.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to take a lot of time since this is the sixth time this year that I have spoken on this legislation, twice in committee and now four times on the floor of this House. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Obey and to thank his staff for the good, solid work product that they have delivered. I have enjoyed our work together this year, and as I said before, this bill, the people's bill, is a thoughtful piece of legislation. 
   If Congress does not override the President's veto, I will look forward to working with the chairman to negotiate a good bill that can be enacted. If the veto is sustained, I would hope that all parties, the White House and both houses of Congress, will come together quickly and work in good faith to complete the appropriations process in a timely manner. 
   There is no good reason why we can't compromise this bill. In times past, people in this body of good faith have overcome differences far greater than we have tonight. 
   If the proposal is to split the difference, to reduce the amount of spending above the President's request by $11 billion, I would advise the President to take ``yes'' for an answer. 
   Let's go home for Thanksgiving, thank God for all the blessings that He has bestowed upon this country, and pray for wisdom and good sense, and come back and get our work done in December. 
   I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis).

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, I am proud to be here this evening to assist the chairman in the management of this important bill. I did not intend to take much time since I think over the last week we have said just about everything there is to be said. 
   I am pleased that we now have before us a straightforward Labor-HHS-Education conference report to review and consider. I would like to extend my appreciation to Chairman Obey and his capable staff for helping us to work our way through this bill and the development of this bill. He has been a great partner in the effort to put this bill together. I am pleased the Senate separated the Military Construction-Veterans bill from this conference report. 
   With respect to the Labor-HHS bill before us, it is a good bill and a fair compromise. It makes needed investment in our Nation's health care, infrastructure, supports our country's workforce and increases educational opportunity for America's kids. I intend to support it.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. I certainly would like to echo his sentiments regarding the time available to us to complete the bill and the ability of Members to get home. 
   Let me just offer a modest proposal. There is a unanimous consent request, but I just ask that the authors consider the possibility that there are four across-the-board cuts proposed for the bill different percentage amounts and there is 2 hours allocated for that debate. 
   Seemingly, 1 hour's worth of debate to determine whether or not there was a majority of votes in the Chamber to cut this bill across the board by 0.25 percent or 4.6 percent, seemingly 1 hour would be enough time to debate as opposed to 2. So that decision has been made, but as the chairman suggested, people may think differently as we move on through the debate about the possibility of spending less time debating those same issues.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for bringing this amendment. 
   There were a couple of things that were said in the debate that I just want to try to get a little clarity on. 
   I served here in the late 1990s, and I recall that Republicans, as the majority party, passed a balanced budget in 1997. In 1998, we had our first balanced budget. Now, President Clinton was President at the time, but I believe I heard someone on the other side say President Clinton left the country with a $5.6 trillion surplus. I think they're mistaken. I think what they meant to say is President Clinton left the United States Government with a $5.6 trillion debt. 
   Now, that debt has increased, but the fact is that when we were in the majority party, for the first time since the 1940s, we produced a balanced budget. The President does not have the power of the purse; the Congress does. We created that surplus. We created the balanced budgets, and there was no surplus left at the end of the Clinton administration. We actually paid down the debt about a half trillion dollars, about $500 billion. That was good work. 
   Things changed pretty dramatically in 2001 when our Nation was attacked. We went to war, we had a recession, and the dot-com bubble burst. 
   But we produced that surplus. We produced those balanced budgets. Not the President of the United States. The Congress. That's where the power of the purse resides.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, a lot is being said, a lot of numbers are being thrown around, a lot of claims are being made, even claims that facts are facts. And I just wanted to clarify a point that my good friend from New York made, and that is that this bill saves $1.5 billion over last year. I don't understand that statement because last year we spent $144.7 billion in budget authority, enacted, and this year it is $151 billion, so almost $8 billion more than last year. 
   So the facts, I think, need to be checked. Let's try to be accurate. Everybody wants to thump their chest and say what a great party they have. But the facts are we are spending $8 billion this year more than last if this bill passes. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   For my part, it was a great experience going through this 5 months with you. It was a lot of work. I think I speak for the staff as well when I say we are all pretty tired from all the work that we have done. And, of course, they had to put together a continuing resolution and a supplemental to boot. So I know I join the chairman in thanking the staff for the remarkable work that they have done, both sides of the aisle. These are professional people who obviously care about the issues, but they are not as concerned about the partisan aspects of this as we are. 
   When the chairman talked about our experience here together, we combined about 57 years of experience here in the Congress. Most of that side falls on his watch and not mine, but I am getting up there too. And it is great to be able to work with someone who has the command of these issues that he does. And I remember asking him, and I have said this a couple of times, Why on God's green Earth would you want to be chairman of the full committee and the subcommittee also? And he said, Because the subcommittee issues are the issues I came here for 38 years ago. And he is making a mark on them today. 
   There has been some partisan back-and-forth here, which is as it should be. The Founding Fathers wanted us to have a clash of ideas.

   Mr. WALSH of New York. They wanted us to have the contest of ideas here. The fight should be over words and ideas and not with swords and other weaponry. 
   But mostly what we have done is we have found what we disagree on and talked about it. But overall, overwhelmingly, both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, agree that the issues in this bill are priorities for the Nation. Maybe we think we should spend 5 percent less or they think they should spend 5 percent more, and I don't want to discount the differences. There are big differences between the two parties. And I am very proud that our party on our watch did balance the Federal budget, did produce surpluses before a crisis of international proportions affected us in 2001. 
   But suffice to say, I have great respect for the gentleman from Wisconsin. Over the years he has made me as mad as anyone else because sometimes his arguments are just too good to argue with. 
   So let me just end by thanking him for honoring our requests. I think we worked out a pretty good bill here, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALSH of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution formalizing this body's resolve to support and protect the men and women in the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and disapproving of President Bush's decision to deploy 20,000+ additional combat troops to Iraq. 
   Like the overwhelming majority of my colleagues in the House and Senate, in 2002 I voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq should the President deem such force necessary.  
   Since then, the men and women of our Armed Services have carried out their mission with great courage and bravery, and they successfully achieved every military objective we set forth. 
   They removed a tyrannical, oppressive dictator who brutally slaughtered his own people, including innocent women and children. 
   They rebuilt schools and replaced a crumbling infrastructure. 
   And they provided security for the Iraqi people to successfully conduct interim elections, to write a new constitution, and to democratically elect and install new national leadership. 
   The remaining objectives articulated at the outset--conflict resolution between Sunnis and Shiites and national peace and stabilization--can only be achieved for the Iraqis, by the Iraqis. Their success will take personal will and political compromise from all domestic parties involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, success in Iraq today requires a political solution, not a military one. Twenty thousand more armed American men and women on the ground in Iraq will not change the determination or alter the strategy of the warring factions and militants our troops now face. 
   The addition of more American forces will certainly not encourage the Iraqi Forces to take responsibility for their nation's security. This premise never became clearer than when GEN. John Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more and from taking more responsibility for their own future.'' 
   He continued, ``I've met with every divisional commander--General Casey, the corps commander, General Dempsey--we all talked together. And I said, `in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in more American troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq?' And they all said no.'' 
   Today's U.S. military role in Iraq should be to assist in support and training initiatives, not to lead the charge. We must remember that this democracy does not belong to us, but to the Iraqi people who are responsible for protecting and enhancing it. 
   If an increase of troops is needed to stabilize specific regions, those troops ought to be Iraqi troops. At last count there were 325,000 trained, equipped and fielded Iraqi Security Forces. At some point in time, these Iraqi Forces have to lead security efforts. 
   What better time than now? What better opportunity could there be for the Iraqis to manifest their national pride and commitment to democracy by concrete actions? The Iraqis are ready and the U.S. needs to stop enabling their dependence. 
   Recently, the 174th Fighter Wing of the New York Air National Guard based in my hometown of Syracuse returned from a support tour in Iraq, and I'm proud that a young member of my staff deployed with them. Dozens of other young men and women from New York's 25th Congressional District have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am deeply proud of them and their remarkable service to our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as a member of the greatest deliberative body in the greatest representative democracy in the world. We are the people's House. We are all elected--chosen--every two years by citizens across this land to converge here in Washington to represent them, to vote on their behalf, and to ensure that their voices are heard in every national debate. And as Members of Congress we do so with a unique balance of personal belief and public will. 
   The President is the Commander in Chief. That is a fact. But he is not the sole decider. We--the other elected leaders of our government--have a responsibility to express the will of the American people as we perceive it. 
   The people of my New York district overwhelmingly supported this mission at its start, as did I. We still support its goals. We will always support our troops. But we do not support the continued build up of U.S. troops in Iraq. 
   This resolution states the House's disagreement with the President on this strategy, and I support this 97-word resolution before us. But I also say today clearly and without equivocation that I will not support any proposal to cut funding to our troops while they are in harm's way. 
   America has kept her promises to the people of Iraq. Over 3,000 American soldiers have given their lives to ensure those promises were kept, and their families now go forward with a constant reminder of the price of their sacrifice. 
   This resolution confronts the reality that there are defined military objectives, defined diplomatic objectives, and defined political objectives that can only be achieved by a sovereign and selfsustaining people. 
   This resolution, ultimately, is about the role and the responsibility of the Iraqi people. This resolution does not call for us to step out--American troops there need to remain and take on a different role. Rather, this resolution calls for Iraq to step up. 
   For that reason, it has my support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALSH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Washington for yielding me the time. 
   I am very disappointed. After the disappointment of moving to minority in the year 2007, I took some solace in the fact that the three highest elected Democratic leaders are all members of the Appropriations Committee, and I thought that they would work the will of the committee within the committee. 
   I am disappointed that in my last year as a member of the Appropriations Committee this majority has not seen fit to bring one regular spending bill before the House of Representatives. 
   It is no secret that I do not always agree with the current President on spending levels, but even if I did, he is brought into the process only after we complete our work. He has been a primary consideration throughout this process, and that's why we haven't worked our will. 
   In short, we gave up a fight without a fight, and that disappoints me, and that should disappoint those we represent. 
   We gave up without letting the Appropriations Committee work its will, without letting the membership of the House work its will. 
   The Senate is the Senate. We have no control over what happens or, more likely, what doesn't happen over there, but we do have control over whether or not the House gets its job done, and quite frankly, that did not happen this year. 
   So here we are, punting on second down. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I must say that as I reflect on my 20 years here, 16 of those on the Appropriations Committee, 12 of those as a subcommittee Chair on this, I believe, the greatest committee of the House of Representatives, there's been much more satisfaction than disappointment. 
   As this is probably the last time I will address this body on a pending appropriations bill, I respectfully ask my Chair and the members of the committee to in the future restore regular order and protect the prerogatives of this committee. It is of signal importance to the Congress that the Appropriations Committee perform its will.

   I am disappointed that in my last year as a member of the Appropriations Committee, this majority has seen fit to bring just one regular spending bill before the House.

   The Senate is the Senate and we have no control over what happens--or more likely, doesn't happen there. But we do have control over whether or not the House gets its job done, and quite frankly, that did not happen this year. 
   So here we are, punting on what is the equivalent of a second down. I regret that. 
   Having said that, reflecting on twenty years here in the Congress, sixteen on the Appropriations Committee, and twelve as a subcommittee chair, there has been far more satisfaction than disappointment. 
   Since this is probably the last time I'll address the Congress on a pending Appropriations bill, I would respectfully request that the  Committee Chair and Appropriations Committee members return to regular order and fiercely protect the prerogatives of this great committee.
