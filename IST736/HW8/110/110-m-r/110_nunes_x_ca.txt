<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to go to the Rules Committee the other evening. Of course it was after the distinguished Rules Committee chairwoman said that they weren't going to accept any of our amendments or a substitute. I made a comment at that point that I was essentially wasting my time in the committee, which is unfortunate. 
   Today we have an opportunity to debate in front of the American people what should be an important policy about energy independence, but this bill doesn't do anything like that, Mr. Speaker. All this bill does is get back at the oil companies. We had many members of the Rules Committee say essentially that it was vengeance. They didn't use the word ``vengeance,'' but essentially I believe that that was the point that they were making because they are putting up a facade that this bill actually does something to lower energy prices to the American people. In fact, all this does is roll back some tax cuts, specifically takes out oil and gas for domestic producers, does nothing to the Middle East producers, and now we are basically going to be left with a bill that isn't going to go anywhere. The majority knows it is not going to go anywhere, and that doesn't even include the process that we have gone through to get this legislation. 
   Earlier one of the speakers--I forget who said it--for the majority side said that the Republicans crafted their energy bills in the backrooms. Well, I would ask the majority if the backrooms included the subcommittees and the full committees, like the normal process that this Congress is supposed to go through where we have full committee debate, we have a bill introduced, we have debate on the bills.  Maybe that was the backrooms that you guys were referring to on the other side. 
   In this case, you essentially had a few staff people in the Speaker's office write up a bill. Then they put out a facade that this is going to lower the gas prices to Americans and lower energy costs and be the bridge to the next renewable energy trust fund that they are going to create. 
   It is interesting in the last Congress we had a bipartisan bill that did put money into a trust fund, but you know what we did? We went out and I said, let's take our resources that we have, like in Alaska, let's go and drill in ANWR. Let's put those royalties into a trust fund, and then we can bridge ourselves into the next generation of energy. That is good energy policy. Taxing small domestic oil producers in America is only hurting American-made energy. 
   I am frustrated not only by the policy that has been put out here as an end-all-be-all perfect solution to America's energy solutions, which it is not, but I am even more frustrated--and I normally don't come down here to speak on rules, but I had to come down here and speak on this rule because I was in the Rules Committee the other night and I wasted my time, and everyone in that committee wasted their time because the Rules Committee chairwoman said, before we even met, that she was not going to accept any amendments or even a substitute. 
   This is frustrating. I hope that the majority will live up to their promise to the American people and will have full open and honest debate.

   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, would it be correct if I asked about the long title of this bill? Is the long title of this bill, to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in alternative energy?

   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to confirm the long title, because it appears today that we are talking about this bill being about energy independence. And earlier, during the rule debate, it was brought up by the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, who referred to the process that was used under the last Congress, referring to Mr. Dreier's process, as being dishonest. 
   Mr. Speaker, this whole process that we are going through today is about dishonesty, and I want to be clear that I am talking about the process. This is unacceptable to me. Because if this is about energy independence, this bill we are going to pass today, then why is there this quote this morning in the Wall Street Journal, and I will read the quote. ``Tomorrow we finish our 100 hours and I will talk about what comes next. And included in that is energy independence.'' 
   Ms. Pelosi made this statement in the Wall Street Journal this morning. So are we debating today about energy independence? We are going to pass this bill about energy independence, or is this going to be something that we are going to do after this? If so, then something about this process is dishonest. I don't know if this bill is about energy independence or, as the Speaker said, in the future we are going to talk about energy independence. I thought this bill was about energy independence. 
   So I hope for the rest of this debate that the majority will clarify this, because I don't understand what this is about. And we have had a lot of strong words stated during the rules debate about dishonesty in the process, and I am thoroughly confused as to who is right. Are we doing energy independence today or are we going to do that tomorrow, as the Speaker said?

   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, it is evident in the Democrats' energy bill, to gain and achieve energy independence they are not using any coal in this country. And I hope that the majority party from the Resources Committee can answer at some point during this debate why clean coal and coal-to-liquid technology is not included as a possibility to achieve energy independence. That question needs to be answered before the American people on the House floor before this debate ends.

   The longer that we continue to blame the White House, the longer that we continue to blame the oil companies, the longer that we continue to blame everyone else but ourselves--we ourselves are to blame; we should look in the mirror. This Congress should take dramatic steps to open up supply that would bridge ourselves to the next generation of energy, Madam Speaker. That's what we should be doing here today. 
   The American people aren't going to buy these arguments, but they are going to continue to be buying $5 gas until we decide, as a Congress, to do something about it.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, our economy has slowed to a crawl and American workers are worried about their jobs. These conditions are clear arguments for action by our government, and action should be taken. 
   The question each of us needs to ask ourselves is whether or not the Paulson plan is the best course of action. In my view, it's not. I made no secret of my frustration and disapproval for the sense of panic instilled upon the public by Wall Street insiders and some of our Nation's elected leaders. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not a time for panic; it's a time for leadership and it's a time for deliberation. Congress must not be confined to a timetable dictated by alarmists who see the government money as their only backstop again, irresponsible lending. Investors take risks, sometimes the risks they take are reckless. Taxpayers must not be liable for Wall Street risk-taking. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people do not accept the allegation that we have only two alternatives before us: passage of this bill or another Great Depression. There are other options if congressional leaders had the courage to allow this democracy to function. We could debate these issues. 
   We need to make certain that our Nation's lending institutions are the strongest in the world and that our constituents have confidence that they have a safe place to put their money. One way to accomplish this is to let the Fed purchase preferred shares with warrants. This would infuse capital into the market, freeing up banks to make loans and extend credit. 
   The plan that I and others have proposed to this Congress is in sharp contrast to the Paulson plan and offers real protection to the taxpayer. Why do we need to give $700 billion to one man to play hedge fund god from the gilded offices of the United States Treasury? If the Secretary wants to run a hedge fund, he should go back to Wall Street. 
   This Congress must not hand over such an enormous amount of money; it is simply wrong. It's irresponsible. Listen to all the pundits, all the financial wizards, the holier-than-thou capitalists from our Nation's leading institutions; they sound like they belong to the Soviet Politburo. When the markets are riding high, they want us to leave them alone. When the market crashed, they want to us nationalize their debt. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' However, if this bill passes, it is my hope that the administration will focus first on shoring up our Nation's lending institutions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to express my support for H.R. 3022, the Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness Act. I would also like to thank my good friend Mr. Costa and Senator Boxer for their willingness to work in a bipartisan manner to secure protections for my constituents. 
   When the idea of this designation was proposed, my constituents had three main concerns: Specifically, continued access to the hydroelectric facilities in the area; continued access for private and commercial horse stock users; and, finally, the cabin owners in the Mineral King and Silver City area needed assurances that they will continue to have access to their cabins in accordance with their Park Service permits. In each case, Congressman Costa and Senator Boxer agreed to add language to the bill that would resolve these concerns. 
   First the cabin owners were provided a half-mile buffer zone around the cabins in order to ensure that management of the wilderness does not impact their access to and their maintenance of the cabins. 
   Second, operators of the hydroelectric facilities were ensured they will continue to have access to their facilities to conduct maintenance and inspections as necessary. They will continue to be allowed motorized access, including helicopters, if non-motorized access is not reasonably feasible.  
   Finally, the private and commercial horse stock users were provided strong assurances that nothing in the act precludes access to the areas that are designated wilderness. There have been recurring problems with such access to surrounding wilderness areas, and the language in this bill intends to ensure that those issues will not be repeated in this wilderness. 
   Again, these were hard-fought protections, and the work of my colleagues during the drafting period was invaluable and much appreciated. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to my colleague Mr. Costa and would appreciate any comments he may have about these specific provisions that I mentioned.

Hopefully this wilderness bill ends up being something that is really done in a bipartisan manner, that after it is passed is also enacted in such a way that ensures use by all of our constituents, because really these are America's parks and resources and we want to make sure that access is granted to those that want it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think it is appropriate that the Congress continues to do their work, Mr. Speaker. But one of the problems that the Republicans have on this side of the aisle is that consumers are now paying upwards of $5 per gallon for gas in California and we want to make sure that the Republicans take our time to come to the House floor to make sure that we convey to the American people that the Republicans do have a plan, and part of that plan deals with drilling on Federal lands. 
   Although a lot of these bills that are coming to the floor deal with wilderness that may or may not have oil and gas exploration possibilities, like, for example, the bill that was just passed before the Congress that was in my district, there is no oil and gas in that area, this wilderness area I am not sure about. So I do have some concerns about this legislation, because I don't know this part of New Mexico, if there is oil and gas available. 
   I am concerned, because as we put this into a wilderness area, this is another area of America that will then be off-limits for drilling for oil or gas, and, like I said, at a time when Americans are paying $5 per gallon in some parts of the country, this is a big problem for the Republicans. 
   With that, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I think the issue here is really not about what is available for exploration and the amount of wells that have been able to be drilled on what's been allowed for exploration. The key here, as most people know, is that there is literally hundreds of billions of barrels of oil that is totally off-limits for us to research. 
   I know that my friend from California is part of the solution, because he is one of the few Members of the Democrat Caucus that actually believes in drilling for oil. I know that he agrees with drilling in Alaska, and he agrees with drilling in the gulf and other places where we have tremendous resources of oil. 
   So really the key here, like Mr. Westmoreland said earlier, is we need to have open time here on the floor with bills that come to the floor with open rules so that we can allow the majority to govern, meaning the majority of Members, not just one party. 
   The longer that the Democrats continue to take bills up to the Rules Committee and send them down here to the floor to where we have no chance to offer amendments, we never have an opportunity to increase exploration. I believe that the American people, now that gas is soon to be $5 a gallon, that the American people have had enough of us buying all of our oil from the Middle East and South America and Africa. They have had enough. They are fed up with it. 
   One-third of our trade balance is basically because of the money that we send out of this country for importing oil. What I am hoping to get back to is some reasonable common sense here in the Congress to where Republicans and Democrats can work together and build a majority that will allow drilling in our own country, because I believe that's what the American people are asking for. 
   Until the Speaker of the House and the rest of the leadership decide that they want to let the majority rule, a majority of Members of Congress and not just one party, we are going to continue to pay high prices at the pump. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for as much time as he may consume.

   Mr. NUNES. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   The key here, Mr. Speaker, is that 86 percent of our Federal lands are off-use for drilling. What we have to really recognize in this country is that we have to quit blaming people and have to start, in my opinion, place the blame on ourselves. It's not a Democrat problem; it's not a Republican problem. It's the whole Congress itself that's the problem, because for decades now, we haven't been able to open up the Federal lands for drilling for oil. And there's a lot of us in this body who believe that what we ought to do is open up these areas for drilling, but, instead of using that tax revenue to go to pay for a lot of the things that we waste money here in Washington on, but instead take that tax revenue and invest it into the next generation of energy. That's what we're attempting to do on the Republican side of the aisle. 
   We actually, I've worked with, including Mr. Costa and other Democrats, to develop bipartisan legislation that would, in fact, open these areas up for drilling, and then basically make the largest investment in American-made energy in our Nation's history. And that's how we move from fossil fuels to the next generation of clean and renewable energy. 
   Today a half a percent of our total energy is produced from solar and wind power; and so to think that we're going to go from a half a percent anywhere close to the energy needs that we need, it's not possible at this time, Mr. Speaker, and we need to be honest with the American people about what really is the problem, why don't we have an abundant energy availability in this country? Why are we exporting so many dollars overseas? 
   And the longer that we sit around and blame oil companies or blame OPEC or blame speculators, quite frankly, the longer it is the American people are going to be paying $5 per gallon per gas, as they are in California, or possibly even higher. 
   What I'd like to see us do, Mr. Speaker, I said this earlier, bringing bills to the floor that are not only wilderness bills but would actually open up large vast areas for drilling, and not only bringing these bills to the floor, but bringing them up in a way where they  don't come to the floor with a closed rule, where the Republicans can't offer any of their alternatives. Because, essentially, what's happening is that a majority of this Congress, I believe, both Republicans and Democrats, would vote to open up for drilling in this country. They would vote for that. We'd probably get 230, 240 votes, I would think. Because a lot of the folks that were elected last year, that helped put the Democrats in the majority, they ran on a pro-drilling platform. The problem is that we have to allow those people that were elected here, the new Members to this body, to have a chance, under an open rule, to vote on things that will really make substantial impacts for the American people. 
   And I believe that if we have open rules in this Congress, where we bring bills to the floor that we can actually vote on, the majority will rule, and it would be a majority of Republicans and Democrats working together to open up our energy resources in this country so that we can begin to rely on American-made energy, and not continuing to export so many dollars outside of this country, which is, in my opinion, one of the most irresponsible things that this Congress has done for decades. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity over the weekend to meet with several legislators from Mexico. And a couple of the legislators asked me--they were very confused as to why the United States is asking Mexico to produce more oil because one of the legislators said, Well, don't you have more oil in your country than we do? And why don't you use your own oil in your own country? We will gladly sell it to you, especially at $140 a barrel, but we don't understand why your government doesn't allow for your own companies to drill for oil in your own country. 
   Now, if the Mexican legislature has figured that out, you would think that our legislature and our Congress could figure that out. 
   And so if we really want to end our reliance on foreign oil, it's very simple. There's two major ways to do it: You can drill for oil and gas in our own country on the 86 percent of the Federal lands that are off-limits to our use, that's one way; and the second way is to build nuclear power plants. 
   If we don't get serious about those two options, Mr. Speaker, we're going to continue to pay higher prices for gas and oil, and we're also going to continue to pay higher prices for electricity. 
   If we continue to make excuses, as people in this body have done for decades, decades this has been happening, we're going to continue to pay higher prices for fuel. I think it's time that we get serious about this in this Congress, we pass meaningful legislation that opens up our own areas for drilling for gas and oil so that we quit buying gas and oil from the likes of the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria, places that are, quite frankly, hostile in most cases towards our country, and we start to buy energy in our own country, drill for oil in our own country, create American-made energy, create American jobs. And then as we begin to put that revenue into solar and wind and future technologies that are going to allow for the next generation of energy to come on line, that, coupled with nuclear power, we can solve our Nation's energy problems. 
   But if we continue to allow the Democrat majority to place blame on oil companies, place blame on OPEC, place blame on any everyone else but themselves, we're going to pay high prices at the pump. 
   So I want to thank the gentleman, my good friend from California, for allowing us this opportunity to express our thoughts on this, the current energy situation, and on the wilderness areas that we're creating today in these bills.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AZOREAN REFUGEE ACT OF 1958 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by taking us back 50 years ago, to the islands of the Azores, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, the peaceful communities of these islands relied on each other to maintain their livelihood, and the mainly agrarian lifestyles of its peoples were sustained by this interconnectedness. Then, in 1957, a tragic and unexpected turn of events, brought about by a natural disaster, severely destabilized the lives of these proud and hardworking people. 
   It was September 27, 1957, when the island of Faial experienced a series of volcanic eruptions that lasted for over a year and immediately shattered its economic infrastructure. In its aftermath, the Capelinhos volcano left behind overwhelming material, physical and psychological damage. 
   The cohesive Portuguese communities already present in the United States at the time rallied behind the victims of this volcano, and unified into a great movement that called for special quotas to allow these victims into the United States. In 1958, in great part resulting from these efforts, Senator John Pastore from Rhode Island introduced S. 3942, the Azorean Refugee Act. This bill proposed the issuance of 1,500 non-quota visas to the Faial victims, providing relief in face of such devastating tragedy. Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy cosponsored this bill, and along with Senator Pastore, became one of the leading proponents of this legislation. Their efforts finally materialized on August 18, 1958, when the Azorean Refugee Act was finally signed into law, becoming Public Law 85-892. 
   By November of 1959, the 1,500 special quota visas allowed by the Azorean Refugee Act had already been issued, with more than 3,000 persons from Faial having already immigrated to United States. With the rippling effects of the Capelinhos volcano still being felt in the Azores, the number of visas was elevated to 2,000 in 1960, and then in 1961, a new law permitted the entrance for 2,500 additional Azorean refugees. In total, more then 5,000 visas were issued, effectively shifting the formerly restrictive immigration laws of our country. 
   The Portuguese community's push to liberalize our immigration policies transformed this Act into one of the most important special laws in our history. In this sense, it was the most important contribution of the Portuguese-American community to the eventual reform of American immigration policy in 1965. As a direct result of the Azorean Refugee Act, the United States Government began to liberalize its immigration laws, and around 25,000 Portuguese citizens eventually immigrated to this country. This law revitalized the long history of Portuguese immigration to the United States, and once again, allowed our great Nation to benefit from the many qualities these people had to offer. 
   The immigrants arriving from the Azores reached the shores of the United States as manual laborers, and without much proper education they relied solely on the fruits of their hard work to earn their living. Portuguese immigrants distinguished themselves in farming, fishing, and other trades, and built for this Nation a solid foundation of honesty and pride in their work. Subsequent generations have rested upon this heritage to succeed in our society, with a great many Portuguese-American communities producing professors, lawyers, physicians, judges, politicians and other leading figures of our society. 
   Fifty years later, the admirable successes of Portuguese-American communities throughout California, New England, and elsewhere are a testament to their remarkable work ethic and integrity, which truly inspire us all. Their story is one of sweat, toils, and struggles before a new land, and in itself reflects the very spirit o$ this nation. 
   For all of that, this resolution recognizes the great importance, of the Azorean Refugee Act, and the vast contributions made by these Azorean communities, who truly turned tragedy into triumph. Let us never forget that America's strength rests on the inclusion of people from all parts of the world and in the generosity that flows from our ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. Ninety-six percent of our energy comes from nuclear, oil and coal in this country. Only 4 percent comes from solar and wind. And I am very supportive of creating more energy by wind, creating more energy by using solar panels, but the problem, Mr. Speaker, is that this is not going to solve our problems. 
   We've heard many Members talk about the price of oil here today. When the price of oil is $100 a barrel, it's because there's not enough oil on the market to meet the demand, largely because we have refused in this country to drill for oil anywhere. We've barred the east coast, the coast of Florida. We even have Cuba now coming in and drilling off the coast of Florida. In California, we don't drill there for oil anymore. And even to go as far as Alaska, the northern slope of Alaska where we have an oil reserve there, we won't even drill for oil in Alaska. So when you talk about having $100 a barrel oil, it's because we refuse to drill for oil, and we rely on oil from other countries to meet our growing demand. 
   When you look at the problems here that this bill creates, it's taking away tax subsidies to oil companies. But what it does is it only hits the top five oil companies, and you leave out one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and that's the oil company called CITGO which is owned by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 
   If you really wanted to tax the oil companies, you ought to tax all of the oil companies, not just tax our domestic companies that, quite frankly, puts us at a disadvantage to those that produce oil in the Middle East and Venezuela and everywhere else. 
   And so if we're going to look at real energy policy here, more solar, more  wind, that's all great, but, folks, we're going to rely on oil, nuclear power and coal power in this country for a very long time. I think this Congress has a responsibility to the American people to lower the cost of energy that the American consumer uses, and this bill doesn't do it. 
   So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5351, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I have heard several Members come down to the floor and talk about FISA and talk about this is not part of the bill; we are supposed to be here to debate energy. In fact, what the gentleman from Florida is talking about is that we have a responsibility here in the Congress to protect the American people, and our military commanders say we need this, this FISA extended, a permanent extension, so that we can continue to watch over terrorists that are trying to call in and out of our country. This is imperative that we get this done. 
   And so when you start to look at what are we doing here today talking about this energy bill, well, this is once again one of these energy bills where we are just going to tax the American consumer. We are going to tax domestic oil producers. And this bill has no chance to make it through the Senate. This bill has no chance to become law. So why would we be here today when we are on day 11, as Mr. Hoekstra said earlier, we are day 11 where we have not been able to surveil terrorists that are trying to call in and out of this country, but instead we are debating an energy bill that taxes domestic oil producers, taxes big oil companies, and leaves a glaring loophole so that Hugo Chavez's CITGO still continues to get tax breaks. 
   So I can understand if some of the Democrats want to tax Exxon and the big oil companies. They don't like oil. They don't want to use oil. They want to raise the oil prices of the American consumer. But why, why would you give tax breaks to Hugo Chavez? That I cannot understand. We need to get off of this bogus debate on taxing oil companies, and we need to get back on to protecting the American people and bring up this FISA bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (CONGRATULATING 2008 NCAA BASEBALL CHAMPION FRESNO STATE BULLDOGS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Costa and Mr. Radanovich. Mr. Costa, of course, is a very proud alum of Fresno State so he's very excited for this day, and I want to thank them both for their help on passage of this important legislation. 
   I rise today to congratulate my hometown baseball team, the Fresno State Bulldogs, who entered the College World Series as underdogs and against all odds succeeded in clinching the championship title. The Fresno State baseball program has had a successful history since its inception in 1922. Bulldog baseball boasts five titles, three WAC championships, 30 NCAA tournament appearances and four appearances in the College World Series. The program has produced excellent Major League Baseball players throughout their 86-year history and many other student athletes that excel both on and off the field. 
   The story of the Fresno State Bulldogs in the College World Series is one of outstanding achievement. 
   With sweat and guts, the Bulldogs won the WAC tournament merely to qualify for the College World Series Their performance at the national championship not only proved that they belonged in this elite tournament, but also left no doubt they were the best team in the Nation. 
   Without regard for the doubters and the critics, Fresno State baseball exhibited an uncompromising commitment to success, which is truly characteristic of this university. Challenge after challenge, they pulled through in the face of adversity and achieved the greatest victory in the school's history. 
   During their outstanding run at the 2008 College World Series, the Fresno State Bulldogs broke a series of records. They were the only team in College World Series history to score more than 17 runs in two separate games. The team also set records for the most home runs, most extra-base hits, most runs batted in, and most total bases in a championship game. Fresno State was the lowest seeded team to ever to win the College World Series, and this championship victory marks the highest achievement of the program in its entire history. 
   While they excelled as a team, some were also recognized for their exceptional individual performances. Fresno State player Tommy Mendonca was chosen as the Most Valuable Player, Most Outstanding Player in the College World Series, and was selected for the U.S.A. Baseball National Team. Coach Mike Batesole received the Coach of the Year award for the second time in his career. Many other outstanding performances are highlighted in this resolution. 
   The accomplishment of this team has filled the community with the utmost sense of pride. As underdogs, Fresno State overcame all the odds and achieved the much-deserved title of champions of the College World Series. Congratulations to the Fresno State Bulldogs for the tremendous achievement.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (HUBBARD ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Before I share with you the reason I wrote this legislation, I think it's important to remind everyone why sole survivors are afforded unique status in our military. 
   Prior to 1942, it was not uncommon for family members to serve together in the military, even in the same unit. However, a World War II tragedy during the naval battle at Guadalcanal would cause the War Department to rethink its policy. That tragedy involved the death of all five Sullivan brothers, who were serving together aboard the USS Juneau when it was sunk in 1942. 
   The death of the Sullivans prompted changes intended to protect families from the heartache of losing an entire generation to war. One key reform is the policy requiring sole survivors to be removed from combat. It is this rule, known as the Sole Survivor Policy, that Tom Hanks dramatized in his movie Saving Private Ryan. Since 9/11, there have been 51 sole survivors identified by the Department of Defense. Each of them has a unique story of service and sacrifice. 
   The events that shaped why we are here today began in November 2004 when a roadside bomb in Iraq killed Marine Lance Corporal Jared Hubbard. It is hard for anyone, myself included, to understand the anguish of losing a son or a daughter to war. The Hubbards bore their grief with amazing strength, and with the help of family and friends, they buried their son. Jared's patriotism and sacrifice inspired everyone who knew him, and although his loss is very real, his presence was not lost. Both of his brothers, Nathan and Jason, soon joined the Army. When asked why they chose to serve, both men responded that they wanted to honor their brother and wanted to continue his service to our Nation. 
   Late last year, Jason and Nathan were returning from a night scouting mission in separate Blackhawk helicopters when Nathan's helicopter crashed. Jason's Blackhawk landed with orders to secure the crash site. However, there were no survivors. Nathan had been killed in the crash. 
   Nathan's death resulted in Jason Hubbard's designation as a sole survivor. He was removed from combat duty, and was assigned to the solemn duty of accompanying his brother's body home for a second funeral in 3 years. Unfortunately, the tragedy does not end here. 
   When Jason voluntarily separated from the Army under the Sole Survivor Policy, he was asked to pay back his enlistment bonus.     
   He was denied transitional health care, and was told that he could not receive GI Bill benefits, the reason: ``He did not fulfill the commitment outlined in his contract.'' This response was clearly not what Jason expected. And I don't think there is anyone in this Nation who would argue that the Hubbards had failed in their commitment to our Nation.  
   Jason lost two brothers to war. He served honorably in the United States Army and discharged as a sole survivor only after being removed from combat under the Army's own rules. The challenges he faced were unjust. When Army Secretary Pete Geren learned of Jason's situation, he intervened to the extent he was able. However, we discovered statutory constraints that limited what the Secretary of the Army could do. The legislation before us today resolves those statutory issues, and for the first time recognizes sole survivors through an act of Congress. 
   The Hubbard Act will provide benefits already offered to other soldiers who honorably separate from military service. This means that sole survivors will not be forced to repay their enlistment bonus, they will be able to participate in the current and new GI Bill educational program, they will receive separation pay, and they will continue to be afforded transitional health care coverage. 
   As I conclude, I would like to thank my friends, Mr. Costa and Mr. Cardoza; both were instrumental in building support for this legislation. Furthermore, I would like to thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Chambliss for championing the Hubbard Act in the Senate, and of course Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery and, of course, Mr. Kind for their willingness to provide the offset for this bill. Their support, and the support of the 311 cosponsors, is very much appreciated. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And really, this is a piece of legislation that we hope will move as quickly as possible to the Senate floor so that the President can sign this bill into law. As has been outlined by all the speakers tonight, this is a sad moment, but it's really a wrong that needs to be made right. And I'm proud tonight that we will pass this, hopefully unanimously, by this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this intellectually dishonest resolution. I do so in order to challenge the majority party to put their legislating where their mouths have been. The endless criticism to the war in Iraq is clouded by political opportunism and has done little or nothing to improve our chances of victory. 
   We need an honest debate. We need answers from those who support this resolution. What is next? What is your plan? It should come as no surprise that the resolution we are debating today says very little. There are less than 100 words. And while the rhetoric has been flying during the debate, it seems to me that the new Democratic majority is hoping to avoid debate in which they might have to defend their plan in Iraq. 
   What we have here is nothing more than a political exercise, a nonbinding resolution, words with no meaning. Make no mistake, their opposition to the President's plan is political. There is no constructive criticism here. Read their resolution. 
   Iraq is the battleground, Madam Speaker, a key battleground against extremism, terrorism and the expansionist goals of our enemies.     
   If we fail, Iraq will be a hotbed of radical Islamic activity, a pivotal safe haven, a base from which to plan and fund attacks against us. 
   Madam Speaker, how is the danger associated with defeat in Iraq not clear? I ask my colleagues, what evidence do you need? Have you listened to the words of our enemies? Must we have more casualties in American cities before you accept the nature of this global threat? How quickly we forget, Madam Speaker. 
   I urge my colleagues to listen carefully to the words of Osama bin Laden. Last year, bin Laden said, ``Iraq is the focal point of the war on terror. The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War. It is raging in Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.'' Another one, ``Jihad against America will continue. Jihad against America will continue economically and militarily. By the grace of Allah, America is in retreat. But more attacks are required.'' 
   Madam Speaker, Osama bin Laden, as well as other Islamic extremists around the world, view the conflict in Iraq as the central battleground in their ideological struggle. 
   Make no mistake, we are at war, and it is about time that some of our members of our government figured it out. 
   Someday soon, the Representatives who are supporting this resolution will have to explain to the voters what they have done to make us safer at home and abroad. Since this resolution does nothing more than embolden our enemies, demoralize our troops, and send mixed messages to our allies, they will have a difficult task before them. 
   Today, unfortunately, we won't hear much about the Democrat plan for Iraq. We will, instead, hear a lot about failure and defeat. We might even hear a conspiracy theory or two. And, of course, we will hear a lot of political posturing. 
   But Madam Speaker, the American people deserve to know the truth. What happens next, Madam Speaker, to those who believe the President is wrong, to those who believe we rushed to war, to those who can't get beyond our national intelligence failures and, instead, persist on conspiracy theories? Tell us, what is next? What is your plan to protect the American people? 
   Madam Speaker, I demand answers from the authors of this resolution. The American people have a right to know. Is your plan to simply stand aside and allow an ideology of hate to consume the Middle East? 
   I implore my colleagues, if you won't heed the warnings of our military and intelligence organizations, listen to al Qaeda's own words. They are speaking directly to you. 
   This is from Deputy leader al-Zawahiri recently. ``I wish to talk to the Democrats in America. You aren't the ones who won the midterm elections, nor are the Republicans the ones who lost; rather, the Mujahadin are the ones who won and the American forces and their allies lost.'' 
   I ask my colleagues, how can you offer this resolution, knowing the enemy we face? Do you really have nothing to offer the American people but this? Is this resolution the best effort of the new Democrat majority in response to our challenge in Iraq? 
   Madam Speaker, we should have an honest debate about Iraq. And my friends who are convinced that the war is wrong need to be accountable for failing to say what is right. 
   In closing, I want to say how proud I am of the men and women who are fighting for our freedom and security all over the world. They don't deserve what we are doing to them today. This resolution is a sham. It is nothing more than political grandstanding, and it is feeding the propaganda machine of our enemy. 
   I have been to Iraq. I have seen the efforts of our soldiers firsthand. They want to win. They have seen the face of the enemy and I can assure you they are committed to winning. If you are committed to winning, vote ``no'' on this resolution

   Mr. NUNES. I was listening to your conversation on the floor. I want to reiterate what's going on outside. You made the point, but there are trucks driving through this Capitol right now trying to drive around to raise awareness to the people of the United States that the gas price is too high. And meanwhile today, we are debating a bill on beaches on the floor of the House while gas prices are soaring to $4 plus a gallon.     
   And so I thank the gentleman from Georgia for bringing this up and for yielding to me because this is something that we should be debating on the House floor. We should be talking about energy, not talking about how we're going to save the beaches.

<DOCNO>Mr. NUNES. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NUNES. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for bringing this issue up. And I know that the bill here today is this beaches bill, but the concern that I have is that we're not addressing the needs of the American people. 
   When the Democrats took the majority, we were told that we were going to go back to 5-day workweeks. Last week, we were in 3 days; we did two votes each day. This week, we've only done a couple votes each day. And here we are doing a bill that now I'm being told we're not even going to finish the bill today, a bill regarding beaches, while we have truckers going around the Capitol honking their horns, trying to get the attention of the United States Congress, to get the attention of the Democrat majority to do something about lowering their fuel price. 
   And the answers that we've received from the other side of the aisle are always the same answers: We need to repeal the tax breaks to the oil companies. Well, if we want to repeal the tax breaks to the oil companies, that's not going to lower the fuel price. As the gentleman from Alaska stated and the gentleman from Georgia stated previously, the way that you lower the fuel price and the way that you stop buying fuel from foreign countries is you have to drill in America. We have to drill for oil in America. 
   I'm a big supporter of solar energy and wind energy, they're great renewable fields, but we get less than 1 percent of our energy from these sources. So if we want to talk about renewable sources of energy, we're going to have to look seriously at nuclear power. We're going to have to look at using the oil that we have in this country if we don't want to buy oil from foreign countries. These are the types of things that we're going to have to do in this Congress. But unfortunately, we've made this commitment, supposedly, to the American people that we're going to work 5 days a week, but instead we only work a few hours a day and end up working 3 days a week. Today we have to get out of here by 4, I'm told, because the Democrats don't want to stay in so that they can get on an airplane and fly home. We're not even going to finish a bill on beaches. And meanwhile, the American people are outside this Congress driving their trucks, honking their horn, asking for the attention of this Congress, and this Congress is not paying attention. 
   We've got to do something to lower these fuel prices, Madam Chairman. The Democrats are in control, they're in the majority. We need answers. My constituents need answers. They need their fuel price lowered. They need their electricity cost lowered. The only way we can do this is by building nuclear power plants, investing in wind and solar power, and drilling for oil in America. 
   And I would hope, as the gentleman from Alaska has stated over and over again, the last time we've gotten serious about drilling for oil in Alaska was 1973. 1973. And here we are, 35 years later, with no more oil production. Now we used to have at least half of our oil came from the United States, now we're less than 30 percent of our oil that comes from the United States. 
   And we send money to Venezuela, we send money to Saudi Arabia, and the other side of the aisle complains about it. But their only answer is that we need to repeal the tax cuts to the oil companies. So in their last energy bill, what did we repeal? We picked the American companies. We repealed the tax breaks on the American companies and we gave tax breaks to the Venezuela oil companies. 
   So I don't know what we're going to do in this Democrat majority to solve the country's problems. President Bush has said that he will sign a bill to drill for oil in America. He will sign any bill that promotes nuclear power. These are the answers that the American people need and they should demand from this Congress to have those answers. 
   And I would hope, Madam Chairman, that this Democrat majority listens to the truckers that are outside right now honking their horn trying to get this Congress' attention. And I am happy that at least on our side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, we are taking this opportunity, during a bill that we're talking about beaches here, but we're trying to bring to the American people, to bring to the attention of this Congress that we need to lower the fuel price, and we need to do it today. 
   So with that, Madam Chairman, I will yield back the balance of my time.
