   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, Mr. McNulty. I will tell you what, you are a protector of our future with Social Security, and there is nothing in this bill, thanks to the Judiciary people on both sides, that changes the Social Security Act or the laws and rules governing the use of Federal appropriations. Therefore, the current prohibition on Social Security's use of its limitation on administrative expenses, known as LAE, on trust fund monies for non-program purposes, remains in effect. 
   Is that the understanding of the chairman?

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the chairman for his supportive efforts to protect the Social Security programs and beneficiaries. We all recognize E-Verify is an important tool. We have to balance that recognition with the needs of our seniors, those with disabilities and others who depend on Social Security for their basic needs.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Zoe Lofgren and Mr. Lamar Smith. Those two worked well with us on Social Security, and I rise today to support the bill and extend the E-Verify program. The extension is, unfortunately, the least we can do to provide a workable tool for employers who want to do the right thing and verify that their new employees are authorized to work in this country. Americans need real immigration reform. We need to protect our borders and make sure Americans are not fighting for jobs with people who are here illegally. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction. We have got a long way to go. I support a mandatory nationwide electronic verification system so we don't have a patchwork of conflicting State and local laws. Protecting Social Security is always the right thing to do, so as the ranking member on the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, I am pleased the bill includes provisions that ensure Social  Security and DHS agree on funding to support E-Verify. 
   However, I ask my colleagues, how long do we have to experiment with employment verification before Congress delivers a nationwide, mandatory, long-term solution that this country needs and the American people deserve? 
   Last February, I, along with several of my Ways and Means colleagues, introduced the New Employment Verification Act, or NEVA. Representative Giffords and I have been working together on this bill that builds on the success of E-Verify while addressing its challenges. 
   I hope everyone interested in this debate will take the opportunity to look at the information on this bill on my website. When it comes to immigration, the American people want, need and expect real solutions, and American employers need a first class system that helps them comply with the law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, I appreciate that. 
   Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the effort to straggle employee free choice. This bill will strip individual workers of their right to vote anonymously when deciding to be involved in a union or not. Taking away this privacy right will subject workers to coercion and abuse. 
   As the former chairman of the Employee-Employer Relations Subcommittee, I studied this issue for the last 6 years. And I want to tell you this bill will replace private ballot union elections with the interfere card check system. This means that a union could simply organize if a tiny majority of the workers sign a card. When truth be told, a worker might vote differently if given the option of the sacredly held practice of secret ballot. This would dramatically change the way small businesses operate, run from the outside by a union, and would have a devastating impact on the small business community. Card checks can be conducted so quickly that mom and pop employers rarely have a chance to address employees during an organizing campaign, resulting in a one-sided discussion between union and an employee. 
   This vote is a Democrat way of paying back the labor unions for bankrolling their win in November. Over $2 million to the top Democrats. 
   Small business owners are trying to live out the American Dream, which just so happens to be fueling our economy.     
   This bill forces them to do away with the longstanding freedom of voting by secret ballot. We can't let this happen to America.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this bill today, but I have got to make it clear that I do support children's health insurance. I believe this bill flat misses the mark. While well-intentioned, this legislation is a massive expansion of a government-run healthcare program that takes resources away from the very children it was meant to help. 
   As ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee on Ways and Means, I am deeply disturbed by the part of this bill that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to be covered under this program. In the last Congress, Republicans worked hard to ensure that everyone in this children's health program are really U.S. citizens. Because of that effort, States now require applicants to show documents like birth certificates, driver's licenses or passports in order to prove U.S. citizenship. 
   This new legislation weakens this standard. All applicants would simply be asked to provide a Social Security number and a name that would then be verified by the Social Security Administration. This process is ripe for massive fraud and abuse that will leave American tax dollars paying for healthcare for illegal immigrants. 
   In addition, we have the responsibility here in Congress to spend the taxpayer dollar wisely. I know my constituents don't want the Federal Government doling out billions of dollars to pay for illegal immigrants' health care. 
   Congress should just pass a responsible extension of this important program before it expires, not play politics with our kids' health care. Americans deserve, want, and need for our children to have good health care, and we need to do it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of National Save for Retirement Week that will be celebrated during the week of October 21 to 27 this year. 
   Our national savings rate is abysmal. Despite our best efforts, there are  fewer traditional pension plans every year. The costs associated with retiree health continue to skyrocket, and the Social Security and Medicare board of trustees have long warned us that without change, Social Security and Medicare will be unable to pay future promised benefits. However, there is one bright spot for Americans who have employer-based retirement savings plans. We all know and love the 401(k) plan and its cousins, the 403(b) and the 457. These plans make it possible for Americans to take charge of their own financial future by putting away savings for retirement in a convenient, safe and well-performing manner. 
   For far too many people, there is too much month left at the end of their paycheck and they just don't get around to putting away money for their own retirement. With a 401(k) plan, the money for retirement is set aside before the other bills get paid. The paycheck that they bring home is then available for life's daily needs, while the money for retirement is going to work with compound interest. You know, Einstein said the most powerful force on Earth is the power of compound interest. For Americans who set aside part of their paycheck for a 401(k), the power of compound interest helps them pave their way to retirement. 
   Another great benefit of saving at work is that in most cases, the employer is going to match some of the amount saved. To the extent that an employer will match, for instance, the first 5 percent of your salary, that's a 100 percent rate of return on those savings. If someone who makes $50,000 a year saves $2,500, the employer will match it with another $2,500. That's free money. So the employee starts out at a 100 percent rate of return. If the market performs as it traditionally has and returns an average of 8 percent a year, the employee's money doubles again every 10 years. So for an additional set-aside of $2,500, in 10 years, that employee is likely to have $10,000. That's powerful. 
   During the week of October 21 to 27, everyone who plays a role in retirement will be called to action. All the companies that sponsor retirement plans, all the companies that do the work to administer these plans, financial consultants and groups like the Employee Benefit Research Institute that runs the Choose to Save campaign are encouraged to bring this powerful message to more people. 
   In the clutter of everyday life, we are bombarded with advertisements for everything from breakfast cereal to fast cars. Advertisements for retirement savings don't always break through the clutter. Again, our negative savings rate goes to show that. Our support of the National Save for Retirement Week today will help that message break through, as communities across our great Nation join in a concerted, week-long effort to teach Americans the importance of saving. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join Representative Schwartz and me in passing this legislation so that more and more Americans can choose to save. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, Members. NANCY, JOHN, DAVID, I appreciate you all. 
   I rise today in support of a clean emergency spending bill for our troops, but this one is all smoke and mirrors. We must give our men and women in uniform everything they need to thwart the insurgency in Iraq and come home safely and soon.  
   You know, we can't tie the hands of the guys on the ground with time lines or benchmarks. And, worse, we shouldn't be using the emergency troop spending bill as the way to finance the political gimmickry of special interest projects. It is just exasperating that the Democrat leaders have turned the emergency troop spending bill into a pork barrel project giveaway. 
   This bill gives piles of money to shrimpers, spinach farmers, and peanut storage. You know, what does throwing money at Bubba Gump, Popeye the Sailorman, and Mr. Peanut have to do with winning a war? Nothing. 
   The special interest projects added to increase the likelihood of this bill passing are really an insult to the troops who want, need, and deserve our full support. The Democrats are trying to buy the majority vote today one pork project at a time, perhaps because the majority does not support their slow bleed surrender strategy. 
   Since the President announced his new plan for Iraq in January, there has been measured, steady progress. He changed the rules of engagement and removed political protections. Coalition forces nabbed more than 50 suspects and dismantled a bomb factory in Iraq over the past few days. Coalition forces in Iraq detained seven suspects with reported ties to foreign fighter groups. In Ramadi, troops nabbed four other suspects with alleged ties to al Qaeda. In Mosul, coalition forces captured a former paramilitary leader who allegedly is responsible for setting up al Qaeda terrorist training camps in Iraq and Syria. During another operation, troops captured a suspected terrorist with alleged ties to al Qaeda car bomb and assassination cells. 
   We must seize this opportunity to move forward and not stifle future success and harm troop morale. 
   More importantly, I want to know, how many of you have ever asked your constituents, Do you want to lose in Iraq? I think if you ask that question, do you want to lose in Iraq, Americans will wholeheartedly say no. 
   We have smart, strong men and women serving in Iraq, and they need our help, and they need the full support of their country and their Congress. 
   Our troops don't need 435 generals in Washington declaring, we will send you money for bullets, but we won't send you bulletproof vests. Our troops don't need folks in suits sitting in wood paneled rooms on Capitol Hill saying, we will send you armored tanks, but we won't send you gas. 
   Literally, this bill forces our guys on the ground to fight a war with one arm tied behind their backs. That just smacks of defeat. 
   Most of you in the Chamber know that I spent nearly 7 years as a prisoner in Vietnam, more than half of that time in solitary. Well, that was during my second tour in Vietnam. During my first tour, I worked for General Westmoreland at MAC-V Headquarters, that is the Military Assistance Command Vietnam. 
   While working late at night, we had a bunch of men involved in the first real hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. You may remember that, JOHN. That was war. It turns out someone sent back footage to Washington that would match the opening scene of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' In the middle of the night, the red phone rang and I answered it. I heard an earful that is not fit for this House Chamber, something like, This is the White House. What the heck is going on over there? I replied, I'll wake up General Westmoreland. They slammed the phone down and hung up. That was the control they had over our guys. 
   Starting in 1965, we had folks in Washington trying to tell the generals how to run things on the ground in Vietnam. A generation ago, we saw what happens when you stop the funding and America stiffs its friends. As a matter of fact, we all know just this morning Iran captured 15 British sailors. This bill prevents us from responding from Kuwait to help our strong allies of British in an emergency. We show weakness, and the world knows it. 
   Just think back to the dark day in history when we saw visions of American marines airlifting Vietnamese out of the U.S. embassy. You remember that. That is what happens when America makes a commitment; Congress cuts the funding, and we go home with our tails between our legs. 
   The brave marines who died on that day in 1975 while innocent people desperately clung to life on a rope tied to a helicopter are a testimony to what happens when Congress cuts the funding and we leave without finishing the job. 
   We can't let that happen again. And I don't think any of you on either side in this Chamber wants that to happen. Frankly, we all want our troops to come home, when the job is done. We want to win. Internationally announcing our timelines for withdrawal literally hands the enemy our war plan and gives them hope that they will win if they just wait it out. What world superpower would do such a thing? 
   We are the United States of America. We are the premier military force on the globe. We are the land of the free and the home of the brave. Surely we do not go around announcing to the world how we will conduct and win a war. Surrendering is not an option, and neither do I think abandoning our troops is an option. 
   Look around you. We are all America. Do you want to lose in Iraq? Voting to set a hard exit date for U.S. troops in Iraq and imposing strict standards for deploying forces gives hope to the enemy, and it is a prescription for failure. Worse, forcing Members of Congress to decide on this issue when the bill is cluttered with excess money for spinach and peanuts is abhorrent, infuriating, and ill-advised. 
   My dear colleagues, if you really want to debate the merits of a time withdrawal, give each Member in Congress an up or down vote so we can vote our conscience. The sweeteners in this bill are political bribery, and our troops deserve more than this. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot abandon our men and women in uniform for politically charged benchmarks wrapped up in fat-cat constituent projects. If we learned anything from the brave Marines who died trying to save innocent people that day at the embassy in Vietnam, and JOHN, you know this, it is that the marines never quit. Neither should we.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Boozman, and thank you, Chairman Filner. I appreciate your bringing this to the floor. It's an important piece of legislation. And I think what everyone has said is absolutely true. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former POW in Vietnam for nearly 7 years, and I was there for two tours too, Mr. Boswell and I both, I find this vandalism unconscionable and un-American. Why on Earth would someone want to reignite the pains of the past? 
   Defacing the wall was the ultimate act of cowardice. Why anyone would want to destroy a sacred monument in Washington, DC. is beyond me. 
   Even though I did two tours in Vietnam, I spent most of my time in captivity. I didn't get to know a lot of the brave men and women who died in action, those who have their names etched into the shiny, marble dark wall. 
   But I did get to know a great American very well. His name is Ron Storz, a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and a fellow fighter pilot. 
   Originally from New York, Ron was shot down on April 28, 1965. I was shot down barely a year later, on April 16, 1966. 
   Because our captors tried to blame a handful of us for overthrowing the Vietnamese Government, they labeled us diehards. They threw 11 of us in solitary confinement in adjacent cells. Of the 11 of us, only 10 came home. Our captors killed Ron Storz after he went on a hunger strike. 
   It breaks my heart to think that someone would senselessly harm and deface the names, the honors, the legacies of great patriots like Ron. 
   You can find Ron's name on panel 1 of the east wall. 
   I deeply hope and pray the loved ones of those men and women memorialized on the wall know we remember their selfless family members and thank them for their dedicated service and ultimate sacrifice. These men and women listed on the wall all demonstrate why America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. These valiant warriors fought to protect and defend this great Nation, and we should not allow someone to tarnish their good names, and we must condemn this vandalism. 
   I thank you both.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. I've said it before and I'm saying it again, the current problems with the mortgage and real estate markets are considerable, but they're not permanent. This bill finally gets it right and provides a 3-year window so that lenders can restructure and write down loans, allowing people to move on with their lives without being taxed on phantom income. 
   I have confidence in the American economy and in the fact that real estate markets will rebound. Our economy is sound. The Federal Reserve is  now addressing mortgage lending practices that were out of control. And it's appropriate to restructure loans without taxing phantom income from the forgiveness of these inappropriate loans. 
   I am also glad to see this bill does not impose a luxury tax on one in 20 American families who own a second home. That tax on second homes also would have been an economic disaster for communities that rely upon tourism and recreation as their development strategy. 
   This bill before us is an appropriate response to a painful but temporary problem. We should all vote ``yes'' on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today proud to say I've been looking to the issue of mental health parity since 2002. In March of that year, I chaired the subcommittee that held the very first House hearing on that topic. I heard back then and have continued to hear over the years the concerns from mental health advocates, employers, and benefit managers about what effect parity may have on everyone's goal of providing quality health care to more Americans. So I come to the floor today disappointed that we are debating a bill that I cannot support. 
   Unfortunately, the majority has decided that politics should trump policy; that instead of bringing a bill to the floor that has the support of all the stakeholders in this debate, a bill the President has said he would sign into law, and a bill the Senate passed by unanimous consent, we're debating a bill that will only delay action on this very important issue. 
   There are real problems with the bill before us today. The first is the heavy-handed list of mandates. This bill would say to employers and insurance companies, if you decide to include mental health benefits in your health insurance package, you are forced to cover anything and everything related to mental health. 
   This is a requirement that doesn't exist in any other sector of the insurance industry, and I believe it would have the unintended consequence, in spite of what our opposition says, of forcing employers and companies to decide not to offer mental health benefits at all. This, of course, is not the goal we're striving to achieve today. 
   This bill also pays for mental health parity with a provision that would have a devastating effect on communities across the Nation. This provision would hurt every physician-owned hospital in this country, and that includes specialty hospitals, long-term acute care facilities, physician-owned full service hospitals, and patient rehabilitation facilities and others. 
   Physician-owned hospitals serve as an integral part of the health care system in this country. They deliver efficient, high-quality care to their patients and are a benefit to any community. These facilities across the country routinely are recognized nationally for their superior care. 
   In fact, just last month a hospital in my district, Baylor Health Care System, received the National Quality Award from the National Quality Forum. This award recognizes exemplary health care organizations who are role models for achieving meaningful and sustainable quality improvement in health care. 
   However, if this provision becomes law, this exemplary hospital would be forced to suffer serious consequences, like reducing patient care. 
   We all support the goal of equal access to mental health benefits; however, it should not be paid for by sacrificing facilities that bring quality health care to more Americans. Physician-owned hospitals are on the front lines of reforming our health care system, and they shouldn't be punished for the inroads they are making. 
   This provision will prohibit any new facility from being built as well as deny Medicare provider numbers to any facility currently under construction. It also caps the percentage of physician ownership in existing hospitals. No one facility can have more than 40 percent physician ownership, and no one doctor can own more than 2 percent of a facility. It puts the Federal Government in charge of deciding whether or not these facilities need to expand and help respond to the needs of the community. 
   There have been a number of studies that have shown specialty hospitals have an overall positive effect over general acute care hospitals. 
   Today is the day to stand up for innovation and stop taking the funding from the specialty hospitals, Mr. Stark.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 5 million valiant men and women who served in the Korean War. Some may know the names Buzz Aldrin or John Glenn. You know, we all flew F-86s in the 51st Fighter Wing back then together. They were household names then. I flew 62 combat missions in the Korean War and got a chance to fly with Buzz many times. 
   On Capitol Hill, there are three of us who served in Korea in this Congress--CHARLIE RANGEL of New York, JOHN CONYERS of Michigan, and I. The Congress is better off because Korean War veterans are represented. 
   They call the Korean War the ``forgotten war'' as STENY HOYER said. Nowhere is this more evident than the fact that the Korean War Veterans Association has not received a national charter. 
   A little known fact is that American prisoners of war in Korea endured even more severe treatment than those of us in Vietnam. In fact, they didn't even want to talk about it for years. Giving the Veterans of the Korean War a national charter will put them in the same echelon as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion, truly a mark of distinction. 
   There is a Sam Johnson Korean War Veterans Group, chapter 270, in north Texas. The founder, Ed Buckman, a great patriot, did not talk about his history or his story for decades. It wasn't until a couple of years ago that he started sharing his experience and became a Korean War veteran champion. 
   Ed Buckman is the one who helped bring the need for a national charter to my attention. Mr. Buckman arrived home in Fort Worth after serving from 1950 to 1951 as a Navy electrical engineer aboard the USS Princeton. The Veterans of Foreign Wars advised him that because President Truman dubbed the conflict in Korea a ``police action'' and not a war, Mr. Buckman and other military personnel were not considered veterans. 
   He once said he did not say the word ``Korea'' out loud for more than 40 years. He confided to the Dallas Morning News that he was bitter. ``We were treated like dirt when we got home.'' Then, in 2000, he heard about a parade in New York City honoring veterans, including those from the Korean War. ``When I went to this parade,'' he said, ``with 25,000 marchers, they put me on the front float and there were a million people saying thank you. No one had ever thanked me for my service in Korea before,'' and he said ``it made me feel proud.'' He tirelessly advocated a national charter for the Korean War veterans, and it brings me great pleasure to know that his hard work paid off. 
   Ed Buckman, your country and your Congress are saying thank you for your sincere devotion to the cause by creating this long overdue national charter for all Korean War veterans. 
   I want to thank STENY HOYER and the others in this Congress for helping do this. It's about time our Nation thanked the Korean War veterans for their service and sacrifice with national recognition and premier status. 
   This July, we mark the 55th anniversary of the Korean War armistice. To the remaining one million plus Korean War veterans we will say, God bless you and God bless America. Your war and your efforts will not be forgotten. This is for you. America salutes you.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING PRISONERS OF WAR FROM THE VIETNAM CONFLICT -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Republican Leader Boehner for his efforts to recognize the prisoners of war in Vietnam and those of us who are marking 35 years of freedom. 
   As a former prisoner of war for nearly 7 years, more than half of that time in solitary confinement, I find great comfort that Americans support our troops 110 percent. Trust me when I say it makes a tremendous difference to return to your country with a warm welcome and homecoming party versus people spitting on you or worse. Thankfully, America does not have hundreds of men and women held captive as prisoners of war like Vietnam. For this, I can only say, ``Praise the Lord.'' 
   You know, celebrating a milestone of liberty like 35 years of freedom really puts life in perspective. I have thought about what my battered body felt like before the years of endless torture and extreme starvation, and I thank my loyal wife and family for sticking by me when I was gone. 
   I also recall the high-caliber Americans held captive with me in Vietnam. By Christmas 1970, my captors ended my solitary confinement after 3 1/2 years and placed me in a huge room full of American heroes, the Hanoi Hilton, now known as the ``Incredible Room Seven.'' The roster of Room Seven included 47 great Americans who spent a combined 108,116 days in captivity. That translates into just under 300 man hours gone. As for me, I spent just under 2,500 days as a POW, and you can Google ``Incredible Room Seven'' to learn about the amazing list of war heroes I have the honor of calling friends, one of whom is John McCain. 
   While held in captivity, most of us agreed that when, not if, we returned home to America, we would quit complaining about the government and do  something about it. Some of us ran for office. I served in the Texas State House and now in the U.S. Congress. Jeremiah Denton, who blinked the letters ``t-o-r-t-u-r-e'' in Morse code while reading a prepared message from the enemy into a video camera, became a U.S. Senator from Alabama. John McCain served in the House and then in the Senate. Clearly, the thread of public service in Room Seven extended well beyond the military code of conduct. 
   I mention my 7 years in captivity for another reason as well. Today, for just about the last 7 years, our troops and their families have put their lives on the line, and many times on hold, to defend the freedom of this great Nation. The Nation has troops waging two different battles in two separate remote parts of the world, and our servicemen and women continue to stand up and be counted. Our troops have done an exceptional job. We all hope and pray they come home soon and safely when the time is right. 
   I would like to close today by dedicating this statement to a dear friend of mine who did not make it home from captivity, Ron Storz. The enemy held me in solitary confinement in a place we POWs named Alcatraz. There were 11 of us held alone in small 3-foot by 8-foot cells, each one adjacent to another. Being the ingenious American servicemen we were, we could communicate with our fellow POWs by tapping on the walls. 
   Of the 11 of us held in solitary cells, only 10 made it home. The North Vietnamese killed my friend Ron Storz, an Air Force captain, after he rebelled and went on a hunger strike to protest our harsh conditions. Ron Storz carried the banner of valor and heroism. This resolution includes him, too, and it includes all Americans. 
   All I want to say is God bless America, and today I salute all ex-POWs. Thank you for bringing this measure to the floor. I salute you.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6532. 
   Today, just 7 weeks after the House first considered this bill transferring $8 billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund, here we are, back again. I was one of 37 Members to vote against the bill when it was previously considered in the House. The bill simply kicks the can down the road just a little bit more until the highway trust fund is again broke. 
   Delay and bailout. Delay and bailout. This Congress is elected to run the country, yet we delay action, wring our hands, lament that there are few good options available to address the Nation's problems, then bail out programs gone broke. Our delay only makes the problem worse. Our delay only leaves us with fewer options once we are forced to act. 
   The bill before us today puts another temporary patch on a highway system that needs funding. Even with this $8 billion infusion of cash, the trust fund is going to go broke again before the next Congress acts to address the underlying problem. 
   When the House initially passed this bill on July 23, the balance of the trust fund stood at $4.2 billion. Now we learn from the Department of Transportation that in the span of just these few weeks, that balance has fallen all the way to $1.4 billion as of the beginning of this month. So today the administration has called upon the Congress to approve this $8 billion transfer and to make it effective immediately, rather than on September 30th, because the trust fund is likely to go broke sooner. 
   The highway funding system is based on fuel taxes that are declining at a time when the price of fuel is rising. Fewer people are driving because the cost of gas is skyrocketing. 
   The majority will not let us debate an energy bill. The majority Democrats will not let America work toward domestic oil and gas. Americans want, need and deserve a clear energy policy that uses American energy sources like oil and gas from offshore. Americans want, need and deserve an energy policy that develops new technologies and brings them to the market. Yet this Congress delays action and prevents debate. 
   If the highway bills that this Congress has passed were not larded up with thousands of earmarks, then spending from the trust fund could be better regulated to match taxes with spending. A little bit of self-control would solve this problem. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that will pass the House today shows no self-control. It is just another bailout. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, you know, it's not every day the House gets to consider a bipartisan, commonsense bill that's affordable. This doesn't cost anything and supports our service men and women overseas. However, I'm happy to say this is one of those days. 
   Right now the law prevents a Medicare physician from leaving his practice for more than 60 days at a time. And the regulation was created to prevent fraud, but it had the unintended effect of making life more difficult for someone that's called up to serve his country. And this bill eliminates the red tape by allowing our reservists to have one substitute doctor for their entire deployment. 
   Not only will the bill help our reservists, it'll prevent Medicare beneficiaries from experiencing a gap in service or losing access to care altogether. 
   And I want to thank my colleague from California for bringing this problem to my attention, I'm surprised we hadn't had it brought to our attention before, and for all the work you and your staff have done to get the bill to the floor today. 
   Those who serve our country and their communities need and want our assistance, and it's time we helped our weekend warriors who happen to be doctors to keep their patients and keep their practice. This is a great bill, and I appreciate the time. I thank Mr. Kucinich for providing us the opportunity.

   Meanwhile, a provision in the bill says that banks that bought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock get better tax treatment than an individual who bought preferred stock. That is wrong. Why shouldn't banks be held responsible for their mistakes? 
   I am not sure this is the best way to fix the problem. We need to discuss serious alternatives before we ask Americans to shoulder billions in additional debt.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. The American people want, need, and deserve a Congress that responds to their needs and acts diligently on their top priority. Sadly, the Democrats in Congress, beholden to their radical leftist interests, have blocked progress and will not let us do the job that the American people sent us to Washington to do--find real energy solutions. 
   Ironically, the only border fence the Democrats seem to care about is the fence they want to put up around the areas where we can't explore for oil. That's a disgrace. Solving our energy crisis means tapping all of America's resources for America's future to create American jobs and American prosperity. Folks are sick and tired of paying around $4 a gallon for gas. They're fed up with relying on foreign countries and brutal dictators to supply our energy needs. Americans have had it with a Democrat leadership who told the Congress to take a 5-week vacation instead of staying around to do their jobs. 
   The Democrat bill before us today is a sham. They're refusing to allow us to tap into our own home-grown energy resources and discouraging investment in future energy supply. I'm here to tell you, in Texas, this bill is all hat and no cattle. 
   On October 1, the ban on offshore energy exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf expires. This bill would put the lid on the OCS with no progress in sight. However, today's bill puts excessive rules and regulations back on the OCS, landing us basically back where we started. That's not what I call progress. 
   We owe it to the American people to get this one done right. We need to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to allow States to share the revenue of oil exploration. We need to tap Alaskan areas that hold potential for domestic energy resources, not just the parts cherry-picked by the Speaker. 
   We must be open to oil shale, clean coal, nuclear, and renewable energy sources like wind and the sun. We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more innovation, and we need it all. 
   I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to come up with real energy reform for our children, grandchildren and America's future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, while I am not sold on the effectiveness of a minimum wage increase, I rise in support of increasing the number of Americans with health insurance. 
   Too many working Americans have a job but aren't insured because their employers cannot afford to purchase quality health care plans. This is particularly true of small businesses where it is difficult to pool risk, and the regulatory environment is overwhelmingly complicated. Currently, small businesses are denied the ability to purchase health coverage with the benefits large companies and unions have enjoyed for decades. 
   So today, as part of a comprehensive motion to recommit, the Republicans will offer a proposal to address health care for many small businesses: association health plans. AHPs would increase small businesses' bargaining power with health care providers, give them much-needed freedom from a costly State-mandated benefit package and lower their overhead costs by as much as 30 percent. 
   By pooling their resources and increasing their bargaining power, AHPs will help small businesses reduce their health insurance coverage costs. As you have heard me say before, if it is good enough for Wall Street, it is good enough for Main Street. 
   By making health care more affordable, AHPs will expand access to quality health care for people for whom it is currently out of reach: uninsured working families. That is something my friends on both sides of the aisle can agree on. 
   It is no wonder my AHP bill has had unwavering bipartisan support in the House for nearly a decade now. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make AHPs law this year. Small businesses need help now. Vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support the priorities of the Republican budget to control spending and keep taxes low. I commend the Budget Committee ranking member, PAUL RYAN, for putting together a budget alternative that prevents expansion of the alternative minimum tax for 3 years and then achieves repeal of this tax system in 2013. 
   This is a huge step in modernizing the Tax Code, and it will give Americans certainty about their tax situation. The Democrat budget only puts the AMT on a leash for 1 year before allowing it to ravage more American families.     
   Our Republican budget would also ensure that American families continue to be free of the stupidity of the marriage penalty and that families get to keep tax credits for children. Finally, our budget would continue to help make sure that investment in American capitalism and jobs will continue to thrive by allowing the tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains to stay at the 15 percent rate. 
   The Democrat budget would raise taxes on my constituents by $2,669. I don't see how we can support that. We balance the budget by 2012 by putting spending under control. It's important to know that total government spending does rise every year of the American budget, but there will be a lot of people claiming that we are actually cutting spending. Only in Washington can more spending be translated as a cut. 
   We pick and choose programs to cut by millions of dollars, and there are spending priorities that would get more money. That's what we are paid to do here in the Capitol, set priorities for what's important to the Nation. 
   Republicans in our budget take on the big issue of entitlement reform. I am very disappointed that the Democrat budget fails to seriously address the pending crisis in our country's entitlement programs. Congress has been warned many times that an entitlement reform is needed now. You would think the countless reports, testimonies and letters sent to Congress would get the attention of the majority. But if you look at their budget, you will see only the real action on reforming Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid is to kick the can down the road. 
   The cost is roughly $14 trillion. By refusing to make the tough decisions on how to resolve the serious financial trouble these programs are facing, the Democrats have decided to leave those decisions to someone else. 
   Medicare and Medicaid need real reform to stop the slippery slope these programs are currently on. We cannot tweak the edges and make small changes and expect dramatic results.  We need to take a look at some real success stories in Medicare and Medicaid and see how we can apply the lessons. 
   For example, independent actuaries again this year have announced that the projected costs for Medicare part D will be lower than expected. Beneficiaries have enjoyed premiums that are 40 percent lower than original estimates. Compare that to the fact that part B premiums have doubled in price over the last 6 years. 
   The Republican budget is a better proposal. I suggest you vote for it.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Village Health Partners of Plano, Texas, for receiving the 2007 Davies Award of Excellence by the Health Care Information and Management System Society. Since 1994, the Davies Award has nationally recognized excellence in the use of health information technology. Dr. Christopher Crow and his partners decided to use technology to revolutionize how they practiced medicine. It took their office 3 short months to go from paper charts to completely paper-free. Using this technology has given these doctors the tools to track the quality of care they provide their patients. In just 1 year these physicians have seen the dramatic impact this technology has had on the lives of their patients. 
   As all of my colleagues know, our health care system is in need of some serious reform, and I believe that bringing every doctor's office, hospital, and medical record into the 21st century is a great start. Just look at the success that we have had in Plano.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my support for combat veterans from the Lone Star State. You have heard a lot of stories from TED POE.  
   As a 29-year Air Force veteran and Texas native, I think it's great that Humble, Texas, will have a post office dedicated to those selfless men and women in the Armed Forces; and I commend my friend, TED POE, for spearheading this effort. 
   You know, many war heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan call the Lone Star State home. He mentioned one of  them, but as an example, you may know the name Marcus Luttrell. He was a Petty Officer First Class born in Huntsville, Texas, a former Navy SEAL, awarded the Navy Cross and wrote the New York Times best-selling book ``Lone Survivor.'' The book details his remarkable story of surviving one of the war's deadliest battles for U.S. Special Forces. I had the honor of meeting him last week, and he's a remarkable individual. 
   TED mentioned Monica Lin Brown, the 19-year-old medic from Texas who became the first woman in Afghanistan and only the second woman since World War II to receive the Silver Star, the Nation's third highest medal for valor. Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown saved the lives of fellow soldiers after a roadside bomb tore through a convoy of Humvees last spring in Afghanistan. After the explosion which wounded five soldiers in her unit, Brown ran through insurgent gunfire and used her body to shield wounded comrades as mortars fell less than 100 yards away. 
   While today I have only mentioned Iraq and Afghanistan, I could go on for hours, as TED POE did, highlighting noticeable Texans who have gone above and beyond their service to this great Nation. 
   I want to thank Mr. Poe and Humble, Texas, for recognizing those men and women who proudly wear the uniform for the United States of America. They help keep America the land of the free and the home of the brave. I salute all of our veterans.

   A law was put in place in 1989 to require that detailed log sheets be kept by employees of their cell phone use in order to document their business use. Those rules made sense back then. 
   Fast forward to today. Clearly, time and technology have marched on and companies give their employees cell phones and BlackBerrys with unlimited minutes. And these communication devices are really just an extension of the business day and place to anywhere at any time. 
   The IRS wants employees to keep detailed call sheets or be forced to include the value of cell phones and BlackBerrys in their pay. The law needs to be brought up to date with the fact that the office cell and BlackBerry is just an extension of the phone on an employee's desk. Employees and employers have better things to worry about than keeping detailed logs of calls only for tax purposes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. You know, as he said, I flew 62 combat missions in the Korean War and 25 in Vietnam before being shot down. I had the privilege of serving in the United States Air Force for 29 years, attending the prestigious National War College, commanding two air bases, among other things. 
   I mention these stories because I view the debate on the floor not just as a U.S. Congressman elected to serve the good people of the Third District in Texas, but also through the lens of a lifelong fighter pilot, student of war, a combat warrior, a leader of men, and a prisoner of war. 
   Ironically, this week marks the anniversary that I started a new life and my freedom from prison in Hanoi. I spent early 7 years as that prisoner of war, more than half of that time in solitary confinement. I flew out of Hanoi on February 12, 1973, with other long-held prisoners of war, weighing just 140 pounds. And tomorrow, 34 years ago, I had my homecoming to Texas, a truly unspeakable blessing of freedom. 
   While in solitary confinement, my captures kept me in leg stocks, like the pilgrims, for 72 days. As you can imagine, they had to carry me out of the stocks because I couldn't walk. 
   The following day they put me in leg irons for 2 1/2 years. That is when you have a tight metal cuff around each ankle with a foot-long bar connecting the legs. I still have very little feeling in my right arm and right hand, and my body has never been the same since my nearly 2,500 days of captivity. But I will never let my physical woes hold me back. Instead, I try to see the silver lining. 
   I say that because, in some ways, I am living a dream, a hope that I had for the future. From April 16, 1966, to February 12, 1973, I prayed that I would return home to the loving embrace of my wife, Shirley, and my three kids, Bob, Jenny, and Beverly. My fellow POWs and I clung to the hope of when, not if, we returned home. We would spend hours tapping on the adjoining cement walls about what we would do when we got home to America. We pledged to quit griping about the way the government was running the war in Vietnam and do something about it. We decided we would run for office and try to make America a better place for all of us. 
   So, little did I know back in my rat-infested 3-by-8 dark, filthy cell that, 34 years after my departure from hell on earth, I would spend the anniversary of my release pleading for a House panel to back my measure to support and fully fund our troops in harm's way; and, that just days later I would be on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, surrounded by distinguished veterans, urging Congress to support our troops to the hilt. 
   We POWs were still in Vietnam when Washington cut the funding for Vietnam. I know what it does to morale and mission success. Words cannot fully describe the horrendous damage of the anti-American efforts against the war back home to the guys on the ground. Our captors would blare nasty recordings over the loudspeaker of Americans protesting back home, tales of Americans spitting on Vietnam veterans when they came home, and worse. I don't think we should ever, ever let that happen again. The pain inflicted by your country's indifference is tenfold that inflicted by your ruthless captors. 
   Our troops and their families want, need, and deserve the full support of this country and the Congress. Moms and dads watching the news need to know that the Congress will not leave their sons and daughters in harm's way without support. 
   Since the President announced his new plan for Iraq last month, there has been steady progress. He changed the rules of engagement, removed political protection. There are reports we wounded the number two of al Qaeda and killed his deputy. And, yes, al Qaeda operates in Iraq. It is alleged that top radical jihadist, al-Sadr, has fled Iraq maybe to Iran, and Iraq has closed its borders with Iran and Syria. 
   The President has changed course, has offered a new plan. We are making progress. We must seize the opportunity to move forward, not stifle future success. Debating nonbinding resolutions aimed at earning political points only destroys morale, stymies success, and emboldens the enemy. 
   The grim reality is that this House measure is the first step to cutting funding of the troops. Just ask JOHN MURTHA about his slow-bleed plan that hamstrings our troops in harm's way. 
   Now it is time to stand up for my friends who did not make it home and those who fought and died in Iraq already, so I can keep my promise that when we got home we would quit griping about the war and do something positive about it. 
   We must not allow this Congress to leave these troops like the Congress left us. Today, let my body serve as a brutal reminder that we must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Instead, learn from them. We must not cut funding for our troops. We must stick by them. We must support them all the way. And, to our troops, we must remain always faithful. God bless you all. I salute you and this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the phones in my office have been ringing off the hook. Constituents are hopping mad about the skyrocketing price of gasoline. 
   In Dallas in just the last month, the price for a gallon of gas has jumped 30 cents. And that's in Texas, where we drill and explore on land and along the coast. 
   It's about time for the Congress to take action. In fact, it's past time. 
   Two-thirds of the oil we use comes from foreign countries. We have oil and gas in the United States, but we have to be willing to move forward with exploration. Congress should allow exploration in Alaska, along the eastern seaboard, the west coast, and allow more refineries to be built. 
   The answer to rising gas prices is right here in America. We have the technology. We have the resources. The time is now. Democrats in Congress need to step aside and let the ingenuity of Americans solve this problem today.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (KATRINA HOUSING TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I rise today in support of the amended version of H.R. 1562. During the Committee debate on this bill I raised concerns about the revenue offset used to pay for this legislation. The original bill would have permitted the IRS to seize the assets of a taxpayer prior to a hearing. The provision was scored as raising $240 million. The reason for the change was that there are some taxpayers who are serial abusers of the payroll tax withholding mechanism who needed to be shut down to prevent a drain on revenues. 
   The problem is that we cannot begin to close the tax gap at the expense of basic civil liberties. We would have a taxpayer revolt at such heavy-handed tactics. Congress put in place many taxpayer protections against heavy-handed IRS tactics and I think we need to be very careful as we contemplate rolling back any of them in the name of closing the ``tax gap.'' 
   The amended bill before us now would go after the serial abusers of the payroll tax system. It would require that if someone has already been through the hearing process in the last two years, then they don't get to keep scamming the tax system. They cannot hide behind the protections meant for taxpayers who have simply made a mistake in filing payroll taxes for their employees. 
   The protection of having a hearing prior to IRS seizure of assets is important in many circumstances. One of the leading reasons for this protection is innocent spouse relief. If a husband messes up his company's payroll taxes in one quarter, the Committee approved bill and the version already approved by the other body, would have allowed the IRS to seize his wife's assets and give her no ability to claim innocent spouse relief until roughly eight months after the seizure. I don't think this is good policy and I think it is a lousy way to close the ``tax gap.'' 
   I commend Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY for working to be sure that these situations are addressed by the amendment we have worked out. I hope that whenever the House and Senate put this revenue raiser into a final agreement later this year, that the House version prevails. 
   Again, I support the version of this legislation that we are debating on the House floor today and I want to personally thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for working so hard to address these concerns.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, today we're considering a bill that does some important things. One, it stops the 2008 physician cuts. Two, it extends the Children's Health Insurance Program past the politics of the Presidential election; and three, it helps physicians who are called up for active duty to serve their country. But in reality, this isn't the best bill Congress could have put together, and y'all need to know that. 
   For the first time, physicians don't know what Medicare will pay them next year. In 6 short months, doctors will once again be facing more than a 10 percent cut in their reimbursements. That uncertainty is no help when you're trying to run a business. 
   When it comes to physicians who are called up to serve their country and their community, this bill does deliver temporary relief. 
   Earlier this year Congress moved in a bipartisan fashion to temporarily fix an oversight in Medicare. Previously, the law created a red tape nightmare for any Medicare physician who needed to leave his practice for more than 60 days at a time. The bill before us today continues this fix for just 6 months by allowing our Reservists to have one substitute doctor for their entire deployment. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues next year on a permanent fix for this problem. We need to support our troops and the docs that are called up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the current problems with mortgage and real estate markets are considerable, but they're not permanent. For the individuals and families who have gotten into trouble with inappropriate mortgages, I'm glad to see that their lenders are restructuring and writing down loans so people can move on with their lives. Taxation of phantom income is something I've fought for a long time. I have confidence in the American economy and in the fact that real estate markets will rebound. It's not a permanent problem. 
   However, this bill puts permanent relief in place and sets up a system where there is permanent assumption of sliding home prices. Instead of a permanent problem, I believe it's a short-term problem worthy of being given emergency budget designation. This would allow this phantom income to remain untaxed, and to make it unnecessary for permanent tax increases to be imposed on other Americans. 
   The tax increase the majority has chosen as an offset is a permanent luxury tax on one in 20 American families who own a second home. The Ways and Means Committee has a track record on luxury taxes, and it's not good. When the Democrats were last in the majority, they imposed a luxury tax on yachts and claimed that only the rich would pay the tax. The luxury tax on yachts really ended up being a tax on boats. It was a disaster tax on the American boat building industry and on marinas all over America. The luxury tax killed the yacht business, devastated an industry and was finally repealed with sincere regret. 
   I fear this luxury tax on second homes will have the same effect as the luxury tax on yachts. Yet our friends, the Realtors, the bankers and the homebuilders all support the bill before us today because of the need for relief and mortgage debt forgiveness. 
   It's clearly not a perfect bill. It should come back from conference with the Senate with only a temporary provision, then the luxury tax on second homes ought to no longer be necessary because it should be given the emergency budget designation it deserves.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (MEDICARE IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill H.R. 6600, the Medicare Identity Prevention Act. I thank Mr. Doggett for bringing it up. Apparently we can't get any resolution on Social Security so we need to do it one baby step at a time. 
   Americans are rightly worried about the security of their personal information, including their Social Security number. Practically every day we hear about another data breach in the private or public sector where identity information of hundreds, if not thousands, of people is stolen. 
   According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, the total number of known records that have been compromised since January 2005 is over 158 million. Even though Social Security numbers were created to track earnings for determining benefit amounts under Social Security, these numbers are now unfortunately widely used as personal identifiers. 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, Social Security numbers have become the ``identifier of choice'' and are used for all sorts of business transactions. In an April 2007 report, the President's Identity Theft Task Force identified the Social Security number as the most valuable commodity for an identity thief. 
   These thieves are hard at work. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that about 5 percent of all of the adult population has been victim of identity theft. Even worse, the true number of victims of that crime is unknown since most victims don't report it. 
   We also know that this is a serious problem for illegal immigration. During a recent hearing at the Social Security Subcommittee, we learned that a credible set of fake identity documents costs about $350. With those fake documents, illegal immigrants can get a job and even sneak through the government's E-Verify system which is meant to verify whether an employee is eligible to work in this country. 
   Congress must get to work on identity theft, and removing the Social Security number from widespread circulation is an excellent place to start. For years, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security has been working on this problem in a bipartisan way. We have approved bills to protect the privacy of Social Security numbers and prevent identity theft since the 106th Congress when it first approved the Social Security Number Privacy and Identity Theft Prevention Act. That legislation was introduced on a bipartisan basis by then-Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw and then-ranking member, the late Bob Matsui. 
   The Ways and Means Committee has begun working on this and so has the Energy and Commerce Committee. Our two comprehensive bills are really not that far apart, yet we are repeatedly met with opposition from those groups which prefer to splash Social Security numbers on every personal document they want. The comprehensive efforts of our two committees are being met with the same resistance they met in previous years until now. 
   I commend my colleague from Texas (Mr. Doggett) for working in a bipartisan way and not giving up on the issue. Sometimes you just have to take an issue one bite at a time. 
   The bill H.R. 6600, Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act, will take the Social Security number off the Medicare card. It is completely ridiculous that people are told not to carry their Social Security card in order to protect their identity, but then every senior citizen is told they must carry their Medicare card, which has their Social Security number on it. 
   When the wallet of a senior citizen has been stolen, even a low-tech crook can get the identity theft. It's not the card itself; it's a fact that then every medical record at nursing homes, hospitals, and doctor offices has a Social Security number written on it. 
   The wholesale amount of Social Security numbers that are available to identity thieves is staggering and completely unnecessary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must change their tracking number for Medicare purposes. 
   In just a few years, the first baby boomers are going to be turning 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Rather than a huge wave of retirees being issued an ``identity theft kit'' when they receive a Medicare card, that card should have a unique identifier. Private insurance moved away from Social Security cards years ago. Medicare needs to do that, too. 
   The problem of identity theft is not going to be addressed with one single piece of legislation, but we must start somewhere, and starting with Medicare cards before Boomers become eligible is a great place to start. 
   Thank you, Mr. Doggett, for your support. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, American taxpayers ought not be footing the bill for sanctuary cities to serve as safe havens for illegal immigrants, especially hardened criminals. 
   Sanctuary cities do not allow money or resources to be used to enforce Federal immigration laws. Police or other employees cannot inquire about immigration status. An example is San Francisco as a sanctuary city. 
   I support the CLEAR Act authored by MARSHA BLACKBURN. The act would empower local law enforcement agencies in the fight against illegal immigration. Under her bill, sanctuary cities would lose Federal crime funding unless local governments rescind the policies that prohibit local law enforcement from working with the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Illegal immigrants know they are safe from deportation. If these cities refuse to enforce the law, especially when it comes to criminals, it ought to cost them. 
   This is a first step, and I urge the House to move forward with this legislation. Americans deserve our full support.

With a nationwide price for gasoline now over $4 a gallon, it's no surprise a recent Gallup Poll showed 57 percent of Americans now favor further exploration for oil right here in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1294, to recognize the goals of National Save for Retirement Week. I am pleased to join my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Allyson Schwartz, to again introduce a resolution in support of National Save for Retirement Week. 
   The week is designated this year as October 19-25. You know the best time for Americans to save is on payday. That is when they have got the cash. When employees save through their employer-based retirement plan, the money comes out of their paycheck before other tempting priorities get in the way. 
   Saving for numero uno ought to be every working American's top priority before spending on optional things like dinner, movies, or, I hope today, still buying a shiny new car. Saving for retirement is not as flashy or fun as many competing priorities, but the only way most of us are ever going to be able to afford retirement in the future is by saving today. 
   This spring, the Employee Benefit Research Institute released its annual retirement confidence survey that shows Americans' confidence in their ability to afford a comfortable retirement has dropped to its lowest level in several years. This drop in confidence represents several concerns, but the big concerns I hear about are the overall state of the economy, the weak stock market and concern about one's own job security. 
   The answer to these concerns, in my opinion, is to save in an employer-based retirement plan. The first reason is that most employers match the employee contributions. If an employee puts 1 percent of earnings into a plan, many employers match that contribution dollar for dollar. That means the employee gets a 100 percent rate of return. Even if the market slides a little bit, the employee still comes out ahead because of the company match. Many employers match even more generously, up to 4 or 6 percent of salary. When an employer is handing out free money, I encourage all employees to get in line and let's say ``yes.'' 
   A second reason to save at work is our economy is going to recover soon and employees can look at their current stock market purchases as buying low. The formal term for regular purchases in the stock market is dollar cost averaging. That means you purchase mutual funds or stocks at regular intervals, such as on payday, regardless of share price. Under dollar cost averaging, when the market prices are low, you end up buying more shares with a set amount of money, and when market prices are high you buy fewer shares with your set amount of dollars. Buy low, sell high. It works every time to build wealth. 
   The third reason to participate in an employer-based retirement plan is that the sooner people save money, the sooner the most powerful force on Earth can work for them, the power of compound interest. With an average of 8 percent return, money doubles every 9 years. The cost of living in the future, even in retirement, is not going to go down, but money saved early in one's work life will make retirement easier. 
   Another powerful force in saving is inertia, sometimes described as a body at rest stays at rest, or a body in motion stays in motion. Employers and Congress recognize that principles of inertia often means that employees never get around to affirmatively signing up for retirement plans at work. 
   To address inertia, Congress passed a law to allow employers to automatically enroll employees in retirement plans and get those savings rolling forward with the power of compound interest. The amazing thing is we are now seeing roughly 90 percent employer participation in retirement plans with an automatic enrollment, up from previous levels of roughly 70 percent. I am glad to see this new law is working. 
   Last year, after we enacted a similar resolution, I was happy to see reports about the number of employers that promoted National Save for Retirement Week. There were lots of employee benefit fairs, promotional enrollment meetings and seminars, and other employers printed up new brochures for employees to review regarding the importance of retirement savings. I hope to work with more employers in my congressional district this year to bring the message of Save for Retirement Week to employees. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that Americans are strapped for cash and that right now saving is a hard thing to do. Rising gas prices are taking bigger and bigger bites out of everyone's income. It is hard to set aside retirement money for years down the road. It feels like right now there is a lot of month left at the end of every paycheck. 
   But Americans don't want to work forever, and the only way to retire is to plan and save. I would encourage everyone to go to the Web site choosetosave.org and use any of the calculators that help to plan for retirement, college savings, and budgeting in general. Planning is a great first step to financial security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know that Americans who have only Social Security as retirement income end up in poverty. As much as some of my colleagues hate to admit it, Social Security has a serious funding problem in a relatively short time and we need to address the problem. We can't just tax our way out of that problem either. 
   Part of the reason for our horrible national savings rate is that Americans are paying a whopping 15 percent of salary between their individual share and their employer's share in payroll taxes. 
   In 1984, when payroll taxes went up dramatically by 5 percent, the national savings rate fell by the same amount. Congress took those payroll taxes out of Americans' pockets in order to fund Social Security and Medicare, with the promise that the programs would always be there to pay benefits in the future. The problem is our programs face huge structural deficits, and Americans have not been saving. We need to change a lot of things, but the first thing we can do is get people to start saving. Americans need to save at work where they generally get a match from their employer and where the money goes down to their own retirement accounts before expenses get in the way. 
   I look forward to working with employers and financial institutions in my Dallas and Collin County representation areas later this year to promote National Save for Retirement Week, which will happen the week of 19 October through 25 October. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Allyson for introducing this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

In fact, in my congressional district, a family of four making $66,000 a year is considered a moderate income. Apparently, the Democrats in the House consider the rest of my constituents superwealthy. 
   Even this paltry relief will be offset with permanent tax increases. The tax increase on real estate partnerships is among the most destructive taxes that could be devised.

   And the real fact is, this compromise bill is nothing less than a bunch of baloney. This bill covers fewer kids, costs more than last week's bogus SCHIP bill, and you know, we have a saying in Texas, if you put lipstick on a pig, it will still be a pig. 
   My biggest concern with this bill is it doesn't fix the illegal immigration loophole. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Federal Government will spend almost $4 billion to pay for health insurance benefits for illegal immigrants. That doesn't sound like much of a solution to me. 
   And this bill diverts resources away from kids who need the resources most. In fact, in 5 years, 10 percent of the enrollees in the Children's Health Insurance Program will not be children but adults. If we're going to reauthorize a Children's Health Insurance Program, we ought to be sure American kids have access to health insurance, not adults, not illegal immigrants. 
   I say support poor kids first. The American taxpayer wants, needs, and deserves a bill that does just that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the President's veto. It is important for the American people to understand that this debate is not about whether or not to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, but how we reauthorize it. This bill completely misses the mark. It is a massive expansion of a government-run program that takes resources away from the very children it was meant to help. 
   In this country there are millions of low-income uninsured children who are currently eligible for government help, but are not enrolled. I firmly believe it is our responsibility to cover the neediest of America's kids first. 
   The bill the President vetoed did just the opposite. 
   The Democrats' bill diverts money away from those who need it the most in order to cover kids who already have private health insurance. One in every three kids covered under this bill already has private health insurance coverage. Because the Democrats care more about how much they can expand taxpayer funded entitlement programs rather than helping those who actually need help, I will vote to sustain the President's veto. 
   Out of respect to the American taxpayer and the uninsured kids who need our help--Congress can and should pass a more fiscally sound bill that puts the poorest kids first.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for all the efforts of the proponents of H.R. 4 to confuse this issue, it truly is a simple one, basically a choice between hot-air promises and real-life facts. 
   Today, some people are claiming we need government negotiation in order to increase the pool of Medicare beneficiaries trying to buy affordable drugs. Well, unfortunately, that math just doesn't add up. The pharmacy benefit managers negotiating drug prices on behalf of seniors enrolled in part D are the very same PBMs going to bat for tens of millions of the under-65 population, including those of us enrolled in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. So if we took the Medicare population out from under that huge umbrella, they actually lose bargaining power, not gain it. 
   Another claim that is being made is that the Secretary will not have to limit the formulary in order to achieve promised savings. Mr. Speaker, if you believe that, I have got some oceanfront property in Arizona I would like to sell you. 
   Let us take a look at the VA plan as an example since it is being touted as a stellar illustration of government negotiating. The VA formulary has 1,300 drugs compared to more than 4,000 for Medicare. 
   And all the Medicare plans protect drugs for the most vulnerable, including drugs that treat cancer, AIDS, and mental illness. That is why H.R. 4 is opposed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the ALS Association, and others. 
   Finally, some are saying this bill will provide outstanding savings. Not to let the facts get in the way of a good story, but our own Congressional Budget Office says the effects of this bill will not save money. 
   Drug prices have fallen every year of part D's existence because of one thing: competition. And it is working great. As we say in Texas, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' 
   This debate boils down to a choice between government promises and free market results. I urge Members to vote against H.R. 4.

Tragically, the body of Private First Class Anzack was found a few days later in the river. DOD has changed the status of Specialist Jimenez and Private Fouty from unknown to missing/captured. Considering that the military found their IDs in an al Qaeda safe house, I'm sure they're being mistreated. And I hope and pray that they can stay alive until we can rescue them. 
   As a former prisoner of war for nearly 7 years in Vietnam, I know what these guys are going through. We must find them, and we must bring them home. Naysayers in Washington should not be talking about pulling the plug on our troops in Iraq when we have our own men missing in action who need to be rescued.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last Thursday, I introduced the New Employee Verification Act; it's H.R. 5515. This proposal will achieve three important objectives: one, ensure a legal workforce; two, safeguard workers identity; and three, protect Social Security. 
   Effective work site enforcement is essential to securing our borders. Reforming work site enforcement will affect millions of workers, and it must be done immediately and done right. Having an effective safeguard in place will allow us to have a rational debate about the number of workers we need to legally enter our Nation. 
   My bill has a mandatory component that builds off of what we've learned from current E-Verify. I also have a component that helps prevent identity theft through the creation of a voluntary system to authenticate and safeguard workers' identities. 
   This bill has strong support in the employer community. I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to see this bill signed into law.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement later, but right now I would like to introduce Congressman Geoff Davis from the State of Kentucky who was in the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served this Nation as an assault helicopter flight commander in the 82nd Airborne Division, which is where I went through jump school, too, and I think he is well qualified to discuss this issue. 
   I would like to recognize the gentleman for 5 minutes.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   You know, it is an honor to be here today joined by Members of Congress who have served this Nation nobly both in the Armed Forces and today as statesmen and -women in the United States House of Representatives. 
   You know, there are lots of ways people can serve this country. Dedicating time to the Armed Forces, the greatest military in the world, can be some of the most fulfilling time in one's life. I know, because I spent 29 years in the United States Air Force; got called up from my ROTC class at SMU and flew 62 combat missions in Korea in a plane I named after my wife, ``Shirley's Texas Tornado.'' 
   In 1965, I left for my first tour in Vietnam, working for General Westmoreland in the headquarters. In 1966 I returned again. And while flying my 25th mission, I was shot down, landed in the middle of a division of North Vietnamese soldiers. 
   What followed for the next 2,494 days can only be described as hell on Earth, or as my friend and fellow POW, Jeremiah Denton did, blinked the letters of one word in Morse Code into a movie camera as a desperate plea for help. The letters made up the word ``torture.'' Of my nearly 7 years in captivity, I spent more than half of that time in solitary confinement. 
   As you can imagine, the North Vietnamese would say and do anything to break our will. The physical torture is not fit for describing as some of it is too graphic and too gory. There were many times that I would pray to God that I would pass out and slip into unconsciousness just to escape the pain if I couldn't escape the beatings. 
   Yet, what also scarred me for life was the emotional torture that the North Vietnamese broadcast to taunt us and break our wills. They constantly blared anti-American messages from back home over the loud speakers. The enemy knows that any anti-American murmur can be used as a weapon. And the same holds true today. 
   The enemy wants our men and women in uniform to think that their Congress doesn't care about them, that they are going to cut the funding and abandon them and their mission. They want Congress to cave to the wishes of those who advocate a cut-and-run attitude. And we should not allow that to happen. 
   We must learn from our mistakes. We cannot leave a job undone like we left in Korea, like we left in Vietnam, like we left in Somalia. 
   Osama bin Laden said that ``in Somalia, the United States pulled out, trailing disappointment, defeat, and failure behind it.'' 
   And we didn't blink an eye when the radicals bombed the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia killing 20 and injuring 372; or after the Kenya embassy bombings that killed 213 people and injured 5,000; or that same day at the Tanzania embassy bombing killing 11 people and injuring 68. On October 12, 2000 the USS Cole bombing killed 17 and injured 39. And we all know how they tried to bring down the World Trade Towers and didn't stop until they completed the job September 11. 
   All of these tragedies of terrorism happened without a United States response. 
   We can't waver in our fight for freedom. We cannot abandon the bedrock of democracy; they are the brave and selfless men and women of our United States Armed Forces. We will stand up with them. We must stand up with them. And I will stand up with them in Congress, because they stand up for our freedom every minute of every day. They are the reason we call America the land of the free and the home of the brave. And I salute them. 
   Now, today I have the distinct privilege of managing time during this debate. Each person joining me is a shining example of duty, honor, country. And I know folks across America will learn a lot from hearing about their stories and hearing why they know firsthand freedom is not free.

   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, in closing, we have heard a lot of excellent presentation points today. I might just clarify the fact that the study group did recommend a surge in one part, and the President has eliminated the rules of engagement that we had laid on our troops over there, so we have a way to make this thing really happen. 
   I really want to know, if the Democrats insist they are supporting our troops, why they would not let me introduce my measure that mandates that Congress would support and fully fund the men and women in uniform. 
   I am positive that Democrats will attempt to cut funding as soon as the spending bills come up this spring, and maybe earlier, because there was a press conference earlier today that indicated exactly that.     
   I fear what that means for our troops on the ground, for their morale. The reality is that President Bush realized he needed to change the course in Iraq, and that is why he worked with folks on the ground in Iraq to hear fresh ideas and came up with a new plan. 
   The President wants change and that is why he changed the rules of engagement, enabling our guys to shoot at any suspected terrorists. The President wants change. That is why he removed political protections of all insurgents, so all of the bad guys could be brought to justice regardless of who they knew or who they worked for. 
   These ideas are huge breakthroughs and real solutions. These ideas represent fresh starts and new plans. What is the Democratic plan to move forward and win? They do not have one. Thirty-six hours of political grandstanding, nonbinding resolutions and petty posturing, they are not proposing solutions. They are not even encouraging new ideas. In fact, they stop them like when they squashed my amendment. 
   Many hope that the troop surge is the beginning of the end. We should all want that if it gets the job done. Yet the Democrats just say no. You know, the time will come when you can put the money behind these nonbinding resolutions. You better believe we will be watching and calling for those funding cuts loud and clear. America needs to know, cutting funds for our troops in harm's way is not a remedy. It is a ruse. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and yield the balance of my time to the next moderator, Mr. Saxton.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress is trying to keep the housing market afloat and is working on an unbridled government expansion of the Federal Housing Administration to do it. 
   I'm all for finding commonsense housing relief for those in trouble, but we need to hold hearings and take a closer look at this proposal and the ramifications. Just because the housing market has tumbled doesn't mean we should capriciously finance a big fat government bailout. Some in Congress want the FHA to ensure about $300 billion worth of risky mortgages, and they want the taxpayers to be held responsible when homeowners default on their loan. That makes no sense. 
   The Senate sent us a proposal to pay for the FHA expansion using a tax on mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unfortunately, Fannie and Freddie are in trouble and now looking for their own bailout. Why should taxpayers foot the bill to prop up those former giants when the company CEOs rake in a bundle and continue to do so? As one person said, It's privatized profits and socialized risk. 
   Apparently, Daniel Mudd, the CEO of Fannie Mae, received $11.6 million in salary, stock, and other compensation for 2007. Richard Syron, CEO of Freddie Mac, took home about $18.3 million last year. On top of his salary, stock options, and a $3.5 million bonus, Freddie Mac paid for a number of other perks for Syron such as a car and driver, a home security system, travel costs for his wife, even $100,000 to pay his lawyer to negotiate his employment contract with the bank. Now everyone knows I'm a strong supporter of freedom and free enterprise, but this is ridiculous, and I think even you all would agree. 
   The lack of accountability and responsibility is astounding. I will not support a bailout for speculators and a package that provides little help to real homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages on time. I do not believe we should ask people who rent homes or apartments and all of the people who reasonably and responsibly saved for a home to foot the bill for all of the people who are in foreclosure. That's just not right. 
   We should have empathy, but we should not write a blank check.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on November 1, the Nation's employment verification system, E-Verify, is going to expire. 
   E-Verify is a broken employment verification system that has helped grow the number of illegal immigrants in America to over 12 million. We have got to find new solutions. 
   Our bill, H.R. 5515, the New Employment Verification Act or NEVA, would  replace the current paper-based and error-prone I-9 process upon which E-Verify is based with an electronic verification system. H.R. 5515 would use the existing new hire registry reporting process already used by over 90 percent of U.S. employers. This bill will create a national employment verification system for new hires that's reliable and efficient. 
   With E-Verify scheduled to expire this year, now is the time for the Congress to create a new way to move forward that prevents unauthorized employment. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 5515.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. The price of gasoline has spiked up $2 since the Democrats took control of the Congress in just January 2007. Americans want Democrats and Republicans to work together to find commonsense solutions to the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. 
   The United States must become energy self-sufficient. Oil, gas, coal, nuclear, solar, and wind, all of it. To bring down the price of gasoline, we must focus on increasing America's energy supply. Congress needs to act now to increase exploration and boost America's refinery capability. 
   Americans are ready for action. They want an up-or-down vote on energy independence. A Democrat aide is quoted in The Hill newspaper as saying, ``Right now, our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' 
   If those are their only ideas, then, as the astronaut said when they were in orbit, Houston, we have a problem.
