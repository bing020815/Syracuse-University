<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 5501, TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on this rule and rise in strong support for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act, legislation that I note  is named after two very distinguished and respected leaders who served our Nation, as well as this Congress, so well. 
   And I want to commend the current leadership of Foreign Affairs Committee, the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Berman and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their leadership in moving this legislation to the floor in a bipartisan way. I also note that no President in history has done more for addressing the global AIDS crisis than our current President, President Bush. 
   Almost 33 million citizens of this planet today suffer from the consequences of HIV/AIDS. We have a moral responsibility to demonstrate leadership in addressing this crisis, which not only is a health issue, but it's a security issue for this globe. 
   We often think of Africa when we talk about global AIDS, but of the 33 million, there are also many living in our own hemisphere in Latin America and the Caribbean who suffer from HIV/AIDS as well. 
   In Latin America today, there are over 1.6 million people living with HIV/AIDS. That is up from 1.3 million in 2001. And we have lost 58,000 citizens of Latin America who have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS. In the Caribbean, 230,000 adults and children are currently known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. That is up from 190,000 in 2001. In the Caribbean, 11,000 citizens of the Caribbean have lost their lives. In Haiti alone, a large recipient of aid as a result of this initiative, almost 4 percent of the population of Haiti is infected with HIV/AIDS. Think about that, 190,000 people. Since 2004, thanks to this initiative, the number of people receiving care and support has grown from 30,000 to 125,000, and an anticipated 150,000 people will be reached this year because of this initiative in Haiti. Haiti has received almost $85 million from this program in the past year to address this crisis which affects many in the Caribbean. 
   This AIDS initiative has allowed us to reach almost every person in Haiti struggling with HIV/AIDS. And the continued support is necessary to make sure we reach every person struggling with HIV/AIDS throughout the world. That is why this legislation today is so very important. 
   Elsewhere in Latin America, let me give you another example in Bolivia. Bolivia is now able to use data to combat HIV/AIDS thanks to this legislation. In fact, real-time data is helping Bolivian health officials carry out more HIV/AIDS prevention education, including HIV counseling and testing services. And thanks to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, prevalence rates in Bolivia's general population has remained at one-tenth of 1 percent, which is a remarkable success compared to some of its neighbors. 
   This is good legislation. It is bipartisan legislation. I commend President Bush for his leadership. I commend the leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their leadership making this a bipartisan initiative. I urge an ``aye'' vote on final adoption and passage of this important legislation today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for the opportunity to speak. Of course, I come before this body today to stand in support of our bipartisan agreement put together by the President and our leadership in an effort to boost our economy. I do want to express to my chairman and my ranking member my disappointment, however, that this product didn't come through the committee, since I know we have good leaders, beginning with our chairman and ranking member, who have good ideas; and I believe this product should have come through the committee with committee action and committee input. But I do stand in support of what I feel is a good compromise. 
   Under this plan, a family of four making $70,000 a year in the district I represent in Illinois will see an extra $1,800 that they can use for family expenses, and that is a good thing, money that can be spent locally and creating local jobs. 
   I would like to focus on the component that I feel is the centerpiece of this stimulus package, which is the 50 percent bonus depreciation, a mechanism that works. It should be called, rather than bonus depreciation, it should be called the ``invest in American jobs component'' of the stimulus package. Because this extra 50 percent bonus depreciation goes to invest in new computers and company equipment and assembly lines, manufacturing lines, they are going to get an extra 50 percent for depreciation purposes. 
   That is an incentive to invest in American jobs here in America, and that is why bonus depreciation is so important. Because when we did it in 2003, it worked. You look at this chart here; and when bonus depreciation was passed into law, we saw an immediate jump in demand for U.S. manufactured goods. The law had an impact, and it had a big impact. 
   Now, I have heard reports today that our friends in the Senate, the Senate Finance Committee, according to reports, may be considering cutting in half the bonus depreciation. Well, in 2001, in the first Bush tax cut, we tried 30 percent bonus depreciation back in this period of time; and as you can see on the chart, it had a little bit of an impact, not very much. 
   As the House and Senate work out our differences if we pass different legislation, I urge that we keep the 50 percent bonus depreciation, again, the ``invest in American jobs'' provision that is in the stimulus act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support of this important legislation.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order against consideration of this bill because the bill violates clause 10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives which provides in pertinent part that ``it shall not be in order to consider any bill if the provisions of such measure affecting direct spending and revenues have the net effect of increasing the deficit'' over the 5- or 10-year budget scoring window. 
   This rule is commonly referred to as the pay-as-you-go rule or PAYGO and was enacted by the majority with great fanfare at the beginning of this Congress. 
   In reviewing the estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, I note that they have scored this bill as increasing the deficit by $14 billion over the next 5 years, and nearly $10 billion over the coming decade. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the table prepared by the Congressional Budget Office appear at this point in the Record.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Yogi Berra once said, this is like d&#233;ja 2 vu all over again. Yesterday after an 8-week delay, the House considered and failed to pass the legislation once again before us today. I continue to support providing extended unemployment benefits to workers who need it most. In fact, every Republican on the Ways and Means Committee supported extending unemployment benefits when this legislation was considered in committee 2 months ago; again, 8 weeks ago. 
   Again, Republicans want to extend unemployment benefits. And we want to help those who are hurting the most. We also recognize that it is time that we pass legislation that can become law. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, that is why I rise in strong opposition to the legislation before us today which does not satisfy the simple standard of helping those who need it most and who have worked a modest number of weeks to earn these benefits. 
   Yesterday, the Democratic leadership brought identical legislation to the  floor under a process normally reserved for naming post offices and honoring sports teams. This resulted in a take-it-or-leave-it approach to this very important issue of extending unemployment benefits, and the bill failed to gain enough votes, forcing us to return to the floor again today. 
   Now have our Democratic colleagues budged an inch? Absolutely not. Today we are considering the same legislation which once again fails to include a long-standing and reasonable policy requiring at least 20 weeks of work to qualify for extended unemployment benefits. 
   As several of us on this side of the aisle have noted, without this sensible requirement under H.R. 5749, workers could qualify for as many as 52 weeks of unemployment benefits, a full year, after having worked as little as one or two weeks. But whether someone worked two or 10 weeks or even 19 weeks, the simple fact is that current Federal law includes a straightforward rule that requires a modest minimum amount of work before someone can qualify for months, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 months of unemployment benefits courtesy of our taxpayers. 
   This 20-weeks rule is not too much to ask. It is fair, and it is inexcusable for the other side not to include such a reasonable, long-standing rule. In fact, to not include it, as the bill before us would do, is a radical, and I say that again, radical change, radical departure from current law. 
   My friends in the majority have called this issue a straw man. If it is just a straw man, why did they make the change? Why did they make this radical policy change that breaks 27 years of bipartisan policy which requires 20 weeks of work to qualify for a full year of unemployment benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a United States Department of Labor document that shows examples of States that would allow 1 year's benefits for only 1 or 2 weeks' work, including a State like Michigan where you would only have to work one week to be able to obtain, under this legislation, 52 weeks worth of benefits. 
   I would like to insert this Department of Labor document into the Record.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to state that I share the Speaker's admiration for Mr. Rangel and Mr. McDermott. I consider Mr. Rangel very intelligent, and I enjoy working with Mr. McDermott as well, but I do disagree with the distinguished Speaker on a point that she made. 
   You know, she was talking about 5.5 percent unemployment, which in my view is too high, but I would note that it seems sometimes the definition of a bad economy is who's in the White House. 
   In 1996, President Clinton stood before us at the State of the Union in January 1996. Unemployment was at 5.6 percent, higher than it is today. President Clinton said the economy was the healthiest it has been in three decades. Well, today unemployment is lower than it was when President Clinton made that statement. 
   So, we all agree the economy needs to be improved, but President Clinton would say it's the healthiest in decades, if he were standing again before us based on his definition of a healthy economy. 
   I would also note, as my good friend from Washington has made the point, that why are we talking about energy. When I talk to the folks back home in Illinois at the local grocery store, at the gas station, and people are commenting about food prices and energy prices, they say that when you have over $4 gasoline, that's bad for the economy. There's people losing jobs because energy costs are so high. 
   As we talk about statistics, and the distinguished Speaker referred to statistics, I would note that the approval rating of the Democrat Congress today is 16 percent. Only 16 percent of the American people think the Democrat majority is doing a good job. Now, historically, that would tell us that today's Congress is the least popular in recorded history. 
   No Congress has had a lower approval rating than the current Democrat majority. Why? Because since the Democratic majority became the majority in 2007, gasoline prices have gone up $1.73. Think about that. The Democrat majority has refused to expand the supply of gasoline, has refused to expand the supply of oil. Why? Because they are locking away, under their policies, domestic sources of oil and gasoline, and continuing to make us more dependent on foreign sources of oil, people like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and sources in the Mideast that we're dependent upon because of the Democrat majority's policies. 
   Again, there's a reason this Congress is the least popular in recorded history, because gasoline prices have gone up $1.73 since our Democratic friends gained the majority. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake).

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I had noted earlier, this Congress, the Democrat majority in the House today, has the lowest level of popularity, lowest level approval in recorded history, 16 percent. Why? Because of actions like today. 
   This legislation that is before us came out of committee 8 weeks ago. Eight weeks, 2 months, that those who are unemployed have exhausted their benefits and been asking for extended unemployment benefits. We in the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee said we want to work with our Democrat friends in the majority so we can pass a bill that's bipartisan, provides extend unemployment benefits and, frankly, becomes law. 
   I would note, there's a publication on Capitol Hill called Congress Daily. It shows that today's exercise is frankly just election-year politics, probably one more reason this Democratic majority has the lowest level of approval in recorded history of any Congress. This Democrat leadership today is quoted as saying, It's not what we had hoped. We'll keep trying. But ultimately this is clearly going to only be possible on the supplemental. 
   So, ladies and gentlemen, what we're doing today is an election-year exercise, and unfortunately, we've lost 8 weeks, which means that for 8 weeks, unemployed workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits have had to painfully wait for the action of this Congress. We want to work together in a bipartisan way. We want to pass legislation that will become law, and as my friend on the other side of the aisle knows, this bill isn't going to become law. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to one of the newest Members of the House of Representatives, the distinguished Member from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, several speakers have suggested that there is plenty of funds in Federal unemployment accounts to support these benefits. Today, those trust funds include $35 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office suggests this legislation will spend about $14 billion over the next 2 years. 
   But that's just the start. This program will run from July through March of 2009; that's 9 months. But once started, such programs have always been extended. The average duration of these temporary programs is about 30 months. Do the math. That's more than three times as long as the legislation before us suggests. So this program could very well wind up costing at least three times as much as the score of this bill says. Three times 14 billion is 42 billion; 42 billion is more than the 35 billion in the current unemployment trust funds. 
   The last time Congress created a program like this that drained the Federal unemployment accounts in the 1970s, it had to create a temporary surtax that applies to all workers. That temporary surtax still exists today; it is more than 30 years old. 
   It's important to note, Mr. Speaker, this legislation not only adds to the deficit, but it's going to force a tax increase. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Republican leader of the House, Mr. Boehner of Ohio.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I would note, the legislation before us, as was so eloquently described by the Republican leader of the House, makes some radical changes. For 27 years, Republicans and Democrats have had in place a work rule requirement for federally funded unemployment benefits. It said, to qualify for up to a year, 12 months, you should work 20 weeks. That seems a fair trade off between work and benefits. And this legislation before us, Mr. Speaker, removes that requirement. 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle refer to that concern as just kind of a straw man, it doesn't really matter. Well, why did they do it? Why is there a need to remove a 20-week work requirement to qualify for 12 months or a full year of unemployment benefits? We've had no hearings in committee. No one has explained why they're making this radical change. It just seems to be omitted from the presentations by the majority side of the aisle. So again we ask why. You know, under this policy that they're putting forward, someone would only need to work 2 weeks in a State like Michigan or Illinois and qualify for a full 1 year or 12 months of federally funded unemployment benefits. That's a radical policy change. 
   And let me just repeat what every Republican has stated: We want to extend unemployment benefits for those workers in hard-hit States who have exhausted their benefits. And we have repeatedly offered to our friends on the other side of the aisle saying we want to get a bill signed into law. Let's set aside election-year politics, let's work together, let's extend benefits for those who have exhausted their benefits another 13, and in some cases, 26 weeks. But we want to work together to get it done, because if we don't, and we just do the usual politics as usual, election-year politics, bring legislation to the floor we know is not going to become law, make speeches, the folks back home are going to be disappointed. 
   As has been noted by many, this Congress today only enjoys a 16-percent approval rating amongst the people of Illinois, the people of America. That is the lowest approval rating of any Congress in recorded history. Why? Because of the election-year politics that are being practiced today. 
   So I'm going to again offer to my good friends on the other side of the aisle, people who I am very fond of, people I enjoy working with, we need to work together because people are hurting. We need to work together to help those in our States who are unemployed and who have exhausted their benefits. And because of election-year politics, unemployed workers in States like Michigan and Illinois, who have exhausted their benefits, have gone without. Why? Because Congress has played election-year politics. 
   So let's work together. I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation because it's not going to become law. I urge a ``no'' vote so that we work together to solve this challenge and quickly place on the President's desk legislation that will become law that extends unemployment benefits because we support extending unemployment benefits. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit supports extension of unemployment benefits for long-term unemployed, those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits. And this motion to recommit makes three simple changes to the legislation before us. It adds a requirement of 20 weeks of work for workers to qualify for the extended unemployment benefits. It targets benefits to high unemployment States, and it provides additional money to many of the newly hired individuals to help them deal with the high price of gasoline. 
   I particularly want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Biggert, Mr. Bilirakis and others for the help that they have given in crafting this motion to recommit as we work towards extension of unemployment benefits to those who need help. 
   First, I would note that this motion reinserts the current law requirement that workers who qualify for Federal extended unemployment benefits must have worked at least 20 weeks before being laid off. This requirement was removed by the majority with the underlying legislation. 
   This commonsense Federal requirement has been in place since 1981 and was included in the temporary extended benefits program Congress created in 2002, our last extended benefit program. 
   Nearly every Democrat Member voted for that bill then, and as we have discussed on this floor for the last 2 days, there is no good reason, there is no argument that has been made by the other side to impose the reestablishment of this long-standing Federal policy now. 
   Second, this motion would specify that only individuals in States with unemployment rates above 5 percent or that have seen a sharp rise in unemployment would be eligible for 13 weeks of Federal extended benefits. As under H.R. 5749, individuals in States with unemployment rates above 6 percent would be eligible for up to 26 weeks of Federal extended benefits. 
   Today, 22 States have unemployment rates above 5 percent or have seen a sharp rise in rates, including six States above 6 percent. So workers in nearly half of the States would be eligible for extended benefits, which could rise, or more would be eligible if States experience a rise in unemployment rates. 
   In contrast with H.R. 5749, this motion would not extend benefits in States that currently have unemployment rates below 5 percent, and I would note that 5 percent is low by historical standards, and that have not been experiencing rising rates. They will continue to be eligible for their basic 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. So I would note that they will continue to have unemployment benefits available to laid-off workers. 
   Moreover, by targeting benefits to where they are needed most, this motion actually reduces the cost of the bill, reduces the deficit, and makes it much more fiscally responsible than the untargeted, unpaid-for, ``in violation of the House rules'' legislation that has been offered by the majority. 
   And third, we all know that every American family is struggling with record gasoline prices. That struggle is especially pronounced for unemployed workers and in particular the long-term unemployed. Those who return to work, however, may face high commuting costs, starting with the high price of gas they must put in their tanks to get to a new job. 
   And I would note that this Democratic Congress, which is the least popular Congress in recorded history because of its lack of action on energy, has refused to allow for increases in domestically produced fuels which we need to help our economy. 
   In fact, it is the Democrat policies in the last year and a half since January 2007 which are responsible for an increase in gasoline prices of $1.73, basically a doubling of gasoline prices since our Democratic friends gained the majority. That's why gasoline prices are over $4. 
   We want to help American workers. And that is why we are offering help to alleviate the high price of gasoline for unemployed individuals. This motion would provide 1 extra week of extended unemployment benefits for those who return to work without exhausting their extended benefits. On average, this would mean an extra $290 per eligible worker. So for an unemployed mother who goes back to work with two children, that could mean up to four tanks of gasoline at today's $4 gasoline prices, probably enough to get her to and from her first full month on the job. Especially for someone who might not have much money left after a long spell of unemployment, that is real relief where today it is desperately needed, at the pump and in the pocketbook. 
   Mr. Speaker, this motion provides timely, targeted and temporary assistance, something the Speaker herself called for earlier this year. So we talked about boosting the economy. I urge its adoption so we can send this bill to the Senate and down to the White House as soon as possible. As the President said, he will veto the underlying bill. Passage of this motion to recommit will give us a bill the President will sign, and it will become law, and we can help unemployed workers. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule and to note that Republicans support an extension of unemployment benefits for those who are suffering, those who need help. 
   I've enjoyed the debate of my friends on the other side of the aisle who point out, they try and blame the minority party for the delay in bringing this legislation to the floor. And I would note that the majority party controls the schedule, and the majority party can pass anything they want in the House. So I would note that the House Ways and Means Committee acted on the particular bill that we have before us 8 weeks ago. Eight weeks ago. 
   Now, some, my good friend from Michigan refers to this debate as being embarrassing. I think it's embarrassing in this legislative process that it's taken 8 weeks, this legislation, to come to the floor of the House to be debated, particularly when people in Michigan and Illinois have exhausted their benefits. And the Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee voted for a proposal which could become law, which would have provided extended unemployment benefits for those workers in Michigan and Illinois who have exhausted their unemployment benefits. Eight weeks it's taken for this emergency legislation to come to the floor. Eight weeks. 
   I would note that a major concern many of us have in this legislation that's before us is that it takes a radical approach. It eliminates a 27-year policy that was supported by both Democrats and Republicans. The bill that is before us repeals a requirement that you work 20 weeks to get a full year's benefits. 
   In Michigan, under this legislation, you would work 1 week and be able to get 52 weeks of benefits. In my State of Illinois, you can work 2 weeks and get 52 weeks of benefits under this legislation. 
   Now, do taxpayers feel that that is fair? 
   We, as the minority party, the Republicans, we want to extend benefits, unemployment benefits to those who need help.     
   My district, my home State, we have unemployed workers who've exhausted their benefits. We want to ensure that their benefits are extended so that they can receive an additional 13- and 26-weeks' worth of benefits. 
   And we had a proposal in the Ways and Means Committee which would have accomplished that goal. All of the Republicans voted for it, and the President would sign it into law. But instead, we're seeing election year politics today. That's what this is all about. It's 8 weeks. Think about that. For 8 weeks. If you're a Michigan worker and you have been unemployed, you have exhausted your benefits, you have been waiting 8 weeks.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, first I want to say on behalf of all of my colleagues our thoughts and prayers are with our good friend and distinguished ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Jim McCrery. Mr. McCrery is not with us today, and he and his family mourn the untimely passing of Jim's sister. Our thoughts are with Congressman McCrery and his entire family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of extending unemployment benefits, and I have sponsored legislation to accomplish that goal. All Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee supported extending benefits when our committee considered this legislation in April. But today I rise in opposition to the legislation that's before the House today which includes a radical departure from long-standing Federal policy when it comes to the balance between work and extended benefits. And I am especially opposed to the cynical election-year maneuvering reflected in how the House is considering this important issue today. 
   Federal law since 1981 has required at least 20 weeks of work before collecting Federal-extended benefits. The temporary program created in 2002 continued this commonsense policy. I believe requiring at least 20 weeks of work to qualify for Federal extended unemployment benefits is perfectly fair, but the majority of Democrats do not. So the legislation before us today makes a radical departure from 27 years of Federal policy by striking the commonsense 20-week work requirement. 
   Ironically, nearly every Democratic Member in the House supported this same requirement as part of the temporary program Congress created in 2002. Yet today, without a single hearing on this topic, this legislation would strike that sensible long-standing requirement. 
   So under this legislation, some individuals will receive 12 months of total unemployment benefits after having worked for as little as 2 weeks in some cases before being laid off. Does the majority think that this is fair to taxpayers to pay 12 months of unemployment benefits in exchange for less than 1 month of work? 
   Since the 1930s, unemployment benefits have been paid to those strongly attached to the workforce. That's the logic behind expecting at least 20 weeks of work before layoff for those who go on to collect Federal-extended benefits. It is not too much to expect someone who has worked for at least 20 weeks to collect up to 12 months of unemployment benefits. 
   What makes this worse, this legislation is being considered under rules that prevent any opportunities for amendments, that prevent any opportunities for substitutes or other avenues to correct what we believe is a serious error in this radical approach. 
   The way this bill is being considered is under a process usually reserved for naming post offices and honoring sports teams. In the past 2 years, this House has named 87 post offices using this process, and today by using this same process, House majority leaders trivialize the important issue of extending unemployment benefits to those who are hurting. And it didn't have to be this way. 
   Every Republican on the Ways and Means Committee supported extending unemployment benefits in some fashion 2 months ago. And I suspect almost every Member of this House shares that view today. The only disagreement involves whether there should be a minimum work requirement, among other important details. 
   But 2 months, again that's 2 months after this so-called emergency legislation was considered in the Ways and Means Committee, here we are 2 months later with the Majority's flawed take-it-or-leave-it approach. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize many workers are hurting. I continue to support extending help to those who need it most. Unfortunately, the bill before us insists on paying extended unemployment benefits even to those who have worked for only a fraction of the time they will collect benefits. 
   This radical policy is a departure from current law, a 27-year-old bipartisan policy, and that's simply not right. And the way this legislation is being considered is an affront to all Americans. This bill was brought directly to the floor without as much as a hearing in committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a letter here from the Executive Office of the President stating the President's position. The administration strongly opposes this legislation, H.R. 5479, and they state that if it were presented to the President, the senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill. 
   I place it into the Record at this time.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would note that most House Republicans and the administration have stated that we all support an extension of unemployment benefits. In fact, the letter we just placed in the Record says the administration would sign into law a 13-week extension that is targeted, providing the extended benefits that we all would like to see. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to yield to my good friend from Michigan, I would note that, again, the legislation before us is a radical change which eliminates the 20-week work requirement to qualify for a full 12 months of unemployment benefits, and that's why it's important we debate it, and that's why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   With that, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlelady from the State of Michigan.

Mr. Speaker, it's interesting as we debate this legislation that some have criticized targeted help for those who we would like to provide extended unemployment benefits for, and of course, the bill before us actually targets the final 13 weeks of a year's worth of unemployment benefits with a 6 percent trigger, and it's also interesting that a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee from Michigan, Mr. Levin, labels that 6 percent trigger for that targeted approach ``ruthless,'' a description that he uses to describe his own legislation.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Well, Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to state that I believe the vast majority of Members of this House overwhelmingly support extension of unemployment benefits for those who need help. We're debating the legislation before us that makes a radical change in qualifying for unemployment benefits. In fact, you can work as little as 2 weeks and obtain up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits in the State of Illinois under their current policy if this legislation were to become law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I note with some humor my good friend from Washington State's comments about whether or not I proposed legislation to right the wrong that I have been raising. Actually, existing law for extending benefits requires 20 weeks' worth. So there is no need for legislation to maintain existing law. What is important to point out is that this legislation eliminates that 20-week work requirement in order to qualify for 52 weeks of unemployment benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to echo the majority leader's comments when I agree that this issue, the issue of extending unemployment benefits, should not be a Republican or Democrat issue. And we, of course, on our side of the aisle, want to extend unemployment benefits for those who need help. And we are prepared to work, as we have been, to achieve that goal. 
   I would note that 8 weeks ago when the Ways and Means Committee took up this legislation, it was deemed emergency legislation. It had to move through the committee quickly. It was an emergency. We had to do it right away. Well 2 months later it finally comes to the floor. And I believe that if we want to be compassionate, if we want to help those who need help, we need to do it in the right way. And that is if it is an emergency, we should have done it 8 weeks ago, number one, but we should also do it in the proper legislative way of ensuring that it is a bipartisan bill and that we construct it in a way that recognizes what has worked in the past. And I would note, as the majority leader said, back in 2002, we passed a bipartisan unemployment extension legislation that was signed into law by the President, and it maintained a 27-year precedent which was that one should have to work for 20 weeks in order to qualify for 52 weeks' worth of unemployment benefits. 
   And that is the big concern here with this legislation today. There is a radical departure from an established policy of 27 years of requiring 20 weeks of work to qualify for a full year of unemployment benefits. And the legislation before us today repeals that. It eliminates a 27-year precedent. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Let's bring this legislation back tomorrow, under a rule, and allow an amendment to be offered to strike this radical change. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose this rule. I also rise to oppose the way that the House majority, the Democratic majority, is managing this legislation, bringing forward a fiscal year irresponsible supplemental bill. 
   I would note, as I recall, on January 29, the Speaker of the House made a statement on the bipartisan economic stimulus package that was about to pass, and Speaker Pelosi said, ``Let's hope for the Senate to take their lead from us and be disciplined, focused, fiscally responsible, and act in a timely, temporary, and targeted way on behalf of meeting the needs of the American people.'' 
   I agree with the Speaker that we should act in a way that is timely, temporary and targeted. 
   Unfortunately, that's not what the House is being offered today. In addition to a large tax increase, the bill before us today includes an untargeted and overly expensive extension of unemployment benefits. 
   Consistent with the Speaker's call for targeting help to those who need it most, I introduced legislation and offered an amendment in the Ways and Means Committee to focus extended unemployment benefits on people and States with relatively high or fast-rising unemployment rates. 
   Combined with regular unemployment benefits available in all States under my amendment, a total of 39 weeks of benefits would be available to unemployed workers whose jobs are hardest to find. On Main Street U.S.A. that helps those who need the help most. Yet this targeted approach was rejected by our Democratic colleagues, the majority on the committee. 
   Why target benefits? Why target benefits to only relatively high unemployment States? For the same reason, the Democratic legislation proposes longer benefits in high unemployment States because workers there have a harder time finding new jobs and thus are in need of extended benefits. 
   Targeting is especially important today since today's national unemployment rate is a low 5.0 percent with a third of all States having unemployment rates below 4 percent. That national unemployment rate is well below the lowest prior level when such a program was created in the past. I have a note in 2002 it was 5.7 percent, and, again, today's unemployment rate is 5 percent. 
   This targeted approach that I offered is also more fiscally responsible. The untargeted Democratic approach costs at least twice as much as a targeted approach and, as the Congressional Budget Office has reported, the Democrat legislation will require State tax increases to pay those additional costs. 
   The bill before the House would require State tax increases, State tax hikes, totaling $1 billion over just next 5 years. 
   If this program is extended, as all such temporary programs have been, the tax increases required will only grow. The Speaker was right, we need to act in a way that is fiscally responsible and targeted. 
   Unfortunately, this legislation before us today achieves neither of these goals and adds to budget deficits and requires payroll tax increases. We can and should do better than this.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today politics trumps policy. If regular order had been followed in this House, allowing this tax increase to go through the Ways and Means Committee, we would have a better understanding of the consequences of today's $14 billion tax increase. 
   You know, if the House of Representatives was subjected to the truth-in-labeling requirement, H.R. 6 would be called the Ship Jobs Overseas Act because it imposes a $14 billion tax increase on investing in America. 
   We have all heard the campaign rhetoric; both sides use it: you know, the Tax Code sends jobs overseas. Well today, this House may well do that if it votes to pass this $14 billion tax increase. 
   I support replacing imported oil with home-grown biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, as well as alternatives sources of energy like wind power and solar. And thanks to the energy bill we passed in the previous Congress, there are hundreds of millions of dollars in new wind investment in the district I represent, six new ethanol and biodiesel plants moving forward in our districts; and because I am concerned about climate change, I believe we need to do more. 
   That is why I believe 25 percent of our energy that we consume by 2025 should come from nonfossil fuel sources. 
   This bill doesn't do anything about that because H.R. 6 only raises taxes. I would note that one of the biggest refineries in America is in the district I represent, providing 600 jobs. That particular company is investing $1 billion right now to expand. They chose to expand in America, creating American jobs. They could have expanded in Venezuela, making Hugo Chavez happy; but they chose to invest here. And what is their reward? Higher taxes. 
   That is why this legislation, H.R. 6, should be called the Ship Jobs Overseas  Act. Think about it, if you invest in energy in America, you invest in oil and natural gas development in America, my friends on the other side of the aisle want you to pay higher taxes. I urge a ``no'' vote.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6, the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act of 2007. I rise in opposition because this bill before us today will make our country more dependent on foreign oil and less secure. 
   It's pretty safe to say that every Member here supports the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It's a national security issue and it hits home every single day when people go to the pumps to fill up their vehicles. 
   And I agree with the concept of this bill that our Nation must invest in renewable sources of energy like ethanol, biodiesel, wind and solar. In the upcoming weeks I will be introducing multiple pieces of legislation that will increase our use of renewable energy and I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with those in the majority to make some of these ideas a reality. 
   What really doesn't make sense to me is that, in this bill, the majority do the complete opposite of achieving the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
   They are going to raise the taxes of oil companies that produce oil here domestically and make it more difficult to produce oil here at home. 
   In my district, ExxonMobil has one of the largest domestic refineries in the country, employing approximately 509 people. 
   Over the last 5 years, they have invested more than $500 million in the Joliet Refinery of which about $300 million was for equipment to produce low sulfur gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. 
   In 2007 and 2008 they plan to invest more than $400 million to install additional control equipment. 
   Now, by passing this bill, we are going to be sending the message to companies like Exxon who by 2008 will have invested close to a billion dollars in central Illinois, saying ``Thanks for investing in America, now we are going to raise your taxes.'' 
   Bills just like this here before us today should be labeled ``the send jobs overseas act'' because that is exactly what it will do. Close to a thousand energy related jobs in my district and the approximately 1.8 million jobs in the U.S. are put in jeopardy now because of this policy that discourages investment in America. 
   And who are the big winners of this bill? Leaders like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and OPEC who are watching this and loving the fact that we are passing punitive tax policy on domestic energy producers. 
   With the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we took steps forward in reducing our dependence on foreign oil by creating policy that increased the use of renewable energy in tandem with increasing our domestic production of energy sources. 
   Due to the Energy bill, we have seen hundreds of millions invested in wind energy and four to five new ethanol and biodiesel plants in my district. In total, we saw investment in renewable energy double in the United States to $68 billion. 
   We need to go back to those roots of encouraging investment here in the United States. 
   This bill makes us less secure and more dependent on foreign oil. 
   Vote against this send jobs overseas act that will raise taxes and discourage investment here in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. I rise in support of bringing this important agreement to the House floor. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I come from the State of Illinois. I represent a district that's heavily dependent on exports for growing our economy. We make heavy construction equipment. We grow a lot of corn and soybeans. We export a tremendous amount of plastics and petrochemicals. This trade agreement is a big winner for States like Illinois as it is for our Nation. 
   You know, right now our products made in Colombia, whether farm products or manufactured goods, they enter the United States essentially duty free. The Andean Nations of Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia, they've got the opportunity for all their products to come to the United States duty free, but our products made in America face taxes when they're exported to Colombia. In fact, the bulldozers made in my district, I have 8,000 workers, union workers who work for Caterpillar, they make the yellow bulldozers. Mining is a big industry in Colombia, we want to sell those products there, but they face 15 percent tariffs when they're exported. It makes them harder to compete with the Asians. 
   The corn and soybeans and livestock products produced in my district, they face tariffs today up to 40 percent, making it hard to compete with the Argentineans and Brazilians and the Colombian market, a nation of over 40 million people. 
   The bottom line is 80 percent of U.S. exports to Colombia will be duty free immediately once this trade agreement goes into effect. And I would note that, as we've seen, countries like Chile and the central American countries and elsewhere where we have trade agreements, we've seen 50 percent faster growth in exports in nations who have trade agreements than those who do not. 
   And I would note also, again, Colombian products come to the United States duty free, tariff free, but our products face barriers going in. This agreement eliminates those and makes trade a two-way street. It's an important agreement, and I urge it be brought up for a vote and I urge bipartisan support. 
   Those who oppose this trade agreement say Colombia hasn't done enough. And I want to begin by asking, who is the Republic of Colombia? What nation in Latin America is the oldest democracy in Latin America? It's Colombia. What nation is the second largest Spanish-speaking nation in all Latin America? Colombia. What nation is the most reliable ally of the United States, particularly when it comes to counterterrorism and counternarcotics? Colombia. And what nation has done more under its current democratically elected president to reduce violence in Latin America? It's Colombia, clearly. 
   Colombia is not only a friend of the United States, in fact, our enemies in Latin America identify Colombia as our best friend. And they say, you know, watch the United States, they always turn their back on their friends; watch how they treat Colombia when it comes to this trade agreement. 
   And those who would argue against this trade agreement say, you know, you've got to look at the labor violence, you've got to look at the violence in the country; and Colombia just has not done enough to address violence. Well, President Uribe is the most popular elected president in this entire hemisphere. This Congress today suffers from a 15 percent approval rating, President Uribe in Colombia has an 80 percent approval rating. He was elected to reduce the violence in his country, and he succeeded. 
   In fact, 71 percent of Colombians today say they feel more secure because of President Uribe. Seventy-three percent say President Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down 40 percent, kidnappings are down 76 percent. Colombians feel free to drive anywhere in Colombia. And I would point out that today, the murder rate in Colombia is lower than Washington, D.C., it's lower than Baltimore. It's safer to walk the streets of Bogota, Colombia than it is in Washington, D.C., yet those who oppose this agreement say the murder rate is too high and that Colombia needs to do more. But Washington, D.C. is more violent than Colombia. 
   Here's the facts: When it comes to labor violence, President Uribe has made major changes. He has increased the Prosecutor General's budget by 72 percent in the last 2 years. He has added over 2,100 new posts, adding 418 new prosecutors, 445 new investigators. He has done so much that the President of the United Workers Confederation of Colombia says, ``never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important.'' Yet there are those who want to turn their back on President Uribe in Colombia. 
   And when it comes specifically to protections provided to labor leaders, and I have met with many Colombian labor leaders, and they note that in Colombia, if you're a labor activist or labor leader and you feel in danger, you can request special protection from the government.     
   And last year under President Uribe, they spent $39 million providing body guards and special protection for labor leaders and labor activists. In fact, almost 2,000 labor leaders and activists have participated in this program, and it's been so successful that no labor leader who has requested the assistance has been denied because it's provided to those who are denied it, but also no one who has ever participated has ever been a victim of violence. It's been successful. And as the Washington Post noted, and you don't want to see anyone lose their life, but the murder rate for labor activists is actually lower than the murder rate for the average citizens of Colombia. And, again, it's safer to walk the streets of Bogota than it is in Washington, D.C. from the standpoint of being a victim of violent crime or, frankly, a victim of murder. 
   The International Labor Organization has recognized the progress Colombia has made. In fact, they have removed Colombia from its labor watch list. And Colombia has agreed to have a permanent International Labor Organization representative in Colombia. 
   Just a few weeks ago, this House overwhelmingly, with bipartisan support, ratified the U.S.-Peru agreement, and Colombia has agreed to every same labor condition that was demanded of Peru. Colombia has agreed to the same. So for those who demanded it, they should be proclaiming victory. 
   The bottom line is Colombia is a friend of the United States. And there are those who want to kill this agreement, those what want to turn their back on Colombia. Let's remember this agreement is good for Americans, it's also good for Colombia, but our best friend in Latin America is Colombia. They deserve a vote and they deserve a ``yes'' vote, bipartisan support, for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Let me begin by congratulating the chairman of this committee, Mr. Rangel, and the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Mr. Levin, as well as the two ranking Republicans, Mr. McCrery and Mr. Herger, for their leadership in bringing this important trade agreement to the floor. I also want to congratulate Ambassador Susan Schwab, our trade negotiator, as well as her predecessor, Rob Portman, in their good work and frankly also congratulate the leadership of Peru, particularly President Garcia and former President Toledo and their administrations. 
   Mr. Speaker, trade is important to my State of Illinois. One out of five jobs in Illinois is dependent on exports, and 40 percent of the agricultural products in the State of Illinois are dependent on exports.     
   In fact, 17,000 Illinois companies export. And trade agreements are working for Illinois. My State benefits, my district benefits. In fact, if you look at the nations that we have free trade agreements with, they represent almost half of all our exports today, even though they represent only 7 percent of all the nations. And free trade, in the last 10, 12 years has created 16 million jobs nationwide, thousands in my own State. And this trade agreement here is good for Illinois manufacturers; it's good for Illinois farmers. 
   You know, my friend Mr. McCrery pointed out that the current status quo, which was renewed recently by this Congress, gives Peru a pretty good deal. Their manufactured goods, their farm products come into the United States duty free. But our products made in Illinois, manufactured goods and farm products, face tariffs going into Peru. 
   Well, this trade agreement makes trade with Peru a two-way street. On day one of this trade agreement going into effect, 80 percent of the tariffs on manufactured products from Illinois are eliminated. 
   Now, I have 8,000 workers, 8,000 union workers who make yellow construction equipment, well-recognized household name, in my district. And half of the product they produce is exported. This agreement's good for them. 
   But under the current status quo, those mining trucks, those off-road construction equipment that are produced in Joliet and Decatur, they face a 12 percent tariff. And that equipment's a $1 million piece of equipment. That's $120,000 tariff tax imposed on that yellow piece of equipment when it's exported to Peru today. 
   And under this trade agreement, that tariff is eliminated on day one, allowing U.S.-made, Illinois-made construction equipment to be more competitive with their Japanese and Asian competition. It means jobs in Illinois. 
   And I would note, if you care about agriculture in Illinois, farmers will tell you that the Peru and Colombia trade agreements are the best ever for agriculture. This agreement deserves bipartisan support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule as well as this trade agreement. 
   You know, exports are pretty important to the State that I represent. We have jobs at stake that are dependent on exports in Illinois. In fact, for manufacturing, one out of five manufacturing jobs in Illinois depend on exports. 17,000 Illinois companies depend on exports. And when it comes to agriculture, 40 percent of all the corn and soybeans and farm products produced in Illinois depend on exports. So trade makes a big difference, and trade agreements are important. 
   We win with trade agreements. You look at the record; since 2002, we have nine countries that we have free trade agreements with. In those countries,  our exports grew by 19 percent, which is 50 percent faster than the overall growth in exports. Morocco grew 67 percent, Bahrain grew 40 percent, Chile grew 30 percent. We have free trade agreements with 7 percent of the world's countries, representing 14 percent of the gross domestic product of the globe, but those free trade agreements represent half of the exports from America. And free trade in the last dozen or so years has created 16 million new jobs. 
   We've got a good trade agreement before us tonight. Peru is a strong ally and friend of the United States. We have an agreement before us that's good for Illinois and it's good for America. On day one, 80 percent of our exports of consumer and industrial products become duty free immediately. Illinois already exports $198 million in exports to Peru. And it's predicted that exports from key industries will rise as much as 57 percent as a result of this agreement. That's not just the big companies. Small and medium-size enterprises also benefit from tariff elimination. My biggest manufacturer is Caterpillar. They make the yellow construction equipment; 8,000 workers in my district dependent on Caterpillar for their jobs. Today, they face a 12 percent tariff on the equipment that they want to export to Peru. On a million dollar mining truck, that's $120,000 tariff tax. It goes away on day one. 
   And those union workers at Caterpillar, and I would note, 8,000 workers, half of the production in Joliet, the biggest city in my district, is exported today. So they depend on trade. 
   So, the Peru agreement creates jobs in Illinois. Illinois manufacturers are expecting to see a 51 percent increase in exports. And I would note that Peruvian products coming into Illinois today face no tariffs, but Illinois products going to Peru do. 
   And the Peru Trade Agreement is also good for Illinois farmers. Soybeans become duty free immediately; many new markets for Illinois farmers. And before this agreement, Illinois pork and corn were at a competitive disadvantage with our competition in South America, Chile and Argentina, who don't face the high tariffs we do, and so they undercut us on prices, hurting our farmers. This agreement helps Illinois pork, corn, soybean, and other agricultural producers. In fact, farm organizations will tell you, those representing producers will tell you that the Peru and Colombian agreements are the best ever negotiated to break down barriers for American farm products. It is estimated that agriculture alone will see a $700 million increase in exports as a result of the Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   This trade agreement also has broader implications. As you know, there are some negative forces threatening democracy in Latin America today, and Peru is a shining example of a working democracy with strong leadership. And President Toledo and President Garcia, his successor, are making a difference. Poverty is being reduced; real jobs are being created. 
   Peru is an economic success story. You don't see Peru resorting to anti-American rhetoric and populist rhetoric. You see Peru being a responsible partner with its neighbors. This trade agreement is part of their strategy to reduce poverty. 
   Let's vote for this agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of this important legislation in order to provide additional needed assistance to the long-term unemployed. As my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will note today, this is an issue that truly matters to millions of Americans, and it's important that we pass this legislation today as our last act before we leave for the election campaign. 
   As data released just this morning shows, that need is rising. While the unemployment rate remains steady at 6.1 percent, the number of unemployed grew once again to a total of 9.5 million Americans. In the past year, 2.2 million Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed. Even more importantly, for purposes of this legislation before us today, the number of long-term unemployed, those who have been out of work for more than 6 months and who are in need of extended benefits, increased by 167,000, to over 2 million. 
   In my home State of Illinois, the numbers are, if anything, even worse. The current unemployment rate is 7.3 percent, and nearly half a million of my fellow Illinois citizens are out of work. 
   The people who would benefit most by this legislation are long-term unemployed people who want to work and are searching for a job, but not able to find one. Today's rising level of unemployment goes a long way to explaining why it is so hard for them to find a new job and why this additional assistance is needed today. 
   This legislation focuses the most additional benefits on workers and States where the unemployment rate is highest and where jobs are hardest to find. That sort of targeting is something Republicans have been calling for all this year. 
   Madam Speaker, I expect that passage today of this current extended benefits program will be bipartisan, just as we acted in a bipartisan way in June to create this temporary extended benefits program. Like the similar program we created after the 2001 recession and the 9/11 attacks, this program helps those who are out of work the longest, at a time when jobs are increasingly hard to find. 
   My colleagues should know this program continues the requirement that those benefiting from extended unemployment benefits had to have worked at least 20 weeks. This requirement has been in Federal law since 1981. That is why Americans were rightly concerned about proposals to eliminate that work requirement and allow 39 weeks or, under the legislation before us today, as many as 59 weeks of total unemployment benefits to be paid to those who have previously only worked for a few weeks.     
   The program we are expanding today and passing today maintains this commonsense ``20 weeks of work'' rule, which ensures balance between work and taxes paid in and benefits paid out. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish this legislation were not necessary, but today it is. The economic concerns affecting the stock and credit markets that we all see have real effects on real people with real jobs. This legislation says we will provide additional assistance to those who have been hurt the most and have been out of work the longest. 
   I particularly want to thank my colleagues Jon Porter of Nevada and Phil English of Pennsylvania, who have been leaders on this issue, urging the House to act. I know they cosponsored this legislation before us today. 
   Today's action is a useful step, but we need to do more to promote a stronger economy so that those who today need these benefits can return to their former work or find new, good-paying jobs to support their families. That task remains before this Congress and is something this Congress needs to refocus on in the months ahead. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Just a couple of weeks ago my friend Jim McDermott, the chairman of our subcommittee, and I were on the floor with our bipartisan child welfare legislation, legislation that is going to become law. At that time, I thought that would probably and likely be the last time I would be working with the chairman to manage important legislation before this House. But I want to thank Chairman McDermott for recognizing the urgency and the importance of bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
   The bottom line is there are Americans who are hurting today. Unemployment is up. The numbers that we saw this morning show that there are more Americans who are unemployed than there were last month. The State I represent, the State of Illinois, has a current unemployment rate of 7.3 percent. Half a million Illinoisans are out of work. This legislation will particularly help those Illinois constituents of mine who have been unemployed for a long time, they have exhausted their benefits, they have had a hard time finding a new job. But they still have to put food on the table, they still have to make ends meet, they still need to provide for their families. And this legislation will help ensure they have the help they need. 
   Again, I want to thank my chairman for not only his partnership, but his friendship, and say that it has been an enjoyable experience to work as his ranking member on this subcommittee. 
   And again, Mr. Chairman, I believe this will be the last time I speak before the House of Representatives unless we have a lame duck session. There are issues we do need to address in that lame duck session, and we need to find ways to continue to grow this economy. To me, that is cause enough to have a lame duck session after the elections. But if not, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your partnership on this legislation which is so important to millions of Americans, almost 10 million Americans who today are unemployed looking for work. We want to help those who are looking for work. 
   This legislation deserves bipartisan support. I hope it passes unanimously. Madam Speaker, again, I urge bipartisan support. I urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING FOSTER PARENTS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, likewise to the chairman of the subcommittee, which I have the privilege of serving as the ranking member, I just want to state that I enjoy working with you very much as well, and thank you for your compliment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1185, recognizing May as National Foster Care Month. This resolution recognizes the enormous contribution of foster parents who care for so many vulnerable young people across America. And I want to commend its chief sponsors, Representative Jon Porter of Nevada and Chairman McDermott, for sponsoring and introducing this important resolution. 
   The House is considering this resolution right between Mother's Day and Father's Day, which is appropriate, since foster parents step in to take the place of biological mothers and fathers. Taxpayers themselves contribute literally billions of dollars each year in Federal and State assistance to this important effort. But the most important part is the simple willingness of responsible adults to step in and care for kids who cannot safely remain with their own parents. For that, as this resolution expresses, the Nation says thank you. 
   Many other people work to support foster parents through both public and private organizations and in paid and volunteer positions alike. We express our thanks to those dedicated people as well. One example in the congressional district I represent, groups like The Baby Fold, which provides a variety of services to support biological and foster families. We thank all of these individuals for their continuing effort and dedication to improving the lives of children and their families. 
   In spite of all the hard work by individuals involved at all levels in the Nation's foster care system, more work is needed to ensure all children have a safe home, are protected from abuse, and have the best opportunities to lead a healthy and productive life. 
   The Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, on which I serve as ranking member, has held numerous hearings in the past year on child welfare issues, reviewing whether foster children are receiving appropriate medical care, are being prescribed the right medications, are receiving the education they deserve, and are being adequately prepared for their life as adults. For some children, the answer to these questions is a ``yes,'' but for too many the answer is ``no.'' Too many children in foster care are behind their peers in terms of their health, education, and job prospects. 
   So there is still much that we need to do to ensure that all children in foster care receive the care and support they need to overcome these obstacles and thrive as young adults. 
   For those who cannot safely return home to their own parents, that means creating an environment providing as much love, support, and stability as possible. For some children, that may mean placement with relatives. For others, it involves the generosity and sacrifice of foster parents who step in when biological families don't work out. 
   In addition to this resolution, as Chairman McDermott noted, he and I  are currently working on a bipartisan package of legislation that we intend to have designed to improve the foster care system: Expecting more educational stability and high school completion for foster children, improving health outcomes, keeping siblings together, and extending and improving a current incentive program that rewards States for increasing adoptions. These legislative changes would implement many of the recommendations our subcommittee has heard for improving the lives of children in foster care. But even with these improvements, the tens of thousands of dedicated foster parents and those who support them will continue to remain the backbone of our foster care system. On our Nation's effort to support children who cannot safely live with their own parents, we owe them our thanks and our continued support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote for this important resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING FORMER FOSTER CARE YOUTH -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1208 on foster care youth aging out of care, an important resolution before us today. I join my colleagues in support of the more than 500,000 children who are in foster care today and in support of this resolution. I hope we can craft substantive bipartisan legislation to help address the challenges in our Nation's foster care system. 
   One of the greatest challenges is helping the more than 24,000 youth who age out of foster care each year. Projected outcomes for too many of these young people are sobering: lower high school graduation rates, higher rates of homelessness, and a higher chance of becoming incarcerated than of other youth of their own age. 
   In hearings before our subcommittee, the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee, which I serve as ranking member, we have been privileged to hear from many outstanding young men and women who have personally shared their personal stories of life in our Nation's child welfare system. 
   For instance, Jamal Nutall, a young man from the congressional district which I represent, has worked as an intern in my office. He testified before our subcommittee about the challenges he faced in foster care and the progress he was making towards completing his college education. More recently, we heard from Misty Stenslie with the Foster Care Alumni Association which represents former foster youth. Listening to these stories and understanding what they tell us reveals how much more needs to be done to help those who spend the longest time in foster care, including the thousands who age out of the system each year. 
   A good place to start would be to ensure that every young person in foster care completes at least their high school diploma. Last year, I introduced House Resolution 733, which recognizes the importance of improving the high school graduation rate of foster youth. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) for being one of the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation. We can and should make improving the educational outcomes of foster youth a key test in measuring any legislation designed to help foster children. 
   Congress is not alone in recognizing the importance of high school graduation for today's youth. America's Promise Alliance, an organization founded by former Secretary of State and General Colin Powell and his wife, has launched a dropout prevention campaign to combat the Nation's high school dropout crisis. The Alliance noted alarming statistics in an April 2008 report. Nearly one in three U.S. high school students drops out before graduating. Approximately 1.2 million students drop out each year, and about 7,000 students drop out each and every day. 
   To improve the high school graduation rate of foster youth, increased coordination between child welfare and educational agencies is necessary. New foster family placements should not necessarily mean a new school, and foster children should have to be able to remain in a single school in their own community so they can build lasting relationships with friends, teachers, and mentors. 
   All these steps can and should contribute to raising graduation rates and increasing chances of future success for foster children, especially those who age out of the system. 
   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important resolution today. But we should also commit ourselves to producing bipartisan legislation to improve the Nation's foster care and child welfare programs and improving the high school graduation rates and other educational outcomes for children in foster care. Without that simple step, too many will continue to face a desperate future. We owe them far better. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I rise to ask what I consider to be pretty fair questions. That is, if you are in Latin America and you ask anyone in Latin America which country is America's most reliable ally, they likely would say the Republic of Colombia. If you ask anyone in Latin America which political leader in Latin America is America's best partner and most reliable partner, they would say President Uribe, the democratically elected President of Colombia. Ladies and gentlemen, if you asked in Latin America who is the most popular political figure in the entire hemisphere in his own nation, you would discover it's President Uribe, the President of Colombia, who has an over 83 percent approval rating. 
   Why? Because he has made tremendous progress, strengthening what is Latin America's longest-standing democracy, reducing violence, making tremendous progress against the three terrorist groups that operate and that have operated for the last several decades in Colombia--the two Communist groups of the FARC and the ELM and the right-wing paramilitaries. He has made tremendous progress. 
   I would like, Mr. Speaker, to put into the Record two news stories from the BBC. 
   I would note the first story I want to put into the Record is the announcement that President Uribe was sending 14 of Colombia's most notorious paramilitary drug lords to the United States to face drug charges. 
   The second article I would like to put into the Record just ran this week. It was of a top commander of the FARC, which is the Communist narcotrafficking terrorist organization which has been fighting the democratically elected government of Colombia. 
   In just this past week, one of their top commanders surrendered. Her name is Nelly Avila Moreno. Her nickname was Karina, and she is one of the most notorious FARC commanders. She not only surrendered but she called on other FARC rebels to follow her example and surrender, basically saying it's over; it's time to call it a day to stop the civil war, to stop the narcotrafficking and to reach a peace agreement with the democratically elected Government of Colombia. 
   The reason I bring this up is, just a few weeks ago, this House, the Democratic majority, voted to turn its back on President Uribe. It voted to turn its back on the democratically elected Government of Colombia, America's most reliable partner. You think about it. We have no more reliable partner in Latin America when it comes to counterterrorism, to counternarcotics than the democratically elected Government of Colombia. 
   What is interesting is we have a trade agreement, a trade promotion agreement, that we have reached with Colombia. It is good for the United States. Right now, Colombian products enter the United States duty-free, tax-free, but U.S. products exported to Colombia face tariffs and taxes. Bulldozers made in my district face taxes of up to 12 to 15 percent, making our products less competitive with Asian products trying to get into the Colombian market as well. In the almost 2 years since this trade agreement was reached, the stalling efforts by this democratic leadership against Colombia has cost U.S. manufacturers and farmers $1 billion in higher tariffs and in higher taxes on U.S. products. 
   What I point out is this trade agreement wipes out those taxes, making U.S. manufactured goods, U.S. corn and soybeans more competitive. 
   Again, Colombian products enter the United States' market duty-free today. They don't face those taxes when they come here, but our products face taxes when they go there. The folks back home whom I represent, they say, you know, we want an even playing field. We're happy to trade with anyone as long as we have an even playing field here. Their products come in duty-free. We want the same opportunity. President Uribe and the democratically elected Government of Colombia have agreed to do that. We just need to ratify the agreement, which is to the advantage of American manufacturers and to American farmers. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the reason I mention the prosecution of the  paramilitaries, the reason I mention the surrender by a top FARC commander is those who oppose reducing tariffs on U.S.-made products argue that Colombia just doesn't deserve it. They've not done enough when it comes to reducing violence and in going after the narcotraffickers and the terrorists. 
   Under President Uribe, he has increased the prosecution budget of the State Attorney General, the State prosecutor for the entire country--a nation of 42 million people--by 72 percent in the last 2 years. He has added over 400 new prosecutors. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement is a good agreement for Illinois manufacturers, for Illinois farmers, for U.S. manufacturers, and for U.S. farmers. Let's ratify this agreement. Let's work with the best partner we have in Latin America. 
   I urge the Speaker to bring to this floor the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. Let's give it an up-or-down vote, and I believe it will pass with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.  
   Free Trade in Thugs: Getting Tougher With Right-Wing Warlords 
   In a surprise move on May 13th, President &#193;lvaro Uribe announced the extradition to the United States of 14 of Colombia's most notorious paramilitary warlords on drug-trafficking charges. As well as sending a warning to other right-wing paramilitaries, the aim is to show Democrats in Washington that Mr. Uribe means what he says about breaking with paramilitary groups who continue to murder trade unionists and other left-wingers. 
   Democratic congressional leaders and their trade-union allies have cited those murders as a reason for their refusal to approve a free-trade agreement with Colombia. Mr. Uribe may also be hoping to boost his already soaring approval ratings to strengthen his hand in an eventual bid for an unprecedented third term as president. More than two terms in a row are currently banned by the constitution, so this would require approval by Congress. 
   Mr. Uribe's move could backfire. Human-rights groups fear that it will rob the victims of the compensation that they are entitled to from their tormentors, and could also remove the evidence needed for a successful investigation into why Colombia's paramilitaries and their political accomplices have hitherto enjoyed impunity. More than 60 congressmen, most allies of Mr. Uribe, are either already in prison or under investigation in Colombia for alleged links to paramilitaries. Last month, Mario Uribe, the president's cousin and close political ally, was arrested. 
   ``The good news is that these paramilitary bosses could now face serious jail time,'' said Jos&#233; Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group. (In the United States, cocaine dealers can get 30 years or more.) ``The bad news is they may no longer have any reason to collaborate with Colombian prosecutors investigating their atrocities ..... Just as local prosecutors were beginning to unravel the web of paramilitary ties to prominent politicians, the government has shipped the men with the most information out of the country,'' he lamented. 
   In fact, the United States has agreed to allow Colombian prosecutors continued access to the extradited men. They have also apparently agreed to transfer to Colombia any seized assets or fines imposed on the warlords to compensate more than 100,000 victims who have come forward. Created in the 1980s by wealthy ranchers to protect themselves from attacks by the left-wing FARC guerrillas, the paramilitaries developed into armed gangs, accused of many thousands of killings as well as drug-trafficking and money-laundering. 
   Explaining his decision in a televised address on May 13th, Mr. Uribe said the extradited men had violated the conditions of a 2003 pact with the government under which they agreed to surrender to the authorities in exchange for relatively light prison sentences--a maximum of eight years--and protection against extradition. In return, they had promised to confess to their crimes, cease all illegal activities and use their drug money to compensate the victims of their appalling crimes. But the 14 warlords had continued to run their criminal networks from prison and had failed to pay reparations, Mr. Uribe said. 
   If the move was made with one eye on Washington, its timing appears to have been determined by a legal wrangle. Groups representing victims have been fighting to halt the extraditions. This appears to have prompted Mr. Uribe's decision to send the paramilitaries to the United States. Colombia's Supreme Court had recently supported these groups, ruling that extraditions of paramilitary bosses should be carried out only after they had confessed to their crimes and paid reparations. But this was overturned by a judicial council last week. Within hours, the first paramilitary leader to be extradited, Carlos Mario Jim&#233;nez, alias ``Macaco'', was on a plane bound for the United States, a journey made a week later by his 14 colleagues. More may follow.

Lieutenant Colonel Brown passed away at the age of 86 in his home on June 6, 2007, on the 63rd anniversary of D-Day. He served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1964, and was a World War II veteran who also served in Korea. During his service, he received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. 
   A leader in his community, Lieutenant Colonel Brown spent many years as a well-respected member of the Grundy County Board where he was known to give full dedication to his job and cared about conservation and preservation issues. 
   Additionally, Lieutenant Colonel Brown educated children in our community about Native Americans by portraying Chief Shabbona, the leader of the Pottawatomie Indian tribe during the Black Hawk War, who is also buried in Morris, Illinois. He instructed these children that ``we are symbols of current and past history, and we represent father, grandfather, brother and the authority figure, and they expect us to do the right thing.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS IN THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 474. As we approach Father's Day weekend, it is appropriate for us to recognize the importance of fathers in the lives of their children. Children who live with their fathers do better in school, are less likely to use drugs or engage in other criminal behavior, and are less likely to experience health, emotional, or behavioral problems. In so many ways, involved fathers provide needed support for their children and serve as role models as they develop. 
   Unfortunately, too many children today do not live with or even frequently see their fathers. This has forced millions of young mothers across the Nation to single-handedly raise their children, struggling to provide them with the love and support needed to succeed in today's world. It is a sad reality that for millions of children, their mother has to play the role of both mom and dad, a task that is not only difficult for the mother but which despite her efforts far too often results in that child living in poverty, among other challenges. 
   To help address this situation, the 1996 welfare reform law included promoting marriage and family formation and the maintenance of two-parent families as key purposes of welfare programs. 
   Under the direction of the Ways and Means Committee on which I serve, legislation reauthorizing the 1996 welfare reform law in the last Congress included specific funding for healthy marriage and fatherhood grant programs to improve the well-being of children. These fatherhood grants were designed to promote responsible fatherhood by funding projects developed by public, private, and often faith-based groups to help fathers establish positive relationships with their children and the children's mothers, improve job skills, increase child support payments, and promote marriage among parents. Activities can include counseling, mentoring, providing information about the benefits of marriage and two-parent involvement for children and the prevention of domestic violence and child abuse, financial planning seminars, and education on good parenting practices. 
   Last October, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced $119 million in awards to 225 grantees for promotion of healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. These grants are designed to make a difference in the lives of children, fathers, and families by supporting groups already at work trying to help men become better fathers. 
   As we honor our own fathers this week, we should also thank those who are working every day to help more men become better fathers. The last Congress took concrete steps to support them. In the congressional district I represent, a recent fatherhood event took place that is described in the June 11 Catholic News Service article, provided below. As efforts such as this and those supported by the recent Federal grants take hold, we will be 
   watching for evidence that more children are  spending every day, and not just Father's Day, with an involved and supportive father.   
   Fathers' Involvement Key in Lives of Children, Says Catholic Charities Conference  
   JOLIET, IL. (CNS).--A convicted drug dealer, 28-year-old Exulam Holman knows his actions have caused pain to those closest to him. The father of three young children, former gang member and ex-addict was released three months ago from prison. Today, he is desperately trying to put his life in order. 
   Holman's painstaking quest to reclaim his life spurred him to take part in a fatherhood conference sponsored by Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Joliet. ``I want to make things right for my kids,'' he told the Catholic Explorer, Joliet diocesan newspaper, during the June 2 event. 
   ``I've messed up,'' he said. ``But I've asked God to help me. I have to get myself right with God.'' 
   About 100 people attended the third annual conference, aimed at getting fathers more involved in the lives of their children, said Ronald Roseboro, site supervisor of early childhood services for Catholic Charities and coordinator of the event. 
   Fathers of children in the agency's early childhood programs were encouraged to attend the gathering, said Roseboro. Other fathers from Joliet and surrounding communities were also invited to attend. 
   The presence of two nurturing parents minimizes the possibility their children will abuse drugs or alcohol, join gangs or involve themselves in other dangerous situations, said Roseboro. A father's leadership and guidance has a definite impact on his children's lives, he continued. ``It's like dropping a pebble into a pond and watching the ripples it makes.'' 
   Guest speakers from diverse backgrounds led various workshops during the conference. 
   A father of five, Rev. Eugene Fears, pastor of Joliet's Redeem Church of God in Christ, spoke of healthy relationships. The no-nonsense preacher relied on his own experiences to build a case for sound communication and devotion between spouses. 
   ``A commitment pushes through adversity,'' he told conference participants. He urged the men to ``learn to make adjustments'' and to avoid ``self-centered'' attitudes. ``We need to learn to give of ourselves,'' Rev. Fears said. 
   Fathers who leave and don't compensate their families are often called ``deadbeat dads,'' but the reality is they are often simply ``dead broke,'' Warren Cottrell, director of the Joliet branch of the Illinois Child Support Enforcement program, said in an interview with the Explorer. He was on hand to field questions from participants during the conference. 
   Most fathers understand their responsibilities. They choose to turn their backs on their families, however, when they realize they cannot adequately provide for them. ``It's the male ego,'' said Cottrell. 
   Applauding Catholic Charities for broaching the topic with the conference, the administrator noted that fathers must be encouraged to do the right thing. 
   Cottrell said the welfare system in Illinois has many cracks. Jobless fathers are leaving their families so mothers can qualify for government aid. There are countless programs for single mothers in need of assistance. At the. same time, government programs need to be created to educate fathers and provide them with skills to remain with their families, he said. 
   Darnell Terrell's children participate in the Catholic Charities Head Start program at St. John's Head Start Center in Joliet. The owner of a disc-jockey business and father of six praised the other men who attended the conference. ``It takes a real man to listen to others about fatherhood responsibilities.'' 
   Kenneth White and Donald Waddell, human services consultants and family counselors, shared startling statistics compiled by the National Fatherhood Initiative during their workshop. The findings highlight the fact that the absence of fathers has a serious effect on families. 
   More than 70 percent of teens who have committed homicide grew up without fathers. Approximately 60 percent of rapists were raised in fatherless homes. Three out of four teen suicides occur in single-parent families. And the list goes on and on, they said. 
   Substance abuse fuels domestic problems that work to break families apart, according to the two experts in the field. Presenting a workshop on the effects of addiction on fatherhood, White and Waddell described the impact that narcotics and alcohol have on the family unit and discussed some proven methods for combating the problem. 
   Addiction among parents needs to be addressed and curbed, Waddell told the Explorer, because children of parents who abuse drugs often become addicted themselves during adolescence and later in life. ``We want to break that cycle,'' he said. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 263, as amended, recognizing National Foster Care Month. 
   We're here today to discuss foster care, starting with recognizing the thousands of foster parents who step in to care for so many vulnerable young people across America. It is right to celebrate the efforts of foster parents who step in to keep children safe. 
   In addition to these individuals, thousands of local organizations, with both public and private sector employees and volunteers, are also active in foster care. 
   In the congressional district that I represent, one good example of a trusted foster care organization is Baby Fold, and Baby Fold is a multi-service family support agency that has served the Bloomington-Normal region in central Illinois for over a century. 
   Today the Baby Fold specializes in residential, educational, therapeutic, adoption, foster care, pregnancy counseling and family support prevention services for children and their families. 
   Many similar groups provide similar services in every congressional district in America. These organizations and dedicated individuals, supported by private donations and over $23 billion in taxpayer funds each year, help children and families lead safe and productive lives. Today we thank each of them and all of them for their efforts and dedication. 
   Yet, despite such dedicated efforts, we also know a lot more work is needed to ensure that all children are adequately protected from abuse and neglect. 
   I have a longstanding interest in training of child welfare workers. Today I am reintroducing legislation I have authored in prior Congresses designed to address a glaring flaw in current rules by ensuring all child care workers, whether they work for a public agency or a private agency, have access to the same training needed to protect children. 
   Take Will County Catholic Charities, which helps protect over 300 children in foster care in the congressional district I represent. There's simply no reason why a caseworker with Will County Catholic Charities should have less access to training than an equally dedicated caseworker who happens to be a public employee. Yet, that is what current Federal rules promote, and we should fix this. 
   We also need to do more to ensure that each and every child involved with the child welfare system is safe. Too often that is not the case. The Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, on which I serve as ranking member, held a hearing on these challenges earlier today. We focused on areas like Clark County, Nevada, which is home to Las Vegas. A series of child deaths in Clark County has proven the risks for children when foster care and child protection systems fail to protect them. 
   As an August 5, 2006 article in the Las Vegas Review Journal put it, ``Since 2002, at least 79 children have died of abuse or neglect at the hands of their parents, foster parents or other caregivers while under the watch of the Clark County Department of Family Services.'' 
   As troubling as that is, the response of local officials has only made matters worse. ``For years, the county child welfare system has continuously avoided scrutiny by hiding behind a veil of confidentiality meant to protect children and families, but which the county has used to shield itself from oversight and criticism.'' 
   This sad trail of facts was supported by testimony we received today from Ed Cotton, who has broad experience in child welfare programs in my home State of Illinois, as well as New Jersey and Nevada. Most recently Mr. Cotton conducted a top-to-bottom review of Clark County, Nevada's child welfare program in the wake of tragedies there. And the evidence shows that Clark County is a case study of what happens when there's no oversight from those administering the program, and clearly is a national embarrassment and a disgrace because Federal funds were involved. 
   As Mr. Cotton testified, in Clark County and too many other places, this system has a very long way to go to ensure that all children are adequately protected. 
   Madam Speaker, in contrast with the Clark County tragedies, some areas have shown progress, but they're all too rare. Recent positive examples include my home State of Illinois. 
   Starting under the leadership of former Governor Jim Edgar in the late 1990s, the entire child welfare system in Illinois has undergone remarkable changes, resulting in there being 16,272 children today in foster care, or in January of 2007 that number, down from 28,202 children in September of 2001. 
   New York City, under the leadership of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, also made changes that were positive, dramatically reducing the number of children who need foster care. 
   Many experts think we should build on this success and do better when it comes to targeting efforts to prevent abuse and neglect from occurring in the first place. That would result in fewer children needing foster care, tracking the Illinois and New York City experiences, and that would free more resources to ensure the safety, permanency and well-being of those children who do not need to be placed in foster care. Both goals are critical, better prevention and better oversight. 
   In 2006, Congress took some modest steps in the right direction by targeting more funds for child abuse prevention and holding States more accountable for results. So there is increasing recognition of the steps needed to turn this program around. 
   In the meantime, we will certainly need the continuing involvement and support of tens of thousands of foster parents. We owe them, and especially the children they protect each and every day, our continued full support. 
   I urge bipartisan support for this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (PASS TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH PERU, PANAMA AND COLOMBIA -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, trade is important to my home State of Illinois. One in five manufacturing jobs depends on trade; 40 percent of agricultural products are exported from Illinois; and I would note, of the 17,000 Illinois companies that are dependent on trade, the vast majority are small employers. 
   We have a great opportunity with some new trade agreements with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. They are important both for Illinois jobs as well as for democratic security in our hemisphere. I would note today for our friends in Panama, Peru and Colombia, their products come to the United States tax free. But when we sell our products to them, we pay taxes. Our partners have agreed to eliminate those taxes and level the playing field. It is time to honor our commitments with our trading partners. Unfortunately, some in the Democratic leadership have said they would reject a deal with our best friend in Latin America, Colombia, and have told our other trading partners they just are not worthy of a trade agreement. No wonder so many in Latin America think the United States Congress is turning its back on Latin America. Peru, Panama and Colombia represent our best allies. They are good trade agreements. Let's move forward and level the playing field. Pass these trade agreements.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (TRIBUTES -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Texas for sharing his time in giving me the opportunity to say thank you, not only thank you to my constituents but thank you to my colleagues, particularly those from the Illinois delegation who are here tonight, my friend DON MANZULLO and JOHN SHIMKUS and PETER ROSKAM for taking time to say a few nice things about RAY LAHOOD and myself, and for that I appreciate that so much. But also I want to say thank you for the partnership I've had with you as a member of the Illinois delegation over the 14 years that I've had the privilege of serving in this House. 
   You know, RAY LAHOOD's a good friend to all of us, and of course, I want to take a moment and just salute RAY LAHOOD who, as my colleagues in the delegation and all the Members of the House, both Republican and Democrat know, is a man who's a man of this institution, someone who's worked tirelessly to bring civility to the House, a man who led efforts to convene bipartisan retreats. Four House bipartisan retreats were cochaired by RAY LAHOOD in his effort to bring civility and bipartisanship to the House. And I think if you can think of just one thing about RAY LAHOOD, it is his commitment and desire that the institution of this Congress should work together to solve the challenges that we have before us. 
   You know, I look back over the 14 years that I've had the privilege of serving in the House as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the opportunity I had to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee and serve, of course, as a deputy whip, I think of those opportunities to get to know my colleagues and have an opportunity to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I can't say a few words tonight without saying thank you to all the men and women that I've had the privilege of serving with, for the courtesies, for the opportunity to work together, and frankly, we had some good times as well in that process. I want to say thank you to everyone, and I also want to thank my colleagues for serving in this Congress. 
   You know, there's a lot of work that goes sight unseen. You don't often get thanked enough for the work that's done behind the scenes, but I want to thank my colleagues for their work and for their commitment to public service. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues for the support that you have given me in the projects and the legislation that I've had the opportunity to work on. 
   My friends mentioned the marriage tax penalty, which was an issue of fairness, and that issue came to me in my first campaign. I remember a young woman who came up, she was working in the office in my campaign, and she said, you know, JERRY, if you do get elected to Congress, there's an issue I want you to look into and I hope you will fix it. It's a penalty. If you're married, you're going to pay higher taxes. 
   She said, you know, my boyfriend and I, we want to get married. We both have pretty good jobs, and my friends said you better do your taxes jointly just to experiment and find out what your obligation would be. And they did that. They discovered they paid about $1,400 more in higher taxes just if they got married.     
   And because it was clear to me that it was unfair and, frankly, wrong that you should pay higher taxes just because you're married, that doesn't seem right, it's wrong, that our Tax Code was punishing marriage; where if two people worked, and because when you marry you file jointly, your incomes were combined. And the way our complicated Tax Code was structured, 42 million married working couples across America were paying higher taxes, on average about $1,400. 
   And I want to thank President Bush for signing into law my legislation eliminating the marriage tax penalty,  which, on average, saves married couples today $1,900 that they otherwise would pay had we not successfully worked to bring greater simplicity to the tax code, and ensuring that our tax code essentially today is marriage neutral. Two married people who both are in the workforce, who file jointly because they're married, will not pay higher taxes than two people that aren't married, but with similar incomes and with similar status. And so, today, we've eliminated the marriage tax penalty. 
   Unfortunately, in 2011 that reform expires. And I would encourage my colleagues to make elimination of the marriage tax penalty permanent so that we can protect the most basic institution in our society from a financial penalty we all know as the marriage tax penalty. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues for the work that we did on working to protect children from Internet predators. With their support, we were able to pass the Internet Predator Protection Act. I want to thank my colleagues for the support you gave me in our effort to ensure that veterans would have a better opportunity to obtain health care locally. You know, traditionally, the Veterans Administration always provided health care through VA hospitals. But many of our veterans live in rural areas and ex-urban areas where they would have to drive great distances. 
   And so we worked--in fact, my colleague, Dave Weldon, and I, he is a classmate--and he's retiring this year as well--we cosponsored legislation that for the first time gave the VA the authority to enter into a cooperative sharing agreement with local health care providers, like a local hospital, to open, essentially, an outpatient clinic in the local area where veterans can go and receive their outpatient care. 
   And one thing I noted, because today the La Salle Veterans Outpatient Clinic in La Salle, Illinois, is a perfect example of that; we have 45,000 veterans living within a 45-minute driving radius of La Salle. Many of the veterans that obtained health care there, it was the first time they were able to obtain health care because otherwise it was too inconvenient. They weren't able to travel all the way to Chicago to Hines Hospital. 
   So those efforts made a difference. And whether it was helping veterans or protecting kids from Internet predators, eliminating the marriage tax penalty, it took the support of my colleagues. And I want to thank all my colleagues for the support that you gave me in those efforts. 
   Some of my friends in the Illinois delegation referred to the Joliet Arsenal. And when I was elected to Congress, the Joliet Arsenal was a 24,000-acre surplus military facility during the Vietnam conflict, during World War II, and before. The vast majority of the TNT production for America's military was produced at the former Joliet Arsenal. In the late seventies it was shut down. In the 1980s it was a rusting, essentially abandoned place. And the community came together and we worked with conservationists and business and labor, political leaders in both parties, a lot of volunteers, veterans, the environmental community, and we worked to put together a plan, a plan that was a win-win-win for the community. We took what was the largest single piece of property in Northern Illinois, created the Midewin National Tall Grass Prairie, a 19,000-acre conservation area, the first-ever tall grass prairie--now administered by the Forest Service--and the first of its kind, but also the largest today. 
   Essentially, we created what became as affectionately known by many as Will County Central Park. We doubled the amount of open space set aside for posterity in Will County with our legislation to redevelop the Joliet Arsenal. 
   We also created the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, which today, geographically, is the second largest national veterans cemetery named after Abraham Lincoln. Not only is Illinois the land of Lincoln, but we have to remember that the Gettysburg Address, made so famous by Abraham Lincoln, actually was the dedication of our Nation's first veterans cemetery. And so we thought it was appropriate to name the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery after the President who started the national cemetery system in order to honor, with dignity, those who risk and sacrifice their lives for our Nation. 
   We also set aside about 3,000 acres for the creation of jobs. And we were fortunate to recruit Center Point Properties, a Chicago-area firm. They partnered with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. And as a result of that partnership, private development attracted over $1 billion in investment--creating jobs, creating what is one of the largest intermodal truck, rail, freight handling facilities. We've now had manufacturing, warehousing and distribution come there. Our farmers benefit because their grain goes to Asia through the terminal there at the former Joliet Arsenal. And almost 8,000 workers today are directly and indirectly employed as a result of that effort. 
   And it was a team effort, I'm so proud to say. And we can continue building on that effort to redevelop the Joliet Arsenal, creating the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, the Midewin National Tall Grass Prairie, and of course the two industrial sites that now have attracted over $1 billion in investment. 
   You know, one of the areas that I've also enjoyed having the privilege of being involved in as a Member of this House was my belief that our economy grows, and manufacturing and farmers and workers, that all Americans benefit when we expand trade, when we increase the commerce between our Nation and others. You know, we're a Nation of 300 million people. We represent 4 percent of the globe's population. Ninety-six percent of the people who live on this Earth live outside of the United States. And I believe that our economy grows when we find a way to market services and produce products and manufactured goods and agricultural products that come from States like Illinois that I represent, having an opportunity to sell them overseas to foreign markets. It grows our economy and creates opportunities for our young people. 
   And trade today, if you look at economic figures, you look at the discussion we're having about the economy, this past quarter we had 3.3 percent economic growth. And if you analyze where that growth occurred, 90 percent of that growth came as a result of exports--whether it's yellow construction equipment made in Joliet or corn and soybeans grown in Illinois, our export markets growing this economy. 
   And a key part of that are the trade agreements that we passed in the last few years, particularly the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, known as DR-CAFTA, the Chilean Agreement, the Peruvian-Chilean Trade Agreement, all good agreements that the opponents would say were going to cost us jobs, and actually today have generated tens of thousands, if 
   not hundreds of thousands, of new jobs. 
   The DR-CAFTA agreement actually took a trade deficit with our six trading partners in Central America and the Dominican Republic, where we had a trade deficit prior to that agreement, and because it eliminated all sorts of barriers--particularly tariffs--on U.S. products and Illinois products, today we have a significant trade surplus with our DR-CAFTA partners. 
   Clearly, trade wins for States like Illinois as well as America. And that's why it's so important that we ratify the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement, which, Colombia is a nation of 42 million people; it's the longest standing democracy in all of South America. It's recognized as America's best friend and best partner in all Latin America. But the population of Colombia is essentially equal to the population of all the DR-CAFTA nations combined. Tremendous opportunity. 
   My hope is that we will ratify this agreement before I leave Congress before the end of this year. And my hope is, as we look to the future on the issue of trade, that we can bring trade back to the middle again and continue moving forward to grow our economy and expand opportunities to sell U.S. products and grow our economy in agriculture and manufacturing, and of course give workers the opportunity for better jobs as a result of expanded exports. 
   Let me close by saying thank you to my family. You know, I remember when I was sworn into Congress 14 years ago, my mom and dad, Lavern and Marilyn Weller, came out, as did my Aunt Mary and Aunt Eileen, and  many friends and family came. I particularly want to say thank you to Mom and Dad, Lavern and Marilyn Weller, who worked so hard raising pure bred and Durock and Hampshire hogs, having many champions at various fairs, selling pure bred hogs all over the world. 
   And frankly, Mom and Dad taught me the value of trade. I remember when President Nixon opened up relations with China, the first shipment of hogs that were purchased by the Chinese included pigs from the Weller family farm. And of course after that, the result of the hard work of my mom and dad, they sold hogs to about 30 nations around the world. I'm very proud of that. In fact, they gave me the opportunity to be involved in 4-H and FFA. And I had the grand champion barrel at the Illinois State Fair my last year in 4-H. But it was all because of Mom and Dad and the opportunities they gave me, to go to the University of Illinois, to pursue a career off the farm, and of course to become involved in public service. 
   I look back at my campaigns. My mother was always my best campaigner. If you went to a JERRY WELLER campaign event, you would always see Marilyn Weller, my mom, right there, shaking everyone's hand, thanking them for coming. And she would always wear a big button that said, ``I'm JERRY's mom.'' She was my best campaigner. 
   I want to thank my sister Pat and my brother Doug. We lost our brother Rod this past year, and he is now buried at the Abraham Lincoln Cemetery. And Rod and Doug and Pat were all part of the campaign as well, the support they gave me. And I can't go without saying thank you to my siblings. 
   And of course, as I close, I want to say thank you to my wife and my daughter. You know, when I came to Congress, I was a single guy. And who would have thought that as a result of coming to Congress I would meet my wife and fall in love and have a family today. And my wife and I, we have a very unique relationship. We're the only parliamentarians from two different countries who are married. My wife is a Member of Congress in the nation of Guatemala. She served in her Congress as long as I have, 14 years. And she's much younger. And frankly, she is a very skilled and dedicated legislator on her own, someone who I am so proud of the work that she does. But Zury Rios de Weller--as she is officially known as now--is a great partner, and she is a wonderful wife, and most important of all, she's a wonderful mother. Who would have thought that as a result of my opportunity to serve in Congress I would meet my wife and I would become a dad? And we have a 2-year-old girl, Marizu Catherine Weller Rios. Marizu is a very bright, happy, healthy little girl. And I am so very proud and so very fortunate to have Zury and Marizu in my life. 
   And as I look at what I'm going to be doing in the future, when I leave this Congress, my first priority is to be a good husband and a good father. And I look forward to my years ahead with Zury and with Marizu and the opportunities that we'll have to do things together. 
   So many of my colleagues have said, you know, when I got elected to Congress, my kids were in diapers. And all of a sudden they're now in high school or they're now in college, and I haven't seen much of them. But what really caught my attention was, I was looking through the family photo albums, and I'm not in the photos--because I wasn't there, because I was attending meetings and functions everywhere else. Well, for me, I want to be with my daughter. I want her to see me at all our family functions. I want her to see her dad every day. 
   And people often ask, why do you want to leave Congress at age 51? It's because I was blessed at age 49 becoming a father for the first time. And my daughter, Marizu, is my one and only child. And I look forward to being her father in the years ahead, to being there, attending all her activities, hopefully being a good dad, but most of all, enjoying life with my wife and daughter. 
   Again, I want to say thank you to my colleagues in this Congress for the courtesies, the opportunities to work together. I want to thank especially my colleagues in the Illinois delegation for the partnership we've had, both Democrat and Republican, and for those who took time tonight to say some nice things about Ray LaHood and myself, since we're departing this Congress. 
   I particularly want to say thank you to John Shimkus and Don Manzullo and Peter Roskam for taking time to come to the floor to say some nice things. And for that, I want to say thank you, you're my friends. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is probably the last speech I will make on the floor of this House as a sitting Member of Congress. My hope is we will have a lame-duck session, but if we don't, this is my final address. Again, I want to say thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record an editorial from yesterday's Washington Post in support of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, as well as a column by Edward Schumacher-Matos, a former foreign correspondent for the Times, as well as a visiting professor of Latin American Studies at Harvard, a column that was published in yesterday's New York Times as well.  
   Free Colombia: A Trade Pact Everyone Can Love 
   Sometime after Congress returns from Easter recess this week, President Bush is likely to present the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement for the approval of the House and Senate. As we have said, the proposed pact is good policy for both Colombia and the United States. Colombia has long enjoyed periodically renewable tariff-free access to the U.S. market; the agreement would make that permanent. In exchange, U.S. producers would, for the first time, get the same tariff-free deal when they export to Colombia. Meanwhile, the agreement contains labor and environmental protections much like those that Congress has already approved in a U.S.-Peru trade pact. A vote for the Colombia deal would show Latin America that a staunch U.S. ally will be rewarded for improving its human rights record and resisting the anti-American populism of Venezuela's Hugo Ch&#225;vez. 
   Sending the agreement to the House of Representatives without the prior approval of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would be risky for the president; usually, the executive and legislative branches tee up such votes cooperatively. But months of Democratic resistance to the Colombia deal may have left Mr. Bush no choice. The agreement is being held hostage by members of the House (and Senate) who argue that Colombia--despite a dramatic drop in its overall murder toll under the leadership of President &#193;lvaro Uribe--hasn't done enough to protect trade union activists or to punish past murders of labor leaders. It's a spurious complaint: Actually, in 2006, union members were slightly less likely than the average Colombian to be murdered. But the human rights issue has served as cover for many Democrats whose true objections are to free trade itself. 
   Once the agreement arrives on the Hill, Congress will have 90 legislative days to vote yes or no--no amendments and no filibusters allowed, because special ``fast track'' rules apply. The Bush administration is betting that enough Democrats would support the pact to ensure its passage in the House, if it ever comes up for a vote. Of course, Ms. Pelosi could make an issue of the president's failure to get her approval to submit the pact and then could have her caucus shoot down the deal. But she could also engage the White House in serious negotiations. The president has signaled a willingness to consider reauthorizing aid for workers displaced by trade, legislation that is dear to the Democrats' labor constituency and that he has heretofore resisted. 
   Ms. Pelosi recently said that no Colombia deal could pass without trade adjustment assistance--without also mentioning the bogus trade unionists issue. Perhaps she is realizing that talking to Mr. Bush about swapping a Colombia vote for trade adjustment assistance might actually lead to a tangible accomplishment. At least we have to hope so.  
   Killing a Trade Pact  
   President Bush has been urging Congress to approve a pending trade agreement with Colombia, an ally that recently almost went to war with Venezuela and Hugo Ch&#225;vez. Even though the agreement includes the labor and environmental conditions that Congress wanted, many Democrats, including Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, now say that Colombia must first punish whomever has been assassinating the members of the nation's trade unions before the agreement can pass. 
   An examination of the Democrats' claims, however, finds that their faith in the assertions of human-rights groups is more righteous than right. Union members have been assassinated, but the reported number is highly exaggerated. Even one murder for union organizing is atrocious, but isolated killings do not justify holding up the trade agreement. 
   All sides agree that trade-union murders in Colombia, like all violence, have declined drastically in recent years. The Colombian unions' own research center says killings dropped to 39 last year from a high of 275 in 1996. 
   Yet in a report being released next week, the research center says the killings remain ``systematic'' and should be treated by the courts as ``genocide'' designed to ``exterminate'' unionism in Colombia. Most human-rights groups cite the union numbers and conclude, as Human Rights Watch did this year, that ``Colombia has the highest rate of violence against trade unionists in the world.'' 
   Even if that is true, it was far safer to be in a union than to be an ordinary citizen in Colombia last year. The unions report that  they have 1 million members. Thirty-nine killings in 2007 is a murder rate of 4 unionists per 100,000. There were 15,400 homicides in Colombia last year, not counting combat deaths, according to the national police. That is a murder rate of 34 citizens per 100,000. 
   Many in Congress, moreover, assume that ``assassinations'' means murders that are carried out for union activity. But the union research center says that in 79 percent of the cases going back to 1986, it has no suspect or motive. The government doesn't either. 
   When the Inter American Press Association several years ago investigated its list of murdered Colombian journalists, it found that more than 40 percent were killed for nonjournalistic reasons. The unions have never done a similar investigation. 
   There are, however, a growing number of convictions for union murders in Colombia. There were exactly zero convictions for them in the 1990s, Colombia's bloodiest decade, when right-wing paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas were at the height of their strength. Each assassinated the suspected supporters of the others across society, including in unions. 
   With help from the United States, in 2000 the Colombian military and the judicial system began to reassert themselves. Prosecuting cases referred by the unions themselves, the attorney general's office won its first conviction for the murder of a trade unionist in 2001. Last year, the office won nearly 40. 
   Of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001, almost all for murder, the ruling judges found that union activity was the motive in only 17. Even if you add the 16 cases in which motive was not established, the number doesn't reach half of the cases. The judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime, 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization. 
   The unions don't dispute the numbers. Instead, they say the prosecutors and the courts are wasting time and being anti-union by seeking to establish motive--a novel position in legal jurisprudence. 
   The two main guerrilla groups have an avowed strategy of infiltrating unions, which attracts violence. About a third of the identified murderers of union members are leftist guerrillas. Most of the rest are members of paramilitary groups--presumed to be behind two of the four trade unionist murders this month. The demobilization of most paramilitary groups, along with the prosecutions and government protection of union leaders, has contributed to the great drop in union murders. 
   President &#193;lvaro Uribe, who has thin skin, can be unwisely provocative when responding to complaints from unions and human rights groups. Still, the level of unionization in Colombia is roughly equal to that in the United States and slightly below the level in the rest of Latin America. The government registered more than 120 new unions in 2006, the last year for which numbers are available. The International Labor Organization says union legal rights in Colombia meet its highest standards. Union leaders have been cabinet members, a governor and the mayor of Bogot&#225;. 
   Delaying the approval of the trade agreement would be convenient for Democrats in Washington. American labor unions and human-rights groups have made common cause to oppose it this election year. The unions oppose the trade agreement for traditional protectionist reasons. Less understandable are the rights groups. 
   Human Rights Watch says that it has no position on trade but that it is using the withholding of approval to gain political leverage over the Colombian government. Perversely, they are harming Colombian workers in the process. The trade agreement would stimulate economic growth and help all Colombians.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. I urge the Speaker of the House to bring this important agreement to the floor for a vote, an agreement that was, where negotiations were completed 2 years ago, where an agreement that was signed 18 months ago and has been waiting for a long time. This agreement is a good agreement for America. It's a good agreement for Illinois. It's also a good agreement for Colombia. 
   Illinois is a major exporting State. My district is dependent on exports to grow jobs. And last year my State of Illinois exported $214 million worth of Illinois products to Colombia, and that's just the beginning because under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, 80 percent of all tariffs, and tariffs are taxes, on U.S. and Illinois products are eliminated immediately when the trade agreement goes into effect. 
   And I would note today that Colombian products come into the United States duty-free, without taxes. But we suffer taxes when we export to Colombia. 
   And I would note that the facts have shown that exports grow 50 percent faster with nations like Chile and Peru and Central America, where we have trade agreements, than those where we do not. 
   Who is Colombia? Well, Colombia is our most reliable partner and best friend in Latin America. Colombia is our most reliable partner in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism. It's the longest standing democracy in all of Latin America. And they have a popular president, President Uribe. The reason President Uribe has been so popular is he's reduced violence; he's brought security to the entire country. 
   People today feel secure traveling between cities, where five and 10 years ago they feared to go. In fact, 71 percent of Colombians today say they feel more secure under President Uribe. 37 percent say President Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down by 40 percent; kidnappings are down by 76 percent. In fact, the murder rate today in Colombia is lower than Baltimore or Washington, D.C. 
   No wonder President Uribe is the most popular elected official in this entire hemisphere. And compare that 80 percent approval rating President Uribe enjoys with the 18 percent that this Congress suffers and the difference in approval. 
   Now those who oppose the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement say, well, Colombia just hasn't done enough. They need to keep doing more before we'll give them the privilege of having this agreement with the United States. And they say that there's been violence against labor leaders. 
   Well, let's look at the facts. President Uribe has made major changes in how they prosecute those who commit murder and violent acts. He's added 418 new prosecutors, 545 new investigators, 2,166 new posts overall in the Prosecutor General's office. And he's increased prosecution funding by 75 percent. 
   A respected labor leader in Colombia said, Carlos Rodriguez, President of the United Workers Confederation said about these new posts and this funding, never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important. $39 million was spent this past year providing bodyguards and protection for 1,500 labor leaders and activists. No other group enjoys this special kind of protection. And it's been successful. I would note no labor leader has suffered an attack or lost his life who's participated in this program. 
   The International Labor Organization has removed Colombia from its labor watch list. Colombia has agreed to a permanent ILO representative in Colombia. That helps explain why 14 major labor leaders in Colombia have endorsed this trade agreement. 
   Colombia is our best friend in Latin America. It's our most reliable ally. Colombia deserves a vote. 
   Think about it. 2 years this trade agreement has waited; 18 months since it was signed by the leadership of both countries. 
   Latin America is undergoing some challenges, and those who are not friends of the United States have made it very clear they want to defeat the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement because they think that's in their best interest, and they've also said that if the Congress defeats the trade agreement, it will send a powerful signal to all Latin America that the United States can't be trusted, and that if you're a friend of the United States, in the long run they'll let you down. 
   Well, President Uribe and the government of Colombia, the democratically elected government of Colombia, are our best friends, our most reliable allies in all Latin America, and all Latin America is watching on how we treat our best friend. 
   This agreement is good for America. It's good for Illinois. If you're an Illinois worker, an Illinois manufacturer, an Illinois farmer, you win under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Authority. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge that this House schedule soon a vote on the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement and ratify this agreement so important to democracy, freedom and economic growth in our own hemisphere.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the majority leadership to bring to the floor the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Authority Agreement. It is a good agreement. The question is, who is Colombia? It is the longest-standing democracy in Latin America, it is the United States' most reliable and best partner in counterterrorism and counternarcotics, and, frankly, it is an important ally of the United States. 
   This trade agreement is good for the U.S., it is good for Colombia. Right now, Colombian products come into the United States, and they come in basically duty-free without any taxes. Our products going to Colombia suffer taxes. Under this trade promotion agreement, 80 percent of those duties and taxes are eliminated immediately. It is good for Illinois workers, Illinois manufacturers and Illinois farmers. 
   There are those who oppose this agreement. The Washington Post probably said it best yesterday in their editorial when they stated their support for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. They noted, ``The agreement is currently being held hostage by Members of the House who argue that Colombia, despite a dramatic drop in its overall murder rate, doesn't deserve this.'' 
   The bottom line is, President Uribe has greatly reduced violence. The murder rate is lower than in Baltimore or Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I join my colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, in  urging the Speaker of the House to bring to this floor the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, an agreement that's good for Illinois farmers, good for Illinois workers, and good for Illinois manufacturers. 
   Let me begin by asking some important questions. What nation in Latin America is the most longstanding democracy? The Republic of Colombia. What nation in Latin America is the United States' most reliable and dependable partner against narcotics and against terrorism? The Republic of Colombia. What nation today has the most popular elected official year after year after year in their own country? That is President Uribe of Colombia. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement is a good agreement for my State of Illinois. We are a big winner, as is the United States. 
   In 2006, Illinois exported $214 million in exports to Colombia, but that's just the beginning. Why? Because Illinois exports, U.S. exports to Colombia are taxed by tariffs. But their exports to the United States are not taxed by tariffs. So right now trade is a one-way street. We want to make it a two-way street. 
   As a result of this trade agreement, 80 percent of U.S. exports that are currently taxed will be duty-free immediately. And as we know, our exports to other countries grow 50 percent faster with countries we have trade agreements with. So it's a win-win-win for American workers, American farmers, and American manufacturers. We want to be competitive with Asia. 
   We know Colombia is a reliable partner, our most important ally. We know Colombia is a longstanding democracy. We also know that President Uribe is popular. He was elected to stem the violence in Colombia. He was elected to push the FARC, the leftist narcotrafficking terrorist organization, out of the country. And he's made tremendous progress. And today because of his success in expanding government presence throughout the country, bringing stability and order and safety and security to Colombia, his approval rating in his own country year after year has been over 80 percent. Compare that to this Congress which has a 15 percent approval rating. 
   Now there are those who oppose this trade agreement and they are the same people who have opposed every trade agreement. They say not enough is done for labor. When the Peru and Colombia trade agreements were finalized, my Democratic friends said we needed to do more regarding labor rights. Both Peru and Colombia complied. And, of course, Peru has been ratified, but Colombia has not. Now they say that there's too much labor violence in Colombia. Well, let's look at the facts. Seventy-one percent of Colombians say they are more secure under President Uribe. Seventy-three percent of Colombians say Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down 40 percent. Kidnappings are down 76 percent. In fact, the murder rate in Colombia today is lower than Washington, D.C., lower than Baltimore. 
   Here are the facts on labor violence: The last 2 years, President Uribe has hired 418 new prosecutors; 545 new investigators; created over 2,166 new posts overall in the Prosecutor General's office; and increased funding for prosecution of those who commit violent acts by 75 percent. 
   Carlos Rodriguez, president of the United Workers Confederation, said about these new posts: ``Never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important.'' Now when it comes particularly to labor leaders, President Uribe has allocated almost $39 million to providing bodyguards for protection for labor union leaders. One thousand five hundred union leaders and activists provided protection, the second largest protected group in the nation of Colombia. And it's been successful. In fact, no labor leader under this protection has lost his life or experienced violence. 
   As the Washington Post noted yesterday, the murder rate for labor activists is lower than the national rate for the rest of the country. So President Uribe has made tremendous progress in reducing violence. For those who point to labor activists being the subject of labor violence, he's made even greater success in reducing violence. 
   I would also note that the International Labor Organization has removed Colombia from its labor watch list and Colombia has agreed to permanent International Labor Organization presence in Colombia. Perhaps most telling, 14 Colombian labor union leaders have personally given their support to the Trade Promotion Agreement and they represent 79,000 organized workers. We continue to hear opposition with no explanation. 
   The bottom line is this is a good trade agreement. Colombia is our best ally. If you care about the future of Latin America, if you care about democracy, if you care about security, we need to bring the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to this floor for a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This bipartisan legislation that we are considering today, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act, increases the amount of time that certain low-income disabled and aged immigrants can continue to receive Supplemental Security Income, SSI benefits, from 7 to 9 years. These are individuals legally allowed in the United States for humanitarian reasons after fleeing persecution and suffering in their own countries. The approximately 28,000 individuals assisted by this legislation include refugees, asylees and Cuban/Haitian entrants from around the world. 
   To gain access to permanent eligibility for SSI and all other benefits and freedoms afforded to Americans, legal refugees and asylees are eligible to become U.S. citizens through the naturalization process now administered by the Department of Homeland Security. However, as many Members have heard from constituents, this process does not always move forward in a timely manner for a number of reasons. 
   For instance, a letter I recently received from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law in Illinois outlines a case in which an elderly Jewish refugee couple from the former Soviet Union working to become citizens encountered problems of lost paperwork and the need to have fingerprints retaken time and time again. A recent Washington Post story noted that as of March of 2007, this spring, nearly 1.3 million individuals were in the Department of Homeland Security citizenship application backlog, and 330,000 cases were in the FBI background check backlog. 
   Recognizing the likelihood of ongoing issues in the naturalization process, this legislation provides up to one extra year of eligibility, for a total of up to 10 years, for those refugees and asylees needing more time to complete the naturalization process. This is an important provision as it emphasizes the relative temporary nature of SSI eligibility for newly arrived legal refugees and asylees, while encouraging them to pursue citizenship so that they may fully participate in our Nation's democracy. 
   As with the other features of this legislation that relate to eligibility for SSI benefits, this provision is effective from fiscal year 2008 through 2010. So a future Congress must reexamine whether these provisions are working as intended, including providing refugees and related individuals who are playing by the rules and applying for citizenship, sufficient time to go through that process without losing access to these important benefits. 
   These additional SSI benefits are paid for through a provision that will reduce Federal income tax refunds to better recover unemployment benefit overpayments that resulted from fraud. Tax refund offsets already occur for delinquent child support payments and certain other debts owed to the Federal Government, and this simply allows the current process to work in recovering unemployment benefit overpayments. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates this permanent change will more than pay for the additional SSI benefits provided in this bill. This is sound policy and builds on proposals included in recent Bush administration budget proposals. 
   The Ways and Means Committee, and in particular the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, has  long been active in developing legislation to combat fraud and abuse involving unemployment and other benefits. I'm pleased to see we are continuing that effort with this legislation. 
   For example, in 2004, under the leadership of former chairman Wally Herger, we passed provisions to stop the illegal manipulation of State unemployment taxes. We also allowed State unemployment plans to use information in the National Directory of New Hires to help prevent unemployment benefit overpayments. Today's legislation builds on those efforts, and I am proud to support it. 
   I would also note that this legislation is supported by a long list of faith-based and other community groups, including many who assist refugees in their efforts to become citizens. That list includes the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, Lutheran Social Services of America, and Catholic Charities USA, among many, many other groups. 
   I would also note I received a letter of support from the Social Security Administration endorsing this bipartisan bill, and I will include the letters of support in the Record. 
   Finally, I would also like to recognize the efforts of my friend and colleague, Representative Phil English of Pennsylvania who, among many others, has worked diligently to see that these sorts of changes occur, including by introducing bills to this same goal and effect. 
   I encourage all Members to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (NATIONAL HOMELESS YOUTH AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last month, Representative McDermott and I, along with eight of our House colleagues on both sides of the aisle, introduced a resolution to designate November as ``National Homeless Youth Awareness Month.'' This action followed a hearing on ``disconnected youth'' held by the Committee on Ways and Means Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member. 
   Disconnected young people include young people who often drop out of school, don't work and wind up on the streets. These young people may have family conflict issues, may experience abuse and neglect, or may be or have been in the past involved in the foster care system. Research completed by the University of Chicago suggests there were nearly 25,000 homeless youth in my home State of Illinois in 2004, including 6,353 in the northern Illinois region where the congressional district I represent is located. 
   Despite an infusion of millions of dollars in Federal assistance and dedicated interests of many adults, too many children today are troubled, disconnected from their families and others who would like to help and, unfortunately, wind up on streets. Federal initiatives such as the Runaway and  Homeless Youth program, the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Discretionary Grants program, and the Chafee Foster Care Independence program have been directed at these problems in recent years. 
   Yet better serving these children and preventing more youth from winding up on the streets will require a better use and coordination of current program funds. We also need to recognize, as one witness at our subcommittee's recent hearing put it, that ``strengthening families is the best way to prevent the suffering and social disconnection among our young people.'' 
   Even as we applaud those young people, including foster youth, who overcome tremendous challenges to succeed in school and beyond, it is hard to overstate the importance of strong families to the raising of young people who grow up to be productive adults. 
   Last year in the Deficit Reduction Act, we included specific funds to support private groups that work to strengthen families and promote healthy marriage, which is the foundation for raising healthy children. I am eager to see how these efforts pay off, including by reducing the turmoil in homes that result in too many children ending up on the streets. 
   We must also acknowledge that kids are connected, and especially as they get older, through their schools. That really means through their circle of friends, teachers, coaches and other mentors they rely on as they become more independent and develop the habits and skills needed for life on their own. Kids in foster care already have suffered the trauma of being removed from their parents. In addition to being bounced from home to home, many foster children suffer too from being bounced from school to school. Studies show high school students who change schools even once are less than half as likely to graduate as those who do not change schools. So it is no wonder that there is ``a 20 percentage point difference between the high school graduation rates of foster youth and their peers,'' according to the Kids Count organization. 
   At our subcommittee hearing, we also heard from Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. She and her husband have helped raised 23 foster children, and she discussed the importance of achieving stability in their lives and especially stability at home and at school. 
   In addressing the issue of youth homelessness, we should start by doing whatever we can to ensure that young people in the foster care system complete at least high school. That will vastly improve their chances of getting a decent job and supporting themselves. One way to do that would be to provide more youth in foster care the opportunity to stay better connected to their schools, including by remaining in a single school whenever possible. That might mean offering scholarships so that those in private schools can stay in that school or so those who might benefit from private school could do so. Or it could involve something as simple as bus vouchers so kids can continue going to their current public or private school even if they are sent to live in a foster home across town. Such efforts will increase the chances for foster youth to graduate and can create the foundation for a productive and happy life that is the American Dream. That will also mean far fewer kids winding up on the streets, as is the goal of this resolution introduced today. We should all support that. 
   And I urge all Members to support this bipartisan resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (TMA, ABSTINENCE EDUCATION, AND QI PROGRAMS EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3668 contains temporary extensions of several important programs that affect low-income families with children. I urge its passage. 
   The subcommittee on which I am the ranking Republican, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, oversees the Nation's welfare, child care, and related programs designed to promote and support work by low-income families. It is important to extend the critical supports Congress enacted in recent years to advance those goals, such the Transitional Medical Assistance program continued under this bill. I am all for that. Every Member should support that. 
   This legislation also extends the Abstinence Education program, which supports efforts to prevent teenage pregnancy and premarital sexual activity, with a goal of reducing the childbearing outside marriage. Childbearing outside marriage is directly associated with higher poverty rates and ultimately greater welfare receipt and dependence. All Members should support measures designed to reduce the chances children are raised in poverty. 
   The legislation has other important features, like an extension of the Qualified Individuals program that provides Medicare premium assistance to certain low-income beneficiaries. However, I would like to draw the House's attention to one provision that, as currently drafted, may not achieve the intended effect and thus may not result in the savings suggested by the CBO scoring of this legislation. 
   This provision appears in section 4 of the legislation, titled ``Extension of SSI Web-Based Asset Demonstration Project to the Medicaid Program.'' The Social Security Administration, SSA, currently is operating a project testing ways to improve asset verification under the Supplemental Security Income, SSI, program. The current project seeks to make sure that SSI applicants are accurately reporting all the assets, like personal savings accounts, to which they can and should turn for support before expecting monthly SSI checks from taxpayers. Since SSI is a means-tested benefit program, it only makes sense to focus benefits on those who don't have a large amount of personal savings, for example, on which to depend. 
   In recent years, the SSA project has tested comparing individuals' self-reports of their savings account assets with actual bank records. This effort has already produced significant savings in the few States where it has been applied, including uncovering some individuals with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed assets. So it makes sense to expand this effort to include other means-tested programs, as the legislation proposes, including the expensive Medicaid program. 
   However, it is my understanding that the legislative language in H.R. 3668 includes a number of drafting flaws that will effectively prevent the proposed expansion of this asset verification project from being achieved. Problems include a lack of reference in the legislative language to the need to obtain written consent from individuals for the purpose of obtaining information for the Medicaid program. This may prevent banks from sharing such information with Medicaid officials as would be required to actually expand the current project as proposed. Such ``consent'' language exists under the current SSI program as required by the Right to Financial Privacy Act, but not in H.R. 3668. 
   Even if this provision were to work as intended, it is noteworthy that nowhere does this legislation provide for reimbursement of Social Security Administration administrative costs that would inevitably result. SSA is already seeking additional administrative funds to address growing disability claims backlogs as well as handle its current duties, which include serving millions of America's seniors, including the rising numbers applying for retirement and disability benefits as the Baby Boom generation heads into retirement in the coming years. 
   It is my understanding that the authors of this legislation consulted with SSA on such technical issues during the drafting process, and opted against implementing any of the SSA suggestions. 
   Because of that, while the current CBO score suggests this legislation is paid for, I am afraid that the real world experience of these provisions will not reflect that optimistic forecast. If that turns out to be correct, the legislation before the House today will not satisfy the pay-as-you-go requirements of this body, which require that increases in spending by fully paid for by such as by offsetting spending cuts. And some individuals will obtain Medicaid benefits for which they should not have qualified. 
   While it may be too late to correct the drafting errors in this particular bill, I urge my colleagues especially on the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Finance Committees, which have jurisdiction over Medicaid law, to revisit this legislative language and make the appropriate changes at the next available opportunity. I do not disagree with their intent, but suggest the legislative text reflected in this bill will not result in the outcome they intend. Related language appears in legislation preauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which as it continues to be acted on in the coming days would serve as a worthy vehicle for making the appropriate changes to ensure the will of the House is carried out, and misspending under the Medicaid program is minimized as the House intends with this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Udall/Platts amendment that will establish a Federal renewable portfolio standard of 15 percent by the year 2020. 
   By ensuring that 15 percent of the electricity we produce comes from renewable sources by 2020, we take another great step forward, just like we did when we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2007, in working towards the goal of energy independence. 
   In addition to the goal of energy independence, this amendment also takes steps toward an issue that we as a country need to ban together to fight ..... and that is global warming. 
   The Federal renewable portfolio standard we are debating here today by 2030 will save consumers an estimated $16.4 billion on their energy bills and an estimated $10 billion on their electricity bills. 
   In addition, the amendment will increase our renewable energy capacity to 91 gigawatts and it's estimated that annual power plant carbon emissions will be reduced by 180 million metric tons. 
   For my rural 11th District of Illinois, renewable sources of energy like wind and biomass are producing new jobs and revitalizing many small towns. 
   There are currently two wind farms in my district, Mendota Hills and Crescent Ridge, with an additional two more, Twin Groves and McLean Wind Energy Center, in the works. The Crescent Ridge project, once completed will be one of the largest wind farms in the country. 
   Since passage of the Energy Bill, we have seen over $100 million invested in Wind energy with a total investment of close to a billion dollars. 
   The American Wind Energy Association estimates that for every new megawatt (MW) of wind energy, 15-19 direct and indirect jobs are created. There are about 826 MWs of planned wind production in various stages in Illinois. That translates into 14,868 jobs in Illinois. 
   By establishing a Federal renewable portfolio standard, we can continue this growth in renewable energy and continue to produce many more new jobs. 
   While I do support the underlying amendment, I believe it lacks one critical component. That is the inclusion of nuclear power as part of the standard. 
   I have the distinct pleasure of representing a district that has the most nuclear power plants of any member of Congress. 
   Accounting for close to 20% of the electricity produced here in the United States, nuclear energy cannot be ignored. 
   With the focus of an RPS to not only drive us towards energy independence but to reduce carbon emissions, you cannot leave out an energy source like nuclear that produces 0 emissions. 
   I am hopeful that when we move forward with this policy that I can work with the sponsors of this amendment to have this clean burning energy source included. 
   In closing, I would like to take the opportunity to commend Congressmen UDALL and PLATTS for offering their amendment today and ask that all of my colleagues support this amendment. 
   Most of our States are moving towards renewable portfolio standards; its time for our country as a whole to become the leader.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this legislation before us today. I generally enjoy working with Chairman Rangel and my subcommittee chairman, Mr. McDermott, and Mr. Neal, people I enjoy working with. But it is hard to support policy that fails to include some good ideas. We should have a bipartisan bill before us today, and the issue is this bill fails to build on the successes of the 2005 energy bill. 
   The district that I represent south of Chicago, cities like Joliet, a lot of rural communities, bedroom communities, was a big winner in the 2005 energy bill. Thanks to the incentives for wind and biofuels, ethanol and biodiesel, we are seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment in wind energy and biofuels in the district that I represent, thanks to the energy bill of 2005. I was hoping we would build on that. I was also hoping that this legislation would include good ideas about energy conservation. 
   We made one of the centerpieces of the 2005 energy bill incentives for homeowners to make their home more energy efficient. It said that about 20 percent of the energy we consume is consumed in our home, and we included a tax credit for homebuilders as well as homeowners to invest in better insulation and better windows and better roofs and better heating and cooling technology, and they could save on that investment and, in the long term, save on energy consumption. 
   It is estimated that today about 65 percent of U.S. homes are not insulated adequately, according to Harvard. That same study said if they were insulated properly, we would reduce the need to import 76 supertankers of crude oil from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela or some other foreign country. So energy efficiency is a key part of our strategy for energy independence. Also, because you are consuming less, you reduce climate change. 
   We should have extended the tax credit for existing homes. We should have extended the tax credit for new homes. Let's give tax incentives to those who want to bring energy efficiency to home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, today I rise to urge the Speaker of the House to bring forward the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. I also ask my colleagues to support this agreement. It's an agreement that's good for America, it's good for my State of Illinois, and it's good for Colombia. In fact, the State that I represent, Illinois, is a big winner under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   The International Trade Commission did an economic analysis. They said if you're an Illinois worker, an Illinois manufacturer, an Illinois farmer, you're a winner under this trade agreement. Corn, soybeans, pork, beef, manufactured metal products, chemicals, machinery, exports will go up. Why? Because right now Colombian products enter the United States duty-free, tariff-free, tax-free, but our products face tariffs. Caterpillar, the biggest employer in my district, 8,000 workers, their heavy construction equipment faces a 12 percent tariff. For a million-dollar piece of equipment, that's a $100,000 tax which would be eliminated immediately, day one, when this trade agreement would go into effect. 
   The bottom line is Illinois will be a big winner. 
   Now who is Colombia? To begin with, the democracy we know as Colombia, the oldest democracy in all Latin America, today is the United States' most reliable and trusted partner in Latin America. Its President, President Uribe, is the most popular elected official in the hemisphere. And while this Congress suffers from 15 percent approval ratings, President Uribe in his own country enjoys 80 percent approval ratings. Why? Because he's made a difference in reducing violence and winning the war against the FARC and the narcoterrorists. Today, 71 percent of Colombians say they are more secure under President Uribe. Seventy-three percent of Colombians say Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down. Kidnappings are down. Today the murder rate in Colombia is the lowest in 15 years. In fact, Medellin, once considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world, today has a lower murder rate than Washington, DC, or Baltimore. 
   Now there are those who oppose President Uribe. There are those who oppose the trade promotion agreement between the United States and Colombia. They argue that President Uribe just has not done enough on the issue of labor and protecting labor leaders from violence. Well, let's look at the facts. Under President Uribe, he's totally reformed the judiciary, the entire institution. For the general prosecutor, he's added 2,166 new positions, including 418 new prosecutors and 545 new investigators, and increased funding for the general prosecutor, the federal independent prosecutor, by 75 percent. Carlos Rodriguez, president of the United Workers Confederation of Colombia, said about this: ``Never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important.'' 
   I would note that President Uribe has also created special programs today to protect labor leaders. In fact, they spent almost $39 million this past year for body guards and protection for labor union members. There are 1,500 labor union leaders and activists who receive special protection, the second largest protected group in the entire country, and this program has been successful. In fact, no labor leader has lost their life who's been under this protection program. In fact, the murder rate, which is a terrible thing, for labor and union activists is lower than the national rate for everyone else. So tremendous progress has been made. 
   The International Labor Organization has removed Colombia from its labor watch list. Colombia has agreed to a permanent ILO representative in Colombia, and 14 labor union leaders representing 14 labor unions in Colombia have endorsed this agreement. 
   Now we continue to hear from opponents and they are really the people who have always traditionally opposed trade and so they've got a different line today, but they always say that President Uribe still has not done enough, we need to demand more, but they never specifically say what more they  want. Clearly, President Uribe has done a lot, a tremendous amount, and he has made real progress. 
   As we have seen this past week, there is a lot happening in Latin America. Colombia, of course, has been fighting the FARC and other terrorists and narcotrafficking groups over the last three and four decades and they've made tremendous progress under President Uribe. We know the FARC in particular are the biggest leftist, antigovernment narcotraffic and terrorist group. They fund themselves by the sales of narcotics. It was recently uncovered, we discovered the links between Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and the FARC, possibly $300 million in subsidies, long suspected but now proven. 
   The bottom line is the Colombia agreement is good for democracy, it's good for America, it's good for workers, and it's good for manufacturing. I urge this Congress to bring it up for a vote and let's pass it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, last month the members of the Ways and Means Committee heard compassionate testimony on several of the tax and benefit provisions for veterans, military families and volunteers in the bill we are considering on the floor today. Several provisions amend the Supplemental Security Income program that operates under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, which I have the privilege of serving as ranking member. These would effectively expand eligibility for and increase SSI benefit payments to certain military families, veterans and AmeriCorps participants. The bill also includes provisions offered by my friends and colleagues, Phil English of Pennsylvania and Tom Reynolds of New York, that would ensure comparable treatment under the SSI program when it comes to State annuities for blind and other disabled veterans. 
   It is important that we look for ways to ensure that those in the military and their families who make sacrifices receive appropriate and timely support. The bill before us today will provide more help to our veterans, to our military families and to others who volunteer in service to our Nation. That is something I support, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting our soldiers, our families and others who volunteer to help America by voting ``yes'' for this legislation.

   This week, the House will vote on a trade agreement between the United States and Peru. By moving forward on the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement we are signaling that the United States will not retreat from trade and will maintain its commitment to its partners. 
   I note that my district depends on exports, both farmers, manufacturers, and workers, and the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement is good for the 11th District of Illinois. This agreement is about economics; it is about the big picture of our hemisphere. We know the numbers. 
   For the United States, on day one, 80 percent of our exports, consumer and industrial products, become duty free immediately. Illinois' small and medium enterprises will benefit greatly from the tariff elimination, as well as its largest employer in the district I represent, Caterpillar. Union workers who build world-famous Caterpillar machinery will benefit when their products such as off-highway trucks are no longer taxed when they arrive in Peru. These vehicles sell for about $1 million and face a 12 percent tariff, meaning $120,000 is added to the price of the vehicle. That goes away on day one, making Caterpillar equipment more competitive with Asian competition, and meaning Caterpillar's union workers will build more machinery for export. 
   The Peru TPA is good for Illinois farmers. Soybeans become duty free immediately, meaning new markets for our farmers. Before this agreement, Illinois pork and corn were at a competitive disadvantage to Chile and Argentina, who faced lower tariffs than the United States' products going into Peru. Now, our pork producers and corn farmers will be competitive. In fact, farmers' groups say Peru and the Colombia Free Trade Agreements are the best deals ever negotiated on behalf of agriculture. In fact, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement has the potential to increase farm exports by well over $700 million a year. We benefit from two-way trade. 
   But this agreement has broader implications beyond increasing exports for Illinois farmers and manufacturers. Peru is a leader in the hemisphere, and the leadership of President Toledo and now President Garcia is making a difference. Poverty is being reduced, real jobs are being created, and Peru is becoming an economic success story for the hemisphere. Peru is achieving results at home not by following anti-American rhetoric or by giving in to populist demagoguery, but by sound economics and partnerships with the United States. We congratulate President Garcia on his 8 percent economic growth and poverty reduction, and I note poverty is down to 49 percent this past year. This trade agreement is not the solution to poverty, but it is a tool and it will help. 
   In 1994, 270,000 jobs in Peru relied on exports; today, more than 1 million rely on exports, thanks to trade granted by Andean Trade Preferences granted by this Congress. Now, this agreement has the potential to create 1 million more formal jobs in Peru because of exports. Clearly, this partnership with Peru will help lift more families out of poverty.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, to urge the Speaker of this House to bring the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to this House floor for a vote. 
   And let me tell you this: this agreement is good for the State that I represent. It's good for Colombia. It's good for the United States. It's good for Illinois farmers. It's good for Illinois workers. And it's good for Illinois manufacturing. 
   And I would note that in my district I have 8,000 Caterpillar workers, union Caterpillar workers who are manufacturing workers. And under this agreement, I note under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement that our machinery exports see their tariffs imposed on Illinois-made construction equipment eliminated on day one. Now, you think about it, mining equipment used in Colombia is $1 million equipment, that's a $100,000 tax on U.S.-made products eliminated on day one. 
   Currently, Illinois exports $214 million to Colombia, and that's just the beginning. According to the International Trade Commission, Illinois is a big winner. Pork products will increase 72 percent, according to their economic analysis. Corn and soybeans will see increased sales to Colombia. Fabricated metal products, processed foods, and chemicals will all see increases. And, again, it's expected that machinery, manufactured machinery, like products made by John Deere and Navistar and Caterpillar, will increase 15 percent. 
   Agriculture. The leaders of agriculture will tell you the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement is the best for agriculture in the history of all trade negotiations. And let's not forget that 80 percent of U.S. exports are currently taxed when they enter Colombia, and they will become duty free immediately. That will allow us to  become competitive with China and Asia and other competition. 
   We know Colombia, a democracy, as a reliable partner and ally. We know that Colombia is the oldest democracy in Latin America. And we also recognize that President Uribe of Colombia is our hemisphere's most popular elected official with over 80 percent approval ratings. Compare that to this Congress, which has a 15 percent approval rating. Big difference. 
   Now, there are those who oppose the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. They say that Colombia, amongst all the good things it's done, just hasn't done enough regarding violence against labor leaders. Let's remember that Colombia has had 40 years of civil strife driven by left-wing gorillas trying to overthrow the democratically elected government of Colombia. But today, 71 percent of Colombians say they feel more secure under President Uribe; 73 percent say Uribe respects human rights. Those are Colombians, not Americans, saying that. 
   Homicides are down 40 percent in Colombia; kidnappings are down 76 percent. The murder rate today in Medellin, once the poster child of violence in Colombia, one of the most dangerous cities on the planet, today has a lower murder rate than Washington, DC, or Baltimore. 
   But let's look at the facts on labor violence. President Uribe has made major changes, beginning with reforming the judiciary. He has had hired 418 new prosecutors, 545 new investigators. In fact, in the Prosecutor General's Office, responsible for targeting those who are responsible for the violence in Colombia, they've added over 2,000 new posts. 
   Funding has gone up 75 percent in the last few years alone under President Uribe. And quoting Carlos Rodriguez, president of the United Workers Confederation, a labor leader in Colombia: ``Never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important.'' Again, that's a Colombian labor leader. 
   President Uribe and Colombia, under the government initiatives, have worked to protect labor leaders, giving them special protections. Last year, they spent over $38 million for body guard protection for labor union leaders; 1,500 union members and activists received special protection, the second largest protected group in Colombia, and it's been successful. For labor activists under this program, none have lost their lives. And I would note that the murder rate today for labor unionists is lower than the national murder rate for everyone else. 
   So progress has been made. 
   And I would note that crimes categorized as anti-union violence often are not union related, but regular crime that everyone in Colombia has contended with, many are the responsibility of the leftist FARC. 
   I would note that the International Labor Organization has removed Colombia from its labor watch list. Colombia has agreed to a permanent ILO representative in Colombia. And perhaps most telling, 14 Colombian labor leaders have given their support to the trade agreement. 
   The bottom line is, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement is good for Illinois workers, it's good for Illinois manufacturers, it's good for Illinois farmers. Let's bring it up for a vote. I ask my colleagues to support this important trade agreement. And I will also include for the Record a copy of an ``Economist'' article talking about President Hugo Chavez and the FARC and their opposition to this agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in 1997, I voted ``yes'' to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. I was proud a Republican Congress put this plan into place, and I support reauthorization of this program, but I oppose this bill before us. 
   Why? This bill contains big tax increases. What is interesting, when we want to make health insurance more affordable, they put a new $2 billion tax, they call it a per capita tax, on health insurance policies, causing them to be more expensive. 
   Then there are some big Medicare cuts, in fact, almost $200 billion in Medicare cuts, probably the biggest cut in Medicare in the history of the program. They want to expand the program, but they want to pay for it on the backs of senior citizens by cutting Medicare. So you wonder who gets hurt when you cut Medicare to pay for the expansion of this program. 
   If you just take the $7.6 billion in cuts to home health care, you think of that elderly woman that many of us have met. We have been in her home. She is an elderly woman with an easy chair by the window, by the television. She has a tray or table there. It is filled with pill bottles. She is homebound. She watches the world go by. And if she is lucky, she has a cat or a dog for a pet and a companion. But, for her, home health care is important, because not only is it contact with the outside world, but home health care allows her to live in her home in dignity even though she is homebound. 
   This plan today that is going to be voted on includes a $7.6 billion cut in home health care. So if you vote ``yes'' for this legislation, I hope you keep in mind that elderly woman stuck at home, homebound, who is dependent on home health care; and today she will suffer when this House passes this bill. Vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (SUPPORTING COLOMBIA, AMERICA'S BEST FRIEND IN LATIN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to express concern about an action taken by the majority of this House this past week. 
   When the question is often asked, who is America's best friend in Latin America, no matter where you are in Latin America, they always say the democratically-elected government of Colombia is America's best friend. 
   This last week, the House of Representatives voted to turn its back on America's best friend. At a time when the autocrats threaten democracy, when democracy is at risk in Latin America by those who threaten it, such as the President of Venezuela, this Congress, this House, voted to turn its back on Latin America's oldest democracy, America's best friend in Latin America. 
   If you think about it, who else is Colombia? Colombia is also America's most reliable and strongest partner when it comes to addressing terrorism and addressing narcotics. Colombia has been there. 
   President Uribe, the President of Colombia, today is the most popular elected President in the entire hemisphere. This Congress has a 15 percent approval rating with the American people. Fifteen, 1-5 percent. President Uribe has 80 percent approval ratings with his own people. Why? Because he was elected to reduce violence. He was elected to bring security to his country, and today 73 percent of the Colombian people have said in a recent opinion poll that they feel more secure in Colombia. Seventy-two percent in that same poll said they believe President Uribe is making progress and at the same time protecting human rights. So President Uribe has made tremendous progress. 
   Today, violence has been reduced, kidnapping is down, murder rates are down. In fact, it is safer to walk the streets of Bogota, Colombia, or Medellin, once known as the most dangerous city in all the world, than it is to walk the streets of Washington, DC. 
   President Uribe with Plan Colombia and the support of his own people has made tremendous progress. They are reliable partners, reliable friends. And last week this House voted to turn its back on the democratically-elected government of Colombia. Think what message that sends to Latin America, about how the United States House of Representatives respects and treats our friends in Latin America. 
   We have before us a trade promotion agreement with Colombia. It is a good agreement. My friend and colleague from Ohio says it is all about oil. We don't need a trade agreement to buy oil from Colombia. In fact, right now Colombian products, manufactured goods and farm products enter the United States duty free. There are no taxes on their imports. But U.S. products, such as construction equipment, the bulldozers that could be used in mining and various other economic projects in Colombia, face 15 percent tariffs. Our corn and soybeans and livestock products face tariffs of up to 40 percent, but Colombian agricultural products enter the United States duty free. We need a trade promotion agreement with Colombia to even the playing field. 
   We often hear from folks back home, you know, we need trade agreements that are fair and where we treat each other equally, so if they get access to our market, we get access to their's. Well, under the status quo, they have that. We need this agreement so we get access to their market. 
   Some say Colombia is not very important. Well, there are 42 million people there. It is the second largest Spanish-speaking Nation in the world. It is America's best friend. But we have a good agreement before us. 
   Some have said we need to oppose this agreement because there has been violence against union activists. The Uribe government has acknowledged that. In fact, they have done some incredible things. They have increased the budget for prosecution of violent acts by 72 percent. They have added almost 2,200 prosecutors and lawyers and others for the Prosecutor General to go after those who commit violent crimes. 
   When it comes specifically to labor leaders in Colombia, as the Washington Post has pointed out, the murder rate for labor leaders in Colombia is actually lower than the national murder rate, and any murder is unacceptable, whether it is here in Washington, DC or Bogota. 
   The bottom line is, Colombia is our friend. This House voted to turn its back on our best friend. We need to move forward on the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. We should bring that forward and give our best friend in Latin America what they deserve. They have earned it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, in July of 2007, H.R. 2608, bipartisan legislation, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act, passed the House by unanimous voice vote. In early August, just over a month ago, the Senate finally passed an amended version of the bill by unanimous consent, and we are here today acting to accept the amended bill. 
   This bipartisan legislation increases the amount of time certain low income, disabled and aged immigrants can receive Supplemental Security Income benefits. Currently these individuals are eligible for these benefits during their first 7 years in the United States. This legislation would extend that period to 9 years, or even longer if the individual has a pending application for citizenship. 
   These individuals arrived and remain in the United States legally and also arrived for humanitarian reasons. They have fled persecution and suffering in their own countries, and include refugees, asylees, Cuban-Haitian entrants, Hmong tribesmen who fought on the side of the United States, victims of communist dictatorships and victims of trafficking from around the world. This legislation provides them additional eligibility to ensure that a lengthy citizenship application process does not inadvertently cause an elderly or disabled refugee to lose access to SSI benefits. 
   Because this expanded eligibility for low income, disabled and aged immigrants will be extended only through fiscal year 2011, a future Congress will need to review whether these provisions are working as intended and need to be extended. That future Congress can and should question whether refugees and others, who are playing by the rules and who apply for citizenship, have adequate and sufficient time to go through that process without losing access to SSI benefits. 
   To cover the cost of these additional benefits, the bill would reduce Federal income tax refunds to better recover unemployment benefit overpayments resulting from fraud. Tax refund offsets already occur for delinquent child support payments and certain other debts owed to the Federal Government. This change simply allows the current process to work in recovering certain unemployment benefit overpayments. 
   In addition to improving program integrity, this change will more than pay for the added SSI benefits provided by the bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   The Ways and Means Committee, and in particular the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member, has long been active in developing legislation to combat fraud and abuse in unemployment and other benefits. I am pleased to see us continuing that effort with this legislation. 
   For example, in 2004, under the leadership of former Chairman WALLY HERGER, we passed a law to stop the illegal manipulation of State unemployment taxes. We also allowed State unemployment benefit programs to use current data on new hires to help prevent benefit overpayments. 
   This legislation builds on those efforts, and I am proud to support it. Even if it is not needed as a pay-for, this good government provision merits passage on its own. 
   This legislation is supported by a wide range of faith-based and other community groups, such as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Lutheran Social Services and Catholic Charities. 
   I would also like to recognize the efforts of my Ways and Means colleague, Representative PHIL ENGLISH of Pennsylvania, who has worked diligently to extend SSI benefits to this vulnerable immigrant group, including by introducing legislation to do so. 
   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   H.R. 2608 is bipartisan legislation. It's legislation designed to help those who need help. As my chairman noted, those who, frankly, benefit from this legislation have been victims of tyranny. Those who fought on the wrong side and, in many cases, they fought on the side of the United States and were forced to flee their country, they're elderly, they're disabled, and, frankly, they're people that came here legally. 
   So I want to ask my colleagues to do exactly what we did when we voted on this legislation before, to vote with strong, unanimous, bipartisan support of this important legislation. 
   I also want to thank my chairman for working in a bipartisan way to move this important legislation to the floor, to work with our colleagues in the Senate and the past legislation, which will become law with this vote today. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this legislation. I thank my chairman for the opportunity to work with him on this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (JACOB M. LOWELL POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6681, legislation I introduced in honor of Jacob M. Lowell to name the New Lenox Post Office in his honor. I also want to thank Chairman Waxman, Ranking Member Tom Davis, my very good friend, Chairman Danny Davis, a member of our Illinois delegation, as well as Ranking Member Kenny Marchant for their support and assistance today. 
   Army Specialist Jacob Michael Lowell is a national hero who gave his life for his country on June 2, 2007, near Gowardesh, Afghanistan, while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom. Today the House will be voting on legislation I introduced with the cosponsorship of the entire Illinois delegation which will designate the New Lenox Post Office the ``Jacob M. Lowell New Lenox Post Office Building.'' I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Army Specialist Jacob Lowell of New Lenox, Illinois, graduated from Lincoln-Way Central High School in 2003. He attended St. Xavier University before heeding the call to serve his country and enlist in the Army in 2005. Specialist Lowell was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Air Assault), 173rd Airborne Brigade, Camp Ederle, Italy. He is remembered by his fellow soldiers for being an avid football fan and expressing his support by shouting ``Go Bears'' at nearly any time. 
   On June 2, 2007, Jacob Lowell heroically defended his convoy. And as his company commander said, he did his duty all the way up until the end. After already having been hit by small arms fire and facing enemies using rocket-propelled grenades, Specialist Lowell manned a 50-caliber machine gun in defense of many members of his platoon. The wounds he suffered proved to be fatal to Specialist Lowell, but they were not enough to keep him from doing his heroic duty. Those present that day credit Jacob with saving lives. 
   Hearing such actions reminds us just how brave our men and women in uniform are. 
   Lowell was awarded the Bronze Star with ``V'' for valor and the Combat Infantryman's Badge for his actions during the firefight, and on May 12, 2008, his fellow soldiers renamed a combat outpost in Nuristan Province after their beloved, fallen comrade. 
   Local veterans have always reminded me that it's important to honor our soldiers and veterans each and every day. By naming the New Lenox Post Office after Jacob, we effectively honor all of them. It should be in the hearts and minds of all those who visit this post office that heroes like Jacob both founded our Nation and stand ready to protect it each and every day. 
   Our sincerest thanks to Specialist Lowell and to his family, and the honor of renaming this post office could never match the gift which Jacob has given our Nation. This honor merely represents that we should never forget the sacrifice which he and all who have sacrificed their lives serving our Nation have made for each and every one of us. 
   I know that we will all keep the family of Specialist Lowell and those of his fallen comrades in our prayers. I ask again that you will join me in honoring and remembering this extraordinary man whose heroism exemplifies everything that America stands for, and I ask you to support H.R. 6681, the Jacob Lowell New Lenox Post Office Designation Act. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Joseph Eannello for his hard work on this legislation and for his work in my office over the past 2 years. He has been an asset in my office and done excellent work for the people of the 11th Congressional District of Illinois. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support of this important legislation to honor someone who has sacrificed for our freedoms.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, so I will take this opportunity to close. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in favor of this resolution authored by my friend, Jon Porter, who is a strong advocate for adoption and foster children while serving on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
   Of course this resolution promotes awareness of adoption and of the children in foster care awaiting loving, adoptive families. I want to recognize all of those parents who have opened their hearts and homes to provide a loving foster home or adopted home for children. 
   In my home State of Illinois, 1,740 children were adopted from foster care in 2006. Nationwide, 51,000 children moved from foster care to adoption this past year. However, with nearly 500,000 children in the foster care system and approximately 130,000 of these children waiting for a family to adopt them, we have much more work to do. 
   That's why I'm so pleased that this House is ready to pass this resolution marking National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month, but it's also paired with the important bipartisan legislation this House just considered and just voted unanimously to approve which provides greater incentives to provide loving homes to children in need of adoption as well as foster children in need of a loving home. Again, I want to commend my colleagues for that bipartisan effort. 
   I urge all Members to support this resolution, to work with the many dedicated faith-based and other groups in their districts who promote adoption, not only in November but every month of the year. There can be no greater gift to a child who has been removed from his or her own parents than to find new, loving, adoptive parents who want to care for him or her as their own. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this important resolution offered by my friend and colleague, Jon Porter of Nevada. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS AND INCREASING ADOPTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 6893, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, legislation I am proud to cosponsor with my chairman, Mr. McDermott. 
   This bipartisan, bicameral House-Senate agreement extends the Adoptions Incentives program, which has earned due praise for increasing adoptions from the Nation's foster care system. It improves the program by raising financial incentives for adopting older children who are the hardest to adopt, among other changes. That program expires in 2 weeks, so passage of this legislation is both necessary and timely. 
   But this bill does much, much more. It expands the eligibility of special needs children for Federal adoption assistance, promoting the adoption of thousands more children out of the foster care system in the coming years. Along the way, it places a priority on older children, children in foster care the longest, and sibling groups who are the hardest to find adoptive families. 
   The bill also promotes stronger family ties in caring for children removed from their own parents due to abuse and neglect, and expects States to do more to locate adult relatives like grandparents or aunts and uncles who can step in to care for such children. And by permitting child welfare agencies access to information from the child support program, the bill helps provide tools to help with that process. 
   It allows States to provide Federal payments to help those adults care for children. And it helps those adults obtain other assistance to ensure kids in their care can thrive. Instead of busting the budget, these pro-family changes actually save money by cutting expensive foster care administrative costs, while most importantly, improving the outcomes for kids in need of a loving home. 
   The bill also responds to concerns that too many youth today are ``emancipated'' from foster care at age 18 and end up on the streets, in jail, or worse. It offers more help for these older foster youth, providing for their care through age 21 as a State option. But like any responsible parent would expect, it requires able-bodied young people over age 18 to work, stay in school, or participate in training to receive the additional help. Like successful welfare reform policies of the 1990s, it conditions assistance on youths engaging in positive behavior. 
   The same goes for foster and adoptive youth under age 18. For the first time, they would have to stay in school for their foster parents to receive Federal financial assistance. That may be tough love, but it is far more loving than subsidizing high school dropouts as taxpayers often do today for a shocking share of young people in foster care. 
   I am honored that this legislation includes two provisions I have worked for years to pass and which will benefit children in foster care. First, it ensures equal access to foster care assistance for Native American children, allowing tribes to operate programs just like the States do today. 
   Second, it provides that all child welfare workers, whether employed by public or not-for-profit agencies, have access to the same resources for training so they can provide the best service to families and most of all children in foster care. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation is good for children and for families. It is good for communities, and it is good for taxpayers. It is fully paid for, including by reducing unnecessary foster care administrative costs and by incorporating antifraud reforms proposed by the administration, amongst other savings. It is bipartisan, and includes the best of legislation developed by the House and Senate to better protect and support children. I urge all Members to support this excellent piece of legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, as this is the final major legislative activity in the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member, I would like to thank the hardworking staff who have made this legislation possible. On the Ways and Means Committee Republican staff, I would especially like to thank Matt Weidinger, Margo Smith, and Brian Newell, who have helped me as ranking member of the Income Security Subcommittee. 
   Last, but not least, I would also like to thank Jack Dusik, who has handled much of my Ways and Means Committee activities for over 5 years. Jack has been a tireless servant of the American people and a great asset to me in representing the 11th Congressional District, and I wish him well as he moves onward. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my gratitude to my friend, Chairman McDermott, for his friendship over my years in Congress. It has been a real pleasure working with him as a strong partner in fighting for America's disadvantaged youth on the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this important bipartisan legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation, bipartisan legislation. 
   I note it's a 10-month extension of the existing trade preferences we grant our friends in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. What's important about this 10 months is it gives us ample opportunity for our friends in Peru to work with us to implement the recently ratified U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. It gives us the opportunity over the next 10 months to move forward on ratification of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, of course Colombia being our most reliable partner for the United States in Latin America. 
   But today we want to talk about trade preferences for the Andean region. When you think about it, 2 million families today are watching the United States Congress. Two million families in the four countries in the Andean region have jobs and livelihoods that depend on the trade preferences. If the trade preferences go away, the livelihood for those 2 million families goes away. 
   Peru, 800,000 jobs have been created by trade preferences. Colombia, 600,000 jobs. Ecuador, 350,000 jobs. Bolivia, up to 150,000 jobs directly and indirectly created as a result of the Andean trade preferences. And when you think about it, what's the alternative? In this region, which is seeking opportunity, and thanks to the U.S. Congress and the Bush administration we have worked to create these trade preferences, the alternatives, if they lose their jobs, are they become part of the wave of illegal immigration as they seek economic opportunities or to become involved in illicit activity, such as the growing of coca and involved in narcotrafficking networks. They don't want to do that. They want good, honest jobs, and the trade preferences give them that. 
   This past week I was part of a bipartisan delegation visiting Ecuador and Bolivia with my friend ELIOT ENGEL and others. It was a bipartisan delegation. We saw firsthand how regular folks, little people, workers, small businesses, men and women, particularly those who in the past have been denied economic opportunity, because of the trade preferences, the opportunity to export to the U.S. market, they have economic opportunity.     
   In Otavalo, Ecuador, we met with a women's cooperativo where they made sweaters and textiles for the U.S. market. We visited those who are involved in cacao production for the purpose of making chocolate, and they are creating organic chocolates that we consume, they can sell in the U.S. market. We, of course, visited organic coffee growers, and we saw how they can take advantage of preferences creating jobs in Ecuador. In Bolivia we visited a textile factory where thousands of workers who otherwise would not have jobs were involved in making garments, assembling textiles and various materials inputs that are manufactured in the United States that are assembled in La Paz, Bolivia, creating jobs and economic opportunity. The point is easily well made that without the trade preferences, those jobs go away. 
   And what is the consequence to America? Another wave of illegal immigration, people seeking economic opportunity, the temptation to become involved in the growing of coca and other crops that are used for narcotics. 
   What is really important I think to note is when we talk about what we as Americans can do to help lift up our neighbors, the trade preferences really work. They come at little or no cost to the United States. But they create a tremendous amount of opportunity in the democracies of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. 
   I urge bipartisan support.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly stand in opposition of this legislation. We had an opportunity to develop bipartisan legislation, and I regret that was not achieved today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record this particular advertising for the building trades of the AFL-CIO.  
   New energy taxes won't create energy ..... but they will destroy jobs. 
   Reliable, affordable supplies of energy fuel America's economy and support millions of American jobs. 
   But some in Congress want to put all this in jeopardy with new, higher taxes on energy. History shows such taxes reduce domestic energy production. But they also  threaten to undermine America's economy--and send American jobs overseas. 
   Americans need energy policies that ensure reliable supplies to create jobs and support our quality of life for generations to come Americans need more energy, not more energy taxes.  
   And let me quote this ad here. It says, ``Reliable, affordable supplies of energy fuel America's economy and support millions of American jobs. 
   ``But some in Congress want to put all this in jeopardy with new, higher taxes on energy. History shows such taxes reduce domestic energy production. But they also threaten to undermine America's economy, and send American jobs overseas.'' 
   Very simple. Very succinct. The primary reason most Members who oppose this bill stand in opposition, because it raises taxes on domestic manufacturers and domestic jobs. I would like to keep those jobs in America, and this bill will send those jobs elsewhere. 
   I also want to draw attention to something I find, frankly, kind of alarming in this legislation, and the reason I would encourage my colleagues who are thinking about supporting this legislation to think twice. And that's what has become known as the Venezuela carve-out in this legislation. Now, the Chavez government in Venezuela admittedly is no friend of the United States. We just hear the rhetoric each and every day, and they've made that very clear. But this legislation carves out the PDVSA, the Venezuelan Government-owned oil company, from the tax increases. Now the biggest gasoline retailer in America is the Venezuelan Government-owned oil company, and one of the biggest refineries of America is CITGO, and they're exempt from the tax increases. 
   Now, who is the Chavez government? The Chavez government is Iran's best friend. The Chavez government started direct flights between Caracas and Tehran, and now Iranian's intelligence and security operatives use that to come into Latin America and the Western Hemisphere. And frankly, it was the Chavez government that sent troops into a Jewish grade school just two years ago and just this past December raided a Jewish community center in Caracas claiming that the community was hiding guns. 
   And also, just this past week, President Chavez of Venezuela said it is his policy to keep oil at $100 a barrel, that he is going to work with OPEC to keep oil prices high. And this legislation, I can't believe it was done intentionally, but this legislation gives a carve-out to the Venezuelan Government-owned oil company. No friends of ours. I hope my colleagues think twice about supporting this. 
   I believe we had an opportunity for bipartisanship. Much in this bill are good ideas. Much of it builds on what we passed in 2005 in the energy bill of 2005, which I strongly supported. 
   My own district, the revisions in the 2005 energy bill that provided incentives for the development of alternative sources of energy, renewable sources of energy, have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the 11th Congressional District of Illinois: wind energy, biofuels, ethanol, and biodiesel. And it creates jobs right here at home. There are some good ideas. We need to work on it in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, this bill does not achieve that goal.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, JERRY COSTELLO, for yielding and join in honoring the life and service of someone who was a friend to many in this Chamber. 
   My friend and predecessor, George Sangmeister, served in this body for 6 years, representing the district I currently represent, the 11th Congressional District, which was previously numbered as the 4th District of Illinois. 
   George Sangmeister was born in Frankfurt, Illinois, 76 years ago. He attended Joliet Junior College before entering the military and serving in the Korean War. After returning to private life, he attended Elmhurst College and then earned a law degree from John Marshall Law School. 
   George Sangmeister had a distinguished service career of 34 years of public service. He began his practice in private law before becoming a magistrate and justice of the peace for Will County in 1961; in 1964, became Will County State's Attorney. 
   In 1972, George Sangmeister was elected as a Democrat to the Illinois House of Representatives; 1976, after two terms in the State house, he was elected to the State senate. George Sangmeister became a respected Democratic leader in the State legislature, and, in 1986, Democratic nominee for Governor, Adlai Stevenson, chose George Sangmeister as his running mate. 
   In 1988, George Sangmeister was elected to Congress, served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee where he helped to bring the veterans outpatient clinic to Joliet and worked tirelessly to expand health care benefits for veterans. After three terms in the House, he declined to seek reelection in 1994. He chose to return to private law practice. 
   George Sangmeister is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, Kurt; a daughter, Kimberly; and four grandchildren. 
   I join my friend JERRY COSTELLO and members of the Illinois delegation in asking this House to honor and remember the late Congressman George Sangmeister for his 34 years of public service to Illinois and our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this two-sentence non-binding resolution which demoralizes our troops in the field while providing aid to our enemy during a time of on-going conflict. These brave men and women deserve the full support of their government, not second-guessing from politicians in Washington, DC. Instead of discussions regarding appropriate funding levels to support our troops, the Democratic majority has chosen to rebuke the conduct of the war while it is still occurring. This is reckless and ill-advised. 
   This resolution encourages our enemies to continue provoking our fighting men and women. America's enemies around the world are closely watching what we say and do today. By passing this non-binding resolution, Members of Congress are sending a vote of no confidence to our troops in the field and a message of surrender to our enemies. 
   I strongly believe it is not the place of politicians in Washington to devise military tactics and strategy. Congress must not tie the hands of our military commanders in the field. You cannot fight a war by committee, thousands of miles away. The responsibility of conducting America's military strategy and the tactics of our armed forces should be left to our military commanders on the ground. 
   The plan to increase the number of additional troops to the mission in Iraq should be given a chance to succeed. These 20,000 additional soldiers will assist the Iraqi government in its new, Iraqi-inspired security plan. As Prime Minister Maliki said, ``This is 100 percent an Iraqi plan under an Iraqi Command.'' 
   The majority of U.S. forces will be deployed to Baghdad to assist in maintaining control of areas cleared of terrorists and insurgents. As our military commanders in the field have repeatedly told us, part of the problem in securing Baghdad comes from the fact that many of the insurgents lie in wait until American troops move to another area only to emerge and retake precious territory gained by hard battle. By having additional troops in the field, the Iraqis will have a better chance to capture all of the insurgents, including those who stay hidden, waiting to attack again. 
   Our commanders on the ground have given this plan a green light, and I will defer to them to make military decisions. We should keep in mind our top commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, has warned against passing this very type of resolution. Our troops have said they want the chance to finish the mission that has been started. 
   Our troops do not want Congress to conduct this war. As one soldier posted to a blog on February 5, 2007, ``Proposing to legislate the conduct of this long war looks worse than cut and run. It feels like the betrayal of the families who bear the burdens.'' 
   Congress should not tell our soldiers how to conduct a war any more than Congress should tell a lawyer how to argue a case or a doctor how to perform a surgery. Congress's place is to support our troops by providing the funding they need to finish the mission that was started. If my colleagues are so strongly opposed to the mission in Iraq, they can vote to cut the funding of our soldiers in harm's way. 
   We must recognize the War on Terror requires perseverance and patience. American patience, however, is not infinite. The lack of visible progress in Iraq is deeply troubling. The 
   Iraqi conflict has a crucial role in the war against al Qaeda. American troops are stemming the tide of a worsening situation. Failure in Iraq is simply not an option. It is important we in Congress demonstrate quickly our ability to win in Iraq before the situation gets worse. 
   This may well represent the Administration's last chance to demonstrate sustainable progress is securing the country. It is equally important; however, that Iraqis take ownership for their own country. Our troops, in whatever number, are not there permanently. The Iraqis must take an active role in shaping their country's future. Americans took control of America after the American Revolution; the Iraqis must do the same. The Iraqis must be made to recognize the need for Iraqis to control the future of their nation. Iraq's future should not be determined by Americans, only the Iraqis can and should do that. 
   In closing, I believe in and support our American troops. They have made tremendous progress in Iraq and should be commended for the actions towards making Iraq a country for the Iraqis. Since the declaration of the Global War on Terror, our brave men and women have worked hard to stem the tide of a worsening situation. Because of them, elections have been held in both Afghanistan and Iraq; the terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has been killed, former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was captured, tried and executed, and more than three-quarters of al Qaeda's known leaders and associates have been detained or killed. 
   At the same time, Iraqis must assume responsibility for their country. Americans will not stay in Iraq forever; Iraqis must assume control of their country. We must recognize the War on Terror requires perseverance and patience. American patience, however, is not infinite. The Iraqi conflict has a crucial role in the war against al Qaeda and American troops are stemming the tide of a worsening situation. However, I believe the Iraqi people must take an active role in shaping their country's future. Iraq's future should not be determined by Americans, only the Iraqis can and should do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (OWEN LOVEJOY PRINCETON POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2825, a bill I introduced that would name the post office in Princeton, Illinois after Owen Lovejoy. Owen Lovejoy is perhaps best known for his role in advocating for the abolition of slavery and his work with the Underground Railroad. 
   Owen Lovejoy was born in Albion, Maine in 1811 to Daniel, a Presbyterian minister, and Elizabeth Lovejoy. While growing up, young Owen came to admire his older brother Elijah, who taught him Latin classics when Elijah came home from college. Owen grew up to follow in his brother's footsteps by attending Bowdoin College. Unfortunately, his father died while Owen was in school, forcing him to leave Bowdoin College after 3 years. 
   After the death of his father, Owen moved to Illinois to live with his brother Elijah, who was the editor of an anti-slavery newspaper. During this time, Owen became a convert to abolitionism. His dedication to abolitionism grew on November 7, 1937 when an anti-abolition mob attempted to destroy Elijah's printing press. In the ensuing struggle, Elijah Lovejoy was killed by the mob. For Owen, abolitionism became ``the cause that has been sprinkled with my brother's blood.'' 
   After his brother's death, Owen Lovejoy moved to Princeton, a village with a population of 200. Rev. Edward Beecher recommended him to Hampshire Colony Congregational Church, the church from which he spoke out against slavery for the next 17 years. 
   Owen used the pulpit to attack slavery. He also operated the ``Lovejoy Line'' of the Underground Railroad. His farmhouse, surrounded by 1300 acres of farmland, was one of the busiest for slaves trying to gain their freedom. 
   In 1854, Owen Lovejoy was elected to the Illinois legislature. Two years later, he was elected to Congress with the help of a fellow Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln. He served four terms as the Representative to Illinois' Third  Congressional District. As a Congressman, Owen continued to work towards the abolition of slavery. Owen worked with members in both chambers in creating legislation to weaken slavery and achieve equality for all people, regardless of race. 
   In 1863, Owen introduced the legislative version of the Emancipation Proclamation. Sadly, he did not get the chance to see his legislation become law. On March 25, 1864, Owen Lovejoy died of Bright's disease, 2 weeks before the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. When President Lincoln heard of Lovejoy's death, he wrote,  
   It can be truly said of him that while he was personally ambitious he bravely endured the obscurity which the unpopularity of his principles imposed . . . To the day of his death, it would scarcely wrong any other to say, he was my most generous friend.  
   I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Owen Lovejoy for his work and determination towards abolishing slavery in America by supporting H.R. 2825.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (THE U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to express concern about an action taken by this House this past week, and let me begin by asking this House who is America's best friend in Latin America? 
   Well, the answer is pretty loud and clear, and that is America's best friend in Latin America is the democratic Republic of Colombia, a nation of 42 million people, the second largest Spanish-speaking nation in the world, a nation which is recognized throughout Latin America and, frankly, throughout the world as United States' most reliable partner in counterterrorism, United States' most reliable partner in counternarcotics. It's the Republic of Colombia. 
   Well, this passed week the House of Representatives, the Democratic majority, which controls it, voted to turn its back, this Congress's back, on our most reliable partner in Latin America, sending a terrible signal to all of Latin America that if you are a good friend of the United States, you're not very important and you're not a very big priority, and when we have an agreement, we'll ignore it. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we have a trade promotion agreement with Colombia and the United States. It's a good agreement. Why is it a good agreement? Because it's a win-win-win for Illinois workers, Illinois farmers, Illinois manufacturers. The majority of this House, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of this House, voted earlier this past year to pass trade preferences for the Andean region, for countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. And what the trade preferences do is allow all the products that come in from Colombia that enter the United States duty free, no taxes, no tariffs. So agricultural products and manufactured goods made in Colombia and produced in Colombia enter the United States duty free. However, without the trade promotion agreement, products made in Illinois by Illinois workers or farm goods like corn and soybeans produced by Illinois farmers and, of course, manufacturers and workers all suffer taxes or tariffs on U.S.- and Illinois-made goods exported to Colombia. 
   We have often heard from constituents that say trade's important in Illinois and it just doesn't seem right when one country's products come into the United States duty free but we don't get reciprocity. And the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement gives us that reciprocity. In fact, farm organizations will tell you that the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement is the best ever negotiated to give U.S. farmers and growers and producers access to a foreign market. And when it comes to manufactured goods, 85 percent of the manufactured goods exported to Colombia would be duty free immediately.     
   In my district, I have 8,000 constituents, union members, who work for a company which makes the yellow bulldozers and yellow construction equipment. Right now, those bulldozers made in America suffer a 15 percent tariff, which means the cost of that product is 15 percent more, making Illinois-manufactured construction equipment, like bulldozers and mining trucks, 15 percent more expensive but also less competitive with Asian competition. 
   We need this trade promotion agreement. And we need to have that brought to the floor for an up-or-down vote. Because I believe if it is brought to the floor for an up-or-down vote, the majority of this House would agree that we need to continue to expand our markets overseas for Illinois-manufactured goods and Illinois farm products as well as American farm products and American manufactured goods. It is a good agreement.  
   Now, there are those who say, ``Colombia, yeah, they are our partner, and, of course, they are the oldest democracy in Latin America. But there has been violence in that country.'' Historically they are right. President Uribe, when he was elected, pledged to defeat the FARC, the left-wing narcotrafficking terrorist group which has troubled the nation of Colombia over the last 40 years. And he has made tremendous progress. 
   In fact, President Uribe today enjoys 80 percent approval. Eight out of 10 Colombians approve of the leadership of President Uribe. And if you look at this Congress, this House of Representatives, this Congress has an 18 percent approval rating. So clearly, the Colombians think more of their president than the American people do this Congress. And at the same time that he has made progress defeating the left-wing narcotrafficking FARC, 73 percent of the Colombian people believe he has made Colombia more secure and safer while respecting human rights. In fact, today the murder rate in Colombia is lower than in Washington, D.C. It is lower than in Baltimore. In fact, it is safer in Colombia than it is in our Nation's Capital.

President Uribe enjoys an 80 percent approval rating because he's made such progress in addressing five decades of violence and civil problems in the democratic Republic of Colombia.

   You said Illinois is headquarters to Caterpillar, and people think of the yellow construction equipment. There is more to it than you think, and that's why this trade agreement is so important. I have 8,000 Caterpillar employees residing in the 11th Congressional District of Illinois. They're union members, every one of them. And Caterpillar, of course, would benefit from this, and that means their workers would as well. Half of their production in Illinois is dependent on exports.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. There would be. And their growth has come as a result of export. 
   But the point that really needs to be made is there is tremendous economic growth going on in the Andean region, which Colombia is leading, and a lot of that is in the energy and the mining and raw material sector, which means they're going to use construction equipment. And right now, the construction equipment that union workers make in the district I represent, places like Joliet, Aurora, Pontiac and Decatur, it faces a 15 percent tariff when exported to Colombia. Now, some would say, what does that mean? That's a 15 percent tax on the price of that bulldozer. So that makes U.S. products less competitive, say, than competing with Japan.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 299. This resolution reflects bipartisan support for increasing public awareness of child abuse and neglect, which is a necessary first step to better protect children. 
   Yesterday, the House passed a resolution honoring foster parents, who play a major role in ensuring hundreds of thousands of children are protected from abuse and neglect each year. Today's resolution before us highlights the too large number of children who are abused and neglected each year and the many negative consequences of that abuse for children, families, and our Nation. The numbers are bracing. Almost 900,000 children in the United States were victims of abuse and neglect in 2005, the most recent figures. 
   Several government programs overseen by the subcommittee on which Chairman McDermott and I serve assist foster and adoptive families with children's needs or help reunify children with their own parents when that is safe and appropriate. But the very first step to ensure children are out of harm's way involves alert relatives, neighbors, friends, teachers, community organizations, and so many others in every neighborhood across this country. These are people who care, people who want to help, and people who take the time to step in to help make sure our children are safe and sound. 
   Consider some of those working hard right now to help children in the congressional district I represent in Illinois. Earlier this year I sat down with my local community support agencies to listen to their successes and their many challenges in helping to prevent child abuse and neglect. These agencies offer a wide variety of services to families, from Head Start, food programs, and affordable housing to social services and foster care when needed to ensure children are safe. 
   In the district I represent, Will County Catholic Charities protects over 300 children in foster care. The Guardian Angel Home and Groundwork in Joliet, Illinois, help abused women and children affected by domestic violence by providing services such as temporary housing, counseling, and legal assistance. Many others provide similar services in other parts of the district I represent, as well as in every congressional district in America. 
   We should never take these people and their agencies that deliver such good services for granted. Just last week, Catholic Charities in Chicago announced they are shutting down their foster care program after 90 years of service. Their absence will leave a void others will have to fill to ensure that more than 900 Illinois children they now care for are protected from harm. This will be a major challenge. Catholic Charities and the Guardian Angel Home are just two of the many organizations across the Nation that help children and families lead safe and productive lives. Many caseworkers and others who serve families directly have committed their lives to this critical service. They deserve our continued support. 
   Congress recently made improvements to key programs designed to protect children, including by providing additional resources for direct services and also caseworkers. Last year in the Child and Family Services Improvement Act, Congress increased accountability by requiring States to conduct more frequent caseworker visits to children in foster care. We also targeted over $145 million over the next 5 years for preventing and treating parental substance abuse, which is a key cause of child abuse and neglect. This legislation was fully paid for and was totally bipartisan. And for that I want to congratulate former Subcommittee Chairman Wally Herger of California, who worked with our current chairman, Jim McDermott of Washington State, to accomplish this goal. 
   I expect to introduce legislation shortly that would provide caseworkers with more resources to better serve children. Currently, when private organizations provide training to their caseworkers, they are eligible for fewer Federal funds to support those costs than are paid for to support the training of government-employed caseworkers. Same training, same job, but different payments, simply because one worker is employed by a private agency and another by a government agency. That is arbitrary and unfair, and we should fix it. I hope the same spirit of bipartisanship evident here today and that which created our work last year will help us get this legislation passed this year, in 2007. 
   There certainly is much more work to do. Many experts have long been concerned that current programs focus too many resources on helping families after children have been abused and neglected. That is simply too late, especially when the right resources might help prevent abuse or neglect from occurring. 
   As this resolution expresses, Congress should continue to work with the States to reduce child abuse and neglect. Thoughtful efforts are under way in States like Florida and elsewhere to test ways to better prevent abuse and neglect from happening instead of addressing it after the fact. We are eager to see these results and stand ready to incorporate any positive measures in reforms yet to come. In the meantime, this resolution focuses public attention on child abuse and on the resources available today to prevent child abuse. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to work together in a bipartisan way with the Ways and Means Committee to develop further measures to protect children from abuse and neglect.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (DEMOCRAT TAX INCREASES IN OUR FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, this week the House is going to be taking up the budget and there is nothing more basic in the fundamental process of being a legislator than the budget. What is written in the budget says a lot. In fact, the budget is really a defining difference when you put forward your budget. 
   The Democratic leadership is planning to bring their partisan Democratic budget to the floor. Again when you get down to basics, the differences are pretty clear because what is in the Democrat leadership's budget that they are bringing to the floor today is the biggest tax increase in the history of our Nation. Think about that. Can we really afford to tax the middle class more. 
   In their first order of business in the 110th Congress, the Democrats made it easier to raise taxes. When Republicans were in the majority, we said you couldn't raise taxes unless you had a two-thirds vote. The Democrats eliminated that because they wanted to make it easier to raise taxes. They have eliminated that rule. 
   They have shown their agenda before. Back when the Democrats were in the majority back when President Clinton called for a big tax increase, the Democrats followed and they rubber-stamped a tax increase at that time, which was the biggest tax increase in the history of our Nation, a $240 billion tax increase on the American people. 
   Just this past week, the Democrats outdid themselves. In fact, they brought an even bigger tax increase to the floor that we are going to debate this week. It was $240 billion 13 years ago, today it is a $400 billion tax increase. They plan to raise the tax on every taxpayer; man, woman, child, married, if you die, you are going to pay more in taxes under the Democrat budget. 
   In fact, if you are a typical couple in the district I represent making $60,000 a year, mom, dad and two kids, you will pay on average $2,000 more in higher taxes. That is a 60 percent increase in higher taxes called for in the Democrat budget. 
   In 2001 and 2003, Republicans worked with the President. We worked to eliminate unfairness in the Tax Code. We worked to lower taxes for the middle class. We succeeded in 2001 and 2003 in reducing taxes for a typical American family. And again, for a family making about $60,000 a year, those tax cuts meant about $2,000 more in higher take-home pay. That is money they can spend on their own needs. 
   In my home State of Illinois, 4.2 million taxpayers benefited from the creation of a new, lower tax bracket. We lowered taxes for everyone, but for lower income Americans, we created a 10 percent tax bracket. Today, 5 million Americans no longer pay Federal taxes because of that new tax bracket; and 1.4 million taxpayers benefited from our efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We increased the child tax credit benefiting 1.3 million Illinoisans. 
   We also passed into law my legislation which eliminated the marriage tax penalty. I stood on this floor day after day after day and I asked a pretty fundamental question: Is it right, is it fair that our Tax Code punishes the most basic institution in our society, which is marriage. And in 2001 we passed the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. That was our third try. Twice we passed the Marriage Tax Elimination Act, eliminating the marriage tax penalty, a tax on marriage and President Clinton vetoed that twice. President Bush signed it into law. 
   But today, millions of couples, in fact 24 million married working couples no longer pay the marriage tax penalty thanks to that legislation being signed into law. Unfortunately, the Democrats want to bring the marriage tax penalty back. In fact, you will hear some this week say ``they are probably rich'' because if they pay the marriage tax penalty, they must be rich. 
   Well, under their legislation this week, 23 million typical married couples in America will see their taxes go up just from the marriage tax penalty alone of almost $500 more in higher taxes just because they are married. Is that right? Is that fair? 
   We worked to benefit all taxpayers by lowering taxes in 2001 and 2003. Now  the Democrats, they want to come back and they want to raise taxes on all taxpayers, including reinstating the marriage tax penalty.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (PASS THE U.S.-PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, you know, trade and exports are important in States like Illinois, and particularly the district that I represent. 
   In Illinois, 17,000 businesses depend on exports for their survival. Forty percent of the corn soybeans and pork and beef and other livestock products are exported. One out of five manufacturing jobs is dependent on exports. 
   We have an opportunity today to expand trade. The 14 trade agreements this Congress has adopted in the last 12 years have created 16 million new jobs. 
   Today, we have before us the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. What's nice about this agreement is it makes trade a two-way street. Right now, Peruvian products enter the United States duty free. Manufactured goods, agricultural products from Peru enter the United States without tariffs or duties, but it's not reciprocal. Caterpillar, for example, our biggest manufacturer in Illinois, their products face a 12 percent tariff. 
   What's good about the agreement we're going to vote for today is 80 percent of the tariffs on manufactured goods are gone on day one for U.S. products exported to Peru under this trade agreement. 
   It is good for Illinois workers, it's good for Illinois manufacturers, and I also note for Illinois farmers. Right now, they're at a disadvantage. It gives them the opportunity to be competitive. Let's have a bipartisan vote for U.S.-Peru.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask this House, why do we continue to punish Illinois and U.S. manufacturers and farmers? 
   In the 531 days since the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement was signed, U.S. products exported to Colombia have suffered over $1 billion in taxes and tariffs because they were exported to the United States through Colombia. And during that period of time, Colombian products entering the United States come in duty free. That doesn't seem fair. 
   We have an agreement with Colombia to eliminate those tariffs, and every day we delay it costs almost $190 million a week in higher tariffs on U.S.-made products.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join in the strong bipartisan support for this legislation which is critical to our need to continue working to reduce poverty, to create jobs and to strengthen democracy. 
   Today this House has an opportunity to continue moving forward by extending the Andean trade preferences for Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia. It's only a short-term extension, 8 months, but it moves forward. 
   Just like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, these preferences create jobs, reduce poverty and also build capacity in nations that previously were left out. The Andean preferences offer many who have been previously left out of the opportunity to participate in free enterprise as well as the export marketplace. 
   I think of examples of communities who benefit. I think of the Gatazo-Zambrano community in Chimborazo, Ecuador, 400 indigenous families now being lifted out of poverty because they are now exporting broccoli and produce to the U.S. export market. 
   I think of the thousands of women engaged in flower production, as well as the processing of flowers in Colombia, involved in that industry, dependent on these preferences. And if they went out of business, China would take over the flower business. 
   There's almost 2 million jobs dependent in the Andean region on these Andean preferences which we created to lift people out of poverty. If you care about democracy in Latin America, you should vote ``yes.'' If you want to increase and expand markets for U.S. products, you should also vote ``yes'' because we in the United States benefit from the Andean trade preferences. 
   U.S. workers and businesses benefit, farmers; U.S. cotton exports to Peru and Colombia totaled $110 million in 2006, almost double that of 2001. U.S. yarn and fabric exports to Peru and Colombia more than doubled between 2002 and 2006. 
   And I would note that when we import garments from the Andean region benefiting from the Andean trade preferences, the components are largely from inputs manufactured in the United States. The Andean trade preferences are win/win for both. 
   It's important to remember they're temporary. We have good trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. We also need to move forward on them. And I urge a bipartisan bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the question: Why is the House of Representatives withdrawing from trade? Why is the House of Representatives drawing away from our need to export products to good markets? 
   The economic statistics speak volumes. This past week, we saw 3.3 percent economic growth for the last quarter. We'd all like to see it better, but what was interesting was that, of that 3.3 percent economic growth, almost all of it, in fact 3.1 percent economic growth, resulted from trade and from exports. So the good news in the economy today is that we're expanding our exports, and if we did not have the opportunity to export products, our economy would really be in bad shape because it's the export market that's keeping this economy moving forward with manufactured goods, agricultural goods, services, and other products. 
   Today, we are fortunate to have 16 bilateral agreements with other nations, many in our own hemisphere in the Americas, and we're fortunate to enjoy a trade surplus with all of them. We voted on these trade agreements in the House. Those who opposed them said, you know, if we have trade agreements, we always lose. Well, the interesting thing is, with the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement and with the Chilean Free Trade Agreement, we've seen the results. American farmers, American manufacturers and American workers are winning because we have a trade surplus with those countries today. In fact, we had a trade deficit with Central America before DR-CAFTA, and today, we have a trade surplus. So trade agreements win. 
   That's why I was so concerned when a spokesman for the Speaker of the House explained her refusal to schedule a vote on the Colombian trade agreement: You know, the economy is bad and trade agreements are bad for America. We can't have a vote on a trade agreement, because somehow that hurts us. 
   All you have to do is look at the facts, and you'll see that trade and exports are good for America. My State and the district that I represent in Illinois are trade dependent. We depend on exports to create jobs as does the rest of America whether it's union workers who make Caterpillar bulldozers in Joliet or in Decatur or in Peoria or whether it's farmers in Bureau County who are growing corn or soybeans. We depend on our exports, on the export market, to create jobs and to raise our incomes. Frankly, it's the export market today that's the engine of economic growth. We have before this House a good trade agreement. It's the U.S.-Colombia trade agreement. ``Trade promotion agreement'' is the technical term. 
   Colombia is not only the oldest democracy in Latin America; it is also the second largest Spanish-speaking country, a market of 42 million consumers. It's a country that has made tremendous progress. In fact, our ally Colombia, which is a democracy, has a very popular president. President Uribe is the most popular elected president in all of the Americas. He has an over 80 percent approval rating. Compare that with the United States House of Representatives, which, I think, has a 16 percent approval rating from our own citizens. Clearly, he has made progress. He inherited a civil war. He has made progress in reducing violence. He is bringing those who committed atrocities during the civil war, on both the left and the right, to trial to be held accountable. He is going after the narco-traffickers who have jeopardized the security of that country. 
   It's interesting to know that 71 percent of Colombians today say they feel more secure under President Uribe while 73 percent say Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down 40 percent. Kidnappings are down 76 percent. In fact, the murder rate in Colombia is the lowest in 15 years, and it's actually lower than that of Washington, D.C.'s. So, if you're a citizen of Colombia, you're safer than a tourist or a citizen who is walking the streets of Washington, D.C. when it comes to being a victim of violence. 
   The bottom line is the U.S.-Colombia trade agreement is good for America. There are those who always oppose trade, and they always have an excuse. They say, you know, in the history of Colombia, there has been some violence, and everyone acknowledges that. President Uribe and his government have made tremendous progress. Then they say, well, there has been violence against labor leaders. Yes, there has been. President Uribe and everyone involved acknowledge that, but they've made tremendous progress. The bottom line is, under President Uribe, Colombia is a safer and better place. 
   Colombia deserves a vote. We need to bring the U.S.-Colombia trade agreement to this floor and to vote on it up or down. I believe it will pass with a bipartisan majority, and American workers will be the winners.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concern over an action taken by the majority in this House this past week when this House, the majority of the House, the Democratic majority, voted to turn its back on the Republic of Colombia. 
   You know, when you ask the question of all of Latin America, who is our Nation's best friend, America's best friend in Latin America, everyone says the democratically elected government of Colombia. And when people ask who is America's most reliable ally when it comes to counternarcotics and counterterrorism in Latin America, everyone says it is the democratically elected government of the Republic of Colombia. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the damage that was done to the image of the United States is going to take us a long time to recover as a result of this House voting to turn its back on America's best friend in Latin America, the democratically elected Government of the Republic of Colombia.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (THE U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I stand to once again raise my concern and, frankly, disappointment by the decision of the majority party in this House to turn its back on America's best friend in Latin America. Ladies and gentlemen, the oldest democracy in South America is the Republic of Colombia. Colombia is a thriving democracy, a nation of 42 million citizens, the second largest Spanish-speaking nation in the world. And in Latin America, everyone recognizes the Uribe Government, the democratically elected Government of Colombia, as America's most reliable partner and America's best friend. And this House, with the Democratic majority voting almost unanimously, voted to turn its back on Colombia, America's best friend. 
   It is kind of interesting. Look at the progress that has been made in Colombia. President Uribe was elected by the people of Colombia to put an end to a longstanding civil war where narco-trafficking, leftist guerrillas, known as the FARC, ELN and right-wing narco-trafficking paramilitaries known as the Paras, all three of those terrorist groups have attacked the democratically elected government and destabilized the democratically elected government. And President Uribe was elected to put an end to that conflict. And he has made tremendous progress. 
   In fact, thousands upon thousands of paramilitaries have laid down their arms and agreed to honor the peace process and integrate back into society. Unfortunately, the FARC, which has ties to the government of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, continues to fight. But the government of President Uribe has made tremendous progress pushing the FARC into the far reaches of the country. And today, villages that have never seen the presence of a national government, certainly not in decades, today enjoy the security provided by the government of President Uribe, tremendous progress. 
   In fact, violence has dropped so much, cities such as Medellin, which was once known as one of the most dangerous places on the planet, today is safer than the city of Baltimore. In fact, the murder rate of Baltimore is higher than Medellin, Colombia. So it is safer to walk the streets of Medellin than it is to walk the streets of Baltimore. And we want to commend the Uribe Government, the democratically elected Government of Colombia for the progress they have made. 
   We have an opportunity with the trade promotion agreement to further cement our ties with our best friend, an agreement that is good for American workers. It is good for American manufacturers. It is good for American farmers. Right now Colombian products enter the United States essentially duty-free. Their agricultural products and their manufactured goods come in without any tariffs. But U.S.-made products such as bulldozers that are made in the district I represent, if they are exported to Colombia, they face tariffs of 10 to 12 percent. Some of our agricultural commodities such as corn face tariffs of 45 percent. 
   Clearly, those tariff barriers, those taxes, make U.S. products less competitive with Argentine corn or Asian competition for construction equipment. And I would note since this trade promotion agreement was signed between the United States and Colombia, over $1 billion U.S. in tariffs have been imposed upon American goods, manufactured goods and agricultural products that have been exported to Colombia. And we are waiting to ratify this agreement which would eliminate those tariffs and make U.S. products more competitive.  
   The bottom line is the trade promotion agreement is good for American workers. It is good for American farmers. It is good for American manufacturers. In fact, the agricultural community will tell you that the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement is the best agreement in our Nation's history with any other nation when it comes to access to products grown in the United States and exported to Colombia. The bottom line is it is a good agreement. 
   Now my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, say, well, Colombia hasn't done enough. We need to make them do more. There is still some violence there. And until they eliminated it all, well, gee. Well, the bottom line is that Medellin, which was once the murder capital of the world, is now safer than the city of Baltimore. And some people who oppose this agreement say, well, there has been some labor leaders who have experienced violence. But look at the history they have. But as the Washington Post just pointed out, it is safer to be a labor leader in Colombia than it is to be a regular citizen. In fact, the murder rate of labor leaders is lower than the average murder rate of any other citizen in Colombia. Again, President Uribe has made progress. 
   Let's honor our Nation's best friend in Latin America. Let's honor our most reliable partner. Let's bring to this floor the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. Let's bring it up for a vote, because we know it will pass. Let's get it ratified and move forward so we can grow our economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 6307, the Fostering Connections to Success Act. I also want to thank my chairman for his leadership and his dedicated example of working together in a bipartisan way to help vulnerable kids. This legislation, H.R. 6307, is an example of what we can accomplish when we work together. And, again, I want to thank Chairman McDermott for this opportunity to work together. 
   This is bipartisan legislation, and it's a result of a series of hearings in which we heard about how youth are shortchanged in the current foster care system. For example, most foster youth  experience three to four placements while in care and some many more than that. Different homes often mean different schools, poor performance, repeated grades, and far too many ultimately dropping out before graduation. About one in four foster youth do not complete high school. In fact, many attend three to four different schools during their foster care experience, and even more don't complete school on the same timetable as their peers. 
   To address such serious problems, this legislation steps up efforts to engage adult relatives in caring for children abused or neglected by their parents. My home State of Illinois has been at the forefront of efforts to support more care by adult relatives, like grandparents, adults, or cousins, rather than strangers in foster care. These efforts resulted in better outcomes for children, including more stability and safety, stronger attachments to school and community, and better long-run prospects for young people. H.R. 6307 encourages more care by relatives nationwide. 
   A former intern in my Washington office, Jamaal Nutall of Joliet, who testified before our subcommittee, was a product of the foster care system and whose life was turned around by being placed in the care of relatives. Jamaal lived what we all intuitively know to be sound policy. In most cases placement with a child's own family makes for the best environment for the child to grow and prosper. 
   This legislation also will hold foster youth and the adults who care for them accountable for the type of responsible behavior any parent would expect and which will help them succeed in the long run. So for the first time, staying in high school through graduation will be a condition of receiving Federal foster care, relative guardian, or adoption payments. A similar new ``education, training, or work'' requirement will apply to young people over the age of 18 who receive continued Federal support. 
   As a letter endorsing this policy from the Foster Care Alumni Association of America put it, ``Holding young people and families in the foster care system to this high standard is a statement from Congress that lowered expectations are not acceptable for those of us from foster care.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert a copy of the Foster Care Alumni Association's letter endorsing this legislation in the Record at this point, and I thank this fine organization and so many others for their help in assembling this bill.

Lo and behold, I read that the Democrat leadership demanded that the Ways and Means Committee come up with a tax increase to pay for expansions beyond for food stamps and other programs.

Mitsubishi's North America plant is in my district. BASF, Pinkerton. And you know what is interesting is there are 235,000 jobs in Illinois, my State, that are generated by foreign-owned companies. And you know what? The Ways and Means Committee abdicated its responsibilities on this provision. No hearings were held. No markup was held. No one knows the consequences of this tax increase. That is why this rule needs to be voted down.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. And first let me thank my colleagues, JOHN LEWIS, PETER WELCH, for the opportunity to join in bipartisan sponsorship of this amendment. 
   This amendment prevents the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from cutting $24 billion in funding for our local hospitals, funding that's used to provide care to seniors disabled under Medicare. In my district alone this would mean a loss of $60 million in reimbursement for my local hospitals, having a devastating effect on the quality of care. 
   A key misstep in the proposed rule is the 2.4 percent so-called behavior offset payment cut. CMS proposed this cut to eliminate what the agency has inaccurately claimed will be the effect of greater use of coding as hospitals move to a new system. These extreme cuts in reimbursements, based on speculation rather than fact, will impose an added burden on all hospitals. 
   Earlier this year my friend and colleague JOHN LEWIS and I circulated a letter in opposition to these Draconian cuts. The response was overwhelming, with 269 Members of this House going on the record against this devastating cut to our local hospitals. This is overwhelming bipartisan opposition to this bad policy proposed by CMS. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will include this letter in the Record in support of this amendment. 
   The amendment also prohibits CMS from prospectively applying any behavioral offset in fiscal year 2008, ensuring that any adjustments made for coding changes will be based on the actual experiences of the hospital, not mere conjecture. 
   I ask my colleagues to join us in bipartisan support of this effort to prohibit the use of any funds to implement these Draconian provisions of the IPPS rule that will place hospitals under undue financial burden, compromising the quality of care our constituents deserve. 
   In order to prevent these local hospitals and protect our constituents, I ask my colleagues to vote in a bipartisan ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friends from Texas for this opportunity to speak during general debate. 
   I rise in support of the basic bill that is before us, H.R. 547. I voted for it last year when it passed the House unanimously, like all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and of course I stand in support of this legislation today. However, I believe we do need to make some minor improvements to the bill. 
   We have made a tremendous amount of progress. The energy bill of 2005 has caused hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment in biofuels production. In Illinois, in the State that I represent, we are anticipating up to 50 new ethanol and biodiesel plants, thanks to the energy bill. 
   When I talk to the local farmers that I represent in Illinois, they are pretty happy with $4 prices of corn. When the energy bill was passed into law, the price of corn was about $1.65 a bushel. So we are seeing the fact that rural America and small-town America, and rural Illinois and small-town Illinois were clearly the biggest winners in the energy bill. 
   But if you also care about energy independence, if you care about addressing the issue of climate change, we need to promote greater use of biofuels. 
   The basic bill makes progress when it comes to infrastructure, but we need to do more. You know, E-85, 85 percent blend ethanol fuels, offer part of that solution. As I drive or travel throughout the district I represent or my constituents travel throughout the district, many of them are looking to purchase E-85. They bought a flexible fuel vehicle; they want to contribute to our commitment for energy independence, they want to see investment in America rather than sending money overseas, so they want to buy E-85. And they question, why is it not available? Why do I have a hard time finding E-85 pumps at the gas stations that serve my community? And that is because there is a bureaucratic logjam in the certification process for the pumps, the infrastructure that is used for the installation of E-85. 
   I have an amendment which is germane to this bill that I am going to be offering. I believe it deserves bipartisanship support that I will be offering to this bill, this legislation to, of course, not only draw attention to this issue, but to help remove the logjam to the certification process. 
   We talk to some of the big distributors, some of the big operators, fuel stations across America; it is because of this issue that they have delayed or stalled installation of E-85. If you truly want to encourage the use of biofuels, if you believe that E-85 is part of that solution, if you believe that we need more installation of more infrastructure to distribute E-85 in America, then I ask that you support the amendment that I will be offering as we move through the processes of the bill. 
   Again, I support the basic bill. It is bipartisan legislation. I believe the amendment, which I worked on with the former Speaker of the House, Speaker Hastert, as well as a bipartisan group of Members, is a good amendment that deserves bipartisan support.

   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, let me begin my commending my friends, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, as well as my friend, Mr. Lampson, who is managing the bill this morning. 
   My amendment is pretty basic in what we are trying to achieve. I want to note that the former Speaker of the House, who, as you know, is recovering from surgery and is not able to be with us, is one I have worked with on this amendment. But this is an amendment that deals with infrastructure, as noted by those that are arguing for this bill which we all support. Our focus is infrastructure and research, affecting infrastructure of biofuels.  
   If we look back to when we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 through Congress, we included a renewable fuel standard of 7.5 billion gallons by the year 2010. Due to passage of this increase, which essentially doubled the amount of biofuels established under the renewable fuel standard, we have seen a tremendous amount of growth in investment in the biofuels industry in Illinois, my home State, as well as across America. 
   Currently, there are 110 ethanol plants in production, with 70 more under construction, producing today 5.2 billion gallons of ethanol as well as biodiesel. Our farmers are seeing $4 a bushel of corn, as well as $7 soybeans because of the increased demand for biofuels. 
   The President, as well, in seeing the need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, announced in his State of the Union a call for a renewable and alternative fuel standard of 35 billion gallons by 2017, 10 years from now. In order for the biofuels industry to move forward and achieve these aggressive goals, we need to make sure that an infrastructure exists that can deliver fuel to the consumers. 
   I am often asked by my constituents, why are there so few E-85 pumps as they travel. Unfortunately, issues have arisen with the E-85 certification by Underwriters Laboratories, which is an independent, not-for-profit, product safety certification organization that tests products and writes standards for safety. UL's worldwide family of companies and network for service providers include 66 laboratory testing and certification facilities serving customers in 104 countries. 
   UL began work to develop standards for E-85 fuel dispensers in early 2006 at the request for certification for such a dispenser from its primary manufacturer. It was reported in August 2006 that the manufacturer was to get UL approval for their E-85 pump. UL has looked at the application for quite a long period of time. Signals were given that the approval was imminent to the point where the manufacturer issued a press release. Yet in October of 2006, UL has suspended existing authorization on components for E-85 pumps, which they had previously approved over the years, and began and are continuing a stakeholder process to develop new standards for all components in the finished pump. 
   According to UL, there are no documented reports on any issues, field incidents, safety issues or documented reports related to E-85 components that have been authorized, or the pumps themselves. This process could take at least another year, possibly more, depending on numerous factors. 
   UL will not give a timeline for completion of the standards. It is possible once these standards are published, manufacturers of E-85 pumps will have to retool their operations to comply.     
   The impacts of certification issue are already being felt in my district as well as across this country. Even though UL is continuing to engage State and local governments and fire marshals with their findings, suspension of the installation of E-85 tanks has started to occur. 
   While States like Michigan and Minnesota are allowing continued use with special monitoring, States like Ohio have already prohibited all dispensing of E-85 blended fuels pending UL approval or listing. Big retailers, names we recognize, like Wal-Mart and Valero, which previously had announced their intention to install E-85 pumps nationwide, have suspended the installation of any new pumps pending this certification. This represents thousands of fueling stations across the country. 
   The bill before us requires the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy's research and development offices to carry out an R&D program of materials to be added to biofuels to make them more compatible with existing infrastructure. 
   The amendment I have offered today will require EPA and DOE and recognize the impact to research and recognize the impacts any further additives they recommend through the research program may have on issues with respect to certification by UL for fuel dispensers like E-85 and other biofuel blends like biodiesel. 
   In the United States there are 110 ethanol plants in production with 70 more under construction producing approximately 5.2 billion gallons. There are over 1,123 E-85 fueling stations around the country today, including on Federal property. 
   In my district alone, there are six ethanol and biodiesel plants, either announced or are moving forward or planned under construction, and 14 fueling stations offering E-85. Unfortunately, the process of bringing more has stalled. 
   We in this Congress have made a bipartisan commitment to an energy policy which encourages the development and use of E-85 and other blended biofuels. Exporting America's domestic agricultural resources to achieve energy security, energy independence, providing jobs for America is of utmost importance. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask bipartisan support for this legislation. E-85 and other blended biofuels are a key part of our strategy. I look forward to working with my colleague in a bipartisan way. Again I ask for bipartisan support for this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. 
   If you travel in Latin America and you ask someone in Latin America who is America's best friend, who is America's most reliable partner and ally, they would say President Uribe of the Republic of Colombia. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here today to stand in support of this amendment that thanks America's best friend, America's most reliable and partnered ally, particularly on the war on narcotics and counterterrorism, and to thank them for the successful rescue of three Americans. And it was done without a shot being fired, without loss of life. 
   It was an incredible operation, an operation based on good intelligence, on good work by the Colombian military and the resources that had been made available thanks to the work of many in this Congress. That's good news, and we want to say thank you to our friend and ally. 
   You know, there's a reason that President Uribe today enjoys an approval rating of almost 90 percent. He's the most popular elected official in the entire Western Hemisphere. And that's because he's made tremendous progress in dealing with the FARC and the ELN and the paramilitaries, those who have threatened the peace and security of that great nation for the last four decades. He has made tremendous progress. 
   And his record is successful. You look at it. Poverty has decreased by 10 percent. Today, 40 percent of the national budget is spent on social needs, as they made progress in bringing down violence. The murder rate has been reduced by 40 percent. In fact, for labor unionists, trade activists, trade union activists, it's down about 85 percent. Tremendous. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (CONGRATULATING ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 57, a resolution honoring and congratulating Illinois State University on its upcoming 150th-year anniversary. I introduced this resolution with my good friend and colleague, Congressman TIM JOHNSON, with the support of the Illinois delegation. 
   I am proud to note that the Illinois State University campus is located in the 11th Congressional District which I have the privilege of representing. 
   On February 15, Illinois State University will start a year-long celebration marking the day that the founder, Jesse W. Fell, took up the campaign of creating the first public institution of  higher education in Illinois and having it housed in the Bloomington-Normal area. 
   In February of 1857, then-Governor William Bissell signed a bill, legislation creating Normal University, and established the board of education for the State of Illinois as its governing body. After Jesse Fell secured financial backing totaling $141,000, future President Abraham Lincoln, then acting as attorney for the board, drew up the bond guaranteeing that Bloomington's citizens would fulfill their financial commitments. 
   Established originally as a teacher education institution, then known as Illinois State Normal University, it has developed into a multipurpose university, recognized around the world with degree programs in the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels. 
   Currently, approximately 20,000 undergraduates and post-graduate students attend the university, supported by an outstanding university staff of 3,200 employees. 
   I would also note that ISU today benefits from the support of over 65,000 alumni living and working around the world. 
   My colleagues today have shared much about Illinois State University, but here is a few little-known facts. The model for student teaching that today is used nationwide was invented by Illinois State Normal University teacher Cecilla Lauby, who today is 94 years old and still lives in the town of Normal. 
   One of every eight teachers in Illinois graduated from Illinois State University. Illinois State University's insurance program is so popular and respected that Lloyd's of London sends it executives each year for management training. And as others have noted, Illinois State University has made the Kiplinger list for the 100 top universities in public education three straight times. 
   Illinois State's physic's program is ranked as one of the top in the country. Illinois State's first president, Charles Hovey, recruited a regimen of teachers to fight in the Civil War. 
   Illinois State is also the home of the Gamma Phi Circus, the oldest collegiate circus in the United States, which was founded in 1929. That circus today is one of two collegiate circuses in the United States. 
   Finally, I would note that Watterson Towers dormitory on Illinois State University, is considered one of the tallest college dormitories in the world and is the tallest structure between the cities of Chicago and the City of St. Louis. 
   Illinois State University has been a model for higher education institutions around this country over the last 150 years. I would like to note a very good friend of mine, Illinois State University's current president, Dr. Al Bowman, and congratulate him, his great staff and all of those affiliated with Illinois State University as they mark this great achievement. 
   Illinois State University has been a model for higher education institutions around this Nation for the last 150 years. I wish them all the best in their year-long celebration. I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman MILLER, and Ranking Member McKeon for allowing this bill to make it to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in wishing Illinois State University congratulations as it marks its 150th anniversary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act. I want to commend the current leadership of the committee, the bipartisan leadership, Mr. Berman and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their leadership in moving this legislation to the floor in a bipartisan way. And it's most appropriate that it be named after Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, two distinguished chairmen of the International and Foreign Relations Committees that changed names, but one thing that was in common between Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde was they always worked to ensure that foreign policy should be a bipartisan product and a team effort. So, it is so appropriate that they be recognized by naming this legislation after them, which reauthorizes President Bush's emergency plans for AIDS relief. 
   As noted by a number of my colleagues, almost 33 million citizens of this planet today suffer from the consequences of HIV/AIDS. We have a moral responsibility, and it's important that the United States exhibit and demonstrate moral leadership in addressing this crisis, which not only is a health issue, but it's a security issue for this globe. 
   I think we all watched the reception of President Bush when he traveled recently to Africa and the appreciation that was shown by the leadership in Africa for the President's initiative and the bipartisan support that we've seen in the effort against AIDS, and to help those who are victims of AIDS in Africa. 
   We often think of Africa when we talk about global AIDS, but of the 33 million, there are also many living in Latin America and the Caribbean who suffer from HIV/AIDS as well. In Latin America today there are 1,600,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, that's up from 1.3 million in 2001; and 58,000 citizens of Latin America have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS. In the Caribbean, 230,000 adults and children are currently known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. That's up from 190,000 in 2001. In the Caribbean, 11,000 citizens of the Caribbean have lost their lives. 
   I note we've made some progress as a result of the President's initiative for AIDS relief. In Haiti alone, a large recipient of aid as a result of this initiative, almost 4 percent of the population of Haiti is infected with HIV/AIDS. Think about that, 190,000 people. And since 2004, thanks to this initiative, the number of people receiving care and support has grown from 30,000 to 125,000, and an anticipated 150,000 people will be reached this year because of this initiative. Haiti received almost $85 million from this program in the past year to address this crisis which affects many in the Caribbean. 
   The point is is that PEPFAR, as we know it, has allowed us to reach almost every person in Haiti struggling with HIV/AIDS. And, for example, the continued support is necessary to make sure we reach every person struggling with HIV/AIDS in the world, and that's why this extension is so important.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. I would also like to share a couple other examples of the success of this initiative and how this funding is helping regular people and making a difference in Latin America. 
   Bolivia, a large nation the size of Texas with 9 million people, thanks to the PEPFAR initiative we're using data to combat HIV/AIDS. In fact, real-time data is helping Bolivian health officials carry out more HIV/AIDS prevention education, including HIV counseling and testing services. And according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, prevalence rates in Bolivia's general population has remained at 1-10th of 1 percent, which is remarkable success compared to some of its neighbors. 
   In Central America, in the Republic of Honduras, beginning in February of 2005 the United States awarded its first set of grants through USAID to 10 local nongovernmental organizations working with 43 Honduran communities most impacted by HIV/AIDS.     
   In their first 7 months of implementation, the organization has reached over 27,000 at-risk individuals with behavioral change models. As part of the HIV prevention efforts, the group began offering HIV counseling and testing, and the counseling and testing programs were the first in Honduras to be offered by those trained in accordance working with the Ministry of Health standards as part of a larger national prevention effort. And this collaboration between the government of the Honduras, USAID, indigenous organizations and the Ministry of Health has set this standard expanding access to testing in the Nation of Honduras. 
   The bottom line is, this program is making a difference in combating what is clearly a terrible crisis throughout the world, currently impacting 33 million citizens of this planet. 
   We have a moral obligation, and it's important that the United States continue to exert the leadership and demonstrate the leadership we have over the last few years to address the global AIDS crisis. 
   I urge bipartisan support.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (WIN-WIN FOR U.S. AND COLOMBIA -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and I urge the Speaker of the House to bring this important measure before the House for an up-or-down vote, and submit for the Record two articles, one a column recently published in the New York Times by Edward Schumacher-Matos, a former foreign correspondent for the Times and a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard, as well as an editorial in this week's Washington Post in support of the trade agreement. 
   Killing a Trade Pact  
   President Bush has been urging Congress to approve a pending trade agreement with Colombia, an ally that recently almost went to war with Venezuela and Hugo Ch&#225;vez. Even though the agreement includes the labor and environmental conditions that Congress wanted, many Democrats, including Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, now say that Colombia must first punish whomever has been assassinating the members of the nation's trade unions before the agreement can pass. 
   An examination of the Democrats' claims, however, finds that their faith in the assertions of human-rights groups is more righteous than right. Union members have been assassinated, but the reported number is highly exaggerated. Even one murder for union organizing is atrocious, but isolated killings do not justify holding up the trade agreement. 
   All sides agree that trade-union murders in Colombia, like all violence, have declined drastically in recent years. The Colombian unions' own research center says killings dropped to 39 last year from a high of 275 in 1996. 
   Yet in a report being released next week, the research center says the killings remain ``systematic'' and should be treated by the courts as ``genocide'' designed to ``exterminate'' unionism in Colombia. Most human-rights groups cite the union numbers and conclude, as Human Rights Watch did this year, that ``Colombia has the highest rate of violence against trade unionists in the world.'' 
   Even if that is true, it was far safer to be in a union than to be an ordinary citizen in Colombia last year. The unions report that they have 1 million members. Thirty-nine killings in 2007 is a murder rate of 4 unionists per 100,000. There were 15,400 homicides in Colombia last year, not counting combat deaths, according to the national police. That is a murder rate of 34 citizens per 100,000. 
   Many in Congress, moreover, assume that ``assassinations'' means murders that are carried out for union activity. But the union research center says that in 79 percent of the cases going back to 1986, it has no suspect or motive. The government doesn't either. 
   When the Inter American Press Association several years ago investigated its list of murdered Colombian journalists, it found that more than 40 percent were killed for nonjournalistic reasons. The unions have never done a similar investigation. 
   There are, however, a growing number of convictions for union murders in Colombia. There were exactly zero convictions for them in the 1990s, Colombia's bloodiest decade, when right-wing paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas were at the height of their strength. Each assassinated the suspected supporters of the others across society, including in unions. 
   With help from the United States, in 2000 the Colombian military and the judicial system began to reassert themselves. Prosecuting cases referred by the unions themselves, the attorney general's office won its first conviction for the murder of a trade unionist in 2001. Last year, the office won nearly 40. 
   Of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001, almost all for murder, the ruling judges found that union activity was the motive in only 17. Even if you add the 16 cases in which motive was not established, the number doesn't reach half of the cases. The judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime, 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization. 
   The unions don't dispute the numbers. Instead, they say the prosecutors and the courts are wasting time and being anti-union by seeking to establish motive--a novel position in legal jurisprudence. 
   The two main guerrilla groups have an avowed strategy of infiltrating unions, which attracts violence. About a third of the identified murderers of union members are leftist guerrillas. Most of the rest are members of paramilitary groups--presumed to be behind two of the four trade unionist murders this month. The demobilization of most paramilitary groups, along with the prosecutions and government protection of union leaders, has contributed to the great drop in union murders. 
   President &#193;lvaro Uribe, who has thin skin, can be unwisely provocative when responding to complaints from unions and human rights groups. Still, the level of unionization in Colombia is roughly equal to that in the United States and slightly below the level in the rest of Latin America. The government registered more than 120 new unions in 2006, the last year for which numbers are available. The International Labor Organization says union legal rights in Colombia meet its highest standards. Union leaders have been cabinet members, a governor and the mayor of Bogot&#225;. 
   Delaying the approval of the trade agreement would be convenient for Democrats in Washington. American labor unions and human-rights groups have made common cause to oppose it this election year. The unions oppose the trade agreement for traditional protectionist reasons. Less understandable are the rights groups. 
   Human Rights Watch says that it has no position on trade but that it is using the withholding of approval to gain political leverage over the Colombian government. Perversely, they are harming Colombian workers in the process. The trade agreement would stimulate economic growth and help all Colombians.   
   Free Colombia--A Trade Pact Everyone Can Love 
   Sometime after Congress returns from Easter recess this week, President Bush is likely to present the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement for the approval of the House and Senate. As we have said, the proposed pact is good policy for both Colombia and the United States. Colombia has long enjoyed periodically renewable tariff-free access to the U.S. market; the agreement would make that permanent. In exchange, U.S. producers would, for the first time, get the same tariff-free deal when they export to Colombia. Meanwhile, the agreement contains labor and environmental protections much like those that Congress has already approved in a U.S.-Peru trade pact. A vote for the Colombia deal would show Latin America that a staunch U.S. ally will be rewarded for improving its human rights record and resisting the anti-American populism of Venezuela's Hugo Ch&#225;vez. 
   Sending the agreement to the House of Representatives without the prior approval of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would be risky for the president; usually, the executive and legislative branches tee up such votes cooperatively. But months of Democratic resistance to the Colombia deal may have left Mr. Bush no choice. The agreement is being held hostage by members of the House (and Senate) who argue that Colombia--despite a dramatic drop in its overall murder toll under the leadership of President &#193;lvaro Uribe--hasn't done enough to protect trade union activists or to punish past murders of labor leaders. Its a spurious complaint: Actually, in 2006, union members were slightly less likely than the average Colombian to be murdered. But the human rights issue has served as cover for many Democrats whose true objections are to free trade itself. 
   Once the agreement arrives on the Hill, Congress will have 90 legislative days to vote yes or no--no amendments and no filibusters  allowed, because special ``fast track'' rules apply. The Bush administration is betting that enough Democrats would support the pact to ensure its passage in the House, if it ever comes up for a vote. Of course, Ms. Pelosi could make an issue of the president's failure to get her approval to submit the pact and then could have her caucus shoot down the deal. But she could also engage the White House in serious negotiations. The president has signaled a willingness to consider reauthorizing aid for workers displaced by trade, legislation that is dear to the Democrats' labor constituency and that he has heretofore resisted. 
   Ms. Pelosi recently said that no Colombia deal could pass without trade adjustment assistance--without also mentioning the bogus trade unionists issue. Perhaps she is realizing that talking to Mr. Bush about swapping a Colombia vote for trade adjustment assistance might actually lead to a tangible accomplishment. At least we have to hope so. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. I urge the Speaker to schedule a vote soon on this important agreement. Why? It is good for Illinois. 
   I represent an export dependent district. I have 8,000 union workers who make construction equipment; and, because of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the 15 percent tariffs, taxes, the 15 percent on that construction equipment exported to Colombia are eliminated on day one. When you talk to agriculture, our farmers, those who raise corn and soybeans and livestock and specialty crops, they will tell you the U.S.-Colombia agreement is the best ever for agriculture. Clearly, States like Illinois win under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement. 
   I would note that, overall, 80 percent of U.S. exports currently taxed will see those taxes waived and eliminated immediately upon implementation of the U.S.-Colombia Agreement. And facts have shown, if we have a trade agreement with a nation, exports grow 50 percent faster. So, it is good for Illinois and good for America. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, who is Colombia? Let me tell you, Colombia is America's best friend in Latin America. It is the oldest democracy in Latin America. It is America's most reliable partner in counterterrorism and in counternarcotics in this entire hemisphere. And today, President Uribe, who was democratically elected overwhelmingly with a mandate to bring security to the country, has been successful in driving the leftist narcotic-trafficking terrorist group, the FARC, to the fringes of Colombia and brought security to his country. As a result, he is the most popular elected president anywhere in the hemisphere, with an 80 percent approval rating. 
   I would note that 71 percent of Colombians in a recent opinion poll say that they believe that Colombia is more secure because of President Uribe, and 73 percent of Colombians say that President Uribe respects human rights. Homicides are down 40 percent, kidnappings are down 76 percent. And I would note, the murder rate in Colombia today is lower than Washington, DC. It is safer to walk the streets of Colombia than it is our own Nation's capital. President Uribe has made tremendous progress in the last few years in reducing violence. 
   Now there are those who oppose the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement, and they say that President Uribe hasn't done enough. He hasn't done enough, particularly when it comes to violence against labor leaders. Let's look at the facts regarding President Uribe and the democratically-elected government of Colombia as it comes to violence against labor leaders as well as against other Colombian citizens. 
   President Uribe has increased by 75 percent in the last 2 years funding for the prosecution of those who commit violent acts. He has added over 2,100 new posts overall in the Prosecutor General's Office, adding 418 new prosecutors and 545 new investigators. He has made major changes. Colombia should be recognized and rewarded for the progress they have made. And, I would note that Carlos Rodriguez, president of the United Workers Confederation, has said about this effort: ``Never in the history of Colombia have we achieved something so important.'' 
   When it comes specifically to labor leaders and labor activists, almost $39 million was spent by the government of Colombia last year to provide body guards and protection for labor activists and labor leaders; 1,500 individuals, labor activists and labor leaders, participated and they are protected. And, I would note, that it has been successful. No labor leader has suffered a violent act or lost his life under this protection. Again, as the Washington Post noted this week, the murder rate for labor activists is actually lower than the national average. So he has made tremendous progress. 
   I would note, the International Labor Organization has removed Colombia from its labor watch list, even while Colombia has agreed to permanent ILO representation in Colombia. Most telling is 1,400 major labor union leaders have endorsed the Trade Agreement. The bottom line is, those who oppose this trade agreement always say they never do enough, but they never say what more can they do. Colombia deserves to be rewarded.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2366, the SBA Veterans' Programs Act of 2007. This legislation will assist our soldiers when then return home with opportunities and information about starting a small business. 
   More than a million and a half (1,502,125) men and women have answered the call to serve their country since 2001. They interrupted their careers, put their families economic security at risk, and face big personal challenges upon returning home. 
   I recently visited Iraq and Afghanistan. That trip gave me an even greater appreciation for the significant sacrifices our soldiers must make and must cope with for the rest of their lives. If our soldiers faced mortal danger every day abroad, let us help them have economic security when they return home. 
   It isn't just the veteran who makes the sacrifice, their families do as well: their parents, their spouses, their children, girlfriends and boyfriends and siblings. They give up so much in defense of our country. 
   It is our job, as Members of Congress, to make sure that our Nation lives up to its commitment to our veterans. It is a simple pact we have made with our troops--and one we are obligated to fulfill: after they have sacrificed to serve our country on the battlefield, we must do all we can to serve them here at home. The cost of any war must include caring for the warrior. 
   This legislation helps our veterans get started with business opportunities in their communities. It does so by providing grants, information services, and personal assistance to help veterans evaluate business opportunities; increasing the number of veteran business outreach centers around the country, and encouraging further assistance to women veterans. 
   Countless soldiers are returning from their tours of duty with new confidence and skills developed during their time in the military. This SBA program will help to ensure that those new abilities are put to good use when they return to civilian life. 
   This bill is the right thing to do for those who have given so much and it will directly impact Vermont and every State around the country. 97 percent of all Vermont firms are small businesses. My office has been involved in helping the Vermont Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) run business readiness classes for veterans. The Vermont SBDC is the primary small business assistance resource sought out by small business clients, lenders, government agencies and other economic development partners. The Vermont SBDC is the keystone in a statewide business assistance infrastructure tying together all appropriate resources and serving as a ``one-stop'' gateway and clearing house to serve small businesses' needs. Drawing on collaborative relationships among service providers, Vermont SBDC leverages economic development resources of all kinds for advancement of small businesses, growing the local economy. 
   Roughly 6 percent of deployed soldiers have small businesses depending on them. Veterans face a number of unique challenges, from increasing lengths and number of deployments overseas, to translating their military experience into business ventures. Yet, there is a lack of substantive programs to help these businesses survive through deployment, and to assist veterans returning home. This program is designed to meet current, real-time needs of people on active duty in business who now need to leave for protracted periods, or for those who have just come back and really ``need'' to do something new with their lives. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2366.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4. Clearly this legislation is a solution in search of a problem, an example of politics prevailing over good policy, and frankly one of my disappointments as a member of the Ways and Means Committee is it was a bill rushed to the floor without hearings and without action in the Ways and Means Committee. I believe that is a bipartisan concern for all of us today. 
   If you look at the record, the system set up in the Medicare Modernization Act used the power of competition, and it has been successful. Competition is working. Today, a senior's average monthly premium for their prescription drug plan is only $22 a month, down from $23 this past year. My own parents were expecting a $35 a month premium. Today they are enjoying that $22 a month premium and seeing real savings. I note that seniors across the board are seeing real savings. There are 23 drug plans in the district I represent that have a zero premium for low-income seniors. There are 34 drug plans in the district I represent with zero deductible. And on average, in the 11th Congressional District of Illinois, seniors are saving an average of $1,200 over their previous medicine expenses because of Medicare part D. It is working. At the same time, seniors have more choices. We have seen a 13 percent increase in the number of medications they have available, again because of Medicare part D. That is why 80 percent of seniors say they like Medicare part D. They like the plan they have. That is why so many are concerned about those who want to have the government interfere in the health of our seniors, who want to get the government into our medicine cabinets. 
   My Democrat friends claim that this legislation will repeat practices used by the Department of Veterans Affairs, but if you look at the record, not only is that approach harmful to Medicare beneficiaries, it has been harmful to our veterans. Every time Congress has enacted pharmaceutical price control legislation, the Veterans' Administration has experienced significant increases in its pharmaceutical costs. That is why groups like the Military Order of the Purple Heart and the American Legion have said H.R. 4 is not in the best interest of America's veterans and their families. That's right. Let's join our veterans' organization and vote ``no'' on H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELLER of Illinois. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. Why is Latin America all today watching this debate in this House? Because today the House of Representatives is going to tell the world how we treat our best friends, how we treat our best friend in Latin America. Who is our best friend in Latin America? The democracy of Colombia. Who is America's most reliable partner in counternarcotics and counterterrorism in Latin America? The democracy of Colombia. Which elected national leader is the most popular elected official in all of this hemisphere? The President of Colombia, President Uribe. Why? Because he succeeded in reducing violence. 
   Today, 73 percent of Colombians today say they feel more secure and more safe prior to President Uribe 6 years ago. In fact, Colombia today is safer than Washington, DC. 
   Today, this House will vote to set Colombia aside, and we will turn our back on our best friend in Latin America. Why again is Latin America watching? Because leftist Hugo Chavez and his proxies, the narcotrafficking FARC, had declared they want to defeat the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. They can't defeat President Uribe at the ballot box, but they want to in this Congress. 
   The Prime Minister of Canada said it best: If the United States turns its back on its friends in Colombia, this will set back our cause far more than any Latin American dictator could hope to achieve. 
   Our friends in the Democratic majority say this is all about election-year politics, but we must understand that turning our back on Colombia will have long-term consequences for Latin America.
