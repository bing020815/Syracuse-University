<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing this important subject up. It is indeed ironic that we are considering today a bridge safety bill and the very stimulus of the bill was a bridge that was approximately 40 years old, and now then we have this motion to recommit that directs attention to this bridge which is over 100 years old. 
   The Massachusetts Highway Department recognized five significant problems with this particular bridge, the one that is in question under this motion to recommit; first of all, that it was structurally deficient; secondly, that the narrow horizontal clearance of the draw span opening is only 98 feet; thirdly, that the location of the channel opening on its side rather than the center; and then fourth, the vertical clearance through the draw span is only 27 feet above the mean water level; and fifth, there are of course traffic congestion problems at the Route 6, 138 and 103 intersection in Somerset. 
   The provision that was put in to keep this bridge in place was placed in the bill in order to allow emergency traffic and pedestrian traffic. Now, the emergency traffic, the large vehicles, the fire trucks, have already been prohibited from going across this because it's unsafe, and though still we're going to  keep the bridge here, and we have to understand that with the prices of energy today, that this block has very little to do with the bridge itself but instead is to do with the fact that our energy policies have been hijacked by a small group of extremists who refuse, at any point, to have more energy brought into this country, either by our own resources or by external resources. And that is the end result of what is going on with this bridge. 
   So the motion to recommit simply says that the bridges that are unsafe as measured by a distinct standard that is available, would be actually torn down. The U.S. Coast Guard said that we need to tear the bridge down. The Massachusetts Highway Department said it's unsafe and would not like to use it. It's going to cost the taxpayers $1.5 million to keep it open. 
   Let's pass this motion to recommit. Let's do the right thing and get more energy into this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (UNNECESSARY DELAY IN PASSING VETERANS APPROPRIATIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the unnecessary delay in passing this year's veterans appropriations. 
   This year's veterans appropriations passed with an overwhelming majority in both Houses, 409-2 in this body and 92-1 in the Senate. This kind of bipartisanship makes it clear to all that Congress takes its obligation to our Nation's veterans very seriously. 
   I sincerely believe America's veterans want to see a final version of veterans funding quickly passed so they may receive the desperately needed funding. However, I feel this will not be the case. Last week, one Democratic aide, asked about this year's veterans appropriations, was quoted in Roll Call saying, ``These bills constitute the little bit of leverage we have.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the sacrifices that our young men and women are making in Iraq and Afghanistan are not leverage. The tragedies that occurred at Walter Reed are not leverage. Veterans health care is not political leverage. We must recognize that veterans funding is critical and should not be used for partisan politics. 
   I urge my colleagues to rise above the partisan bickering and pass this. Our veterans are demanding: Do not betray us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, just as a disclaimer to the chairman of the committee, I did vote against this bill in committee and am still talking against the bill. Mr. Chairman, that is always a shock to you, and I'm just trying to settle your nerves down here at the beginning of my comments. 
   I am supportive of the TRIA concept in general. I understand the market is not yet where it needs to be. As I explained in committee, our company was one of the companies who had to renew our insurance 30 days after 9/11. On October 11 every year we had to renew insurance. So we were some of the first to encounter the problem that some insurances simply weren't going to write insurance if we did not have some solutions. So I understood the concept. But we put into place some legislative changes that were slowly moving the marketplace to where it needed to be. 
   And the market was responding. The marketplace was increasing the deductible percentages. The trigger limit was raised between the first two versions of the TRIA bill, and the industry retention level was raised, the Federal co-share was lowered, and those were all positive signs because we all recognized that the last thing we want to do is have, say, an agency like the Postal Service in charge of risk insurance. It does not meet the standards for a very mobile market. 
   So in the long term, we would like to have the private sector handling this problem. It's where the responsibility then would fall on the people who are getting the benefit. 
   As it is written, this bill begins to move us far beyond that concept. It begins to increase the mission, providing what should have been a temporary solution making it into a 15-year solution and with decreasing amounts of private sector employment or utilization. So responsibility in the end should be borne by the people who are buying the insurance and the insurance companies. 
   And, again, I would speak against the bill, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. My amendment takes one critical step forward in writing insurer participation back into TRIA. 
   Five years ago, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, TRIA, was signed into law as a temporary program to facilitate transition to a viable market for private terrorism insurance. Since enacting TRIA in 2002, insurer deductibles have increased incrementally by at least 2.5 percent each year, from 7 percent in the first year to the current 20 percent level. 
   The bill before us today scales back insurance industry participation in the terrorism risk market and reduces the expectation that a private market will one day take over. H.R. 2761 would lower the 20 percent deductible to 5 percent, increasing by one-half percent each year for events above $1 billion. At that rate, it would take 30 years before the deductibles would reach today's level, where Treasury assures us the market is performing very well. 
   While I am supportive of TRIA as a concept and understand the market is not yet where it needs to be to take over terrorism insurance, I believe strongly that the responsibility for terrorism insurance needs to be on the insurers, not on the taxpayers. 
   My amendment will rewrite some of the insurance industry participation back into TRIA. I have proposed a modest increase in deductible each year of 1 percent, an increase of one-half percent from where the bill is today. It will ensure that deductibles are back up to the current 20 percent level at the end of the 15-year extension. 
   I believe my amendment is a step in the right direction towards encouraging a private terrorism insurance market, while providing the insurance industry with the environment for a stable transition. I hope that you will join me in supporting this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I find the comments very strange from the opponents of the amendment. They say that my amendment will stop rebuilding and let Osama bin Laden tell us where to rebuild. 
   Currently the rate of insurance deductible is at 20 percent. The rebuilding is going on quite well, frankly, and they have sustained 2.5 percent increases through the past 6 years. What we are simply saying is we are going to start at 5 percent and increase 1 percent a year over 15 years back up to the 20 percent level. Yet we are being told that regardless of what is being built now, something is going to change in the equation and the people are going to stop rebuilding if we go up and go to this one-half percent increase. 
   I find it heartening to know that we are within a half percent of stopping the entire economy of the U.S. on a one-half percent deductible and giving over our independence to the terrorists based on this one-half percent, when the truth is the last 6 years showed us that the industry will sustain 2.5 percent increases and continue to build exactly where they want to build, and in fact the industry will sustain on its own at least up to 20 percent. If we are estimating something above that, that would be unchartered territory. But I do find the arguments somewhat stunning. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, we heard a comparison today between December 7 and what we are passing today. December 7 began World War II in the Pacific, and if we read the history books, actually the war was lost by Japan and Germany because they ran out of oil. Japan was trying to keep us from interrupting their oil supplies and they ran out of oil. And we are absolutely disarming ourselves, taking away our own oil for the future here with this bill. I fail to see the connection that was being made earlier. 
   We have been told right now in this debate that we should consider what we are going to do about the problem before us. Now, the problem before us that I saw yesterday was that Dow Chemical began to ship its jobs overseas. Previously this summer they had announced $22 billion worth of investment in Saudi Arabia because the price of natural gas here is above $7, and it is below $1 there. They are simply choosing the economic choices that lie before them. 
   Mr. Speaker, when this bill first passed the House of Representatives, The Washington Post referred to it saying it would be legislation that is welcomed in Russia and Bolivia and other countries. The version before us today would still prompt the same comment, I am sure. 
   We should be working to expand our manufacturing. We should be working to encourage American energy companies to expand their operations by building U.S. jobs. But this bill, today's bill, hurts our domestic manufacturers by adding $21 billion in new taxes on Americans, but no new taxes on those other foreign oil companies. We are choosing foreign over domestic producers. 
   We should be working to help America's forest communities biomass plants. Instead, the majority's bill prohibits this. We are stopped dead in our tracks from taking biomass out of Federal lands, out of our national forests. The mandate is let them burn; we don't want to take biomass out of them. 
   We should be working to expand our domestic energy supply, but instead we are restricting future supplies of energy. 
   China has made its choices. They are building one new coal plant each week for the next 10 years. We are choosing to not have new energy. It is the wrong bill. I would recommend a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this misguided, misdirected legislation. After seeing this bill defeated just 2 weeks ago, I quite honestly am surprised that we are back for one more attempt at it. It is really heartwarming to find my colleague from West Virginia, the chairman of my committee, saying ``drill America now.'' 
   The only thing is I am wondering why the chairman did not allow us to have amendments that would allow us to drill now. If he would allow us the amendments that would stop the litigation that is stopping us from drilling now, maybe we could work through some of those 68 million acres, if he would allow us to have amendments  which would stop the regulatory process that is delaying unnecessarily and is of no benefit to the American consumer, maybe we could drill now. But I find the chairman's comments just hard to believe. 
   In the context of the discussion today, I would invite the chairman to sign on to a letter with me. The letter is from myself and several other Members asking just in one area, one area where we find bureaucratic delays, 7 years in Utah, the BLM has not issued the resource management plans that are required in order to develop just that. 
   If the chairman of the committee is intent on drill, drill, drill, as he says today, let him just put his one signature beside mine, and we will send it to Nancy Pelosi and send it to the President of the United States from Nancy Pelosi and us in the House and the Members of the Senate. 
   One place where we have some of that 68 million acres, 1 million of the 68 million acres, and let's just work one block at a time to figure out exactly what the roadblocks are because I believe, I believe in my heart that the majority does not want to drill today. 
   I believe that they understand that it is not the oil companies who lack the diligence, but it is instead roadblocks by people who have hijacked the energy policy of this country. 
   In my section of the debate we will talk about the reason the 68 million acres lie unused, and it will go from regulatory process to litigation. It will go into the problems of seismic that are being blocked up along the northern end of this country. We will talk about the delays one step at a time. 
   But let's talk just a little bit about the bill before us today. It is several sections. 
   The first section I want to talk about directs the sale of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, the NPR-A. Now that is curious that the Democrats on the floor of the House today do not want to open up ANWR, 2,000 acres. They have been concerned about the environmental degradation of the 2,000 acres of ANWR, and yet today they are saying that they are going to open up 23 million acres to environmental degradation. There is not one bit of infrastructure. There are no roads. There are no drilling pads. There are no pipelines. They are hundreds of miles away from where they need to be for the market. Yet with ANWR, with a 74-mile pipeline, it is sincerely believed that we could get production down to the continental United States within a year. 
   The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, 800 miles long, took 3 years to have it built and full of oil because this Congress, at that point in time, realized that they could make a difference and they did make a difference by saying that this pipeline is not going to be delayed by litigation. 
   If the gentleman from West Virginia says drill and drill now, then let him make the equal commitment that we will not allow our production to be delayed by litigation which is going to come from every sort of environmental group, either in the NPR-A or ANWR or the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   It is really difficult to believe that the majority is sincere when they say drill today, and on the other side of the spectrum we see all sorts of delaying mechanisms from people who contribute money to them. 
   I was interested in the last debate to find that oil companies contribute money to Republicans and therefore there is some scheme. When I look at the bill in front of us today, I see groups, I see an alliance with groups that contribute a lot of money to Democrats. I see over $670 million in the last several years from trial lawyers. There is new language in this bill which will be litigated probably for decades. 
   I see a section in this bill, section 5, that requires project labor agreements, and I see that the unions have given to the Democrats over $1 billion. 
   And then I find the continuing language which says that there are going to be protections in place that satisfy environmental groups; and again, environmental groups have invested over $1 billion in Democrat candidates. 
   So when I hear from the other side their observations about the special interests, I think we should look at the bill. Section 2 requires again the direction that any leases be environmentally responsible. That is new language. 
   Sections 3 and 4 deal with pipeline requirements that companies tell me that they have to currently comply with already, so it appears to be a duplication. 
   The project labor agreements are brand new. These are things where private companies are directed that they will, before they can work on any private project, have labor agreements in place. 
   Then we have a ban that is reinstated on exporting Alaskan oil. Keep in mind that it was Democrat President Bill Clinton that opened up the Alaskan oil to be exported. So again, we find now the flip-flop in that position on their part. The ban was originally in place, and President Clinton decided he would relieve that ban. And now we find it being put back in place. 
   The issuance of new leases, use it or lose it, frankly is already in place in law. There is language that currently states that if you do not use a lease, you lose it. 
   So either this bill is simply to try to convince the American people that we are doing something when we are actually not, or it is even worse than that. I believe that we have no purpose for this bill. I believe that this bill is not going to increase the amount of domestic energy one bit. I think that what it is going to do is to start anew, it is going to start new processes and are going to delay even by months the process in place for the NPR-A. 
   So while it is telling us we are going to drill now and drill in the NPR-A, actually it is doing the exact opposite. It is instituting new rules that will have to go through a completely new process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the debate.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, one of the issues that is not dealt with in the drill now bill, DRILL, someone said maybe that means Democrats Reinventing the Inconvenient Liberal Lies instead of drilling now, but we just have a process that takes a long time. This process is part of what creates the 68 million acres. 
   The 68 million acres of idle land are not idle at all. They are involved in this process. This process is not changed one bit by the bill in front of us. Again, if the bill had come through committee, if we would have had hearings, we could have made these points in committee. 
   It's rather inconvenient because we don't have the ability to amend the bill today. We do not have the ability to offer a substitute bill, no motion to recommit. So we are tasked with simply explaining why the bill should receive a ``no'' vote. 
   But the process today has not changed at all, and you cannot read every single element in this block, but you can just see, as we move the chart toward me, what the steps are that are required to drill any single well. Litigation can occur at many different points. Again, this bill does absolutely nothing to stop any of this regulatory process that exists today. 
   There is not really such a thing as a third-world country. There are only overregulated countries, and when we look at this chart, we see why America is moving towards the status of a third-world country, because we are overregulating to the extreme, and it is winding up with millions of idle acres. Our friends want to say take it away from those companies that are not using it. 
   Either it is because of bureaucratic process, external litigation, but there are very good reasons why acres are idle. I think that our friends on the other side of the aisle are simply avoiding the real question of why we are not drilling in this country, why we are preferring Hugo Chavez oil, why we are giving preferential treatment to oil from OPEC, rather than this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

That is 34,000 acres that, according to our friends, are idle. And yet, $2 billion has been spent. Another billion dollars has to be spent before that can be produced. 
   And what is going to happen with this bill is that people are going to say, I am afraid I might lose my lease. 12 years to produce one, not even 1 drop of oil on 34,000 acres, and people are going to stop buying leases. This bill is going to kill production, not assist production.

I would thank you for that reminder, and would point out that, in fact, what we are doing here today, we are saying that people have been laying on these leases, that they are letting them lie idle. 
   But it was actually the Democrats of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that passed, Democrats in the majority. And you notice that we have many of the gentlemen on the floor of the House today. Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Miller, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Rahall all voted yes in saying that we need, not just 5 years, but 10 years to produce these wells. And now we are having the finger pointed by the same people today, saying that it is irresponsible oil companies who are delaying too long. So the flip-flopping that we are seeing across the country right now is absolutely amazing. 
   We would love to hear the Democrats say that they want to drill and drill now. The only problem is that I have heard Democrats say that drill is a four-letter word. Well, either they can't spell or they can't count; I don't know which.

   Mr. PEARCE. The gentleman asks a question whose fault is it. Let's read down through a list of observations: Wilderness Society v. Wisely, 16 leases, 11,000 acres stopped; Montana Wilderness Alliance v. Fry, stops three leases, limits additional 9; Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Norton, injunction covering 93 percent of the resource area; Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership challenges total of 127 APDs, applications for permits to drill; Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Kempthorne stopped 60 wells; Potash Association stopped 72 wells; Biodiversity Conservation Alliance suspends leases; Wyoming Outdoor Council v. BLM, 11 parcels BLM stopped; National Audubon Society challenging the Resource Operational Division, and then we have Pennaco Energy v. U.S.; Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance; Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. 
   The reason that oil and gas exploration is stopped, the reason that we have 68 million acres is because of litigation and excess regulation, many of which do nothing, nothing to improve the environment. Most are bureaucratic delays. 
   I would suggest that the gentleman should--maybe if he thinks that he can produce oil more cheaply and more effectively than the people who are producing it, maybe he should be there and actually be drilling some wells and find out for himself the difficulty of producing.

It is lawsuits that are stopping much of the production, and yet the gentleman's bill does nothing. It does nothing to stop the lawsuits. 
   If we are serious about drilling and drilling now, then let's put something substantial in this bill, let's take it back to committee, let's amend it like we should have, let's put things that restrict the litigation that is stopping Americans from receiving the oil that they deserve and the lower price of gasoline.

I was surprised to hear our chairman of the committee say that because it takes billions of dollars to build these rigs out in the middle of the gulf, and to suggest that it is quite as simple as grabbing a Black and Decker and going and drilling with your hand, simply just, I think, intentionally understates the difficulty in providing low-cost gasoline for consumers in today's market.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert two documents that show a history of litigation in the NPR-A. If the gentleman from West Virginia is unaware of those, maybe that would help. 
   Litigation History: Oil and Gas Leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska 
   In 1980 Congress amended the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (Public Law 96-514), directing the Secretary of the Interior to carry out ``an expeditious program of competitive leasing of oil and gas'' in the 23 million acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Pursuant to this directive, BLM developed an expedited leasing program. 
   In 1983, BLM completed an environmental impact statement (EIS) and issued a record of decision (ROD) opening all but 1,416,000 acres of NPR-A to leasing. The ROD called for five annual lease sales of approximately two million acres each. Soon after the release of the ROD a lawsuit was filed by two Inupiat Eskimos in U.S. District Court for Alaska. The plaintiffs, together with amicus State of Alaska and North Slope Borough, sought a preliminary injunction blocking the lease sale. They contended that BLM failed to make certain subsistence-related determinations required by Section 810 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 16 U.S.C. &#167;3120. After a trial on the merits, the district court held in favor of BLM, finding that such determinations were not required. However the court issued an injunction precluding execution of the leases pending appeal of the matter to the Ninth Circuit. The district court's decision was affirmed on appeal in Kunakana v. Clark, 742 F.2d 1145 (9th Cir. 1984), thus allowing issuance of the leases. By 1998, all leases issued under the 1983 ROD had expired without a significant discovery. 
   In 1998, BLM completed an ElS and issued a ROD addressing the 4.6 million acre Northeast Planning Area of NPR-A. The ROD opened 87 percent of the area to leasing, excluding an area that included most of the submerged lands of Teshekpuk Lake and lands to the north and east of the lake. Several environmental groups filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Wilderness Soc'y v. Babbit, Civ. No. 98-2395), alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and seeking an injunction to preclude lease sales under the ROD. In an unreported decision, the court ruled in favor of BLM as to the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, thus allowing the lease sales to move forward. BLM held lease sales in 1999 and 2002, which resulted in the issuance of several leases near Teshekpuk Lake. However, the court has yet to issue a final decision on the merits, and the case remains pending without any action having been taken by the court for several years now. 
   After completing an EIS, in 2004 BLM issued a ROD addressing the Northwest Planning Area. The ROD opened all 8.8 million acres of the planning area to leasing, but deferred 1,570,000 acres near the village of Wainwright from leasing for ten years. Several environmental groups filed suit against the Department of the Interior in U.S. District Court in Alaska. The plaintiffs argued that BLM acted arbitrarily in violation of NEPA by authorizing leasing in the entire planning area without considering reasonable alternatives and without doing a site-specific analysis of each of the areas affected by the proposed action. The plaintiffs further argued that the biological opinion was arbitrary in violation of the Endangered Species Act, alleging that it was insufficiently thorough, not co-extensive with the ROD, and paid insufficient attention to the uneven distribution of eiders within the affected area. The district court ruled in favor of BLM on all counts, N. Alaska Envtl. Ctr. v. Norton, 361 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (D. AK 2005). The decision was upheld on appeal in its entirety in N. Alaska Envtl. Ctr. v. Kempthorne, 457 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2006). 
   Seeking to open additional areas of the Northeast Planning Area to oil and gas leasing pursuant to a 2002 recommendation contained in the President's National Energy Policy, BLM completed an amendment to the 1998 EIS in 2005 and issued an amended ROD in 2006. The amended ROD sought to open for leasing all lands in the planning area except the submerged lands underlying Teshekpuk Lake. In doing so, 389,000 acres that had been unavailable under the 1998 ROD would be available. Several environmental groups filed suit against the Department of the Interior in U.S. District Court in Alaska, alleging violations of NEPA and the Endangered Species Act. Holding in favor of the plaintiffs in part, in National Audubon Society v. Kempthorne, No. 1:05-cv-00008-JKS (Sep. 25, 2006), the court vacated the ROD. The court found that the amended EIS failed to adequately analyze cumulative impacts associated with the adjoining Northwest Planning Area, and that for similar reasons the biological opinion was inadequate as well. The Department chose not to appeal the adverse decision, but instead proceeded to correct the deficiencies noted by the court by supplementing the amended EIS and revising the biological opinion accordingly. BLM issued the final Supplemental EIS on May 23, 2008. Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, potential plaintiffs have 60 days from issuance of a final EIS to bring suit (i.e., until July 22, 2008)   
   Groups Sue To Protect Rare Loon in Alaska's Arctic Oil Reserve  
   Three conservation groups sued the federal government Wednesday hoping to block Arctic petroleum development through protections for a rare loon that breeds in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve.  
   The groups claim yellow-billed loons are threatened by industrialization in the 23 million-acre reserve that covers much of Alaska's western North Slope. 
   ``The yellow-billed loon is one of the rarest and most vulnerable birds in the United States,'' said Andrea Treece, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. ``If the loon is to survive in a warming Arctic, we need to protect its critical habitat, not open it up for oil development.'' 
   Inundation of the loons' freshwater breeding areas by rising sea levels tied to global warming is also considered a threat, but petroleum development is the petitioners' main concern. 
   The lawsuit names Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. According to the conservation groups, the agency is more than two years behind the legal deadline for taking action to protect the yellow-billed loons under provisions of the Endangered Species Act. 
   A spokesman for the agency said a decision on protections is coming. 
   ``We expect to have money available in the fiscal year '08 budget and then complete the status review and the 12-month finding,'' said Bruce Woods. 
   The Center for Biological Diversity, the National Resources Defense Council, Pacific Environment and other U.S. and Russian scientific and conservation organizations filed a petition in April 2004 to list yellow-billed loons as threatened or endangered. After a petition is filed, agencies have a 12-month deadline to issue a proposed rule listing a species or to decide listing is not warranted. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service only last May accepted the petition for review. The determination required the agency to solicit public comment, carry out a status review of the loons and, if merited, issue a proposed rule to protect loons. That has not happened and the lawsuit will seek an order from a federal judge telling the agency to do so. 
   The yellow-billed loon breeds in tundra wetlands in Alaska, Canada and Russia, and winters along the west coasts of Canada and the United States. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service estimates there are 16,500 yellow-billed loons in the world, including 3,700 to 4,900 that breed in Alaska. More than 75 percent of the Alaska breeders nest in the petroleum reserve and many nest in areas recently opened to oil and gas development near Teshekpuk Lake and along the Colville River, according to conservation groups. 
   Smaller numbers breed on the Seward Peninsula, the land mass east of the Bering Strait, and on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. 
   President Warren Harding created the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in 1923 as an emergency oil supply for the Navy. Current leasing plans come from a presidential directive guiding the Department of the Interior to foster oil and gas development there. 
   The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco by the Center for Biological Diversity, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pacific Environment.  
   So we now arrive at the point of conclusion of this debate. Protests are up 706 percent. That stops oil production. This bill does nothing against the protests. 
   Litigation is up in this one case. Eighty-six percent of the available acres are undrilled because of litigation. This bill does nothing about litigation. 
   In this particular case, 33 percent of this in Utah is out of production because of a combination of litigation and bureaucratic delays. This bill does nothing about that. 
   Finally, 1992, the Democrat majority extended the drilling from 5 to 10 years because they understood at that point what the Democrat Congress of today does not understand: that it does take time to prove up on leases, find if there is oil there, and produce them. The entire allegation that 68 million acres are completely idle is one that's intended, I think, to misconstrue the whole situation. 
   And finally, the entire underlying intent of the bill, the use-it-or-lose-it, is already a part of BLM regulations. So this bill does nothing except it duplicates what is already in place for many instances, and it threatens companies with the loss of valuable resources and will actually drive the price of gasoline up. 
   I would urge a ``no'' vote on the bill today and give the gentleman thanks for the debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chairman, today the Democratic Majority has brought to the House floor legislation chairman representing one of the greatest assaults ever on the American worker. Today the Majority in Congress will strip American workers the right to a secret ballot election when deciding whether or not to unionize. This freedom stealing legislation, complete with a misleading title, does nothing to enhance ``free choice''--rather it undermines workers' freedom of choice to vote by secret ballot. 
   Our country is a democratic society committed to preserving and protecting the rights of American citizens to vote for those who represent them. Secret ballot elections are conducted when electing our state legislators, our congressmen, our senators and our President. Secret ballots are used by Unions to elect their own leadership and pass resolutions changing their bylaws. Yet the Democratic Majority wants to strip that right away from Americans in their own place of work. 
   More accurately characterized as the ``Secret Ballot Elimination Act'', this legislation opens the door wide for union organizers to use intimidation, coercion and compulsory tactics on workers who hesitate to join their efforts. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing thousands our nation's law enforcement officers, has urged opposition to this legislation stating, ``The scheme proposed by the legislation would replace the current democratic process of secret ballots with a `card check' system that invites coercion and abuse.'' 
   It is clear that Big Union organizers said ``Jump'' and the Democratic Majority asked ``How high?'' as they crafted this legislation that panders to their Big Union bosses by allowing them to force workers to join their unions. 
   Today, Democrats are trying to justify their support of allowing union organizers to intimidate workers by debating the pros and cons of unionizing. Not only does this further the agenda of Big Union leaders, it avoids the true issue at hand--the basic right of American workers to vote by secret ballot when choosing whether or not to unionize. 
   Working families in New Mexico and America deserve to decide whether or not to join a union without the threat of coercion and intimidation. The denial of secret ballots is something you only expect in nation's like North Korea, Cuba or other Dictatorships where citizens and workers don't have the right to organize at all. The Democratic Majority is once again chipping away from the freedoms of our democracy and I stand in opposition to the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support this amendment that will restore a portion of the fundmg which is critical to maintaining our commitment to safety and security of our nuclear stewardship responsibilities. 
   I deeply regret that the Majority has decided to cut these programs and irrevocably harm our nuclear weapon programs and fail to maintain our nuclear stockpile. Our responsibility is to protect the American people and ensure that our weapons programs operate in a responsible and secure manner. 
   These important programs are our national deterrent against rogue nations who would threaten us with weapons of mass destruction. In addition, these cuts will erode our non-proliferation efforts worldwide, as our allies would have to consider expanding their own nuclear arsenals to make up for our reductions. 
   The cuts proposed today will cut nearly 40 percent of the funding for our Nuclear weapons programs operated at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I would ask the sponsors of these cuts if they believe that the threats from rogue states and aggressive dictators have reduced by 40 percent? If not, why are we cutting our ability to defend ourselves by 40 percent? These cuts will damage our ability to retain good scientists, preserve the knowledge base of our laboratory, and our preparedness to respond to our future nuclear needs. 
   In addition, these cuts decimate the nation's Stockpile Stewardship Program. Since we have stopped testing nuclear weapons, our country relies on Los Alamos to ensure that our strategic weapon capabilities are safe, reliable and secure. Failure do so abdicates our responsibility to the protect the American people. 
   These programs are critical to the mission of Los Alamos and critical to America. We shouldn't just simply fold up our tent and allow these programs to be deeply cut or nearly eliminated and I urge all my colleagues to stand up and support this amendment and furthermore support restoring the full funding to these important programs.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the continued politics being played with this year's veterans funding by the majority party. Last week, 44 Members of Congress sent a letter to the Speaker urging her to immediately bring a conference report on veterans funding before the House. Our goal was to pass this funding and avoid the political gamesmanship of the appropriation process. Earlier this year,  the House and Senate both passed veterans funding with overwhelming support. The fiscal year ends on Saturday. 
   Unfortunately, it has become clear that the top Democratic aides intend to hold our veterans hostage. A spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee called our letter and efforts to pass veterans funding immediately just ``a cute diversion.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing cute about withholding funding for veterans benefits. There is nothing cute about withholding funding for veterans health care. There is nothing cute about Democrats using veterans as political pawns in their appropriations strategy. 
   I urge my colleagues not to let veterans funding be held hostage any longer. Our veterans are saying, don't betray us. Pass the fiscal year 2008 appropriations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, we must utilize every resource available while fighting the Global War on Terror. Currently, we are fighting two major combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan which are critical to implementing democracy and peace throughout the Middle East. In both these areas we have a common enemy that continues to increase its forces. Recent reports have shown that Iran is supplying arms to both the terrorists in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
   Every night on the news we see the price we pay in a two front war against a sinister and studious enemy. It is difficult enough to fight an insurgency inspired by hatred, let alone an enemy supported by a sovereign nation such as Iran. 
   Reports of Iranian weapons and funds surfacing both in Iraq and Afghanistan are indicators that Iran is willing to use other countries to attack American interests without having to sacrifice their own sons and daughters. We are fighting a cowardly enemy which uses others to do its dirty work for them. This is state sponsored terrorism and we must take steps to cut off the resources they use to fund our enemies. 
   In addition, under the guise of energy development, Iran continues a program that puts them closer and closer to developing weapons grade plutonium. I have severe reservations allowing this program continue until Iranian President Ahmadinejad can unequivocally prove that he does not have intentions of someday creating and using a nuclear warhead against the United States, Israel, Europe or other Allies. 
   This legislation is crucial in the Global War on Terror because it is a tangible indicator to Iran, and all other nations which harbor or sponsor terrorist tactics in any form, that we will not allow the violence to escalate any further. By preventing the sale of F-14s in whole or part to Iran we will be cutting off the supply of arms that may someday be used to kill American soldiers.  
   I congratulate my colleague and Congressional neighbor from Arizona for her hard work and dedication to this issue. It is important for our safety as a country, as well as the world's freedom from terrorism, that we cut off the supply of F-14 parts to Iran. I call to my friends on both sides of the aisle for overwhelming bipartisan support of this legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for his work on this important bill; Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, Secretary Garcia, Governor Richardson, Congressman Udall, and Congresswoman Wilson for their lead in recognizing Jerry Murphy's life of service. 
   We have heard about his exploits. We have heard about the valor that he displayed under fire. Many of us too often believe that heroism can only be exhibited in those extreme circumstances. But I would say that it takes more courage to live a life of service that he chose to live after his heroic exploits where he was awarded the Nation's highest award for valor where he received the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the Korean Service Medal, the Bronze Stars. This was a true hero. Yet, he wasn't faced with multi-million dollar book signing deals, no movie contracts; just a quiet life serving other veterans who are often overlooked. 
   The Korean War is often referred to in New Mexico by veterans of that conflict as ``the Forgotten War,'' because so many of the veterans of that time have simply been overlooked. Yet, Jerry Murphy chose to live a life where he remembered each and every one of them. So, it is entirely appropriate today that we would name a facility in New Mexico for the guy who worked at the facility, always remembering those forgotten veterans. That is the kind of life that takes real valor and real heroism to live day after day after day. 
   For his quiet life of service, we are simply saying, Thank you for a job well done, Mr. Murphy. God bless you and keep you.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (LIFT THE RESTRICTION ON MEMBER TRAVEL ON PERSONAL AIRCRAFT -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the group today. I represent the southern district of New Mexico, New Mexico 2. I come with a chart today, and with a map of the district. 
   Now, if you can visualize, I live all the way on the east side of the State, Hobbs, New Mexico. We are about 3 miles from the Texas border and represent all of the way to Arizona. Now, it is almost a 9- to 9 1/2 -hour drive to come across to the Silver City area, and then if we have to go further north up into the Zuni area, it takes an additional 2 to 3 hours. 
   So each time I go home is a lot of miles. On a 3-day weekend, we have made up to 1,000 miles. On the 10-day breaks, we have been known to make up to 2,500 miles with events all of the way across. And then on our first 30-day break, our August break in my first year here, we had 29 different motel rooms and about 6,500 miles that we made to cover this large district. 
   Now, my particular approach today is to talk about a rule that the new majority put into place when we voted on January 4, 2007. I will read from those rules, House Resolution 6, section 207, rule 23, item 15(a). A Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner may not use personal funds, official funds or campaign funds for a flight on a nongovernment airplane that is not licensed by the FAA to operate for commission or hire. 
   Now, in the FAA there are basically two categories of operating for hire. There is the category of airlines. Those operate under section 121 of the FAA rules. The second section that is predominately used is section 135; that is, the charters. Those are the private aircraft that are used that you call, and  they are like a taxi. They show up so they are called air taxis or air charters. 
   Now, these are the only two categories who live in the West, in these broad, sprawling districts. We all represent about 6- to 800,000 people. That is determined by our districting process. So everybody represents the same number of people, but it requires a lot more ground for me to represent 600,000 people, so I have a small aircraft, a four-place aircraft, single engine, that I use to fly around the district. 
   Now, when it takes me 9 hours to drive across this district, I can make it in about 2 1/2 in that small aircraft. That is about the size of a Volkswagen. If I get in, the ceiling is just barely above my head. My knees are touching. And if people get in the rear seats, their knees are absolutely up against us. So this is not like some limousine service. 
   This is just basically a small aircraft with a 210 horsepower engine, very economical. I would use the same gallons of gas to fly across the district as I would to drive across it. But according to the rules that are adopted by the new majority, we cannot any longer use this. I cannot even pay for this out of my own pocket to serve the constituents of New Mexico. It is against the rules. I will be held in violation of House rules. And why they did it, I do not know. It affects as many people in their party as it does ours. 
   Now, given that backdrop, it is very interesting to see that the Speaker of the House now wants a 42-place aircraft to transport her. She was given the access to a Lear jet-type aircraft that the former Speaker used, 12 seats, 5 crew members, and those are very comfortable, plush seats. But now then she is wanting a 42-person aircraft with a crew of 16. 
   The cost of flying that aircraft is $22,000 per hour. The cost for her to round-trip back and forth to California is going to be an astounding $420,000. Now, we just voted for an omnibus where we took funds away from our military, and yet she is asking the military to not only take funds away from the troops, but also to fund this $420,000 trip, presumably every weekend, because all of us try to go home every weekend. 
   At the same time she has taken a constitutional provision for me to use my private property, to use my own funds, my own aircraft, and I cannot do that because she has made it against the rules. 
   Now, we were told when the Democratic majority took over that there was going to be a new way of doing business, and we are finding out what that way of doing business is today. We are finding the willingness to limit people from using personal assets, while on the other hand reaching for these extraordinarily large perks.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Research Remediation Act. Methamphetamines represent a tremendous growing threat to the fabric of our society. Last year, I held more than 40 town hall meetings across Southern New Mexico, listening to law enforcement, health officials, recovering addicts, and other experts. Time and time again I heard horror stories about whole families in my district destroyed by methamphetamines. It is our duty as members of the United States Congress to protect America from all enemies foreign and domestic. Mr. Speaker, methamphetamines are one the greatest domestic threats that our nation faces. We must confront its production, its trafficking, its abuse, and its effect on the land itself. 
   Meth is a problem concentrated in the West and Southwest, but be aware that this great evil is moving across America, and soon no one will be able to say it is not their problem. As meth spreads across our nation it leaves a trail of destroyed lives, families, homes, communities, property and public lands in its wake. H.R. 365 the Methamphetamine Research Remediation Act of 2007 will set needed standards for the clean-up of property and public lands destroyed by methamphetamines. Unlike other drugs, the cooking of methamphetamines is hazardous to everything that it touches and can render houses and property uninhabitable. H.R. 365 will address the environmental impact of methamphetamines, and how to recover our properties and lands.  
   In the Second District of New Mexico half-million dollar homes have been left uninhabitable, and state parks have become unusable. This destruction occurs because of methamphetamine cooking and the dumping of meth related chemicals. I fear that unsuspecting New Mexicans will encounter these environmental hazards and endanger their lives. H.R. 365 The Methamphetamines Research Remediation Act of 2007, will provide communities across America with the proper information and procedures on how to clean up meth labs and reclaim the land they have poisoned. 
   This bill is the first in many steps we should take to track and fight Meth in our communities. I have introduced H.R. 304, the CLEAN TOWN Act to help in our battle against meth. As we talk about this bill, I hope my colleagues will examine my legislation that has tremendous promise to help change the way we fight drugs and drug dealers. I urge all my colleagues to join me in fighting Meth and help us save America's families.

This important step is one of the best ways we have to stop terrorism. Sadly, last week, Americans who were simply trying to protect themselves in their country have now found themselves subject to a lawsuit for reporting suspicious activity. 
   In a lawsuit filed against US Airways, 60 moms removed from planes in Minneapolis have named ``John Does'' as defendants. These are simply people who were watching suspicious activities and called to report those suspicious activities, and now they are going to be terrorized in our court system in this country.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chairman, I sadly rise today to oppose this Important legislation. Unfortunately, in a kickback to Unions, the Majority has decided to include in this legislation provisions that will drive up the cost of state water projects and are particularly harmful to small rural communities. 
   As a New Mexican, I know the critical role water plays in economic expansion and the daily need of our citizens. We in New Mexico struggle to find good clean water for our communities. The reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program is an important step to meeting the needs of my communities. 
   Communities in my district like Columbus, New Mexico, a small community of 1700 people which has no clean running water in its community, is desperate for assistance from a  program like the one we will authorize today. Sadly, the majority has decided that this poor community should have foisted upon it Federal Davis-Bacon requirements which were never intended to be applied to non-Federal funds. Instead of helping communities get clean water projects the majority has decided to inflate the cost of these projects with unnecessary provisions that will result in fewer clean water projects, fewer jobs and less clean water. 
   I don't understand how the inclusion of these provisions that inflate costs will benefit the small rural communities who can barely afford clean water projects in the first place. Sadly, those provisions prevent me from supporting this otherwise good legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am here to support H.R. 902 introduced by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall). I have cosponsored legislation authorizing the Department of the Interior to study the potential use of extracted water from oil and gas production for irrigation and other purposes. 
   It will not surprise anyone in this Chamber that water is the most important resource in the West. Water is the lifeblood of the American West and the foundation of its economy. Yet it is also the scarcest resource in some of the fastest-growing areas of the country. But we can go beyond that and declare that water is the most strategic asset in the entire world. It may surprise some in this Chamber that the potential source of good-quality water lies just beneath the surface and is being wasted every day. 
   During the process of oil and gas development, approximately 924 billion gallons of water is extracted throughout the year, with most of that water being pumped back underground. Some significant share of that water is already being used for irrigation and livestock watering, but converting just 1 percent more of that total to additional beneficial use would yield over 75 billion gallons of more usable water for irrigation, ranching, fish and wildlife enhancement, stream augmentation or drinking water. The produced water that contains the lowest concentration of total dissolved solids, or TDS, less than 10,000 parts per million, is found in the western United States where water is a critical resource. 
   Often the largest hurdle to beneficial use of water produced from oil and gas production is finding the technology to accomplish water treatment in a cost-effective manner. Water treatment must compete with the lower-cost option of deep well injection. And while deep well injection is the most environmentally sound method of disposal, it forgoes the opportunity to use millions of gallons as a resource. 
   Beneficial use of this water in these arid environments will be a win-win situation for the energy industry, water consumers, and oil and gas consumers. This legislation will facilitate the potential use of this abundant water for irrigation uses and other beneficial purposes. It could potentially help us find new water from what is now a virtually untapped water resource. 
   I thank the gentleman from Colorado for introducing this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, many times people have asked exactly how does this work on the ground. For instance, in my home county of Lea County, New Mexico, we have the Ogallala Aquifer. We are right at the very edge of it. And in the 50 years we have been pumping out of the aquifer, we have used about 50 percent of the water that is available to us. There is no surface water available, only that aquifer water is available. We have used 50 percent of it, and it would take 1,900 years to recharge what has been used, and so we understand that we are on the downward slide for having water available to us. 
   In Lea County, New Mexico, we produce over 150,000 barrels of water yearly, and that water is reinjected. If that water were available to be cleaned up, that water would be available for development, industry and jobs. It is a very important thing. 
   The county right next is Eddy County. Water is produced there that is fresher than water in the Pecos River, and yet law and regulation requires the disposal of that water back down into salt zones. Everyone in the West understands that at some point we are going to go back and repump that water to the surface, this time for use as water. Right now it is free at the surface. It is a by-product of the oil and gas exploration, and yet we are required to put that water back down into wells, into the salt zones, where it is going to be very much harder to clean up the next time we use it. 
   So this bill represents a great opportunity for us to take a step forward to benefit the industry in the West, to benefit the residents of the West, and to help lower the cost of production of oil and gas. It seems to be a win-win situation every way that we look at it. 
   I compliment the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Colorado for introducing this legislation.  
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 902, the ``More Water and More Energy Act, and to express my thanks to Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee for making it possible for the House to consider it today. 
   The bill's purpose is to facilitate the use of water produced in connection with development of energy resources for irrigation and other uses in ways that will not adversely affect water quality or the environment. 
   It is similar to a bill I introduced in the 109th Congress that passed the House last year but on which the Senate did not complete legislative action. It is cosponsored by Representative PEARCE of New Mexico, who is the ranking Republican member on the Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources and also by Representative EDWARDS of Texas. I greatly appreciate their support. 
   I think the bill may help change an energy-industry problem into an opportunity, not just for oil and gas producers but for everyone else who would benefit from increased supplies of useable water. 
   Especially in the arid west, that covers everyone--not least our hard-pressed ranchers and farmers. 
   The focus of the bill is the underground water extracted in connection with development of energy sources like oil, natural gas or coalbed methane. It would do two things: 
   First, it would direct the Bureau of Reclamation and the USGS to identify the obstacles to greater use of produced water and the how those obstacles could be reduced or eliminated without adversely affecting water quality or the environment. 
   Second, it would provide for Federal help in building 3 pilot plants to demonstrate ways to treat produced water to make it suitable for irrigation or other uses, again without adversely affecting water quality or the environment. 
   At least one of these pilot plants would be in Colorado, Utah, or Wyoming. At least one would be in New Mexico, Arizona or Nevada. And there would be at least one each in California and Texas. This is to assure that, together, the plants would demonstrate techniques applicable to a variety of geologic and other conditions. 
   Under the bill, the federal government could pay up to half the cost of building each plant, but no more than $1 million for any one plant. No federal funds could be used for operating the plants. 
   The bill's goal is reflected in its title--the ``More Water and More Energy Act of 2006.'' 
   The extent of its potential benefits was shown by the testimony of Mr. David Templet at a hearing on the similar bill of mine the House considered last year. 
   Mr. Templet testified in support of that bill on behalf of the Domestic Petroleum Council and several other groups, including the Colorado Oil & Gas Association. He noted that produced water is the most abundant byproduct associated with the production of oil and gas, with about 18 billion barrels being generated by onshore wells in 1995. 
   And he pointed out that if only an additional 1 percent of that total could be put to beneficial use, the result would be to make over 75 billion gallons annually available for use for irrigation or other agriculture, municipal purposes, or to benefit fish and wildlife. 
   Now, remember that in the west we usually measure water by the acre-foot--the amount that would cover an acre to the depth of one foot--and an acre-foot is about 32,8560 gallons, so an additional 75 billion gallons is more than 230,000 acre feet--more water, indeed. 
   And at the same time making produced water available for surface uses, instead of just reinjecting it into the subsurface, can help increase the production of oil and gas. 
   At last year's hearing, this was illustrated by the testimony of Dr. David Stewart, a registered professional engineer from Colorado. He cited the example of an oil field in California from which an estimated additional 150 million barrels of oil could be recovered if water were removed from the subsurface reservoir. And he pointed out that where oil recovery is thermally enhanced, a reduced amount of underground water means less steam--and so less cost--is needed to recover the oil. 
   The potential for having both more water and more energy is also illustrated by the example of a project near Wellington, Colorado, that treats produced water as a new water resource. I had the opportunity to visit it just last week, and found it very interesting. 
   An oil company is embarking on the project to increase oil production while a separate company will purchase the produced water to supplement existing supplies, eventually allowing the town of Wellington and other water users in the area to have increased water for drinking and other purposes. 
   In view of its potential for leading to both ``more water'' and ``more energy'' I was pleased but not surprised that last year the Administration, through the Interior Department, testified that it ``agrees that the goals of the bill are commendable and the needs that could be addressed are real'' and that the roles the bill would assign to the Bureau of Reclamation and the USGS are consistent with the missions and expertise of those agencies. 
   In view of all this, Madam Speaker, I submit that this bill--and its promise of helping provide our country with both more water and more energy--deserves the support of the House, and I urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (THE REST OF THE STORY WITH REGARD TO THE DEMOCRATS' 100 HOURS -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I would thank the gentleman from Iowa, and consider his comments to the fullest. 
   I would congratulate my friends across the aisle for their attempts at activity in the first 100 hours. The truth is that, like my friend from Iowa, I am in business. My wife and I had a small business that we bought in, and we had four employees; 14 years later we had 50 employees. We sold that business when we came here. But I understand the creation of jobs and I understand the impact of taxes, the impact of what we do here in Washington. And I like the idea that we would move to bold action. I like the idea that we would compel these United States to be different and new and think differently. But I will tell you, there are some things that in the last 2 weeks have concerned me greatly. 
   Several years ago I had the opportunity to visit Egypt. When I was in Egypt, I noticed that almost every building had rebar and unconstructed pieces on top. So I mentioned to a friend of mine who was in the embassy that, why are all the buildings unfinished here? His comment was that they do not tax the buildings until they are complete, and so no one ever finishes their house, their home, the building they live in. The top floor is always under construction. And if they get that floor finished, they continue on and put rebar out onto a new addition that may never actually take place. 
   The truth is, that is a great example of one of the fundamentals of economics: The things that we tax more of, we have fewer. We tax complete houses, so in Egypt we have fewer full, complete houses. That same principle works here. 
   Now, yesterday on the floor of the House we heard much language that certainly appeals to many people in this Nation, that we are going to get back at those big greedy oil companies, that we are going to tax the people who have taken advantage of the American consumer. I would just point to the photograph on my right, this is what we are taxing. If the principle holds that we have fewer of what we tax, then we would understand that there are going to be fewer of these monstrous oil rigs. This is about a $1 billion to $1.5 billion project that sits out either in the Gulf of Mexico or off of the California coast and they produce tremendous amounts of oil. 
   I am from an oil producing State, New Mexico, but our oil wells are single wells coming up out of the ground. This one may have 20 or 30 wells that diverge out once it gets under the ocean. Our single wells may produce 50 barrels a day, and that would be a good well in New Mexico. These billion dollar investments might produce thousands or tens of thousands of barrels of oil per day. So like my friend from Iowa said, they contribute greatly to lowering the price of oil and, therefore, lowering the price of gasoline. 
   Now, in our friends' enthusiasm across the aisle to raise the taxes on those oil companies that have produced so much, what they are actually going to do is raise the taxes on these facilities so that we produce fewer of these and fewer gallons and barrels of oil and gallons of gasoline, which means simply that the price is going to go up at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to stop a program that has been a failure. Let the record be clear. After more than 10 years of failed attempts to reintroduce Mexican wolves, it is now time to call an end to this program. 
   I am speaking of the Mexican Wolf Recovery Program operated by the Fish and Wildlife Service in New Mexico and Arizona. Since the 1998 release of these captive bred wolves into the Blue Range Wolf Recovery area, this program has attempted to restore a population of wolves into the area, all while providing no compensation to ranchers for their livestock losses and all in the face of nearly unified local public opinion against the program. 
   Promises were made that the wolves would be restricted to the wilderness area of the Gila Mountains, but instead we have seen wolves as far away as Tularosa, New Mexico, almost 200 miles away. 
   To date this program has spent nearly $14 million and as of today has only 58 wolves in the wild; $14 million, 10 years, and 58 wolves in the wild.     
   Of these 58 wolves in the wild, we now are on a pace to remove 12 this year because they're problems. 
   Chart number 1 that I brought up today highlights the increasing rate of removal of the wolves from the wild because they're killing too much livestock and they're endangering people and pets in the district that I represent. 
   In 2005, the Service removed four problem wolves. In 2006, it removed eight. In 2007, we're on a pace to remove 12 wolves, 12 out of 58. If the Service has to remove 12 wolves this year, 20 percent of the wolves in the recovery area, how can anyone classify as a success a program where this many of the wolves are being a danger to ranchers and livestock? 
   I would add that the wolves that are released into New Mexico are the wolves that have killed too many animals over in Arizona. So New Mexico gets the benefit of having the most dangerous wolves released into the Second District. 
   Secondly, I would like to go to a chart that shows the horse, Six. In this shot, on the left side, Stacy Miller, 8 years old, is riding her horse, Six. This picture was taken 2 weeks before this picture. This picture on the right indicates her horse, Six, after the wolves finished with it. You see the ribs have been stripped completely clean. The hide is laying out here. That's 2 weeks after the picture was made. This is in the Second District of New Mexico. 
   And for those of you who want the feel-good feeling of releasing the wolves into the wild, let us release them into your daggone area instead of the area of southern New Mexico, where they represent a danger to the people of the Second District. If you aren't willing to take them into your district, then why are you going to spend money to put them in our district and endanger our people? 
   I would like to draw your attention to another tremendous concern, the Durango pack, particularly the female, AF924, which we speak about, is stalking the home of a young woman named Micha. Micha Miller, not the same, is pictured here. Micha Miller is about 100 yards from her front door pointing to a wolf print that is there in the dirt. What is startling about this picture is the gun which Micha is wearing while she goes about her chores. The Durango pack of wolves have been in and around Micha's house for so long that her parents insist that she carry this gun with her while she does her chores, works or plays in the yard. 
   I am submitting for the Record a letter from Micha asking Congress to end  this program that has put wolves in her front yard.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, the following material are letters I have received from my constituents and other concerned citizens of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona regarding the reintroduction of the Mexican Wolf. 
   Since the reintroduction of the Mexican Wolf in 1998, the residents of my Congressional District have been plagued by problems associated with the release. Not only do ranchers suffer economic hardship due to wolves preying on their livestock, but countless family pets have been lost including dogs and horses. As the wolves become less afraid of man every year, I fear they will eventually prey upon humans. 
   To date, the program has yielded 58 wolves, 20 percent of which will be removed as problem animals, at a $14 million cost to the taxpayers. That is $242,000 spent per wolf.  
   These are some of our wolf experiences in the past 7.5 years. I don't think we have had a decent nights sleep since this program began. 
   2003--Wolf notes Monday May 19 to Tuesday May 28. 
   Tuesday, May 20, 2003 12:42 p.m. Subject: wolves are back 
   No sooner that I griped to the Game Commission's about the release of our old friend from the Campbell Blue pack, F 592 into the wilderness again that she shows up here again. John Oakleaf called last May 19 about 9 p.m. with the happy news that they were with our cows and calves. 
   We were missing 2 calves since Friday and wolf tracks are everywhere but everything was OK when I checked this morning and this afternoon nothing but tracks. Life gets just a whole lot more complicated with them around. How many times can you say I told you so to the FWS, they can't stop believing that releasing heavily pregnant wolves into the Wilderness will keep them there, it doesn't and it hasn't and it never will. Changing the name just buffalo's the public into thinking there are new wolves out there. The new name for F 592 and her new mate was the Sycamore pack. The only good news is she should have had her puppies last week or maybe two weeks ago and she probably killed them if she traveled this far. 
   Ivy, my 14 year old daughter rode her paint mare up to the top of the hill by the house this morning like she always does and met up with both wolves. She said they wouldn't leave her alone and squared off with her at about 30 feet away. She didn't want to turn her back on them so she shot and reloaded and shot her single shot 22 off in the air a couple times and they finally scuttled down the hill into Turkey Run in front of her. 
   She was pretty excited and not a little scared when she came in. I on the other hand am livid and a lot scared. My kids shouldn't have to be held up by a pair of wolves on a ride 1/4 mile from the house. LAURA. 
   Wednesday, May 21, 2003 1:17 p.m. Subject: wolf update Rafter Spear 5-20&21 
   We caught them on the cows and calves last evening May 20, 2003 around 7 p.m. and they had them bunched up trying to get a calf out the calves were either crying or sucking, we were just in time. We ran them off all of 50 feet and started driving the cows down the canyon on foot. 
   I left Matt with the cows and the 30-30 and went up the other canyon to check the other cows. On the way, I met Dan the wolf guy and told him to hurry up, the wolves were following Matt and he might just have to shoot one since they are following him so close. I stopped at the house to get a blanket for Miles since it was getting cold and he was asleep in the jeep, thank goodness. I also told the girls to saddle up and go help dad move those cows. Which they did. 
   Over the ridge I found a bagged up cow with wolf tracks nearby and all the other cows were far enough up the other canyon and still all right with no sign of wolf activity around them. I went on to 74 and check the other cattle thankfully the wolves hadn't been there yet. 
   By the time I got back to the turnoff to the house, where Matt and the girls left the cows, Matt was way off ahead on the road home and Dan was parked in the flat near the turnoff to our house with our cows. I picked up Matt and he said to go back and let him talk to Dan. He didn't apologize for yelling at him earlier but let it be known he didn't totally blame Dan for the situation. Dan said he was going to stay in the cows all night and we told him to come to the house and eat first. He said OK. 
   He called an hour later {satellite phone} and said the wolves were in the calves again and he wasn't coming in to eat. By then it was 10 p.m. so I made him supper and coffee and we took it out to him. He said they were all over the cows and calves and howling at him because they were frustrated and he was firing rubber bullets at them. He only had enough light to set one trap though. Since he was OK we went home to sleep because after learning they were in the cattle the night before we pretty much stayed awake all night. 
   Woke up at 4 a.m. finally got up at 4:30 and Dan showed up at 5:15 with some good news, he caught the male about 20 minutes before in the single trap he had managed to set the evening before. Apparently Dan has been improving as a trapper since our Dec. 99 experience with Campbell Blue pack which included F 592. 
   Melissa, Ted Turners wolf biologist, was 3 hours away with a cage so we called our neighbor Jack Diamond and he sent his wife Kaye over with a kennel to put the trapped wolf in. 
   We went back out and the female was still there with the male but not very close, it was breaking daylight by then. Dan gave the wolf a light sedative type drug so he would relax and not hurt himself in the trap. Matt went to check the cows in 74 where I had gone that night and I waited with Dan in case Kaye got there and Dan needed help loading the wolf. She did and Matt and Dan loaded him into the kennel right about the time Melissa showed up, so we sent that wolf home to Sevilletta. I made Dan keep Melissa's kennel in case 592 was caught. 
   The female 592 ran off but I am sure she stayed somewhere nearby, Dan looked around for her and then tried to sleep a few hours during the day they aren't very active, thank goodness. The wolves had run him from calf to calf and canyon to canyon last night and he didn't get much rest I am just grateful it wasn't me but I may get a turn tonight. These livestock killers and problem wolves should not be turned out at all. 592 is the major stock killer of the pair and they were determined to get a calf. Dan didn't let them and they actually howled at him about it. But they did manage to bite at least two calves before he could hit them with rubber bullets which seemed to have little effect. 
   We are missing two calves one since about last Friday and one since Monday but haven't found any wolf poop yet to see what is up with that. Probably won't be confirmed though. One was about a week old and one was born Saturday to a cow that has never lost a calf, Matt saw it Sunday evening and it was fine then. 
   Mad as we are about all this at least we had competent help and we are grateful for that. Why the hell they are re-releasing stock killers is beyond me. It is plain dumb and only makes the program look bad. 
   Laura. Update: wolves at the rafter spear 5-21-5-23  
   The last few days the wolf story has slowed down a lot but the aftermath is still ongoing. After trapping the male, the female took off and is about 6 miles to the SW at last flight on Thursday. There are traps everywhere in preparation for her return. I understand they are trapping for her because of the incident with Ivy not the calf killing. I don't care why but glad to hear there is a limit to how badly they can accost our kids. Nick Smith and Dan Stark also have a permit to shoot her if they have to. 
   My problem is, this animal has a history here and has absolutely no fear it has menaced my daughter and followed my husband, who is not menaceable, or at least he thought he wasn't until he was followed by wolves he was not allowed to shoot. Together they killed and ate two calves before we knew they were here and two bitten calves, they are swelled up and crippled we have shaved measured and taken pictures. 
   One has more bites, on the flanks, side and head but they are superficial, the calf is in quite a bit of distress from bruising but hopefully will be fine. I imagine the times when Dan heard the cows get up and shined the spotlight on them and saw the wolf, he stopped the attacks. The next day there was a calf with a swollen front knee in the same bunch, after shaving we found wolf bites on the front and back legs. The knee is hot and three times bigger than the other, the wound on it is superficial but the trauma caused the swelling is severe and this calf may be ruined. Both calves were in the bunch Dan guarded Tuesday night. If he hadn't been there would probably be 4 missing calves and four tight bagged cows. I am glad he got to experience the mayhem one pair of wolves can attempt to wreck in just 12 hours. 
   On a side note there is another injury from a calf caught in a trap this morning, nobody is to blame for that, We are grateful to have the traps out, but still, another injury. 
   There was a small bunch of 11 cows and calves that were harassed by the pair, not including the two that lost the calves. 
   It has been some week. I have a dramatic picture for every day of the week. Yesterday the FS backburned from behind my house and it was pretty scary kind of like a volcano going off on your back door. The results  should be good though. We had good representation from our government yesterday though. FWS, FS RITF and APHIS all on the porch at once. If we can find a piece of the space shuttle maybe NASA will come pay us a visit. 
   It is hard to know where to begin since our emotions have run the gamut the past few days. Traps were set Tuesday after the male was caught and the female left for several days, she ended up on the Diamond Bar where Nick Smith tracked her for several days. He found one bitten calf probably from the trip over here a week prior. The calf was a month or two old so that is probably why they were still shy about killing it and staying there. 
   The weekend was pretty good though, I went to town, 74 miles away on Saturday and bought groceries so the guys could be fed halfway decently while they worked and believe me they worked. Matt took Miles, he is 5 and clipped cages below the house and Dan checked his traps and made a 20 mile circle hiking into diamond creek on foot trying to get a signal. He was unsuccessful but Nick Smith found her signal later that night west of the Links camp on the Diamond Bar. On Sunday, Matt and Dan rode into Round Mountain and packed salt. That afternoon everyone rested a bit between checking traps and gardening, painting, watching Kristie and her boyfriend and various other normal pursuits. 
   She was back here Monday morning. Dan woke up checked his equipment, got a signal and took off. When I checked cows that day I got a signal that seemed pretty strong right in the cows up 74 draw and Dan's truck was nearby. She pretty much stayed there all day with Dan tracking her along with Nick Smith who came in to help him. Dan came in that evening to make some phone calls and get something to eat. While he was on the phone, Matt and I went out and looked after the cows, one of us on either end of the bunch. She was there the whole time but we didn't have a directional antenna and felt our job was to look after the cows not the wolf. 
   Monday night and Tuesday, yesterday. Dan was up all night with her, most of the cattle were west about a mile he felt OK about leaving her alone until light, really there wasn't much choice since she didn't seem to be doing anything but hanging out in that area and it was pretty thick. Near morning he could hear coyotes making a heck of a ruckus in the draw she was up and thought that it was weird since he has been taught all his life that such wolf/coyote fraternizing behavior was abnormal. 
   He hadn't remembered or taken us seriously when we had told him the coyotes saved her life in the winter of 1999/2000 when she was here last. She had nearly starved to death until she started hanging around with the coyotes. Kristie who was 15 at the time had ridden up on her and the wolf followed her part way back to the house. Kristie was really mad because she could see the wolf was half dead from hunger and going bald. It was so cold that winter she would cry on the mountain behind the house and we would hear her at night. She was there for 5 months until she moved to the neighbors on Canyon Creek and killed her first calf. Later that summer she moved to the Adobe which is north of us met with her old mate and really went to killing cattle. Those coyotes saved her life though and she was used to being around them. 
   Anyway, Dan hiked into the draw to see what was up as soon as there was enough light and a cow with a full bag of milk met him on his way in. The bad news is 592 was on a cow that had calved a day or two before and she had killed the calf. The coyotes had found her and were trying to steal the carcass from her. He ran both the wolf and the coyotes, off the calf, found two pieces and packed them to the truck and brought them in to the house put them in the barn and called Wildlife Services. As Dan has found out, sometimes there is just nothing you can do about the killing even when you are watching just as close as you can and not sleeping or eating to do it. The wolf has every advantage even if you do have the technology. We were very lucky he found any remains of this calf. 
   The calf was killed by the wolf, Wildlife Services verified it the hemorrhaging was way too bad to be coyote and the bite marks measured out. At least the few that weren't eaten away. The calf was in two pieces it was a new heifer and had walked on it's feet quite a bit before it was killed. The cow was one we were concerned about because she had taken off to have the calf as they all do. Apparently she didn't hide well enough to fool the wolf. But as Dan can attest to, she was hidden from all human eyes pretty darned well. 
   I had to go to Winston and get gas, so I took Dan and Nick some Orange juice that afternoon, Dan looked like crap and they were still tracking her. Dan was waiting for Nick to radio him and was trying to catch a catnap under the truck when I pulled up, so much for that nap. Johnny Anglin with Wildlife Services arrived the same time I did. We left them to their business about 30 min later. On my way home I found a brand new calf in the same bunch of cows that the wolf had been living with the past couple days. I took pictures of it in case the calf showed up on a milk carton in the next day or two. The cow was eating her afterbirth in the pictures so she was doing her best to keep baby safe instinct is an amazing thing. It was a big old baby too. 
   The wolf was shot this evening, the poor little old thing was laid out on the tailgate. She had big feet, a big head and big teeth and an extremely full belly. She did have a really ugly unhealthy looking coat in my opinion for something that had only come out of captivity a few weeks earlier. It had done nothing but follow her own survival instinct as successfully as possible. This was a dumb mistake and a bad situation that didn't have to happen. 
   We all spent a week living and breathing this tragedy that resulted in three dead calves, 3 wolf injured calves a bunch of stressed out people one trapped wolf and one pathetic shot wolf. It cost us a full week away from earning any income milling and we are way behind, broke and extremely tired. It cost Dan his peace of mind and taught him the hard way what we have to deal with. Thankfully he retained his integrity in spite of the mess and stress going on all around him. 
   Thank goodness it is over for now. However I know the Francisco Pack will be re-released soon and am sure the same set of problems on a larger scale will be imminent as soon as that release takes place. Rereleasing habitual stock killers is poor management and is only asking for trouble. Unfortunately so many of the employees agree with the environmentalists that the wolves should be out on the ground no matter how many of our cows they kill so they just keep using problem and habituated wolves in the program. When the wolf kills too many cattle they just re-write their policy to allow them to leave it out longer and hurt us ranchers more. 
   Update: June 5, Sherry Laney found a calf with a big bite in it's behind the bite is 1 and 1/2 inches, wolf width. It is healing but mildly infected. I guess she wasn't so shy over there after all. 
   June 2004.  
   A single wolf has been moving around 74 draw all month. Matt found a small calf with his hind end totally mauled. We already had his mother here at the house, that cow never ever loses a calf so Matt had been looking for the calf, the calf found him actually ran to him bawling for help. We cut away the dead and infected flesh and found bites in all the same places as last years calves, WS came out but they didn't do a thorough job examining it. I was gone so nobody insisted on a thorough job like I would have. I did it myself later. This is a wolf attack the bites measure out and the injuries are in the same place and there were wolf tracks. 
   People don't realize wolves are not efficient killers and they aren't at all humane about what they do. They simply get something down and start eating and the prey dies of shock and blood loss. It is very difficult for someone who raises livestock to see their hard work tortured to death in this manner, especially the pregnant cows and the baby calves. This wolf was inexperienced and the calf got away. He nearly died of the infection though and weighed about 150 pounds less than the other calves. I guess when he finally went to the market he was considered a wolf friendly beef. 
   Summer 2005 wolf tracks up and down 74 draw again. Watching all the cattle all the time no time for school or anything else. Kristie got married in July so we are glad the wolves didn't show up until after the wedding anyway. No kills that we know of except to a bear which we were allowed to take care of so that ended that problem. 
   October 2006.  
   At least two separate wolves moving in and out of the area. These wolves do not have tracking collars. FWS will not investigate. WS showed up and documented tracks so we can do something if there is a kill. Nothing so far that we were able to find just a lot of lost time and a huge amount of fuel again. Bought two Pyreneese pups in September, we can't afford to feed them but we have to do something progressive. 
   We have also purchased water rights and are going to the huge expense of putting an irrigation system into the old fields on this place so we can bring cows into the deeded land if necessary and wolves get into them again. We have to be able to defend our cattle and the rules only allow us to do so if they are on deeded land. 
   We have also built kennels at a 4000 dollar cost that we also cannot afford but we can't allow wolves to come into the deeded land and kill our valuable cow dogs. We can't operate in this rough country without them. 
   December 26, 2006.  
   Pyraneese puppies who are 5 months old now gone. The other one is hiding under the porch and there are wolf tracks everywhere. We had them penned up in the yard but they found a way out. The kids are devastated. We looked everywhere but the puppy is gone. The wolf just carried him off. All that dog food we have in him wasted all those kid hugs and effort just eaten up like it was nothing. 
   We will have to replace him, his brother can't be alone with these animals around. I guess we just have to get used to living with death and destruction and still we are supposed to be happy people and living under the requirements of the law. It is sickening. 
   2007. 
   June 11 on our way home from town we saw three wolves, one had a collar but two did not. They were in Brian Carters cows on the side of the road just about two miles from the Poverty creek subdivision. They were just laying in the tall grass with the cattle waiting for it to get a little darker. Matt and I ran them off the cows and called  our neighbors to tell them the wolves were in the cows. It didn't help, the next day we went over with our monitor and there was no signal for the collared animal so he is probably has a non functioning collar. This is a whole other pack FWS do not believe exist. 
   Found wolf poop two different piles of it. One had calf teeth in it. FWS never even bothered to come out or do anything at all and there is no telling where these animals are now. 
   Our closest neighbor Jack Diamond has the horse killing aspen pack on him in his roughest pasture they are having pups there and are now feeding his yearlings to the pups. I went over and gave moral support while they confirmed the first kill that the Diamonds were able to find. They are out there every day but like I said it is rough country and they won't know how many they lost until it is time to ship the yearlings. 
   Nearly 2 year old heifer eaten alive at water tank on Diamond's place. All three wolves involved only the male has a strike towards removal. The rule doesn't say only one wolf gets the strike. FWS are cheating the people out here of proper and fair management to leave killer wolves out on the ground. 
   May/June 07.  
   I once again have two sets of wolf tracks and no signal in our cow pasture. I am watching the cattle like a hawk. 
   The Boy Scout camp has moved in and that seemed to have driven the animals out for now. Now I am just worried sick about the kids so I warned, mentioned is a better word the wolves to the scoutmasters. How do you tell them that wolves that attacked a dog in front of an 8 year old girl are here within a half days walk of your camp. I didn't tell them all that, didn't want them to feel uncomfortable out here. I want them out here while it is still possible, within a year or two, nobody will be comfortable camping out here with kids. So I told them to come and use my phone for anything they needed and I am checking in on them every day or two. It is nerve wracking but they are making quite a bit of noise so things should be ok. 
   We are exhausted and financially strapped from all the re-vamping of our operation and we are demoralized by all the un-collared wolves we are seeing and finding tracks for. Mostly it is so disheartening that nobody even cares about our neighbors and ourselves. That we are all going broke supporting this program and those kids running it are getting huge salaries and don't end up losing anything, ever. Why us why is it our responsibility to shoulder this program's foolishness? Why are we being allowed to go bankrupt? Why can't I finish my college education? Why can't my youngest daughter go off to school too? She feels like she needs to be here to help us keep our home and help us keep our family ranch in business. 
   My son never got to be raised at the creek playing with minnows and frogs like his sisters did before wolves. He hasn't gotten to ride with his dad hardly at all either, he just turned 9 and his whole life has been affected by wolves. At least our girls were able to be raised out here the way we intended. Our son is locked into a yard and has to be watched constantly. 
   I have to attend every single meeting I can scrape together gas money for, and we can't afford to any more. But if we don't go, FWS and the groups that support this program and who get paychecks to go to these meetings will come up with another plan to harm us further. 
   I pray every night that this program will go away, before it is too late for us before it is too late for the game and the whole country is too dangerous to live in the way it used to be. 
   Sincerely LAURA.

   Mr. PEARCE. I would thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Recently, in Catron County, the local county commissioner started posting signs like this, ``Dangerous Wolf Area.'' It just is a continuation of the theme that we're trying to accomplish something in the Second District of New Mexico that you're not willing to accomplish in your own districts. 
   I will tell you that we heard testimony in the Resources Committee that described the most provocative sound to a wolf is a crying baby or a laughing baby. It's a matter of time until these wolves, which will stalk for weeks and weeks and weeks at a time around local homes, it's a matter of time until a wolf catches one of these children. Their blood will be on your hands, my friend, because we've had the testimony in committee. 
   I would say that this has nothing to do with endangered species but instead has to do with protecting the lives of the people and the livestock of the Second District.

   Mr. PEARCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   We again have the issue of depredation. There is no fund that pays ranchers when their livestock is killed. So we have the livestock, which in these days of ranching, ranching is a very hard business, and we have the livestock which is killed by these predators that continue to eliminate more and more livestock each year, with no payments being made from Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   I would simply point out, and I would thank the gentleman from Kansas for yielding, that this program is restricted to only two very rural parts of America. It is wrong; it is wrongheaded. 
   I would thank the gentleman from Washington for his suggestion to withdraw the amendment but would instead ask for a vote on the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I would thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing this important item up tonight and will enjoy the opportunity to address it. 
   First of all, as we went through the discussions today, we were told, I heard that it was not the intent to lower production. It was not the intent to harm the American consumer. It was not the intent to defraud the contracting process. But I would share with my colleagues that the same kind of language  had to be used in the first item that came to the floor. 
   That item, the majority placed an element into the new rules package which said that a Member, Delegate Or Resident Commissioner may not use personal funds, official funds or campaign funds for a flight on a nongovernmental airplane that is not licensed by the FAA 
   to operate for compensation or hire. 
   Now, when it came up for their own colleagues, they came to the floor and just declared in their comments that this was not the intent of the provision. But it is the effect of the provision, because they absolutely outlawed, they made it illegal to use even your own funds or campaign funds or MRA, that is the Congressional delegation funds, for private aircraft. So you had then Mr. Hastings of Florida say, I want to assure my colleagues that this is not the intent of this provision. 
   Now, either we are bumping into people who were not quite prepared to present legislation to the floor, who are maybe getting bad advice, maybe thinking a little bit too quickly, maybe being driven by an agenda to bring stuff to the floor, to bring legislation to the floor that is a little bit narrowly constructed without the opportunity to go to committee. 
   But let's take a look at what happened today in this energy bill. The first thing they declared was that energy companies are making so much profit that they must be declared immoral, that we must take back some of that money. We heard that over and over and over again today. 
   But I would like to take a look at a chart here that begins to break down the cost of petroleum versus the cost of some of the other items take we have. 
   The cost of oil, today, is $52 per barrel. The cost of bottled water is $409.50 per barrel. The cost of American beer is $448 per barrel. The cost of ice cream is $934 per barrel. Nail polish rings up an amazing $75,264 per barrel. 
   So we have to ask how it is that we are declaring too much profit is being made? I heard today that oil companies, the top oil companies made $96 billion in profit. Yet when I look at Microsoft in just this past year, it was $36 billion just by itself. 
   If we are going to make it wrong, if we are going to simply set up the class struggle between companies that make extraordinary profits, we should look at those that have no investment in large capital. 
   When I look at the elements of producing oil that we are describing today, I see an investment in a rig that is almost like $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Now each one of these components that is made on this rig creates jobs, they create cash flow, they create profits for a whole range of companies. 
   So when my colleagues were saying we need to go up on the taxes for these pieces of property, I think that the American consumer is smart enough to realize that investors just might choose not to put their money into this project. 
   If that is the case, then we are going to find that our colleagues, in trying to assure energy independence, will, in fact, ensure energy dependence. 
   Because in America, in the United States, we are driven further and further offshore, further and further down into the ground in order to produce oil. 
   Saudi Arabia produces from a very shallow depth. Some of the wells in our district may be 20,000 feet deep. Saudi Arabia could be producing from as shallow as 1,000 feet deep. Saudi Arabia already has significant cost advantages over the United States production. We have tried to encourage this kind of drilling, this kind of production, to see that we have as much oil and gas as possible from internal sources. 
   Now, our friends have said that they wanted to create incentives for the renewable fuels. Then they declared that the previous Congress for 12 years did nothing. I don't think they absolutely intended to mislead the American public on that, but they certainly did. 
   Just because of the effects of the Energy 2005 Act that we passed from the Republican House, let me read a list of renewable projects that have already started or are already showing results. 
   First of all, because of that legislation in 2005, 27 new ethanol plants have broken ground, 500 million gallons of new annual ethanol production is online already, 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol production are online by the end of 2006; 401 E-85 pumps, those are the pumps that can give you 85 percent ethanol if you pull up and have an engine that will burn ethanol; 25 new nuclear reactors are planned, 25,000 megawatts of electricity will be generated by 2020 if all 25 plants are built, 15 million households can be powered from the electricity by the 25 plants; 116,871 new hybrid vehicles have been purchased since January 1 of 2006, so the last calendar year, over 116,000 vehicles that are hybrids; there were 2,000 megawatts of new wind power. 
   Many of those wind generators went into the second district of New Mexico that I represent. Many others lie just outside the district. Wind generators are not suitable for all parts of the country, but New Mexico is one of the few States that could be self-sufficient on wind energy. Very few States are capable of doing that; 493,000 homes will now be powered by new wind power. 
   Three billion in economic activity is spurred by the wind power production. There is 7 billion pounds of CO2 offset by new wind power production, 1 million homes that can be powered by new wind power by the end of 2006, 100 percent increase in California and New Jersey and the applications for photovoltaic systems, 30 percent increase nationwide are solar, thermal collector installations. We had 15 new efficiency standards implemented for large appliances and 50,000 megawatts of energy saved by 2020 because of the 15 new efficiency standards. 
   Now, our friends today said frequently that they were giving comments like clean energy policy starts today. Well, they are making the implication that nothing was done previously, and such is just not the case.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. One of the distressing things about the vote we took today was that not only were we setting up kind of an undisclosed fund, a slush fund for things that had already been done, the $8 billion referred to by my colleague from Tennessee was in the Energy Act of 2005 and was very specific. It had incentives for wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear. It had  incentives for many of the renewable fuels. Those incentives are taking place and those incentives are causing developments to take place that are very significant. 
   But the very damaging thing about this bill today was it violated a constitutional provision that prohibits the Federal Government from taking private property. That occurs on page 10 of the bill. Again, I would read the excerpts from the bill, line 4 on transfers. Basically the language says: ``A lessee,'' and some language in between, ``shall not be eligible to obtain the economic benefit of any covered lease or any other lease for production of oil or natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico'' unless they voluntarily back away from, agree to undo these contracts written in full faith. 
   If you can imagine an investor, or even a stockholder, having to walk away from an investment like this because the government changed its standards, the government changed the contracting basis, you would understand then why The Washington Post said: ``This House bill would break the deadlock,'' meaning the deadlock in this contracting process that has been so messed up. ``The House would break this deadlock by imposing heavy penalties,'' that is the heavy penalty of walking away from that investment without economic return, ``on firms that do not renegotiate on terms imposed by the government. 
   ``This heavy-handed attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia, Bolivia and other countries that have been criticized for tearing up revenue sharing agreements with private energy companies.'' 
   I would like to share with my colleagues, before I yield back, the things that this Washington Post is referring to. For instance, in Venezuela in 2006, Hugo Chavez caused royalty rates to be increased from 1 percent to 16 percent without renegotiation. In 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez mandated that private oil firms cooperate with new contractual changes. Those firms that did not agree had their assets nationalized. 
   Now, we are not nationalizing these assets, but we are saying you have to sacrifice any potential to make economic benefit from that. That does not seem American. It does not seem like the way that we want to run business in this country, and yet it is what the majority presented to us today. They said, well that is an unintended consequence, which brings me back to my initial point, that maybe they just should have sent these things to committee before they came to the floor with such outlandish provisions. 
   Bolivia in 2006 threatened to expel oil companies that refused to agree to new government terms on already existing contracts. That is very similar to what this language in this bill did. If you don't agree to the terms in the language here, then you do not get to make economic impact from an investment such as this. 
   In May of 2006, President Evo Morales in Bolivia suspended negotiations and nationalized his country's energy industry. These actions were done for short-term increases in revenue from taxes and royalties, but foreign investors have canceled almost new projects, which will likely lead to massive economic problems in the future. 
   Now, if they are going to cancel economic projects in Bolivia because of the overturn of existing contracts, I will guarantee you that they will do the same in the United States, and they will cancel future contracts. 
   Russia found the same thing. President Putin made firms agree to change existing leases that had been in existence for several years. He threatened to pull these leases for suspect reasons. Now he is willing to hold all of Europe hostage as he takes these nationalized assets. I will tell you that companies will not invest in Russia in the energy business in the future. 
   These are all problems that this bill today that was passed off the floor of the House of Representatives are going to cause. So if my colleague would give me one more second, we would run through a chart showing what American consumers can expect from this bill. 
   First, it sends American manufacturing jobs overseas. The second thing that it does is lower domestic energy production, so we are going to use more foreign oil, not less. It is going to provide higher prices at the pump, $3, $4, $5. Hugo Chavez, the Iranian Government and the Russian Government get the handouts at the expense of the American consumer. 
   American voters need to understand what has occurred in the House of Representatives today. I think that they are going to rise up when they begin to see the effects on jobs, when they see the effects at the pump, and when they see that the contractual basis, the full faith and credit of the United States, has been undermined by this piece of legislation. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding. If he has additional time, I have other comments. But I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing this important issue up.

   Mr. PEARCE. That is a great point. Let me make one additional comment. The very amusing thing is the people that are so critical of the contracting process, the negotiation process, are exactly the same people that said we should trust the Federal Government, who negotiated so badly here, to negotiate in good faith on our prescription drugs. I will tell you, it is not congruent. It does not fit any sense of logic that I understand.

   Mr. PEARCE. Yes. I would comment to my colleagues that a government depends on the confidence of the people. We make promises all the time, and we are expected to honor those promises if we are going to be a good government. We make promises to our seniors. We make promises to our veterans. We make promises to our young men and women who serve in the military that we will watch out for them, that we will take care of them. 
   But like the gentleman says, we also make written contracts and written agreements. In this bill today, we have undermined the contracting process. We have declared that previous agreements simply must be renegotiated or you give up all future rights, and when we as a country choose to do that, not only do we offend and compromise our constitutional protection of private property rights, we undermine the confidence in our Nation and in our government. 
   This is such a very serious step. It is a step that other Nations take very easily and yet is so significant, and yet this major step, this change in American policy was done without one single committee hearing. 
   This bill that was in front of us today, H.R. 6, should have gone to four different committees. Instead, it went to none, not one committee hearing, and there were new provisions in this bill. There were new people on the floor who were elected just this year who have not heard the old provisions. I do not disagree with my colleagues who wanted to make us energy independent, but they failed in that task, and in the process, they have begun to undermine the confidence of this great Nation and the great reputation it has for treating fairly those people who invest and those people who trust the government. 
   Who else will be undercut by actions from the floor of this House and the Democrat majority that is willing to take any step to try to enforce a new standard while declaring it to be a new way? Instead, it is an old, tried way that many other Nations have tried in the past. It is unfortunate to see now this Congress and this majority taking steps that Russia or Bolivia might have taken. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.

   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and salute my colleagues for working at a concept really that we all agree on: Energy independence. I refer only to the second title in these comments, where I oppose the rule which says there will be no amendments. 
   Title II is the one where the Washington Post says ``This House bill would break its deadlock by imposing heavy penalties on firms that do not renegotiate on terms imposed by the government.'' They go on to say, ``This heavy handed attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia and Bolivia.'' 
   Let's look at just a couple of things that have occurred recently. In 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez mandated private oil firms to cooperate with new contractual changes, much as we are doing in section 2. The investment from foreign firms, which is vital for Chavez's economic plan to succeed, are already being curtailed due to the uncertain investment environment. 
   In 2006, Bolivia threatened to expel oil companies that refused to agree to new terms on existing contracts. These actions were done for short-term increases in revenue, yet they are leading to massive economic problems in the country through the oil and gas industry. 
   Also, in Russia, 2006, companies such as Shell, Exxon, and BP have held valid oil and gas leases for years, yet Putin has declared that the agencies are going to pull these leases for a number of suspect reasons. In section 2, title II, we have those same sorts of heavy handed approaches that the Washington Post editorial complains about. 
   Our colleagues have said that President Bush refused to get serious. If getting serious is undermining the full faith and credit of this government, then I will agree that President Bush failed to get serious. 
   I had also heard a comment from one of my distinguished colleagues on the other side that this agenda includes things that the minority would not do, and I will agree the minority would not do those things which undermine the contractual basis of this government. 
   I think this bill should be back in committee to have the hearing and the amendments that would occur, because you know that these things are not valid and will not promote more production from U.S. companies but less.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring a couple of points up on this in response to the gentleman who was just making the points. 
   First of all, we talk about the $440 million that the head of Exxon makes. If we divide out the numbers of millions and billions of dollars that Exxon pays out to shareholders and compare it to Tiger Woods, for instance, Tiger Woods made $25,181 a stroke. Shaquille O'Neal made $18,300 per minute that he played. A-Rod made $180,000 per run batted in. 
   And the people who provide gasoline and oil at the price, $3 for gasoline, you will pay more than $3 for this fingernail polish that comes out to $25,000 per bottle. This bottled water is over $400 per barrel, and it does not require an investment in an operation like this. These offshore platforms are over $1 billion investment, and you are saying that oil is overpriced and we are gouging the American consumers. Next, you should go after bottled water and after fingernail polish because this is $25,000 per barrel. 
   We need to understand that it takes a lot of investment to put gas in the pumps. It cannot be done. I have heard today that we are going to provide wave energy. Wave energy on our F-16s, I can just imagine it now. The investments to power this Nation are extraordinarily high, and we are not overcompensating the companies that do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are three titles in this bill. First deals with ways and means problems, those problems that have to do with taxes. We can have legitimate discussions on whether to tax or not tax corporations. 
   The third title deals with the renewable resources. Being from New Mexico, I think we should be exploring and investing in renewable resources. New Mexico is one of the few States that would be self-sufficient in wind and solar. We are making heavy investments in nuclear energy and in biomass, hydrogen, and geothermal. 
   I am very committed to the section that the Democrats have on title III. The one I have deep reserves about is title II. In that title, page 10 says a lessee shall not be eligible to obtain the economic benefit of any covered lease, or any other lease. 
   Mr. Speaker, what is occurring here is the piece that is referred to in yesterday's Washington Post editorial where the Democrats are described as being heavy handed. The stability of contracts that would be recognized and welcomed in Russia and Bolivia, I do not think that our friends on the other side of the aisle intended to do this. Therefore, I recommend that we kindly send this back to committee and we could take out these offenses. 
   Mr. Speaker, the quality of a nation and its government depends on the full faith and credit of that government. This government depends on making promises that are not written to its seniors, to its veterans. Those promises are honored. But it also makes contractual promises, promises where companies are spending billions of dollars based on the contractual agreement that is there. If we are going to find a way out of those foolish mistakes made by the Clinton administration, I agree we need to do it, but we do not need to do it in the way that they did in Venezuela and Bolivia and Russia. We need to go about it in a proper way. If we are going to punish people who did not voluntarily change a contract, we are no better than those countries that nationalize their industries.

   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not energy policy, it is industrial policy. The San Francisco wing of the Democrat Party is switching from blaming America first to blaming the American way of life first for all the ills they conjure up. 
   San Francisco Democrats want to tell the American people they should be running their cars off wind, yet I will tell you that there is only one institution in this Nation that runs off wind and that is the hot air that fuels this institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, energy is the largest business in the world, not because governments make it so but because 6 billion people demand the freedom and quality of life that its use provides. When America went from horses to cars it was because cars were more efficient and faster than horses, not because government deemed they should be driving in cars. When America went from dirt roads to asphalt it was because asphalt was the more efficient surface that could withstand rain and snow, not because government told people to use it. 
   Just because we say people should be using wind and solar to power their cars does not mean it is going to occur.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker and fellow House Members, let's take a look at what we are doing here today. The Democrats say that they are reducing America's dependence on oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative resources. Both goals, I agree, are admirable. 
   In the process, they are trying to unravel a very thorny problem of contracts that were badly negotiated by the Clinton administration, contracts that the Clinton administration made no attempt to remedy. But let's look at what is actually occurring. 
   In title I, we are penalizing American oil and gas companies and rewarding foreign companies by taxing them differently. That is, we are going to favor foreign jobs and foreign oil over domestic jobs and domestic oil. 
   The second thing we are doing is charging a conservation fee on U.S.-produced oil while protecting foreign oil from this tax. Now, again, this is $9. If I could get the House to focus on the percentages for just a moment. 
   If $9 is added on top of the $70 charged to a production company that is making $70 a barrel, that is about 12.8 percent. But already the price of oil has fallen to about $52. And if $9 is assessed into a $50-a-barrel revenue stream, then it is 18 percent. 
   But what happens if the price of oil falls to $30? I would remind my constituents that as little as 3 1/2 years ago the price of oil was actually at $20. And there, you now have a fee on top of the taxes that is 45 percent. A 45 percent fee will begin to move exploration away from this Nation. 
   In 1999 and 2000, I was in an oil and gas company that did repairs for oil and gas wells. The price of oil fell to $6. At that point, our fee is going to be 150 percent. 
   This bill is extraordinarily prescriptive in declaring not a percent, but instead a fixed fee. It disadvantaged tremendously the production of oil and gas. 
   But probably the most serious consequence of this bill is where, on page 10, it describes that ``a lessee shall not be eligible to obtain the economic benefit of any covered lease or any other lease.'' 
   This is the piece of the bill that The Washington Post declares to be heavy handed, the heavy-handed attack on the stability of contracts, a process that would be welcomed in Russia and Bolivia. 
   In 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez mandated that private oil firms cooperate with new contractual changes. Those firms that did not agree had their assets nationalized.     
   This bill does not nationalize, but it prohibits firms who do not agree from participating in future contracts. It is a very serious contractual problem. 
   Bolivia in 2006 threatened to expel oil companies that refused to agree to new government terms on already existing contracts. That is extraordinarily close to what we are doing in this bill. What Bolivia did has caused investors to begin to take their investments out of Bolivia. 
   In Russia, President Vladimir Putin wants to gain complete control, and so he has begun to renegotiate with companies like Shell, Exxon and BP, who have held valid oil leases in Russia for several years. Mr. Putin had a number of government agencies threaten to pull these leases for a number of suspect reasons. That is exactly the language contained in this bill. 
   I do not think it is the intent of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be this heavy handed. This bill would have been presented differently if it had been sent to committee, if it had been debated in committee and if amendments had been allowed. My request is that we vote ``no'' on this bill and we send it back to the committee where we can get a good hearing to take the very troublesome parts of this bill, troublesome parts which The Washington Post describe as heavy handed and the sort of thing that you would expect in Russia and Bolivia. 
   In this country, we want an environment that causes people to go out and invest. We want people to create jobs and to create a better standard of living. But this bill begins to undermine the full faith and credit of the United States by changing the contractual basis. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2016. One of the Resources Committee staffers was just pointing out that 6 years ago she paid $1.10 for gasoline. Now we are seeing the price of gasoline at $3.30 and increasing. Now what have we done to improve the lives of the middle-class citizens who are struggling to pay taxes and to pay the cost of fuel for their car, and then face the prospect of losing jobs? Well, in 1995, the Republican Congress passed the provision to drill in ANWR. President Clinton vetoed that. If that had been passed, today we would have 1.5 million barrels of oil in production coming daily from there to help stem the price of gasoline. We have limited the ability to drill in our outer continental shelf, even though China is drilling 47 miles off our coast. So again, we are allowing foreign countries to develop our resources, yet we are restricting ourselves. 
   This past December, this Congress, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, put 2 trillion barrels of shale oil off limits in Colorado saying, I guess, that we're going to go ahead and import, and we're going to face the higher price of gasoline. Now, if we think there is no connection between the price of gasoline and this bill, take a look at the Wilderness Society and their 18-page brochure which tells us that it is imperative that we do something with this bill, that we pass this bill. It lists as problems that this bill will correct, road building, energy exploration, mining, recreational use, offroad vehicle use, boundary adjustments. These are all the immediate threats that the Wilderness Society points out that the NLCS is going to stop. 
   So we find that even the supporters of the legislation realize it is going to affect energy development, and yet our friends on the other side of the aisle say we are going to accept $3 gasoline, we are going to import from Hugo Chavez, and we are going to continue to import from the Middle Eastern countries that despise us and work against us. And they say they, as a majority, are not going to do anything. And in fact, they are going to pass this bill, which makes it more difficult for us to produce energy off of Federal lands. It just does not make sense in these times when it is a struggle for middle-class taxpayers to pay the bills of the family, to feed the family and then get the kids to the soccer games, to the classrooms and back, and we are passing a bill that has significant effects on the western lands of this country. 
   In many of my counties, we have 10 percent private lands. In many of my counties, the back will be broken of all economic activity as we undergo this management change, this way we manage our lands. Our western lands are managed well. Maybe the Bureau of Reclamation and the Forest Service could do a better job. But they are doing a good job. Instead, we are going to say we are going to treat all of the western lands like parklands where we have no economic activity at all. 
   Mr. Chairman, this legislation is sadly misguided. And it is not without understanding. My office proposed an amendment for wind energy on these lands. And they rejected without debate the idea that we would not only want to have energy production, but also convert to renewables on public lands. They rejected that without debate, without discussion, because they know they do not want the footprint of any entity, not even oil and gas or renewable energy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would recommend that we turn this bill down flat because it is going to affect the future of all of our hardworking citizens. Just last year, Dow Chemical announced a $22 billion facility is going to Saudi Arabia. It is going because the price of natural gas is so high here. It took over 10,000 jobs with it when it went. We are seeing our jobs leave because of the policies that are being put in place by this majority. And this bill is just one more addition to those bad pieces of legislation of bad policy that is restricting oil and gas and restricting renewable development on the lands.

   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I would point out that in committee we heard these same comments that we are talking in generalizations, half-truths, complete untruths. We were told then that the border is completely secured in the current legislation, and now we find that maybe there is a reason to kind of adapt the wording. 
   We also were told that there is nothing that would limit any sports, no hunting, shooting sports, that those assertions on the part of the minority were simply generalizations, half-truths and untruths. 
   So it's really amazing to me that those half-truths now are being incorporated into the bill by first the bill sponsor and then by another one of the majority Members. 
   The complete idea and argument that all of our discussions have been generalizations, half-truths and untruths, simply now rises to a level which we have to ask ourselves on which side do the generalizations lie, on which side do the untruths lie and on which side do the half truths lie, because we are finding the majority that is adopting and adapting the bill now in order to make it more secure if they did not blink, if they had not believed the arguments in committee, they would not be making these changes today, they would not be trying to work out deals behind the scenes to make this a little bit more, maybe, less risky. 
   I think if we all see what's going on, I think if we see the majority blinking in a big way here on the floor, it just tells us we should turn down the underlying language and turn down this offensive impact on our public land management. 
   I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, today I'm offering a simple, straightforward amendment. It states, ``Specifically, inclusion in the National Landscape Conservation System shall not affect current grazing rights or operations.'' That's it. 
   This language is very clear. We're working to protect the ranching economies of our western States.  
   In the West, many of our communities depend on ranching as a traditional and an important way of economy. The West was settled by ranchers who brought with them little more than a few cattle, the clothes on their back and hope for the future. Today, America's ranchers still hold the dream of a better future. 
   In New Mexico and across the West, our ranchers are real conservationists and know how to protect the land they depend on every day. Their lands are often the backstop against growth, and they are the voice of preserving the rural nature of our lands. 
   However, in countries in the West, it's not uncommon that we find 30 percent, 18 percent, 6 percent or even 2 percent private lands. Therefore, our ranchers depend on public lands for their operations. These ranchers bring in millions of dollars of economic activity to New Mexico and the entire West. In many places, ranching is the single largest economic driver in our communities. 
   My amendment will ensure that nothing in this act cuts off the current operations of ranchers in the West. Without this amendment, it is entirely possible that the enactment of this bill will cut off millions of dollars in activity and devastate our western counties. 
   Supporters of this bill tell us that it will not stop the multiple use of our BLM lands. However, my amendment ensures that this legislation does not stop ranching. 
   Let me leave you with no doubt. This amendment will ensure that we do not cut off our ranchers from lands that they have used for years. In some cases, the same ranching families have administered these lands for more than 100 years. 
   Ranching is an important part of our economy, an important part of the history of the West, and passing this amendment will ensure that ranching has a part of the future in this West. 
   It's a simple amendment. It is endorsed by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, by the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association, New Mexico Wool Growers and the New Mexico Federal Lands Council. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I observe that we are hearing the same tired excuse that nothing in this underlying bill affects this. Yet I would simply point out to the ranchers of this land that now, under the majority, you don't rate as high as the sportsmen. You don't rate as high as those people who are concerned about border security, because we were told that same tired language that nothing in the bill affected them, but the majority's been willing to adapt the language here because they know that the underlying bill affects it. But they are not going to make one amendment in order that would protect our ranchers and protect and make sure that this language doesn't affect them. 
   It is really unusual that we're hearing such a diverse opinion from the sponsor of this bill right now. It says that nothing affects it. And then he reads all sorts of language in, and again for those people who are watching and listening, I would simply say again, read the very simple language: ``Specifically, inclusion in the National Landscape Conservation System shall not affect the current grazing rights or operations.'' 
   And yet we've built all of these potentials that we have created for this language that we are, in fact, rewriting the entire way that grazing is done. Grazing is always done by cows walking out and munching on the grass. And it's a very simple operation. I think that maybe our amendment is being overcharacterized. I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona and his overcharacterization. But the truth is, we're simply trying to protect the ranchers in the West who use the public lands, and many times there are no private lands to graze off of. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, this urgently needed bipartisan legislation constitutes an important step forward in our efforts to improve homeland security. H.R. 556 injects significant doses of transparency, accountability, and oversight into how our government reviews and approves U.S. investments by foreign government-owned companies. 
   Before the proposed transfer of six major eastern shipping terminals to Dubai Ports World came to light last year, very few Americans had heard of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The concern that greater scrutiny was not applied to this transaction and its potential impact upon the security of our ports became a source of shock and outrage--and CFIUS became synonymous for bureaucratic failure in the face of the post 9-11 challenges America confronts. 
   Congress began investigating the CFIUS process immediately following the resolution of this controversy. The House and Senate passed legislation last year which enhanced reporting standards while strengthening congressional oversight; yet a final conference agreement was not reached before the end of the last Congress. 
   H.R. 556 builds upon last year's efforts, providing the comprehensive CFIUS reform that our national security requires without overburdening the flow of commerce and capital upon which our prosperity depends. 
   I have listened to American business owners as they urged us to act for the sake of certainty and stability in international investment markets--and I am pleased that acting together as Democrats and Republicans, we are poised to pass legislation today that constitutes real progress toward addressing their concerns. 
   We must remain vigilant in our oversight of CFIUS and other long-established bureaucratic processes that can fundamentally impact our economy and our security. We can--and we must--protect our homeland while ensuring that foreign investment remains strong and New Mexico and America continue to be the best places in the world to do business.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, once again we are here to vote on the majority's newest No Energy Act, and I stand in opposition to that when America is facing the highest energy costs ever. We are here today with a bill that mandates plenty, but has no new energy. 
   We are told that today is a turning point, and it absolutely is a turning point. Last night in that first turning point we took 2 trillion barrels of American oil off the market. Instead of closing off American jobs, we should be working to encourage American energy companies to expand their operations building U.S. jobs and cutting back on the money we send to the Middle East. 
   It is a turning point today if you need the muscle of an SUV or strong pickup. You just aren't going to have that if you are a rancher or maybe in the oil and gas industry or something in the mining industry. It is a turning point for biomass, because we in the West have many Federal lands, but we are restricted from taking off biomass from those Federal lands by this bill today. It is a turning point for conservation, because if you own a 20-room house, 10,000-room mansion like Al Gore does, you might be able to afford the new conservation techniques that are implied and required in this bill. If you are making $25,000 a year, in New Mexico, you probably can't afford that replacement furnace. 
   Our economy needs an expanded domestic energy supply. We need more clean domestic natural gas; we need to open our lands to renewable energy development, we need to utilize our domestic oil reserves; and we need to develop nuclear energy. And this bill is silent about nuclear energy. We need to make energy more affordable by making the supply greater.  
   Our largest competitor, China, has made that choice. They are building one new coal plant each week for the next 10 years. We are trying to stop those plants here. It is the most affordable of energy. China has doubled their domestic natural gas supply since 2000. How different would our economy be? This is a bad bill. We should turn this bill down and do what is right for the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Mr. Forbes for your leadership in this call to establish American Religious History Week. 
   Also, as a cosponsor of H. Res. 888, I'm strongly supportive of the idea that we should remember that we should always acknowledge the founding fathers' belief that this Nation was indeed blessed by our Maker, that we would, as a Nation, acknowledge our corporate belief. 
   It's important to remember not only our founding, but also to take a look at where we're headed as a Nation. We acknowledge that our Nation was founded on the right to choose to believe or not believe, but also our founding fathers gave us choices in exactly how to express our faith. 
   I believe that acknowledging America's rich spiritual and religious history is important and it is a great step towards accomplishing what would be the future of this country, America's religious heritage. 
   It troubles me that we are beginning to see shifts in this country. We're seeing shifts, not in ideology, not in philosophy, but over whether we can even declare our faith publicly. In this country we're beginning to hear people say that if you declare faith publicly, you're infringing on their rights. I simply do not agree or believe in that. 
   If you want to acknowledge your faith, there are people who say that it should be behind closed doors. This is sad. Often this mind-set is originating right here in Washington. This mind-set is originating in this institution, but it's also originating even in institutions where the members are not elected, and I think those are critical things for us to look at as we consider where this Nation is headed. 
   This Nation has a motto ``In God We Trust.'' It was approved by Congress, and yet it's being circumvented sometimes by unelected officials. ``In God We Trust'' is printed on coins, on our currency. It is engraved on our buildings. It appears over the entrance to the Senate Chambers, and you can see the phrase engraved in this Chamber on the wall above the Speaker's dais. This phrase is woven into the fabric of our Nation, but we're beginning to see an unraveling of the phrase, an unraveling of this tradition of declaring that  we do trust in God. This is a string that should not be cut. 
   In 2006, the U.S. Mint announced plans to move the inscription ``In God We Trust'' from the face of the Presidential Dollar coin pieces to the thin edge around the dollar coin. 
   In February of 2006 the Treasury announced that in an accidental omission an unknown number of Presidential coins had made it past inspectors and were sent into circulation without the words ``In God We Trust'' at all. Some estimates are as many as 50,000 of these coins are in circulation. 
   I understand that mistakes happen, but sending 50,000 coins without the basic motto which this institution declared should be on our currency is a major mistake. I ask for the U.S. Mint to give a full report and accounting of the situation. 
   Our history tells us the importance of God and faith in the birth of our Nation. The problems with the phrase, ``In God We Trust'' being omitted from our coin is just one indicator of how badly we're drifting off course. It is fitting that we honor the spiritual history with a week dedicated to remembering our founding and ensuring that the lasting connection which so many Americans share in and believe in is a part of our national fabric. 
   I support H. Res. 888, and agree that we should, indeed, establish a week which declares American religious history. And I thank Mr. Forbes for yielding time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, we call our veterans from World War II America's greatest generation but our actions don't always hold water. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment to the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs appropriations bill which would ensure veterans are appropriately reimbursed for mileage travel to and from medical facilities in New Mexico or large rural States. 
   Many times people in my county, 305 miles away from Albuquerque one way, are directed to drive to Albuquerque. These people, many are like my father in their 80s, they cannot travel 5 1/2 hours one way. It's unthinkable that we do that. It's unconscionable that we only pay them 11 cents a mile. 
   From Hobbs to Albuquerque, 305 miles one way, the reimbursement is $34. I would like to ask anyone in this chamber how they would expect to drive 305 miles for $34, but even worse, the Veterans' Administration takes a fee when they get there. Approximately $7.50 of the $34 is then sacrificed to the VA.     
   No allowance is made to sleep overnight. No allowance is made for hotel. No allowance is made for any circumstance except turning around and driving another 5 1/2 hours to get back home. We are reimbursing all that driving at 11 cents a mile. 
   Meanwhile many of us in government jobs, all Federal officials are reimbursed at 48 1/2 cents per mile because that's the going rate. That's the rate that we should be paying, and yet to America's Greatest Generation, we're paying 11 cents a mile. 
   Now, the director of the service, the Secretary, could change this by regulation, and all people on this House floor agree that it should be changed. Back in March of 2007, March of this year, we passed the Wounded Warrior Act, H.R. 1538, by a vote of 426-0, where we mandated that the Secretary actually do this. 
   But we also know in Washington that we play games with people, we play games with our veterans. So that bill now is trapped over in the Senate. 
   What my amendment simply does is say we would like for the Secretary not to pay anyone mileage from this bill, from H.R. 2642, until he remedies the situation with our veterans. Pay them what the mileage costs them to drive. We are mandating that they go that far to the facilities. That's unthinkable, but it's unconscionable that we are paying only 11 cents a mile. 
   So while we are claiming America's generation, America's World War II veterans, to be our Greatest Generation, let's begin to act with honor and reimburse them the way that we should. My amendment would ensure that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I would just remind the Members of the Chamber that we are a part of the Republican Study Committee, that's the RSC here. We have the Web site, www.house.gov/hensarling/rsc. So take a look at the things that we are talking about, the things that we all believe in. It's the conservative arm of the Republican Party. 
   I think the first thing that we would want to talk about is basically what is happening in Iraq. If the gentleman doesn't mind, I would like to use one of the charts here. If we take a look at the charts, these are reconstruction projects, but also they mirror very closely the conflict, the different fights that are going on. 
   If you look at this whole part of the country, this entire section is actually pretty secure. This al-Anbar province out in the west has been the subject of a lot of discussion. Baghdad, of course, is very near the center part. You can see where we are spending more money on reconstruction there and up north. We can see, also, that if we have the reports of firefights, the reports of IEDs, we would see the same sort of clustering there. 
   People ask, well, why did the British leave? The British were serving in the southern section here. The British actually had secured their area that had been turned over to the Iraqis. 
   I think all of our troop commanders are telling us that when we have Iraq secure, that when the Iraqi forces are in charge of their own security, both police and then the army, then we are going to see troops start coming home. That's exactly what happened. 
   Now, the risk that we run, I would cover that just briefly, Iran touches on the eastern side of the country. If we pull out, Iran will take over these massive oil fields in the southern part of Iraq. That's going to destabilize even more the price of gasoline. Our colleagues were just talking about it. Really, the price of gasoline is quite simple. I majored in economics in college, and I did so because economics is very easy. It's just got two moving parts: supply and demand.     
   If you will consider the demand for our product, the demand for gasoline, we have 300 million people today. That is significantly more than what we had in the 1950s when the price of gas was low. So our demand is increasingly higher, but also our supply is becoming more restricted. 
   Then we look at the worldwide picture, and you understand that the Chinese, if you overlay the price of oil, the price of natural gas, the price of gasoline with the demand in China for the last 20 years, you would see that the demand of the Chinese is almost exactly mirroring, is exactly causing our high price of gasoline right now. 
   There is a compelling fact today; we heard the same statistics that just a couple years ago the price of gasoline was actually $2.47, today it is about $3.29. And, again, the law of supply and demand, the Middle East, that OPEC group is actually cutting their exports. They are trimming back their exports. They are cutting the supply. It is driving the price up. It is actually quite simple. Our friends on the other side of the aisle in charge of governing the Nation really should stop and consider these two moving parts, supply and demand. They have got two hands, maybe they could write one on one hand and write one on the other hand and try to keep them organized, because they make this far more complex than what it actually is. 
   So what we are doing in Iraq is trying to stabilize the Middle East, because I would guarantee everyone in the Chamber that if Iraq fails, if we leave Iraq, Iraq falls. We were just in Israel about 2 months ago, and the Israelis said that you are going to lose Saudi Arabia. That is, the terrorists are going to go in and topple that regime, they are going to go in and take over that government. Now, Saudi Arabia has about 60 percent of the world's known reserves; that is the reserves of normal petroleum. So that would destabilize between losing the production in Iraq, losing the production in Saudi Arabia. And, don't forget Kuwait, because the general assumption is that Kuwait and Jordan would fall. Then you see a picture where the worldwide oil market would destabilize. 
   At that point I think that we would really have to worry about the security of the entire world economy. And if you worry about the security of the world economy, you also have to worry about social stability, because the terrorists know they are not going to beat us militarily. That has never been their attempt. Their attempt is to destabilize us economically. That was the reason they hit the World Trade Center in 1993. They came back and hit it in 2001. And they knew that if they could strike at that vibrant nerve center of the U.S. economy, they would destabilize us economically. If they destabilize us economically, they destabilize us politically. 
   So right now we are finding that actually our surge of troops, those troops are mostly in the Baghdad area, because how goes Baghdad, that is how goes Iraq. The governing structure is in Baghdad. If we secure Baghdad, then we secure Iraq. If we do not secure Baghdad, we do not secure Iraq. 
   We put about 110,000, 120,000 troops into Baghdad. We are also joining those up with about 100,000 Iraqi troops that are there already. Both of those numbers are increasing, and I will tell you that we are hearing already that the violence in Baghdad itself is beginning to diminish significantly. Again, we can take some of the instability that is moving out to the outlying provinces if we first secure the capital, if we can have those essential government functions that cause the people to believe that their society is intact, and that even though there are difficulties that they can get their garbage service, they can get their water service or whatever. Those are the underlying factors that we are seeing playing right now in the troop surge. 
   I think that everyone believes by September or October, we are going to know the outcome of the surge. It doesn't mean we will know the outcome of the battle, it doesn't mean we will know the outcome of the war. But I think that it is essential that we fund our troops, that we quit playing games. 
   We have consistently asked our leaders, the majority leaders, if you do not like the war, that is a credible position. Just come to the floor, have the vote about withdrawing the troops. Do not play games with the funding. Do not play games with our troops in harm's way.  
   But they refuse to have that vote. Instead, what they do is they put the money here and they put conditions. 
   Now, I know that college football coaches and pro football coaches get fired every day. It is because they become too predictable. Their offense is too well known. When an offense is well known, the defense knows exactly where to play. Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle want us to give our playbook; they want us to put into legislation the benchmarks that will determine if we go or leave, if we come home from Iraq or if we stay in Iraq. And we will tell you, that simply tells our opponents where to go to defeat us. If the benchmarks are in writing, then that is going to give our playbook to the opposition. 
   We as the American Congress, we as the United States Congress, owe it to the men and women in uniform, who are in harm's way, to support our troops or to please bring them home. 
   I was in Vietnam at a period of time when the Nation began to turn its back on its troops. I was in Vietnam at a time when they began to play games with the funding. I was in Vietnam during the time that Jane Fonda went to the North and gave aid and comfort to the enemy. I will tell you that I have personal experience that this is not the way that we want to treat our young men and women who are in harm's way. 
   So we owe it to our troops to have the vote on the supplemental budget that we are discussing tonight, because the future of our country depends on it. But more than that, the lives of our young men and women rest today, today, on what we do. 
   So I yield back to the gentleman from Texas. I have other comments, but I see we have a lot of people here tonight. I thank him for the opportunity to speak and thank him for taking his leadership and giving leadership to this great subject, because it is the right thing for us to do. It is the right thing for America to do. It is the right and honorable thing for this Congress to do, to give the funding to our troops or bring them home. Those are the two choices we have in Congress. And I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. PEARCE. I would. And I thank the gentleman. As he's talking about this new willingness of Iraqis to report suspicious behavior, I would remind my colleagues that it was our bill, my bill that was introduced, that simply said that you cannot be sued in American courts for reporting suspicious behavior, that you cannot be terrorized in our own courts of law for reporting the same sort of behavior that you're talking about being reported in Iraq creating stable responses, stability in the country. 
   And yet, we had 121 of our Democrat colleagues vote against that legislation. They voted with the terrorists to say, you can sue Americans in court for reporting suspicious behavior. I think that shows the difference between the Republicans in this Congress. All Republicans voted with the American citizens to limit those capabilities. But the difference between the Republicans and Democrats is that the Democrats are still soft on security. They're soft on terrorism, and they're soft on funding the troops who are fighting the battle. 
   And I just wanted to, your comments about the Iraqis now turning in evidence, bringing those actions to our attention, caused me to remember that bill on the floor of the House where we actually had a vote here, and the Democrats voted, 121 of them, to let terrorists sue us in our own courts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, we are moving to recommit this bill in order to provide an amendment that would prohibit the Secretary of Interior from using eminent domain to acquire land, water, or interest in land or water under section 3 of the bill. 
   Now, most of you, like me, received probably the hardest phone calls from both Democrats and Republicans alike when our Supreme Court made the Kelo decision which said that local entities could, in fact, use eminent domain to acquire property from private individuals.     
   This motion to recommit is extremely simple. We do not want the Park Service to use eminent domain to take over property. 
   I sat as the chairman of the National Park Subcommittee in the Resources Committee for all of the last year and part of the year before that, and I will tell you that the most disturbing things that happened in committee were that we heard testimony from people around the Appalachian Trail where the willing seller that is referenced in the bill, the underlying bill today, the willing seller legislation was in fact used to threaten, to intimidate, to cause people to become ``willing sellers'' against their will. 
   Right now, I am working on the Continental Divide Trail, which goes north to south from the Mexico border to the Canadian border. Since 1978, it did not have one mile that had actually come from private landowners in New Mexico. 
   I believe in the park system and I believe in the trail system of the United States Government, but I do not believe that the government should or could be able to intimidate, to harass, to cause people to become willing sellers. And that is my fear in this legislation, that it does not go far enough and is not explicit enough. 
   I have expressly worked to get all of the landowners through the Second District of New Mexico, including 22 miles on the Acoma Indian Reservation, where they did not want any Federal presence, no people coming across their land, and now they are excited about the prospect. 
   So I support the concept of preservation, and I support the concept of our national parks, but I will fight to the last breath to protect the private property rights of the people in this country, because it is a constitutional right. The right to private property is the basis of our economic and, therefore, all other freedoms. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we simply say that in this bill ``the willing seller'' is not hard enough; that we want assurance that eminent domain will not be used to acquire land, water, or interests in land or water under section 3 of the bill.

   Before the gentlewoman from Michigan leaves, I wonder if she would yield to a question. 
   I was wondering, the gentlewoman mentioned, and I appreciate what she is saying about leadership getting together, she mentioned a $50 million cut to first responders. Can you tell me how much is unspent from previous appropriations? 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would just comment that there is $5 billion in the first responder grant program which has not been accepted by States, and each year about September they have to give back a portion of that. And the underlying bill appropriates $4 billion more, and that is the reason that the President cut $50 million out. 
   He said there is so much money unspent, let's begin to lower the level we are pouring into it, and it seems to me a reasonable suggestion.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). He mentioned last night that the underlying amendment is Mr. McHenry wanting to take money out of the appropriation for the lawyers, and he pointed out we have 77 staffers in order to watch for circumstances like the Dubai Ports. 
   I would comment that the gentleman's party has been in the majority now since January, and 80 percent of our ports are still controlled by foreign countries. Have you put a bill in? If that is true, and it is, 80 percent controlled by foreign countries, that is the exact circumstance you mentioned we would not want to cut this budget for. I am asking if the gentleman knows of any plans on his side to simply eliminate those contracts, to take the contracts away from the foreign countries. It seems like if the gentleman is concerned, 80 percent of our ports are controlled, that there would be something in the works to do that.

   Mr. PEARCE. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate his answer, and I did hear him say that those are valid contracts, but I would point out and I'm reading now from a January 17 bill where the majority in their H.R. 6 bill, the Washington Post editorial says, ``The House would break this deadlock by imposing heavy penalties on firms that do not renegotiate on terms imposed by the government.'' 
   And it says, ``The main problem with the House bill is that hitting up oil companies is a poor substitute for a real energy policy. The Nation needs to accelerate the development of less-carbon-intensive fuels,'' and it declares in this that the heavy-handed attack of H.R. 6 is something that would be welcome in Russia and Bolivia and other countries but not in the U.S. 
   And so my point is that the gentleman's party has already decided that contracts are not especially valid, but I would simply say that if contracts are valid contracts, then they should be valid throughout the spectrum of vision that the gentleman has.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to talk a little bit about what we as Members of the House owe the American public, what the people who elect this House deserve and expect. 
   The first thing they deserve and expect is honest conversation. They deserve fiscal responsibility. They deserve openness and transparency. They deserve fairness from us.  
   Now, the bill in front of us, the appropriation bill in front of us tonight, spends about $4.3 billion more than the same type of bill last year. That is almost a 14 percent increase. If you look at where the increase is, about $4 billion is in first responder grants. Now, that would seem on the surface of it to be adequate and fair. That is something that the American people might like. The first responders do expect and deserve good treatment. 
   But when we understand from the past appropriation processes that there is almost $5 billion left in this fund for first responders to draw from that they have not yet taken out from past appropriations and we go ahead and add $4 billion on top of it now, it causes the American public to say, Why? What is it that we are getting? 
   The American public will stand for things that seem right and seem justified, but in order to get the $4 billion to put into this fund, our friends on the other side of the aisle are increasing taxes, the second largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, how is that important?     
   I will tell you that the Governor of New Mexico said it best: Lowering taxes creates jobs. The corollary of that is also true; raising taxes depresses jobs. Raising taxes stagnates the economy. It does away with the vitality that any country is looking for. 
   So, when Ireland wanted to improve its economic state, it began to lower taxes. When it lowered taxes on internal corporations, they had a surge of growth. But when they lowered taxes on external corporations, companies began to move to Ireland and create a grand, booming economy and new jobs in Ireland, and for the first time in the Irish history they have moved their economy tremendously forward because they cut taxes. 
   Now, what we are doing in order to create the $4 billion in just this one appropriations bill is to raise taxes. We are going to stagnate the American economy. We have created an about 7.7 million jobs in the past 2 or 3 years. It has been an excellent economy, one that started off in a recession, the recession that started at the end of the Clinton years, and that recession then moved forward. And 9/11 shocked us into the recession again; the Global Crossing scandal, the Enron scandal, the WorldCom scandal that shocked us into recession even further. But the Bush administration and this Congress passed two successive tax cuts which began to revitalize the economy, and that revitalization is now at risk because of the way that the Democrats in this Congress are willing to put $4 billion into this one fund that has a surplus of over $5 billion in it. 
   Now, the lady from North Carolina is taking a small attack on this whole increase. She's saying, quite simply, let's just don't pay the attorneys $1.2 million that they received. A $1.2 million increase is not needed for attorneys. The people in this country need good-paying jobs, they need a good economy, they need a sound economy and a good government, and that good government is being denied in the guise of providing another $4 billion into a fund that still has a surplus of over $5 billion to it. 
   So, tonight I would recommend that we all look carefully at the lady from North Carolina's amendment, and that we support it as the first increment of many in reducing the cost of this particular bill. 
   The deficit spending for the government doesn't occur one large lump at a time, it occurs one small piece at a time. And the lady from North Carolina has adequately stated, let's just not do it. Let's level fund. Let's fund at the same amount that we gave last year. 
   That is a reasonable thing for the American people to want to see. The American people deserve and expect this fiscal responsibility, for us to spend the money as if it were our own because they are trusting us with it. They put us in a position of stewardship over that money, and yet here we are throwing the money into a fund that is not being spent adequately yet. And in order to get more money to put in there, we are raising taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his hard work on this issue. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. We're good friends. And all three of us come from the West, where we are very familiar with public ownership of land. 
   One of the things that really concerns us most about the threat of condemnation and about the way that home owners, private property owners would be affected is shown in this chart that I have here. The management plan would put a cap on impervious services, and those services could not be paved. If the road to your house washes out, then you simply can't do it. 
   Now, there are all sorts of takings that the Federal Government can do, and this is one, where they simply won't allow you to fix your property up or fix the roads leading to your property.     
   So you would lose value because you could not own a house and sell a house that has a road leading to it that has washed out. You cannot add a room to your home; so feasibly we could say that we are limiting procreation. If you have another kid, you can't build a room in the back to accommodate them. You can't go build on your property if you have not already built there. You can't go in and build. The private land is impacted seriously. 
   But beyond that is there a real concern? Do we have a concern for the public taking of private lands and making it theirs? Are there examples in our history as a Nation where we maybe have extended the power of a Federal Government, a central government that is too strong, a central government that begins to overburden and outweigh and out muscle the citizens? If so, then it is imperative that we give voice to those citizens who have no other voice, who have been left out completely, who are going to be marginalized by these management plans. 
   I think that we do have a Federal Government that will extend too far, and I think that we have a concern here. Now, it is unfortunate that we have come to this point because the underlying bill, the one that says we would like to preserve a wild and scenic river, is one that there is almost no discussion about. The entire discussion is about private property rights, that constitutional right that gives us each our place to retreat to in the evening without the government's coming in and taking either part of its value or simply confiscating the whole thing. 
   Now, confiscation is a language that seems abrupt, that seems too harsh, that we really do not face that sort of circumstance today in this country. I would tell you that, as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee last year, we heard testimony from the Franciscan Friars of Atonement in New York. That group had fought the National Park Service for decades, saying don't take our land. But through eminent domain, the Federal Park Service had continued to put pressure. Again, it was the threat of what they could do that was used as the hammer. 
   So we find ourselves now with this bill, which the ranking member adequately points out that there is an underlying bill that contains language that nothing contained in this section shall preclude the use of condemnation. It is a process that has been used frequently. 
   I was recently in Shenandoah National Park, and you would think that Shenandoah is just a great location, and it is. But the underlying story is one that is told right now in the Visitors Center in Shenandoah, and it is about the confiscation, about moving, it seems to me, about 4,000 families out of their homes so that that could be a big park area. We did not want those inconvenient people living there; so we simply moved them out for their own good. We moved them to much better places regardless if they wanted to move or not. 
   In my own State of New Mexico, the White Sands Missile Range exists there. It is 100 miles north and south and it is 40 miles east and west, 100 miles by 40 miles, and almost all of that land was taken by condemnation. 
   Condemnation occurs when a too strong central Federal Government just wants to go ahead and move. Forget those pesky citizens. 
   The Supreme Court recently in the Kelo decision said that governments can, in fact, take private property and redistribute it to another private firm. That is what is at stake both left and right. Both agreed in this circumstance. Liberal and conservative, Democrats and Republicans, said the Kelo decision was one of the most atrocious in taking private property rights away from people. 
   Madam Speaker, I would simply point out that private property rights are the foundation of our rights. I would urge all Members to vote for the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (MANAGING PUBLIC LANDS -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate his leadership on this. 
   We are discussing extremely important things. For instance, in the mining bill, which will be coming to the floor, a heated debate really arises  about what does it matter. What does it matter if we add an 8 percent royalty on to the price of minerals? 
   At one point yesterday in the debate, the chairman of our Resources Committee, Mr. Rahall of West Virginia, said, I see no reason, no reason whatsoever why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product. Now that is, to me, a stunning statement because I think policy should always consider the jobs in America. It should consider our standard of living, and it should consider the ramifications for our communities. 
   Communities in the West, where mining occurs on public lands, will be affected most by this new royalty that is being suggested by the majority party. 
   Now, we had comments at a field hearing, and we find the comments are very similar from the Democratic witnesses to the Republican; in other words, both sides agree. There's a James Otto, ``8 percent is excessive,'' he says. 
   ``I'm only aware of a single royalty that is as high as the royalty proposed in the bill, just one in my 20 years of practice. An 8 percent royalty would really be ruinous,'' says James Cress of Washington on 10/2/07. 
   ``I am particularly concerned about the potential impacts of the 8 percent net smelter return royalty called for in the last legislation. All the royalty costs will be absorbed by the mining companies, and this will be a direct adverse impact on the amount of mining tax revenues that flows into the State and to the counties.'' 
   We had testimony from one country, and I think it was British Columbia, that increased their royalties and saw a tremendous decrease in their net tax revenues because companies simply moved out. 
   Today, companies can move their mining assets; they can move their mining investments by simply a flick of the computer. If it's that easy, then we should be very cautious. We should be concerned about the gross domestic product before we jump into these very significant arguments. 
   One of the letters that I have, and I would like, Mr. Speaker, to submit this as a part of the Record.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate has progressed for a long time, but made a very short distance. The American people have a right to expect that we would do our job, that we would do our job to ease the pain in their everyday life. They have a right to expect that we would increase the competitiveness of American companies so that we are able to hold a good, strong economy. They have a right to expect that we would give fairness to all States. They have a right to expect that we would use good common sense in establishing this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are failing on every account in the bill that is before us tonight. When we should be establishing American dominance in the energy field, we are saying ``no'' to nuclear and ``yes'' to bicycle power. When we should be doing our job to find new clean coal technologies, we don't even mention them here. When we should be drilling for every amount of oil that we can find here to create American jobs and to stop spending $700 billion overseas, we are limiting our ability to produce here. 
   We were told 2 years ago that we were going to see a plan, and tonight we were told we have new ideas. Those new ideas are riding bicycles and killing the American economy with higher fuel prices, hurting the American family with continued restrictions of supplies, putting ourselves strategically at risk by selling off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I request that all Members, Republican and Democrat, vote ``nay'' on the bill in front of us tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, a generation ago, extreme environmentalists began filing lawsuits to stop the production of timber in the United States.  They killed the timber industry throughout this great country. 20,000 jobs were lost in New Mexico alone. Today we have fewer than 100 of those jobs left, and they're in the process of dying probably this year. That whole response to our timber industry was a hoax. 
   Today we're involved in another hoax, the hoax that is sending $700 billion a year to enemies across the seas; $700 billion a year would be a 6 percent increase in our economy. That means more jobs. And yet instead of solving the problem, we're extending the problem through a hoax. 
   If we want to stop the outflow of American jobs, we need to stop the lawsuits that are killing every single new lease. They're killing mining, they have already killed the timber industry. The extremists, with litigation, are killing American jobs, and this hoax that is on the floor today called an energy bill is doing nothing about the litigation that is killing American jobs. We must stop it, and we must stop the litigation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his discussion on energy security. 
   And for my discussion tonight, I would like to begin at the same point that my friend from Ohio from the other side of the aisle began. She was quoting accurately an oil industry study which says that supply cannot keep up with demand, that prices are going to be high, that supply is going to be tight, and that is for the foreseeable future through the next decades. 
   Now, the response that we had in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was literally to, number one, recognize that it is not possible to convert overnight; so we had incentives there for the very hard-to-get oil and gas. That is the deep, the very deep, ultra-deep, and then offshore. 
   Now, the offshore platforms are extraordinarily expensive. They maybe look something like this. Our friends from Louisiana would recognize many of these, and California. These units cost over $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We don't invest in them easily, but they produce a tremendous amount of energy. It is the belief of those who are concerned about the energy business, concerned about the fact that prices are high, that supply is low, they really only have two choices if prices are high and supply is tight. You can lower demand, which Americans have not seen to want to do, or you can increase supply. 
   So these units here, we had great incentives for those, and we felt like that would bridge us during the years to where consumers would begin to consume differently. 
   But I would ask our average listener, how many people do you know who actually put biodiesel in their car or their truck? How many are using any fuel other than straight gasoline? We have got some of it augmented by ethanol. But how many cars really do significantly reduce the consumption? 
   If the answer is not many, then you would be concerned about the time to convert. And we have had testimony in our Resources Committee where both sides of the aisle say we are probably on a 20- to 40-year conversion that you and your family probably will not drive a different car for 20 to 40 years that has a different power source than what it has got right now. So we either recognize the truth in the matter and we encourage supply while we are converting to those renewables, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 had great stimulation. I think the difference, though, is that when we are confronted, as business-supporting conservatives, with the idea that the oil industry study says the supply is limited, it cannot keep up with demand, that we probably should increase supply. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle, and I would quote, said that we are going to reinvent our economy in the first decade of this century. 
   Now, it is not possible to reinvent an economy in 2 1/2 years because we are already at year 6 1/2 . It is just not possible to reinvent an economy in 2 1/2 years, and that becomes the great disconnect on the discussion. 
   I would like to spend the rest of my time talking about the energy suggestions that our current majority has. We have recently marked up H.R. 2337. We have recently passed that out of the Resources Committee. And I will tell you that we need to make one point perfectly clear, that H.R. 2337, the Rahall energy bill, which is intended to be a piece of the package that is brought to this floor, will cost Americans jobs. It will increase the cost of natural gas and gasoline. And it is going to stunt the growth of the alternative and renewable energy industry.     
   H.R. 2337 is called the Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act. It could be called the ``American Job Outsourcing Act,'' it could be the ``Chinese Full Employment Act,'' or it could be the ``Funding Mechanism for Hugo Chavez,'' but to declare that it is the ``Energy Industry of America Revitalization'' is intended to be a stretch of the facts. 
   During congressional hearings in Congress, we've heard a lot of testimony from witnesses talking about the impact of our actions on the cost of energy. So I would refer to another chart which simply talks about the cost of our energy is going to be increasing dramatically. We have received this testimony that the cost of energy probably will go up to a 23 percent increase in some areas, 29 percent on the California coast, 32 percent in the Texas region, 21 percent in the South, and in the Southeast, 19 percent; 20 percent in New York. So you see significant energy increases because of the increasing consumption of natural gas. 
   One witness, Paul Cicio, testified that America has lost 3 million manufacturing jobs to overseas competition due to this kind of energy increases. It is an important point because we need good jobs in America. High-tech industries and high-tech manufacturing are the future of our economy, yet they're tremendously energy dependent. You can't put a server farm in Washington or San Jose unless you have the energy to power it. You can, however, put it in Beijing because the Chinese are committed, like one of my friends said, building 544 coal-powered plants over the next 10 years to ensure they have enough cheap power. Cheap power is the key to keep their economy moving forward. 
   At the hearing we talked about, a couple of months ago, how Dow Chemical was going to build a $22 billion facility in Saudi Arabia because of the price of energy here in the U.S. And yet, what we're doing is restricting our access to energy here in the U.S. while we're not restricting the overseas, ensuring that we're going to import more energy, ensuring that jobs are going to continue moving to those cheap sources of energy. 
   American prices are simply too high, and we're doing nothing about it. And  the renewables, though they have promised, the renewables are far, far into the future, decades into the future, where they begin to affect us. 
   We can see that energy prices are already high and headed higher. The projections show that they're going to be 20 to 30 percent increases, which drive these billion dollar projects overseas. 
   I would comment that the Dow Chemical plants in both China and Saudi Arabia are going to take 10,000 jobs, those are 10,000 jobs which would be in the hundred thousand dollars range if they're here in America, and yet because of the low energy prices overseas compared to here, we're going to export those jobs. And it simply does not make sense. 
   Since 2000, our offshore gas production has dropped 40 percent. Our next chart will show that production decrease. It's very difficult to see, the yellow line is on the top, moves along here. And we see the energy decreasing as it moves across the chart. 
   We would recognize that onshore gas is actually a flat stable line, but the offshore is decreasing rapidly. And yet the Outer Continental Shelf, where we have great potential large, large resources, we're restricting access to those areas. Meanwhile, in the Rocky Mountains, where we restrict access there, those are fields which already have been drilled, so it's not as if they're pristine. We just are limiting our access to our own resources, which then compounds the problem that Ms. Kaptur started out with initially. Prices are high, supply is tight. And we're seeing that supply gets tighter, and we're going to then increase the price. 
   Another thing that H.R. 2337, the Rahall energy bill, is doing is limiting shale completely. We're restricting the regulatory framework that was supposed to be out already and saying that it won't come forward. And without regulation, the industry is simply going to die. Now, that's important because in the long term, the 20 to 50 year term, shale causes America to be the Saudi Arabia of energy. If we consider just oil, Saudi Arabia has the dominant amount of energy in the world. But when we consider shale, the U.S. then becomes the dominant energy producer, and yet we're killing that industry completely. 
   We're in the shape that we're in today because of our decisions over the past 30 years. We chose not to build new refineries. We have chosen not to have nuclear energy. We have chosen not to drill more in this country, but instead, to restrict access on Federal lands, and so we simply have a problem of tight supplies and high prices. And those are going to continue for the foreseeable future. 
   Now, what does 2337 do regarding renewable energy? We hear our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the need for renewables, but this bill begins to hurt the renewables. It begins to restrict the renewable energy development, also. It just doesn't make sense. 
   But we heard from four Democratic witnesses at one hearing that coal cannot be a part of America's energy future if we're to combat global warming, but according to the bill H.R. 2337, it's about the only energy source left because of restricting oil and gas in 2337. We also give deep restrictions onto the wind industry so that the Wind Energy Association came out opposed to the bill saying it cripples our industry. 
   The bill places new costs and restrictions on the solar industry, requiring new labor provisions, per acre fees, and purchasing restrictions. So this bill harms domestic oil and gas production, reducing domestic production, increasing our reliance on foreign oil, but it also begins to limit our development of the alternative energy sources, but even worse, the most restrictive thing for alternatives is that there were corridors that were implemented in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Those corridors recognize that places where renewables are created are not where the population is generally. New Mexico is one of the few States that would be self-sufficient on wind, yet we can't consume all of the wind energy that we would produce there. And so there were corridors that were lined up to take the renewables from where they're produced maybe in New Mexico to Los Angeles or New York, wherever, and yet those energy corridors receive a death blow in this bill, H.R. 2337, which again is passed out on pretty well party lines and is coming to the floor of the House as a part of Ms. Pelosi's energy package. And yet you have to ask, where is the energy in the bill? Because I see where the limitations on oil and gas are; I see where the limitations on shale are; I see where the limitations on wind and solar are. Exactly where is the energy production going to come from? 
   I guess with the carbon sequestration that is in the bill, to the dismay of our friends on the other side of the aisle, it's going to ensure that coal is our only source of fuel for the future. But they're also trying to limit its use. 
   Finally, regarding royalties. This bill attempts to capture royalties owed to the American Federal Government. Like the chairman, I strongly believe that American taxpayers should receive the royalties that are due. Nevertheless, we differ when it comes to the method of collection. 
   I support a Royalty in Kind program where we simply declare the number of barrels produced. We can meter that, it's very easy. We don't have to calculate the price because the price changes every day. And so the take to the Federal Government changes every day if we're contemplating dollars, but Royalty in Kind is very simple, but it also puts a lot of accountants out of business, puts a lot of tax lawyers out of business. And so we could call the provisions here where we kill the Royalty in Kind program in 2337, the ``Tax Lawyer Full Employment Act.'' Because that's what it's going to do, it's going to put people in the courts saying, now exactly what was the price on November 7 of 2001 when you sold that gas? It would be so much easier just to take the meter reading, take the government's percent, and put it into the government's coffers. 
   In our legislative hearing on this bill, leading Members on the other side of the aisle chastised our royalty regime saying it parallels countries whose corrupt governments are blowing up the rigs. That was a quote. Then they're moving to this country to exploit our low rates. But how ironic is that? You wish for the U.S. to set an example for the world on climate change, but want to follow the lead of Venezuela and Nigeria on royalties. 
   I support increasing production that will bring good, safe jobs and energy to America. I support efforts to keep the ``American take'' as a portion of energy development to a reasonable level that ensures companies have the money to provide safe working conditions, keep their facilities up to date, and reinvest in development and exploration. 
   Finally, we had comments all through the time that the royalties received by the U.S. Government are so much lower than Russia, so much lower than Venezuela. Yet I would like to share a final chart with you that shows some of the problems. 
   This picture is in Russia. And I will guarantee you that you will see no oil field in America like this. The opponents on the other side of the aisle of the level of royalties that we take currently simply want to make a moral equivalency between the kind of government and regulations that allow this, and the government and regulations in this country which have produced one of the strongest energy economies in the world, which have produced the most dramatic economy of American exceptionalism in the world, and yet they're trying to unravel that and undo that. 
   I would hope that we all would look at the energy suggestions from our friends on the other side of the aisle, that we would carefully evaluate the fact that the supply cannot keep up with the demand, that prices are going to be high, and the supply is going to continue to be tight unless we do something about it. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding tonight and appreciate the discussion on both what we've done in the past, and what we're looking for in the future according to 2337.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (WILD SKY WILDERNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to begin by complimenting Representative Larsen for the hard work he has put into this legislation and for proposing wilderness only in his district. This would seem to be a basic sensible courtesy, but seems to be lost on some of his fellow Democrats. 
   With that said, the minority is opposed to this bill. During the markup in the Natural Resources Committee, the minority pledged its willingness to work with the majority, but this offer must have fallen upon deaf ears. In the future, we hope the majority can at least contact us after we make such a gesture. 
   Much of the area that would be designated by this bill does not qualify as wilderness. The 1964 Wilderness Act states explicitly that wilderness areas should be primitive and untrammeled by man. Yet the Wild Sky Wilderness Act includes several roads, a bridge, numerous culverts, and other man-made developments. 
   The proposal also includes areas with mining patents and lands identified by the Forest Service for timber harvest. Moreover, according to the Forest Service, road corridors within the wilderness are too narrow to ensure proper road maintenance and safe passage by travelers. Without sufficient corridors, landslides or other natural disturbances could permanently block or destroy the road. 
   Restrictions associated with the wilderness areas prohibit the use of mechanized or motorized activities, which would surely be needed to prepare a road. It is disingenuous for the majority to tout the public's ability to visit the Wild Sky area without protecting one of the main roads that would allow access to the Wild Sky area. 
   We are willing to work with the majority and have indicated our willingness to do so. In the future we hope that the majority would work with us. 
   Wilderness areas affect local communities, are permanent, and many times have ramifications or unintended consequences. We ask the majority to take these bills seriously and study them in good faith before hurriedly passing them on to the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the comments by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva). 
   H.R. 309, introduced by me, would establish an innovative 4-year demonstration program in the National Park Service to improve and expedite landscape restoration programs within 24 units of the National Park System to better preserve and interpret resources associated with American military history. 
   One of the tenets of the Park Service is to preserve the look of national battlefields as they existed at the time of the conflict. Often this involves removing trees and other woody debris that encroach on sightlines. Under current law, these trees are removed and any funds from their sale are returned to the General Treasury. 
   As a part of this new program, selected parks would be permitted to retain receipts from any timber sales and use those funds on the respective landscape restoration programs and interpretive services. While this would not involve a lot of money, every little bit helps, especially given the National Park System maintenance backlog. 
   This noncontroversial bill was favorably reported last Congress by unanimous consent, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 309. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and thank the colleagues across the aisle for this important debate. 
   I think one of the things that should be brought to our attention is that the debate is not subject to amendment. We are not able to really consider and take action based on our considerations. 
   We received a communication from Rebecca Dow, who is the founder and executive director of Apple Tree Educational Center, a nonprofit institution serving low-income/at-risk children in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. She stated that if a Federal or State minimum wage passes, the reimbursement for child care assistance is going to be so low that providers cannot continue providing service for low-income families. For programs like Apple Tree, it will mean closing. There are going to be unintended consequences. 
   As a small business owner myself, I will tell you that we are not talking about the middle class working for minimum wage. I will tell you that we are not talking about people who are right in the midstream of the employment force. I will tell you that we are talking about giving jobs to people who are not and have not in the past been hirable. 
   We brought one man in who was 40 years old, tattoos from one end to the other. He told me after working 6 months he had never had a job, a full-time job, in his whole life. Because we could bring him in at a lower level, we did not have to have productivity, he was allowed to learn on-the-job training. That gentleman is still employed at the company which my wife and I sold after we came here because we were able to give him an entry level wage at an entry level job without much demand for performance. 
   In the last session, the last Congress, I voted to increase the minimum wage when the protections were there for small businesses. It is the small business people who get caught in the middle. 
   We heard from our colleagues on the other side that many small businesses support minimum wage. If that is so, they have got the instrument to do something about it. They simply increase wages. But it is those small businesses, family owned businesses, where the decisions are made, on the living room sofa and the dining room table. Those are the people that you are going to put up against very hard economic circumstances, people like Rebecca Dow, who is going to have to close her institution that provides child care assistance for low-income families in an area that has no other provider for this sort of service. I think these are the things that we should be talking about and should be making allowances for, rather than rushing this bill to the floor in the manner that it is today. 
   I appreciate your concern for the working families and for the businesses of the country. There are changes that we need to make.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I believe we can all agree that we must work to increase opportunities to enhance the education of America's men and women. Education provides the needed foundation for helping Americans become productive working citizens. This makes our country stronger and more competitive both now and in the future. 
   Because I believe we must open the doors to higher education while ensuring taxpayers are protected, I plan to vote in favor of H.R. 5. This bill cuts subsidized student loan interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over a period of 5 years and includes offsets within the federal budget to ensure the budget deficit is not increased. This makes the bill a ``win-win'' situation for both college graduates and taxpayers. 
   However, the bill before us contains serious weaknesses--weaknesses that could have been avoided had the Majority allowed for a more open discussion both in committee and on the House floor. The bill lacks in its ability to help individuals who need to fund their education today. To truly increase college enrollment and affordability, students need to have increased access to financial aid while they are attending college. 
   Last year Republicans brought to the House floor more comprehensive legislation that created Academic Competitiveness and Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) grant programs to supplement the existing Pell Grant program. I supported this measure as well as an increase in student Stafford loan limits from $2,625 to $3,500 a year for first year students and $3,500 to $4,500 a year for second year students. These measures were signed into law on February 8, 2006 and are helping students get increased access to financial aid as we speak. 
   By focusing on the principles of fairness, accountability, affordability and quality, we can continue to reform federal student aid programs to both maximize the benefits for students and spend taxpayer dollars wisely. I look forward to the Majority changing their closed door policy and giving all Members of Congress an opportunity to put forth their ideas to develop comprehensive higher education reform this year. We must continue to improve our efforts to increase college access and affordability to help Americans achieve a better future for themselves and their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to restore a small sum of money into an important program, the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The RRW is critically important for our national security. Our current nuclear stockpile is aging. As it ages, we must constantly pour more money into maintaining the aging weapons. 
   We have a choice to make as a Nation: Do we continue to rely on current weapon stockpiles and pay an increasing cost of maintaining the readiness and reliability of these weapons, or do we develop a new line of weapons to replace the current stockpile? The RRW would improve the overall shelf life of a warhead from 30 to over 50 years, and the program is true to its name. 
   RRW does not pursue new nuclear weapons capabilities. Rather, it pursues making our weapons more reliable, and more reliable weapons will help reduce the maintenance costs of our nuclear stockpile and ensure that we have stable and reliable weapons ready, and most notably, reduce our overall nuclear stockpile by potentially as many as 1,000 warheads. 
   Without RRW, we will continue to have a larger weapon stockpile. Not pursuing RRW is essentially counterproductive to our stated goals of arms reduction. Not only is my amendment the responsible thing to do for our national security, it's the fiscally responsible choice as well. The current life extension programs that are designed to extend the shelf life of expired warheads are at a great cost to the taxpayer. 
   I think we should all agree on the goal of reducing our total stockpile of nuclear arms, and if you agree with that goal, then I urge you to adopt my amendment to restore funding for the RRW program, the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have heard the arguments that maybe we're taking too much money from the EEC program, the Energy Efficiency Conservation program, that we're actually taking 12 percent was what was stated, but actually the truth is from last year's funding, we're not taking a penny. We're actually leaving that program funded at exactly the same level. 
   I have heard that we should not be building new weapons in order to give the right example to some of our friends around the world. And when I consider our attempts to influence our friends in North Korea, I would think that our unwillingness to build new weapons won't influence them at all. And when I think about influencing our friends in Iran, I think that our new posture of not maintaining our nuclear weapons will not influence them at all. In fact, they might be influenced in the other way. 
   Mr. Chairman, the world is not safer since 9/11. The world is more dangerous. During the 50 or so years of the Cold War, we didn't experience one strike inside the United States that even came close to being like the attack on 9/11. Yet after the Cold War, 1993, we had the first attack on the World Trade Center and then the second attack in 2001. 
   The world is getting progressively more dangerous, and I think for us to think that we can negotiate with these different countries is one that we should back up with the capability to strike back if a strike is needed. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate congressional Republicans for acting to protect Americans. 
   Last week we passed, and yesterday the President signed, legislation protecting Americans who in good faith  report suspicious terrorist activities. Conservatives successfully fought the liberal leadership of this House to pass the John Doe protection legislation. 
   On August 1, after the House and Senate acted, the lawyer for the six Muslim clerics who were removed from a U.S. Airways flight last November amended their lawsuit to remove John Doe passengers from the lawsuit. What does that mean, Mr. Speaker? That means that the responsible Americans who report suspicious behavior and who will report suspicious behavior in the future no longer have the threat of a lawsuit hanging over their head. 
   This legislation is already making Americans safer. It means that we can tell Americans that if they see something, they should report it. Our Founding Fathers envisioned it thus. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Americans should know that Republicans in Congress are standing behind the vigilant citizens and saying, ``I am John Doe.''

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I would yield to the desires of our ranking member on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill of that amendment offers us clear choices on the environment. It lays before us the kind of choices, the kind of development we should support. My Republican colleagues and I believe that we should support and expand our domestic energy supply. 
   This picture is a picture of American energy. This offshore rig produces between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil a day from America's Outer Continental Shelf. The production is clean, with a limited impact on the surrounding ocean. The impact it has causes the creation of a new column of ocean life on the legs of the platform. 
   During Katrina, these did not spill one drop of oil, not one drop, in one of the worst hurricanes in American history. I believe that this clean development is what we should produce more of. That is why I am going to vote for this bill. 
   Many of our friends see life differently. They are going to say that this is not the way to produce. To quote my friend from New York, ``Let us import as much energy as we possibly can.'' 
   Now, I have traveled overseas and I have looked at oil production overseas. When they say, let's import as much as we can, some of that production comes from places like this, with absolutely no environmental standards. And we are going to export our problems, export the environmental contamination from this country to others, all in the guise of making ourselves energy independent. 
   Many in the majority of Congress is going to vote today, and I would recommend that we very carefully think about the problems that we are going to export and think about that tremendous energy industry that has developed here and is a model for the rest of the world. 
   I thank the ranking member for yielding time and thank the chairman, and appreciate the opportunity to speak.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3221. I rise in strong opposition to the method and strategy promoted in this bill, which suggests that it is a new direction towards energy security. I don't oppose the bill because it doesn't include any new energy. I can tolerate a bill that doesn't include any new energy, and this one doesn't. 
   But this bill is worse than that. It takes domestic energy supplies away. At this time of record energy prices, this bill limits our domestic production. This is a San Francisco energy policy that will force prices higher, will increase our dependence on oil from Venezuela and Iran, and it will send even more of our American jobs overseas. 
   The bill is deaf to every signal in this country and around the world regarding energy prices. Listening is one of the most important skills of a policymaker. I urge the Members of this House to please listen to the signals surrounding us. 
   Oil shattered another record this week, reaching $78.77 per barrel during the trading day. This ``Wrong Direction'' bill cuts off 2 trillion barrels of American oil from oil shale resources. 
   Energy Secretary Bodman called on world producers today to boost oil supply of world oil because the U.S. economy is in a ``danger zone.'' This ``Wrong Direction'' bill cuts off 10 billion barrels of oil from our own National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. 
   On one hand, the Independent System Operator of New England released a study today that states that New England's energy rates are among the highest in the Nation and they will continue to depend almost entirely on the price of natural gas. So New England's energy depends on the supply of natural gas, no matter what policies State leaders adopt for conserving energy. 
   On the other hand, this ``Wrong Direction'' bill cuts off 18 percent in Federal onshore natural gas supply by gutting the categorical exclusions provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   In another move to use energy as a political weapon, Russia announced this week that it would again cut off Belarus from natural gas supplies. At the same time, Russia is putting a flag on the North Pole so that it might drill and continue to feed its hungry energy appetite. Meanwhile, this ``Wrong Direction'' bill plays 11th hour games and cuts off critical domestic natural gas supplies from the Colorado Roan Plateau. The Roan has enough natural gas to power 4 million homes for more than 20 years. 
   Venezuela announced this week they are coordinating with the Cubans to drill offshore Florida. China is already working with Cuba to drill off the shore of Florida. And yet we do not harness any of this energy for our own purposes. Instead, we allow the Chinese to become even more dominant in the world. 
   The bill will prohibit government agencies from working together. Right now, BLM, the Forest Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Army Corps of Engineers all work together in pilot offices that make common sense to the American taxpayer. Yet this bill stops them. 
   Dow Chemical announced recent plans to build a $22 billion chemical facility in Saudi Arabia because natural gas supplies are too tight in this country. This ``Wrong Direction'' bill breaches contracts with natural gas producers. 
   Again, this bill simply does not produce any new energy, but, worse, it affects the supply of energy we currently have, diminishing those. It is going to put a double squeeze on our economy. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not the best new direction. It is a new direction for the country. It is the wrong direction. I oppose the bill strongly.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this unduly restrictive rule. I had two amendments that I was prepared to offer to this legislation, neither of which will be considered here today. They were pretty simple, really. 
   My first amendment would have increased funding for the Wildlife Services by $500,000 to support the Mexican Wolf Recovery Program in New Mexico and Arizona. This program is teetering on the edge of failure. My attempt to add a modest amount of additional funding to manage dangerous problem wolves was rejected by the majority. 
   My second amendment was an attempt to bring protections to the endangered wolves in the Northeast United States, where many in the conservation community believe they are being killed by Wildlife Services. 
   My amendments were filed in a timely fashion. The committee was alerted to my intentions all along. Yet this is the result of the rule that we have before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the rule be amended to allow me to offer my two amendments which have been placed at the desk, which were also filed with the Rules Committee, were provided to the Appropriations Committee and are critically important to my constituents in New Mexico.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to amend this bill in order to  make our borders more secure. I am one of the Members who lives on a border and on the southern border. In New Mexico we experience many of the problems of having a porous border. We find drugs, human trafficking, and other problems at the border because of our failure to secure the border, and many of our residents are affected daily. 
   With an overwhelming amount of funding and preexisting TSA full-time employees, I think it is proper for us to divert funding from TSA to border security. The TSA, and I have heard my constituents call it ``thousands standing around,'' seems to have plenty of people to do its work, and yet we do not have enough people to put on the border. We are simply requesting a move of less than 3 percent of the funds. Less than 3 percent of an agency, and every single American who travels on airlines understands the number of people they see standing around when they walk through the checkpoints. 
   We are asking that less than 3 percent of that money be sent over to where we can use it along the borders. Our calculation is that we can hire over 4,000 new people to help us secure the southern border of the United States. 
   CBO recognizes the value of this and scores this as a $43 million savings. We would like to draw that to the attention of the body. 
   Every year, between 500,000 and 1 million illegal immigrants come into the United States. We need more people to help on the southern border. Many problems are coming into this country and many problems are affecting each State, but especially the States that lie on the border.

I am telling the American people that we have underfunded consistently for the last decades, the last 30, 40, 50 years, the efforts that are needed on the southern border, and today is not the day to find 3 percent to be an onerous fee. 
   I sat on the Transportation Committee and watched some of the elements two terms ago. Last year I was on Homeland Security. I saw the waste, fraud and abuse, and I will tell the American people that tonight we must make the stand that our border must be secured.

   Mr. PEARCE. My simple point was that the same agency that approved the puffer machines is going to approve the explosion devices; and my feeling is that the agency has been ill-managed since the beginning. 
   We have a desperate need on the southern border today, right now. The TSA, in finding equipment and funding equipment, both now and in the past, has been shown to be very, very ineffective. I would just say, we have an emergency crisis on the southern border and all along the northern borders. We have 13,000 Border Patrol agents to work that entire range of 5,400 miles and we have 43,000 TSA officers and inspectors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   It's an interesting discussion that we have here about taxation policy. As you know, this budget is going to increase the taxes to the American consumer more than any single time in our history. 
   But why should that matter? Why is that important? I will tell you that the Governor of New Mexico, Governor Bill Richardson, a staunch Democrat said it best, when he is passing tax increases for New Mexico, tax cuts create jobs. He said Democrats should get over it. They should understand the economic principle. If tax cuts create jobs, then the reverse is true, that tax increases are going to outsource jobs. 
   So what we have here is one of the largest outsourcing of jobs in American history. 
   Now, if you would like an example of it, you could take a look at Irish miracle. We are all familiar with an Irish economy that was slugging along, so what they did is they cut taxes to their internal companies. If you are internal, you paid like an 8 percent or maybe a 10 percent tax. If you were an external company, maybe someone outside of Ireland, they still paid a 36 percent tax. Their economy began to boom. 
   At that point the European Union said, you know, you Irish people have got it wrong. You must change the tax structure. We are not going to listen to this. We are not going to allow for it. 
   The Irish, being the Irish, looked at it and said, yes, you are right. Our tax structure is wrong. So they lowered the taxes to all the external companies. They did increase to 12 percent their internal companies, lowered everyone to 12 percent, and that boom continued tremendously. 
   New Mexico had a boom after we began to cut taxes. The United States government, people would ask me, why did we cut taxes in a period of deficit spending? We cut taxes to grow the economy. It has worked, and over the last 3 or 4 years we have created over 7 million jobs in this economy, which has been spurred on by tax cuts. 
   So what our friends on the other side of the aisle are doing is it does not matter about the health of the economy. It does not matter about the jobs that we are going to outsource. We are going to tax people more in this country. 
   That's the fundamental difference between Republicans, Democrats, and I would bring that to the attention of our audience today and ask you to oppose the Democrat budget that increases taxes more than any other budget in American history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank both gentlemen from Georgia for their work, either plus or against this amendment. 
   I offer to support the amendment tonight, have helped cosponsor it. I appreciate the work that the gentleman from Georgia has done.  
   Mr. Chairman, our amendment simply requires secure forms of identification. It can be any form. It can be a foreign passport, a U.S. passport. It can be a Citizenship and Immigration Services photo ID card, a Social Security card with some State or Federal ID. 
   These secure forms of identification are relatively easy for legal residents and citizens to accomplish and to acquire. They are relatively difficult for illegals to acquire. So I think that the gentleman's amendment is very appropriate. 
   We are finding that more and more services that should go to legal American citizens are being soaked up by those who come here illegally. In the Second District of New Mexico, we are on the southern border of the United States bordering Mexico, and I will tell you that our hospitals are overwhelmed. Good tax-paying citizens come to me and ask why is it that one's daughter whose husband and she make $30,000 or $40,000 a year just paid $5,000 to have a baby and the girl in the bed next to her got it for free? 
   We are finding that this is the case over and over. And so requiring this fund to establish some sort of legality, some sort of legal residency or citizenship is not an onerous burden, and in fact it is one that most Americans would expect that we would accomplish. 
   I will tell you that the underlying bill, in establishing one of the trust funds, is a very problematic situation. We heard the left declare when they came into power in this Congress that they would spend the profits of companies like Exxon, and now we are seeing them actually reach down and pluck those profits away, put them into a fund, and with no discretion, no declaration of how those funds are to be spent. I don't think that is what Americans want. 
   And just so we understand the real process, this same technique of establishing funds that simply appear in the authorization bills is also accomplished in H.R. 6 and the Hardrock Mining bill. Those attempts to reach out and take money from corporations to spend it because the left declared that to be their intent when they came to power in this House of Representatives. 
   So my friends, I would suggest that making a requirement for U.S. citizenship is not too much. 
   I would say also we have received a lecture tonight about hypocrisy, we on the Republican side. I would comment that just earlier today we have heard promises from the other side that they were not going to have secret votes to increase the debt limit, and yet even today almost $1 trillion in debt limit was increased without a vote, without the transparency that we were promised. We were promised under the new majority earmark reform, and within the last couple of weeks we have seen a little $23 million earmark slid into the bottom of a bill with no ability to even comment about it. 
   We were told that we are going to protect the American soldiers, and yet we see funding mechanisms that take money from the operational troops and placed only for training. 
   So my friends, when we are told to trust us, that we will create this fund and we will write the specifications later, I say in New Mexico we have a saying ``trust your neighbor but brand your cows.'' 
   This bill with the Affordable Housing Fund is no cow. It is mostly bull. But we had still better brand it and watch for what we are doing.

   We are not trying to engage the REAL ID Act at all, what we are trying to engage is a situation that exists right here in Arlington County, Virginia, the immigration status of applicants for local housing subsidies is not checked. Illegal immigrants are allowed to receive taxpayer-funded rent assistance. That is the thing that we are trying to address. 
   Also, the chairman says that somehow these firms are not the same as other firms that get profits. The truth is that they were commissioned as government-sponsored enterprises, but then the government sponsorship was pulled away. They are simply for-profit businesses. The government does not anymore, and if the gentleman from Texas will yield, are you saying that the government still backs up, with full faith and credit of the United States Government, to the transactions of these----

   Mr. PEARCE. I would point out that one similarity, that we are willing to treat them similar with for-profit businesses is reach down and extract profits away from them in the way that we're going to do under the Hard Rock Mining Act, and the way we are going to do under H.R. 6. And then these three assistances, and I suspect more instances than this, we are actually fulfilling a promise of the left to take the profits of large companies and spend it. And that to me is an abomination in this free enterprise society.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this massive $463 billion dollar spending bill because it fails four critical tests: the accountability test, the common sense test, the compassion test, and most of all--the smell test. 
   Hatched behind close doors by the chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees with no input from Members or their constituents, H.J. Res. 20 levels a devastating blow against New Mexicans and their communities. Our most vulnerable low-income residents will pay the heaviest price. 
   As Deputy Ranking Member of the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee, I wish to point out that the Majority's arbitrary choices are ripping nearly one million dollars away from the public housing authorities in my district and the people they serve; including $272,428 from the Las Cruces Housing Authority; $158,355 from the Dona Ana Housing Authority; $30,461 from the Gallup Housing Authority; $40,717 from the Truth or Consequences Housing Authority; $15,076 from the Bernalillo Housing Authority, $43,596 from the Los Lunas Housing Authority; and a combined total of $416,173 from the Region V and Region II Housing Authorities.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Republican motion to recommit. 
   Last year, I held nearly 40 town hall meetings across New Mexico talking to our local communities about combating methamphetamine use in our towns. Twenty of these meetings were in schools with our school kids, and we found that five times the national average of kids in New Mexico are addicted to methamphetamines, up to 15 percent of our elementary and high school students are already addicted. 
   Two weeks ago, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and I announced our bipartisan determination to fight the dangerous scourge of methamphetamine use, production and distribution in our State. Tragically, the majority's ill-considered cuts will slash funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration Mobile Enforcement Teams, the MET teams, by $30 million and 134 agents, and Region Enforcement Teams, the RETs, by $9 million and 23 agents. 
   Our local and State law enforcement officers depend on the MET and RET initiative as two of the most effective tools in this fight. Many officers in my district have told me that even at current level of funding, MET is insufficient. 
   Perhaps the majority leadership has decided battles against illegal drugs are not worth fighting. A few moments with the individuals and families who I met with in my 20 school meetings and 19 additional town hall meetings might change their minds. But we did not seem to have time to consider the people and the effects on the lives of kids in the real America that we face today. We were explained, well, maybe we made a few mistakes. Do tell. We made mistakes that affect the lives of the young people of this Nation and the heart and the soul of this country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit. Work with us to protect and defend the families of New Mexico and all of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, it is a very dark time for the Nation. The President is at an unpopularly low rating, unprecedented in our history. We are involved in an unpopular war. Elected officials on both sides are calling for us to get out of the war. I am not talking about this war, I am talking about the civil war, when President Lincoln had the courage and the vision to hold onto that concept that we must  let liberty triumph. And because of his courage, we have a Nation that has set the course for liberty for the entire world. 
   Exactly what are we involved in here? This is far broader than a war in Iraq. This is a war with radical Islam. It is not the first time we have engaged with radical Islam. The first time that comes to my attention was 1786.     
   Thomas Jefferson goes to find out about the Barbary Coast. He comes back and he reads the letter about why the Barbary pirates were fighting everyone in that region. He buys his own book of the Koran to understand, but that letter that he had and brought back says that it was founded, he is talking about Islam, it was founded on the laws of their prophet, that it was written in their Koran that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners; that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found. That same principle is holding today. We read it on all the Web pages of the radical Islamists. 
   Now, we can wish that it weren't true. We can wish that the attacks on the Cole did not happen. We can wish that 9/11 did not happen. But they did. And now we are involved in a very difficult, unpopular war with the President, again, at historic low ratings. 
   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in opposition to this dangerously misguided resolution which will only embolden our enemies and demoralize our troops. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle claim to support our troops, and I do not discount that. I do not question their sincerity. I question their judgment. 
   I will tell you that the political gymnastics that are required to come this soon after they campaigned against stay the course, to present a resolution that supports our troops who are in Iraq, and yet says that we will not change the tactic, we will not increase, if we are not going to get out, if they have turned down those resolutions which would bring us home, and if they do not want to declare to defund the war, if they do not want the surge, then we are involved in a resolution today that is nonbinding, but says stay the course. 
   Do tell. Stay the course is what they had to campaign so hard against in the last elections. 
   I served in Vietnam when elected officials were on the floor of this House having these same conversations, and I will tell you it is extraordinarily distressing from the point of someone serving in harm's way to have the elected officials playing games. 
   My friends, if you don't want to support the effort in Iraq, you have the majority, call the troops home. It is within your capability. Have the courage of your convictions. Stand for what you believe. Do not put this resolution in front of us that simply encourages our enemies and distresses our troops. 
   There are those who claim that General Abizaid has said we can't win the war. President Lincoln was faced with the same thing, generals who listened too much to the public. He had to fire General McClellan and replace him with General Grant. 
   Many recall those words of President Lincoln saying, if you will not use the troops, sir, can I borrow them? 
   We have replaced the general who was in charge of Iraq with a new general. I am sorry, but he is a troop. He is a commander. He is the commander, he is the supreme troop in Iraq, and he says, I could use more troops. Please, don't leave me dangling. 
   And yet, this Congress, with this leadership, is going to say, we support the troops but we are not going to support the troops. The mental gymnastics, the political gymnastics are to appease the very shrillest of their proponents, the very shrillest of their supporters. But everyone knows they will not be content with this nonbinding resolution. Those supporters will be like the tiger at the door, eating their own if it does not escalate from here. 
   Have the courage to bring the troops home, my friends, if you are not going to let the generals run the war. Let the military run the war. 
   The greatest mistake we made in this House in Vietnam was trying to manage it with people who are elected rather than military leaders, and it was an abysmal failure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding,  and I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his work on this bill. 
   The Native American Housing Assistance Self-Determination Reauthorization is actually quite a bipartisan effort in the Financial Services Committee. We had Representative Waters, Chairman Frank, myself, and Mr. Kildee working on the bill. 
   Basically, we're faced in many of the States with Indian tribes with large Indian populations. We are faced with the problem of consistent high unemployment, consistent homelessness, substandard housing, infrastructure that is not developed. 
   In New Mexico, I've seen Native American homes which consist of cardboard, corrugated tin, bare boards, no insulation, and I've seen where toilets simply flush out the bottom of the trailer out onto the ground with no sewage infrastructure. 
   And so what I began to do when I first came to Congress is sit down and meet with the tribal leaders. We formed not only a working relationship but a strong friendship as we tried to wrestle with these problems in New Mexico, as we began to wrestle with the problems of self-determination, the problems of self-sufficiency, the problems of employment of tribal members. They understand there's a cultural problem, as well as a systemic economic problem; but we have committed ourselves together to work one issue at a time, side by side, to accomplish what we can. 
   So when we come to this housing problem, this reauthorization, and I understand my friend from Texas and in his objections, and do not disagree with those, but at some point, I myself am faced with a pragmatic decision about just what can we do and what are we going to do. 
   So I find that the greater discretion that's allowed in this language, the greater flexibility that is allowed to the Native Americans to begin to make their own decisions, and we've had frank, straightforward discussions about accountability, about the needs of these funds to be measured and where they go and what they accomplish, and never do I find them to be wary of this accountability. It's just that they are trying to get their feet underneath them to try to solve the problems on their tribal grounds. 
   And so I come to the floor to support the reauthorization and several of the underlying amendments that will come up on that. 
   One of the things that this bill does is begin to set up block grant programs to where the tribes can take out loans for infrastructure, clean water, healthy drinking water, ways to dispose of raw sewage. Those are things that really affect every tribe, and not many of them have very good solutions. Many in New Mexico are a long way away from the urban centers where the funds are available to create sewage treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants; and so it's an important addition to this bill that we allow them that flexibility and that ability to create the loan programs, much like the CDBG program which affects small communities, rural communities throughout New Mexico. 
   So as we begin to look at this reauthorization again, I would come to the floor in support of that and in support of the idea that we must begin to pay attention to the very desperate needs that exist on many of the tribal grounds throughout this country; and as we do that, I think that we'll find when housing begins to stabilize, then those cultures begin to stabilize because homeownership is one of the basic building blocks of a society, that ability to have some place where you can retreat and be away from the cares of the world with the family structure gathered around. 
   So it would work well. The idea of affordable housing is one that is extraordinarily important in all of New Mexico. We have a very low per capita income, and so affordable housing is important in every community but especially in our Native American communities, and the affordable housing is addressed here in this reauthorization, too. 
   So understanding the objection of my friend from Texas, I would still rise in support of the underlying legislation of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to offer support for H.R. 2786, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act. 
   Chairman Frank has described it very well. Basically, we are trying to see that the plight of Native Americans in their housing can be improved. It is basically fairly simple. 
   As home to many Native American tribes, New Mexico sees this problem up close. The lack of standard housing, the availability of substandard housing, the lack of economic development opportunities, the lack of infrastructure such as water and wastewater treatment facilities all continue to plague people who are trying to make the tribal grounds their home and their place of habitation. 
   So I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill and appreciate the hard work of Representative Kildee, Chairman Frank, and Chairwoman Waters in drafting a bill that begins to address these problems. 
   One of the things that I think is most important is the flexibility and self-determination that begins to work its way into the legislation. Washington has never been the right place to make decisions for either local, State, or tribal governments, and in this bill we begin to send more of that autonomy, to send more of the decision-making power back to the tribes, which I think is an excellent opportunity for them to begin to find their way to self-sufficiency. 
   We have had one of my good friends come and testify on the bill. That was the president of the Mescalero Apaches, Mark Chino, who came here during the Financial Services Committee's consideration of the bill and gave his insights on why the program is needed. And, again, I would just like to commend each one of the tribal leaders throughout not only New Mexico but throughout this country for really doing their job to begin to see that tribes deal with the problems that face them, not waiting for the Federal Government to come around and not waiting for BIA, not waiting for any of the agencies. And this bill, in its block grant program, begins to do that. 
   Another one of the significant things of this bill is that it allows tribes to take loans out, to incur indebtedness, to issue bonds in order to get infrastructure on the tribal grounds. I know that the Mescaleros do not have their own wastewater treatment facility. They instead work with the local communities of Ruidoso and Ruidoso Downs to deal with the wastewater treatment. But as tribes across the country are allowed to incur indebtedness for these solutions, then I think that is going to be extraordinarily important. 
   Some of the tribes have used their housing money, for instance, to go to FEMA where many of the trailers that were bought and put there for Hurricane Katrina victims ended up not being needed or used, and different tribes, which the Mescaleros were, I think, the first in the Nation to go take advantage of some of those trailers, move them into their native grounds. And it represents a significant improvement over what some of the families already had. So we are beginning to see those roots and those seeds of self-determination already make a difference in the lives of Native Americans. And with this reauthorization, we will be able to continue to see those seeds of local progress, local input becoming the way that we do business. 
   I support the bill and look forward to the discussion. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I would compliment the gentleman from Michigan for his work on this legislation. He has been tireless in his support of and the working of the legislation to get it to this point on the floor. 
   In my district we have several tribes, including Laguna, Acoma, Zuni, Mescalero, Isleta, the Ramah Navajo chapter, Tohajiilee Navajo chapter and the Alamo Navajo chapter, and each are faced with different difficulties. That's the reason that the flexibility is so important that is offered in this legislation. 
   Flexibility and autonomy are the beginning points, and accountability then is kind of the finishing point. Given the opportunity to solve their own problems, given the resources to solve their problems holds the tribes accountable. And I have not found one that finds this distressing in any way. 
   Too often I think that the Federal Government has been looked at as the caretaker of entire cultures, and literally that's not possible that the caretaker of the culture has to be the cultural members themselves. We see significant advances and capabilities in these areas. And, again, I am happy to be a part of this particular effort in this particular extension of flexibility and accountability.

   This is the same amendment that was offered to a freestanding piece of legislation that was offered in the Financial Services Committee. At that point, I commended the gentleman, Mr. Watt, for his work on justice, equality and fairness, and recognize that. I also favor loud and extremely clear messages, and this language is that. 
   My concern on the day that we accepted this amendment as a part of our freestanding bill was that the underlying bill addresses some of the most needy, most impoverished rural areas in our Nation, and I would just hate for some of those areas to be disadvantaged simply because they are caught in this particular fight. 
   There is pending litigation on the subject. And I wonder if it would not be better for us to let that litigation run its course. There is always opportunity for us, as a freestanding body, to come back and address this issue with legislation if it does not clear up in the court case. 
   So, again, I compliment the gentleman for the clear and concise message that he is delivering. I am not opposed to the message. In fact, I support the message of justice and fairness and equality, but would continue to wonder out loud if this is the proper vehicle.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment to H.R. 2786, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2007. While NAHASDA continues the great practice of giving tribes more flexibility to develop housing, I believe that we can do more. 
   We all know that economic development and infrastructure needs are acute in Indian Country. My amendment allows Native Americans to receive the same opportunity for economic development that States, cities and other units of local government across the United States enjoy without an increase in direct appropriations. 
   Representative Renzi from Arizona, a good friend, has similar stand-alone legislation, the Tribal Economic Development and Infrastructure Support Act of 2007. I appreciate his hard work on this important issue. 
   Currently, communities that receive direct funding from the Community Development Block Grant program may borrow or issue bonded debt for up to five times their actual CDBG allocation. This is the section 108 loan guarantee program and it encourages economic development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical development projects. 
   Title 6 of NAHASDA is similar to the section 108 statute and allows tribes to borrow or issue bonded debt up to five times their annual NAHASDA allocation for housing purposes only. The title VI program has been underutilized in part because the eligible projects are limited to low-income activities that do not generate sufficient income to pay back these loans.     
   My amendment gives to tribes the same access to vital economic and infrastructure resources that non-tribal communities currently use. 
   Specifically, my amendment authorizes a demonstration program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide for guarantees to loans for housing-related economic infrastructure and development on tribal lands. The demonstration project embodied in this bill will build not only better neighborhoods, but also build the economic infrastructure to support those communities, especially in our most rural and impoverished sections of America. The demonstration program is limited, so that at least half of the title VI program authority will remain exclusively for housing. 
   Also, in order to be approved by the Secretary, an applicant must demonstrate that 70 percent of the benefit of the proposed projects will go to the low-income Indian families on Indian reservations and other tribal areas.  This is similar to the CDBG program which requires that 70 percent of a project's benefit be for low- and moderate-income families. Nothing in this amendment changes the use of appropriated funds, but it will encourage private money from banks or bond investors to be used for economic development purposes. 
   In June, I visited the Pueblo of Zuni, where it rained and snowed, leaving standing, muddy water throughout the community. Most of the streets in the historic plaza do not have gutters to control water runoff, nor do the roofs of most houses have the gutters. The water began to flow and residents were literally surrounding their homes with bath towels to absorb the melting snow and to prevent their homes from being flooded. This is an example where NAHASDA dollars should be eligible for infrastructure to help these low-income families build gutters in their neighborhoods and protect their homes. 
   My amendment will help Native Americans build stronger, better communities all across America by encouraging economic development. I believe this is the right step to help Indian Country build and improve their communities. 
   I hope that you will join me in supporting this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding time and also thank Mr. Lantos. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have to ask ourselves exactly why would we be interested in this particular thing today. Some might claim that it's an old circumstance, that it existed too far in the past. Others might say that it simply is not our right, not our position, to enter into the discussion. 
   As far as it being too far in the past, many times I go into the district of New Mexico, the Second District of New Mexico, and I bump into people from the Vietnam era, people my age. I was there in the 1970s, I flew in Vietnam. Many, many have hearts broken by the way a Nation treated them, and just a word of encouragement, just a word of saying welcome home, brother, brings tears that flow down men and women's cheeks from long ago past. 
   We have a responsibility to impact those circumstances which were not right, which were not just, and no better person than Mr. Lantos to be talking about this today, because he understands that. He's a steady, quiet voice for reason. Regarding Ms. Lee, who is with us today, I would remember the words of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who said that the simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the entire world. 
   He went on in that same talk to say that one person of truth impacts the whole world. So I think that we are called to quietly visit with our friends, the Japanese, and I think they are very good friends. I think that we, as good friends, should quietly say, Friend, it's time to acknowledge; it's time to apologize; it's time to speak. Because the healing just doesn't occur on the recipient's part, on those persons who were wronged; the healing begins in the heart of those who have perpetrated the actions. Admission brings a certain humbleness that each one of us begins to recognize that we are not above righteousness, we are not above rightness, that we are not above justice, truth. No single one of us is. 
   So if we find ourselves at this curious point saying to a long-time trusted friend, It's time to acknowledge; it's time to apologize; it's time to recognize what we have done and to change, it's not a very harsh statement. It's not one taken in anger, but it is one taken with the noblest of objectives, and that is the recognition and the healing of a long-overdue act.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (SMALL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3067, the Small Public Housing Authority Act. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I represent a rural district where most of the Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) operate in small communities. These small PHAs face excessive paperwork requirements and outdated regulatory burdens which undermine their ability to provide affordable housing to underprivileged families. 
   Currently, all PHAs are required to submit both 5-year and annual plans to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD. However, these PHAs do not have the time, staff or resources to complete these annual plans and often have to hire expensive consultants to help complete these annual plans. 
   I am pleased that my friend, Mr. NEUGEBAUER from Texas, has taken the steps needed to alleviate this burden on small PHAs by introducing H.R. 3067, the Small PHA Act. This legislation will bring long needed regulatory relief to small PHAs by exempting those with 250 or fewer public housing units and Section 8 vouchers from the requirement of submitting an annual plan to HUD. 
   Today, I urge my colleagues to once again support regulatory relief for small PHAs by supporting H.R. 3067.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman from Utah and recognize the hard work of my friend from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva). 
   I think that we all agree patently that the underlying bill is not a problem. The problem is a very simple sentence that my friend from Utah would have included: no Federal funds may be used to condemn land, carry out the purposes of this act, or the amendment made by subsection B. It is a very simple amendment, one that is very clear. 
   One would have to ask: Are there circumstances where we would be concerned about confiscation? Is it a valid concern? Has it been done before? Is it a worry that land owners or property owners might have to fear that confiscation would actually reach in and take their property and wrestle it away from them? That is the essential question before us. 
   As the chairman of the Parks Subcommittee last year, we had the opportunity to listen to people along the Appalachian Trail. The Friars case was most prevalent. It is not the actual condemnation; it is the threat of condemnation that is the tool that is most often used; that we begin to persist from the Federal Government that we are going to take your land; that we can; that you need to just get along. So we have seen up and down the Appalachian Trail problems that come when land owners get in the way of a very strong central government. 
   A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to be in Shenandoah National Park. I was amazed at the boldness of the park superintendent there. The entire visitors center was filled with stories of exactly the same thing, where a too strong Federal Government came in and began to take people and move them off the land because they were just so inconvenient. These constitutional rights of private property ownership were so inconvenient that we simply confiscated their land and moved about 4,000 families out of that whole Shenandoah area. 
   Confiscation is a very real thing to people of New Mexico. The White Sands missile range extends for 100 miles north to south, 40 miles east to west. Ranch was confiscated because the Defense Department felt like it wanted to create a training base. Now, all of us in the area support the training base. We support that it is the largest overland missile training proving ground in the world. We are able to do magnificent things there. But we cannot turn a blind eye to the way that parcel of land was put together, by taking people and evicting them off their land. 
   Recently, I had the opportunity to stumble across one of the books that people in dire frustration write in their home. No major publisher would pick it up and do it. It wasn't very well written, maybe. But it was published on a small printer or maybe even one of the old copying machines that we used to have in high school, but it talked about 50 years of confiscation there in that one section of New Mexico. 
   So, yes, we do in this country face a problem of a too strong central government. I don't know if it is going to be a problem; Mr. Bishop alludes to the fact that we have land owners there who are expressing their concern of what is going to happen to them. None of us can say what any bureaucracy would do in the future. All we can do is offer the security of this one simple sentence: no Federal funds may be used to condemn land to carry out the purposes of this act or the amendments made by this subsection (b). 
   Now, there are those who completely oppose this kind of restriction. Recently, I volunteered to help with the Continental Divide Trail that runs north-south, through the United States. It starts at the Mexican border, goes all the way to the Canadian border, and runs all the way north to south through New Mexico. That trail was originated in 1978 language, but in the intervening years not one mile across private property had ever been gotten. I volunteered to take that task on, but the one reassurance people wanted was, don't let them come and take my land later. 
   I am sympathetic to the rights of private property owners. I think that we all should be, because private property ownership is at the heart of the success of our democracy and this Republic that we represent people in. Private property ownership is the basis of our Constitution. It is the basis of the economic way of life that we have in this country, and we should jealously guard it even to the point of putting in simple language like that that Mr. Bishop has suggested. It is not an unreasonable request. 
   And, no, it is not some scheme rigged up to make it look like someone didn't get their job done. It is simply the people out West, where 60 and 70 and 80 percent of our States are owned by Federal Governments. Those people out West have a different view than those people on the east coast where almost nothing is owned by the Federal or State government. And we out West say, please, just take the time to put in this one simple sentence, to take the precautions that would protect the constitutional rights and liberties of our residents. It is not an unreasonable request, and we simply ask that the bill be voted against because of that one provision that is missing. I thank the gentleman for yielding

What was offensive about this particular amendment that simply says no Federal funds may be used to condemn, and it just gets really clear, because again, those of us in the West, maybe we're overly sensitive, but so much land has been taken from us that it is, it is a point at which we begin to resist. Why wasn't that amendment simply agreed to?

   Mr. PEARCE. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. And if he would yield further, just point out that, again, we have had so many people come and testify about the Appalachian Trail that came through there, and I wouldn't call it systematic, but enough to where we began to feel, I began to feel uncomfortable with a too-strong National Park Service that was very energized about just getting this little parcel here, and it would make things fit so well that they began to really use their power in a way that was distressing. And that's, again, it's a very simply straightforward, transparent piece that is the problem. 
   We've got some magnificent vistas out West that might not equal what you're talking about, but we share our love for those things, and it's unfortunate that this bill is kind of the focal point for this particular dispute. But again, it's certainly nothing to do with the gentleman's underlying assumption or his belief that this river is worth protecting, but is instead one that we're expressing our concern as cleanly as we can that a government can be too strong and too large and too heavy-handed. And we worry about that. 
   But I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this legislation today. Many have stated it well, that discrimination is not the subject here tonight. It is the end of the statute of limitations which is at issue. 
   I would like to just make a point that often we're accused in Congress of appealing to the special interests, and I can't tell what the motivation is on this particular piece of legislation. It could have been narrowly scripted to where it applied only to the person that was being affected, to where the question of whether or not it applies to the full statute of limitations really would not even be a question.  
   I can tell you that on Thursday of last week we sat in the Resources Committee, and we heard testimony that talks about the Hard Rock Mining bill that is coming up to regulate Hard Rock Mining. There is a provision written by a former Clinton solicitor who is now working for a special interest group. That provision in that legislation we read says, ``Notwithstanding the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in High Country Citizens' Alliance v. Clarke,'' and then it goes on to say that all the decisions in court are going to be set aside, and we're going to allow this group to go back to court once more. 
   Keep in mind that the district court found against the group, then the appellate court found against the group, and finally, the Supreme Court said we will not hear the case. So all three levels of judicial review had been listened to and turned down, and yet this Congress, this majority, says we're going to set it aside. That was last week Thursday. 
   Last week Friday, we had the Imams case, the John Does. You will recall that how innocent people who report suspicious behavior would be taken to court. Three-quarters of this House voted against that, and yet the House's leadership found it necessary to strip the provision out in conference. That provision was stripped out, and that provision was added then only under great pressure from this country. 
   And now we're at this case. It would have been possible and could have been possible to narrowly craft this legislation to where the question did not come up. I feel that it is the special interests of the trial lawyers who in each case would have had open venue, open access to many millions of Americans which was at stake, and I feel that's what's like at stake here. 
   It is not good for American business. It is not good for American competitiveness. I'm deeply opposed to this legislation, and I thank the gentleman for yielding

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I would again say thanks to the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for their work on this issue and for the time that they are yielding. 
   I first became acquainted with Taiwan when I flew there. I was stationed in Southeast Asia in the military Air Force, and we had missions in and out of Taipei and other airfields, and I began to have a love for the Chinese people there in Taiwan. 
   After I came back to the United States, I met a good friend who had come from Taiwan and opened a small restaurant in my hometown of Hobbs, New Mexico. Joe Ye and his wife and their son have been long friends of our family. We have had many deep discussions about the future of Taiwan. 
   So it was with some alarm that I went to Beijing and heard meeting after meeting where the leadership of that country began to say that Taiwan needs to understand that they should voluntarily admit to being part of mainland China. And then the question arose, What if they don't voluntarily do that? The response was always a very unanimous, straightforward, Then we will do it for them militarily. 
   Those things began to alert me that we have in the future very difficult questions that we need to answer among ourselves here about our old friendships. If we do not have the internal strength, the internal courage, if we do not have the political will to stand by those countries that have stood by us, to remember those old friends from afar, then this Nation will indeed begin to undercut the basis of friendship for many countries, because each one of us is measured by how we live our lives and how we act. And our government, no less, is measured by the way it responds. If we respond to old friends by walking away, by turning our back, by not letting them come here to visit, it is one of the most insensible and insensitive things that we can do. 
   I really appreciate the work of both parties. Again, this is a good bipartisan  effort to express the sense of this Congress that we will remember our friendships and that we will honor those relationships, that we do understand the importance of the future and the past as we consider who we will spend our time with. And we as a Nation must understand that our government's actions are reflecting every day a value system. Those value systems should reflect what we, the American people, would have, not what seems politically correct or convenient at the moment. 
   That is not the way I want to be judged, and I don't think it is the way that people in this House want to be judged. I urge all Members to support this resolution to send a loud message to our friends in Taiwan that we do remember you and we do welcome you.

But financial and business pressures are of another magnitude if we cannot get the attention of Iran in any other way when we should exert every means possible, but beginning with business pressures, they are certainly ones that we should consider.

They said that Iran, late in the summer, was going to pass points in their nuclear program that could not be gone back past, that once they passed those, then they have the capability to strike. They expressed deep reservations and deep concern about the inactivity of the entire world and urged us to come back and do things. 
   It is, again, a very great bipartisan effort that we begin to ratchet the pressure up on the Iranian Government to say that you cannot act like this in the current world, it will just not be tolerated, and that the pressures will be extreme, we will increase those pressures.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the body tonight about what we are facing in this country as we experience higher gasoline prices, higher energy prices. Today there is an article that I will submit for the Record today: Dow Chemical announced it is going to cut jobs and close plants in the United States. 
   Dow Chemical To Cut Jobs and Close Plants  
   Dec. 5.--Dow Chemical Co. plans to cut 1,000 jobs and shutter a number of underperforming plants, saying it will put the savings into higher-growth opportunities. 
   The job cuts constitute about 2.3% of Dow's estimated 42,500 employees. The chemical company expects to incur a fourth-quarter charge of $500 million to $600 million, including costs for severance and asset write-downs. 
   The effort ``reflects our commitment to prune businesses that are not delivering appropriate value and tackle tasks more efficiently across the entire organization,'' Chief Executive Andrew N. Liveris said in a statement. 
   Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., has been struggling with higher prices for natural gas and oil, the main feedstock for chemicals, and lower prices for commodity chemicals, or the basic building blocks for more complex chemicals. Basic chemicals account for about 50% of the company's revenue. 
   To reduce its costs, the company has been actively moving its commodity-chemical production to places like Asia and the Middle East, where raw materials are cheaper. It has also worked with local companies in those regions to reduce the amount of money it has to invest. 
   The company also is trying to expand its specialty-chemical business, which is more profitable and less exposed to the ups and downs of energy markets. Dow has been widely expected to unveil a major joint venture or acquisition that would reduce its dependence on low-margin commodity chemicals. 
   The company pegged the annual savings from the moves at $180 million once complete. 
   Among the moves announced yesterday, Dow said it will exit the auto-sealers business in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and explore options for the business in Europe. The company will close an agricultural-sciences manufacturing plant in Lauterbourg, France.  
   Now, it's not that it is cutting those jobs in the United States and simply lowering its production worldwide. What it is doing is cutting jobs in America in order to make more competitive changes to the company and have those jobs overseas. 
   This is a significant thing that we on the Republican side have been talking about for the last several years. It is time for us as a Nation to fight the economic fight that we are faced with. We cannot continue to ignore what other nations are doing and what our energy costs are or we are going to continue to see headlines like this today with Dow Chemical cutting jobs and closing plants. 
   Now, we had a precursor to this earlier this year. Dow Chemical announced that it was going to build a plant in Saudi Arabia that cost $22 billion, an investment that large in Saudi Arabia, and meanwhile they are going to also start in China another plant for approximately $8 billion, and they knew at that point that they would begin this transfer of jobs. 
   Now, we have to ask ourselves is it because Dow Chemical is just a bad corporate partner? Maybe they are just after corporate greed. They're going to make profits at the expense of the United States, because that's what we have heard. We have heard on the House floor that corporations are evil, that they don't have the interests of the country at heart. 
   As we look at it a little bit closer, we recognize that in the United States just today the prices for natural gas are quoted at above the $8 range. We have at the same point, and natural gas is a very key component of Dow Chemical's products; in other words, about 50 percent of their costs, if I am not mistaken, come from their raw material costs, of which natural gas is the key component. So there is a direct correlation between the price of natural gas and jobs in this country. Now, when we are paying above $8 for natural gas, what are they paying in Saudi Arabia? In Saudi Arabia the price is today about 75 cents. So almost one tenth, one tenth the cost for 50 percent of their raw materials in Saudi Arabia versus here. 
   Now, you don't have to be schooled in economics. You simply have to understand that you are not going to Wal-Mart and pay ten times the cost for something you buy when you could go down the street and get it somewhere else. You go to buy and get the best deal. Companies have to have the same incentive. If Dow Chemical stays here and pays ten times more, ultimately they become noncompetitive in the world. Someone else will set up the plant in Saudi Arabia with one tenth the cost of raw materials, and the jobs will come away from Dow Chemical and go to another plant. So all that Dow Chemical is doing is saying we have competitive forces that cause us to consider this move. 
   We have done nothing in this Congress to dispel those costs, to drive  those costs lower. And, in fact, it is this Congress that is mandating the switch nationwide from coal production, coal-produced energy, to natural gas-produced energy. Now, that's fine except you must realize when we drive that demand up as a regulatory agency, as a government, that we drive the demand up and we say you are going to convert for clean air purposes from coal to natural gas, you have a great increase in demand. It is simply a supply and demand problem. So we have the outcome today. We are seeing Dow Chemical ship jobs overseas. 
   Now, we have to then look at what the Congress is doing. Speaker Pelosi announced very early on that it was her desire to make this country independent of foreign companies. I will tell you that what we are finding now, we see this particular chart, and this is for the summer of 2007 and moving forward, we see the predictions that we have a 23 percent estimated increase in prices in the northwestern part of the country; in the middle regions about 30 percent increase; 19 percent on the eastern seaboard; in Florida we are seeing 21 percent; Texas, 32 percent; California, 29 percent. Now, when you are seeing increasing prices, you would say that we as consumers are not seeing this energy independence. If we are, it's not a helpful thing to us, that, in fact, it is somewhat hurtful when we see energy prices and our home heating increase by that much. We are told these are the forecasts right now, so we are seeing the effects not only in jobs but also everyday costs. 
   We have passed two bills, one back in January, H.R. 6, and then we also passed H.R. 3221, and those were to deal with the problem of higher prices, and yet they still have not come back from the Senate. We still don't have an agreement. And I will say that in the early stages, the things that we saw pass off this House floor were actually penalties to energy independence. They tax American companies but they don't tax Hugo Chavez. 
   Now, we must at some point ask ourselves why we have a policy that would tax American companies and American jobs, would limit the supply so that the cost goes up and we lose jobs. Exactly why are we doing this as a country? Why are we suggesting passing policy off the floor that is causing this particular effect? Those are things that we as Americans should be asking, and we are asking, and yet we don't have a good, clear answer. 
   It appears to me, because I am not involved in the conference, the discussions between the House and the Senate, it appears to me that special-interest groups have dominated those discussions and have said we are going to tax those high-profit oil companies because they are making $100 per barrel of oil, or maybe today it is only $85, but it seems like there are strong forces out there that say we need to penalize and punish these American companies because, according to some, they are obviously doing things that are harmful. 
   I would say that the harmful effects are not to be found. The harmful effects are not there. They're not documented. The oil companies are simply price takers. Exxon cannot set the price of oil worldwide. They simply take the price that's offered to them. They have a large production. They are making quite a bit of money, but they have also got a large investment in the offshore rigs. They have got a large investment in onshore production, large transportation costs. Their costs are about the same as any company worldwide. But we are not taxing worldwide companies in each of the energy bills; we are only taxing American companies. And we have to ask ourselves why. Why are we driving the price of natural gas up, sending jobs overseas, and why are we taxing American companies and not taxing Hugo Chavez? 
   These are the questions that we are here tonight to talk about as we move very close to a discussion of what might be in the energy bill when we close this week. We were told at the beginning of the week we will have an energy bill this week; yet we have not seen it on our side. We have said that we are going to discuss it. Tomorrow is the last day of business for the week, to my knowledge, and yet we still don't have a printed copy, we on the Republican side, and I don't think many Democrats have seen a written bill. But we do have in front of us what has been done earlier this year. 
   I am joined tonight by a colleague from Pennsylvania, a classmate of mine, Congressman TIM MURPHY. He has concerns also about the direction that we are taking the energy policy in this country. We are facing worldwide competition, increasing pressure from the large states of China, India, the other competitive nations in the world, and at a time when we should be all looking outward and working, Democrats and Republicans alike, to protect the economic base of this country and understanding that energy is a key piece of the economic base of this country, that jobs are created around the cost of energy. At a time when we should be focused outward together, we instead have a, suggested policies that punish American producers, American oil and gas companies, and they give competitive advantage to other nations and other countries. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to talk about the nuclear, the coal, and the natural gas industries. He is from a coal-producing State and has good knowledge on these. 
   Again, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for his comments and recognize that we have a 15-year lead time before we build the first nuclear power plant. China is right now currently hiring our nuclear technology capability. They are hiring our people so that we first of all don't have young people going into the nuclear industry, those who are retiring are going to China because they have a commitment to build nuclear power plants. And as the gentleman said, we face a severe shortage of energy in the future. We are already giving up jobs. And we are doing nothing about it. 
   Now, I would like to show a difference in viewpoints. Up above the Speaker's dais is a quote by Daniel Webster. If I were to read that quote, it says, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' It begins, ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' Daniel Webster. 
   Can we do something great that our generation might be remembered for? Now, I would go also to a quote from earlier this year from the chairman of our Resources Committee. Now, keep in mind Daniel Webster said, ``Let's develop our resources,'' but the chairman of our Resources Committee this year says, ``I see no reason, no reason whatsoever why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product.'' I'm sorry, the gross national product is our capability to generate jobs. And contrasting with Daniel Webster who says, Let's do everything we can to build a great country. Let's build this dream of American exceptionalism and let's fight to have the hope and opportunity that we as a country have and let's use our resources to do it. 
   Contrast that to this year, this year's energy bill, ``No reason, no reason whatsoever, why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product.'' Just earlier this week, I authored an article in Human Events magazine. If you want to go online, pearce.house.gov. Be sure and spell it p-e-a-r-c-e. If you spell it p-i-e-r-c-e, there are things on the Web site that come up on that that your mother would not want you to see. We simply need to go and look at energy policy. If you go to pearce.house.gov and look at the Human Events article earlier this week, we talk about the energy bill that was passed out of the House by the chairman who says, ``No reason why public law should be linked to gross national product'' and what they did in that particular bill, H.R. 3221, was they cut off 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from Colorado's Roan Plateau.     
   They cut off 2 trillion barrels of oil from shale oil. That is in Colorado. This, by the way, is twice the reserves of all known reserves in the world. We could be the Saudi Arabia of oil if we would simply harness those resources down there Webster talks about, that shale oil in Colorado. 
   The bill, H.R. 3221, dramatically expands the environmental study requirements on existing oil and gas pads. This provision alone is expected to reduce or delay onshore natural gas supply by approximately 18 percent. So at a time when Dow Chemical is investing $22 billion in Saudi Arabia because their natural gas prices are one tenth of ours, we are limiting supply by another 18 percent by our bureaucratic and regulatory requirements. It just does not make sense. 
   There are breaches in the legitimate legal offshore energy contracts between companies and the U.S. Government, in much the same way as Hugo Chavez and Vladimir Putin might install. That is a quote from some of our friends at the Washington Post earlier this year writing about H.R. 6. 
   It cuts off 10 billion barrels of oil from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and it cuts off the government agency's communication for oil and gas permitting activities, as they currently do under law. 
   Now, these are things in the bill that supposedly are going to bring us energy independence. It is a bill that we oppose. We as Republicans and we as conservatives say that we must first take care of the opportunity for our young people to have jobs and careers. We first want to defend our economy against those foreign countries that would take our living standard, that would take our jobs. And yet we are passing a bill where the chairman says there is no reason, no reason whatsoever, why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product. I find that quote to be stunning. 
   One of the provisions in the bill that is suggested that might come up, again, the Democrats are saying, Nancy Pelosi is saying we are going to have an energy bill this week, and one of the provisions in that is a provision to require renewable fuel standards. 
   Now, that is well and good, until one looks more closely. That part of the renewable fuel standard is ethanol from cellulose fibers. Those are wood fibers. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Utah, a good friend of mine, Representative Bishop, who heads the National Parks Public Lands Subcommittee in the Resources Committee, is knowledgeable about national forests and about the opportunity that we have to help lower energy costs by using renewable fuels as the technology exists or does not exist today. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Utah.

   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman from Utah for his compelling arguments. 
   The situation is, again, there appears that there will be a requirement to produce ethanol from cellulose, which is a nice thing to think about. We have had testimony, though, that no technology exists to do that, and it could be 20 years before that technology exists. 
   Now, you would ask what are the circumstances in the bill that deal with this. What if there is no technology, but there is a requirement? That is fairly simple. There is up to $2 a gallon penalty, tax, fee, on the companies, the refiners, if they can't produce the minimum amount of ethanol from cellulose fibers. So, first of all, we are restricted from going into our national forests and stopping them from burning down. We have all seen the wildfires in San Diego and New Mexico. We had the Los Alamos fire back in 2000. We had the Kokopelli fire up near Ruidoso that burned 30-something houses. We have seen the devastating effects of wildfires in the West, and yet we are prohibited now by this law from going in and taking those fibers. One has to ask, where is the sense in that? Why are we doing that? I would say again, it is special interests, the extremists of the environmental movement who say we are not going to allow the Forest Service to cut one single tree. We are not going to allow any harvest. 
   We passed the healthy forest initiative back about 2004, and yet this is the way that we gut the bills. We can say on the one hand we passed the healthy forest initiative, and then we don't quite tell the people of the country that the healthy forest initiative will not be implemented. We won't keep our forests healthy because we are going to prevent anybody from using those materials out of them. So it is going to be a sheer cost, a cost to the government, where we could get someone to pay the government.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, now we should talk about the components of the bill that is suggested. Again, keep in mind that we are here talking about the future of the Nation. We are talking about the philosophical underpinning of where we are going in this country with our jobs, with our economy, with our future. This bill is at the basis, because the American economy is driven by affordable, cheap energy.     
   And what are we to say about the bill? We are having to speculate. We are told that it's coming up this week, either today or tomorrow. It's obvious that it's not coming up today. So one would say that it must come up tomorrow because we had that promise from the Speaker of the House. And yet we don't have the text of the bill that is dealing with our future as a Nation, our ability to make and create jobs, and we know nothing tonight so that we can not really talk in anything but speculative terms. But we feel fairly certain on those speculative terms because we have had leaks from behind those closed doors where this process is going on. 
   What are we to believe might be in that bill? First of all, there is going to be the renewable fuel standard, the RFS, renewable fuel standard, which says that we need to produce a certain amount of our energy, our gasoline, from ethanol. That is a worthy and acceptable thing if it's possible and if it doesn't stop us from implementing the Healthy Forests Act. 
   The second thing that is in the bill that we feel pretty certain about is that there will be some renewable portfolio. That is, we are suggesting that companies should produce electricity using renewable fuels. The only problem is that the suggestion up to now has been that they should produce 15 percent. Now, there's a delicate problem there because we have not yet seen the capability to produce from renewable fuels 15 percent. Again, one has to wonder about the penalty. Every major utility is against this provision because they know they cannot comply. 
   Every single one of us wishes that we were independent of Saudi Arabian oil and Hugo Chavez oil. But the truth is we are not. We made the wrong decisions 30 years ago, and the wrong decisions are causing us the problems that we have today. We did not make incentives in renewables 30 years ago. We made it harder to invest in nuclear power 30 years ago. Today, we are making it harder to invest in coal. We are requiring the conversion to natural gas, and that conversion to natural gas is pushing the price of natural gas up, which is causing Dow Chemical to say we are taking our jobs to where the price of gas is 75 cents, not over $8. It is a very simple process that we are engaged in. 
   So the bill, we think, is going to have a renewable fuel standard. It's going to have a renewable fuel standard that says we cannot take woody fibers out of our national forests, even when they are burning down, even when the trees are dead, even when they are at threat of burning down. There's going to be a renewable portfolio standard which says that you have to produce more energy than what is technically feasible right now in this country from renewable sources. 
   The next thing actually appears to be a good consensus from the auto industry on the CAFE standards. If the automakers say that we can hold American jobs and we can produce to those standards, again, we have not seen the exact standards, but if the automakers say we can keep American jobs, then that's one of the key pieces of the debate. 
   There is another thing in this energy bill that we are supposed to bring up tomorrow but yet haven't seen. But there is a component that we are assured is going to be there. That is $21 billion in taxes on American companies, $21 billion, and the truth is taxes are not paid by companies, taxes are passed along by companies. So that is $21 billion that is going to come out of the taxpayers' pocket. Every time you fill up with gas, $21 billion is going to come from the producer or from the taxpayer. It's going to the government and it's going to lower the capability for us to balance our personal budgets. So $21 billion in taxes in this bill that will be borne by consumers. 
   Now, the sad thing, and this is where you really must understand that there are elements of this tax provision that include a rollback of the section 199 manufacturers' deduction. That was a deduction that was passed in Congress back in 2004. It included oil and gas, but it was specifically there to encourage increased domestic production activities. We wanted to assure American jobs and we wanted to assure that American jobs were competitive with overseas countries, so we had a rollback in the 199 taxes. I'm sorry; we established the section 199 manufacturers' deduction but the bill that is coming before us, it has leaked out that it has a rollback in those incentives for producers. 
   Now, the difficult thing is that the rollback hits only the top five producers. It hits BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Shell. Now if you are listening like I am reading, you're wondering who got left out of the list. Who's not going to see a tax increase? Citgo. 
   Now Citgo is owned by Hugo Chavez. I do not know if it is by design, but I can say that according to the information that is out right now, there is going to be a rollback in deduction for the top five companies so that they pay more taxes, and we are not charging Hugo Chavez any more tax. One has to wonder about the value system that says don't charge Hugo Chavez tax but do charge Exxon, do charge ConocoPhillips, do charge Chevron/Texaco, do charge Shell and BP. 
   Now, what you have been led to believe, if you listen to the people on the left, they want you to believe that ExxonMobil is an evil entity; that they by themselves are driving the price of oil up that they might profit. When we look at a world assessment of size of companies, we realize the falseness of that argument. 
   Let's look at this chart which begins to look at countries and companies. Many countries own their oil companies. Saudi Arabia by far has the largest oil company, you can see. It has about 10.3 million barrels per day. You go to Iran. It has a very large oil company. The Iraqi National Oil Company is actually quite large. Qatar, Kuwait, Venezuela, ADNOC, Nigeria. You notice we are not even yet to ExxonMobil. 
   And yet HILLARY CLINTON says, I am going to take ExxonMobil's profits and spend them. Nancy Pelosi has said the same thing, We are going to take  ExxonMobil profits and spend them. We haven't taken yet any profits from any of these companies, and they dwarf, they dwarf ExxonMobil. We go all the way down to this far on the chart before we find the first privately owned company, ExxonMobil. 
   ExxonMobil is owned privately by you, the shareholders, the stockholders. You can buy it every day. ExxonMobil is going to be charged taxes. It's going to make them less competitive worldwide. We are going to do away with more jobs so that these companies, these state-owned companies might have an easier time to take our jobs. I wonder at the thought process that went into that. I wonder what compelled policymakers here, the Speaker of the House to say we are going to tax American consumers, we are going to tax American companies, and we are going to let Hugo Chavez, we are going to let Nigeria, we are going to let Kuwait, Saudi Arabia go. 
   We also have other considerations. In the bills that we have passed, the bills that we have passed out of this Congress so far about energy, we have done kind of sort of a tricky thing. There is much discussion about Enron. That was the large power company that became synonymous with tricky dealings, double dealings. 
   What did they do? One of the things they did in defrauding the consumer, one of the things they did in 
   defrauding the shareholders is that they did things called round-trip sales. If they needed their balance sheet to look better on a certain day, they would maybe buy or sell a lot of energy, maybe a specified amount of energy, and then they would simply buy it back, sell it to their own selves in a different company, and buy it and sell it, buy it and sell it, round trip, so that nobody was actually giving them money, but it looked like money coming in, and no one could ever see their balance sheet to see that they were actually paying out the money to themselves. It was coming in. The sales looked really good until some day you simply have to have the cash in hand. Those round-trip sales became synonymous with Enron and their double dealing. 
   But let's look at what this Congress, the new majority, who said they are going to do things in such an ethical fashion, let's look at what they have done. They have used the same taxes on offshore oil and gas in the gulf coast, the gulf region. They used those as on offset because we in Congress say we can't spend money without providing for it; the PAYGO provision. So they use those same taxes in H.R. 6, and, by the way, I am calling these the Enron tax provisions because they are kind of like those Enron round-trip sales, those ways of stating things so you have to check both sides of the ledger before you understand, but there's really not anything there. 
   So our friends on the other side of the aisle used those offshore taxes, those 1998/1999 leases to offset, to be the PAYGO in H.R. 6. They used it in H.R. 2419. H.R. 6 we passed back on January 18. H.R. 2419, we passed July 27. They used them again on August 4 in H.R. 3221. And they used them again in H.R. 3058, which still has only passed committee but yet has not passed the floor. 
   When we as policymakers begin to do round-trip sales, it's no wonder that we have the reputation that only 9 or 10 percent of the American public really trusts what we are doing. We are doing things that do not make sense for our economy. We are doing things that are creating a false illusion about our potential to pay for things that we are saying we are going to do. We are watching our jobs leave and go away, all because we in this country need affordable energy, and yet we are doing things that hurt the chances of providing affordable energy. 
   Again, the point that we object to in this coming bill, the energy bill we are talking about this week, are the renewable fuel standards that are not achievable and keep us from implementing the healthy forest initiative so that we don't burn down our forests. It's objectionable that a renewable portfolio standard is being set that we cannot reach. It's objectionable that we are raising taxes by $21 billion to American consumers. It's objectionable that we are using a tax that is going to be punitive to American companies but will not tax foreign oil companies, will not tax Hugo Chavez. At the end of the day we have to ask ourselves exactly why. Why is it that this majority is taking these stances that harm Americans so much? I don't know an answer to that.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, let it be clear, an overwhelming majority of the members of this House, including this member, strongly support extending the Wind and Solar tax credits. These credits will help begin new investments to create new jobs, establish new industries in this country and eventually create more energy for America. 
   However, in order to pay for these new investments, this bill will kill thousands of current manufacturing jobs by raising taxes and giving foreign companies a competitive advantage. 
   Are we willing to sacrifice jobs Americans have right now for the promise or opportunity for future jobs? I would say that we don't have to make that choice. Yet, the Majority clearly believes that is the only choice before us. 
   Instead of the massive new tax increases in this bill, we could open up development 44 miles off the coast of Florida beside the Chinese companies working with the Cuban government to drill 46 miles off the coast of Florida. 
   We could open up new opportunities off the coast of California where new rigs could drill for oil and serve as new platforms for generating renewable wind and tidal energy. 
   We could lease more areas in Alaska, where a sale last month generated $2.6 billion in revenues for America in lease sales and will generate tens of billions in royalties in the years to come. 
   If our goal is to reduce our dependence on foreign energy, this bill fails to accomplish that. I would rhetorically ask the Chairman how much of a tax increase in this bill is on oil companies based in Venezuela or Iran? The answer is none. How much of the tax increases in this bill fall on American companies working in Artesia or Farmington, New Mexico? One hundred percent. 
   We don't have to choose promoting new industries by destroying old industries. This is a case where we could have it all, new energy development and more energy development, unfortunately the Speaker wont let us make that choice.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Thank you, Mr. King. I appreciate the work that you're doing on this issue on the eve of 9/11. 
   It behooves us all to remember exactly what happened. It behooves us all to remember the loss of that 1 day, and like my friend from Georgia says, over $2 trillion in loss from America's asset base that day, and even worse, the 3,000 lives that were lost. 
   I went to Iraq on Thursday evening. We left after votes on Thursday, flew all night long, and ended up in Iraq on Saturday and Sunday. And we spent the night in Baghdad on Saturday night and Sunday visiting with the troops and visiting with Iraqis. 
   I was struck by the cautious optimism that General Petraeus related to us today, a very cautious optimism that the trend lines are favorable, that we're seeing some lessening of violence, and that's the sort of things that I found there from the troops in the country. I wanted to visit with our soldiers one on one. I had the opportunity to ride into Baghdad with troops who were going for the first time. I sat across from a Captain Serrano from Chicago and was able to talk to her about the 2-year-old daughter that waits at home for her. Her husband,  who is engaged in going through sheriff's training to hopefully work for the sheriff's department there. And we're asking the sacrifice of young men and women daily to be there and stand in the gap to stand between the terrorists and ourselves. 
   I have one of my friends who says, I hear America is at war. He said, America is not at war, America is at the mall, our military is at war. I think if we've made a mistake since 9/11, it's in failing to accept our responsibility individually, every single one of us, our responsibility to be engaged in this problem, because we are literally fighting for the future of freedom throughout the world. The terrorists who hate us hate our way of life. They hate our freedoms. They hate the films that come out from the West. They think they're corrupting their young people. They think that our society is decadent and that we're corrupting their cultures, so they simply want to annihilate us. That's the difference between a democracy or a republic and the tyrannical states of radical jihad that say that we will annihilate the West and we will annihilate America and Americans. 
   I remember, on this eve of 9/11, President Bush's three goals. It was very simple. He said, first of all, if you harbor a terrorist, you are a terrorist. But then he said we're going to do three things: We're going to uproot the terrorist training camps that exist throughout the Arab world. We're going to stop the training and the production of new radicals. The second thing he said is we're going to stop the funds that flow from supposedly legitimate compassionate organizations when actually they're funding terrorists. So we're going to uproot the training camps, we're going to stop the funding of terrorists, and finally, we're going to take the fight to the terrorists. 
   Now, there are many on the left who say that Iraq is not about the terrorists. The terrorists are coming in from Syria, they're coming in from around the world, they're coming in from Iran. This is the site where we are fighting terrorists. Now, maybe it began that way, maybe it didn't begin that way, but it's the way it is now. And if we walk away from that country, the general consensus is that Iraq will fall within days to the terrorists, to the terrorist state of Iran. 
   After Iraq falls, we're going to see difficulties in Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar. And pretty soon you can see that every one of our friends in the Arab world is at risk. And there are people who ask me, well, how could those countries fall? Just remember back to 1979 when the shah of Iran was making great progress in westernizing that country, and in a matter of days was thrown from power, his whole government collapsed. We stood by, President Jimmy Carter stood by and did not lift a finger for our friends. And that's exactly how the falls will occur at this state. 
   The difference is that now we import over 60 percent of our oil, and most of it comes from the Middle East. If those countries fall, the terrorists have said they're going to cut the supply of oil off to the world. They will plunge the world economy into chaos. And that's how they're going to create the economic destruction of the United States and of the West. 
   I went to Israel earlier this year. They said if you leave Iraq, you will allow us to fall, because they saw the same scenario that I'm repeating, that all of our friends in the Middle East will fall, and then ultimately Israel says ``we will fall.'' Now, my personal belief is that Israel is our first line of defense against terrorists. They've been fighting since their inception against radical jihads in the Middle East. They are our first line of defense, and if they fall, what calamity and what terrors await for us in this country? There are many who say that it's just a fabrication, that it's not true, and yet we see the signs all around us. 
   As I visited with our troops in Iraq over this past weekend, I conveyed one message, that we thank you. We thank you for your service and we thank you for your sacrifice. We thank you for serving your country honorably, and we thank you for serving your country well. As the gentleman from Iowa mentioned, this is one of the messages of General Petraeus, that this may be the best military the United States has ever had. 
   I do not believe the terrorists can win. I do believe that there are those in this Congress and those in this country who can cause this magnificent military to fail. And if they fail, I don't know where the hope for humanity comes. I don't see any other country in the world willing to fight for freedom and to fight to resist the radical jihad that threatens us all; to fight to resist and to fight to retaliate from circumstances like 9/11/01. 
   So that's what we're doing today is remembering those events 6 years ago, remembering what our responses were and what our anger was on that evening as we contemplated the events of the day. Both sides, Democrat or Republican, in those days were of the same mind, that we need to get to the terrorists before they get to us. I'm not sure where we came off of the rails and where we've lost so much consensus. It's not good for the United States and it's not good for the world because we're still in a very difficult circumstance fighting a very difficult battle, one that General Petraeus today said is going to be awfully hard. 
   It's going to be a long struggle, and it's a struggle that will be up and down. He believes our young military men and women are sufficient to the task. I do also. So I would yield back to the gentleman from Iowa by saying thanks to our troops. I hope that we all keep them in our thoughts and prayers. 
   God bless you to the troops, and God bless America. I thank the gentleman from Iowa.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the chairman for his work on this bill and rise in opposition against that bill. There are no Third World countries. There are simply overregulated countries; there are overregulated economies. The debate that Members of this House are about to engage in will be passionate because the positions that we are fighting over are polarizing. 
   Mr. Chairman, it did not have to be this way. We all agree on the same principles, hardrock mining on Federal land should pay a royalty, should continue to operate in the most environmentally responsible manner in the world, and protect the health and financial security of the miners who bring the world's minerals to the surface. 
   As I mentioned earlier, if given a fair hearing, we would have agreed on these goals. Instead, right now at this moment the stock market is plunging in this country because of the rising energy prices. Oil hit $94. Our stock market is reacting. The price of our dollar has fallen. We are doing things in this body that will punish domestic jobs and domestic industries. They will not touch the mining industry outside of this country. Outside countries will have better access to our markets because of the things that are occurring in this legislation. 
   So, yes, we are passionate about our position, and, no, we do not listen to the arguments, no matter how well-conceived from the other side, because they are simply arguments; they are not truths. We are here to fight against a bill brought forth by the chairman which will send some of the highest paying jobs in the West overseas by making mining in the U.S. uneconomic.  
   Members from western States, like mine, will fight fiercely to keep these jobs because the West cannot survive off tourism alone. 
   I have a chart here that shows the relative wages in the mining industry. We have had hearings about the evolving West and what they hope the West looks like, but we in the West want these good, high-paying union jobs that exist now in the mines. The jobs in tourism do not pay nearly as much. That is what we are fighting for today. 
   By making mining in the U.S. uneconomic, the chairman's bill will give competitive advantage to countries like China and India. We Members who like the U.S. being number one and who don't like the current value of the dollar are fighting against that. I favor American exceptionalism. 
   By making mining in the U.S. uneconomic, the chairman's bill will compromise the readiness of our military because the military will have to further import the strategic minerals and materials it needs from hostile nations. It would be a sick twist of fate if the U.S. had to start importing uranium from Iran. 
   In order to defend the bill against job loss, the economic security and military security, you are going to hear some rhetoric that simply amounts to whoppers, the whoppers about the 1872 mining law on the House floor today, and I think it is important to set the record straight. 
   First, you will hear the law was passed in 1872, and at 135 years old it needs modernizing. I wonder where the chairman is when it comes time to modernize Yellowstone National Park, which was also created in that same year. But I will tell you that the chairman would be the first to argue against any changes in the acts that created our national parks, and Yellowstone in particular. Maybe the leaders back then believed that we needed to protect areas, but we also needed to use some of our lands to supply the materials for a growing Nation, because they understood we needed those materials. Maybe our politicians of today do not care if America's economy grows or not. 
   Secondly, you will hear that the law allows public lands to be purchased for $2.50 an acre, the ``price of a snack,'' I think were the words that were used. And yet I do not see any of our people in this Chamber or across the Nation standing up to say let me have some of that land for $2.50 an acre. Because the truth is that you have to mine that land to get it for $2.50 an acre. Maybe it is just not that easy to prove up on the mineral assets, on the mineral claims, as the chairman caused us to believe here. 
   Third, you will hear that energy companies pay 12 percent or more in royalties for coal, oil and gas on Federal lands; mineral mining companies don't. 
   Now, that seems fair, doesn't it? But you have to understand that many of our energy companies also tried to buy mining claims and tried to do mining, and they gave up on it because they simply could not do it. They did not have the economics right. They didn't understand how to do it. And no more than you and I can buy a claim for $2.50 and make a mining claim work, even our biggest oil companies could not do it. And these are the kinds of misinformation points that we are asked to believe today on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   I tell you, please, my friends, do not believe it, because we are about to export these jobs, these good high-paying jobs. We are going to export jobs. 
   Fourth, you are going to hear that the Mining Law needs modern environmental laws. The mining industry today is well regulated. The mining industry itself, the BLM, the regulatory agencies used to have mines that looked like this top chart; and this mine under current law, under current environmental regulations, has now looked like this. We had testimony to this in our committee, but the majority just decided that they didn't need to listen to what is going on already. They wanted to create new overlapping legislation. 
   Currently, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and all other Federal regulations apply to the mining industry. But you would believe, if you heard our friends on the other side of the aisle, that we are simply out here digging holes in the ground and we are polluting the streams with no oversight. It is just not true. 
   So, my friends, as we engage in this argument, listen to the passion from the West, because you will know that our jobs are at stake, our livelihoods are at stake. There are people who want to make the West simply the vacation ground for the rest of the country. And I am saying from the West, we just want jobs, good jobs. We want not only jobs, but careers for our families. We want careers for our kids. And the legislation today here is designed to take away the careers from the West. 
   Look at it very carefully, because today the stock market is plunging amid fears of high energy prices and unavailable access, no access to drilling lands to increase the supply; and our dollar is falling because the world believes that we are going to give away our economy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, my good friend from California said we want to get the facts right; and if I heard him correctly, he said this bill is a work in progress. Now, we've had 135 years, according to him, to work on this bill, and we're going to rush it while it is still in progress. I really don't understand why we're going to take such a serious step as risking all the jobs in mines with work in progress. I think those were the words used and the facts used. 
   The truth is we have a severe difference of opinion. I will quote from the chairman of the committee: No reason, no reason whatsoever why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product. That was in our markup hearing, and yet I would submit that energy production, timber production, water production, mineral production, they all affect the gross domestic product, and they are public land law. 
   So I really just believe that we have a complete disconnect in the committee between the majority and minority.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, in order to, again, stick with facts that I think one of my colleagues mentioned we should, I would note that when we just heard the comment that no fees or dollars were taken from the mining industry, actually, $55 million was paid in claim maintenance fees. 
   But if we are to have this discussion about what effect this royalty is going to have, I think we should look at other circumstances. Again, these facts were presented in committee, in the committee hearings, but, somehow they did not get integrated into the bill, the knowledge, and again, it's the reason that we are passionate here on the floor about our points of view. 
   We had testimony from British Columbia that instituted a 2.5 percent royalty. Now we are looking at an 8 percent, almost three times as much. 
   Now, if, as our opponents claim, there is no effect, that we can expect nothing, then you would think nothing happened in British Columbia. Yet, after they instituted, in 1 year, 1 year, revenues from the mines didn't increase because of this royalty; it decreased from 28 to 15, almost a 50 percent decrease. 
   Exploration, likewise, fell dramatically from 38 to 15, far more than a 50 percent drop. That was in 1 year. The tax was repealed the next year because they found out exactly what we are claiming, that jobs were lost, 6,000 jobs were lost in 1 year. In 1972, the number of claims fell by 85 percent. 
   So when our opponents say there is not going to be any effect here, it's only right, we are asking them to pay the same amount that you pay for a snack at the grocery store. British Columbia did one-third of the tax that we are proposing. British Columbia found that they had to undo the tax because it was so destructive to the industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, again, just sticking with the facts, we had one of my colleagues talk about fluorspar, that's what's used to make toothpaste, as if there were no strategic minerals; yet when I look at the list of imported minerals, I see that we import 72 percent of titanium, which is used in jet aircraft, fighter jet aircraft, 72 percent. 
   I think when we are discussing these facts, we should be talking about the critical facts, as I am sure that the gentleman was correct that we do import fluorspar, and it probably is used on toothpaste, but we probably should be talking about the domestic security, about the security of our Nation, about the willingness of our industry and the capability of our industry to provide the instruments to defend this country. 
   We are at a time when terrorists are trying to overcome us, al Qaeda, radical jihad. The terrorists are trying every way they can, and we are going to put the source of critical minerals that are necessary for our Nation's offense outside the Nation's borders. It simply doesn't make sense. It actually does feel like a work in progress. It feels like we should have done more.

   Mr. PEARCE. I have no additional speakers. I will close if the gentleman is ready to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I look on the walls of this Chamber, I see the quote by Daniel Webster up above the Speaker's chair, and it says: ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' 
   Worthy to be remembered. I think our Founding Fathers had it right. They visualized a nation of tremendous promise, where the wealth of the Nation and the protection of the Nation would come together in the production of its resources and in the taking care of its land. 
   I don't find it unusual at all that the same generation protected Yellowstone and yet gave us the capability to create these mines, which take billions of dollars to promote and to produce. I don't find that unusual at all. 
   But what I do find unusual is that our friends on the other side of the aisle are not listening to their own testimony coming in their own hearings. We heard testimony from both Democrat and Republican witnesses alike saying 8 percent royalties are unprecedented. They are damaging, destructive, they will hurt. Those are the things that we heard in the committee. 
   I would suggest that we send this work in progress back to the committee and finish our work before we try to change 135-year-old policy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I include a letter for the Record from Governor Palin of Alaska, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association, and others, all in opposition to the legislation proposed here.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually quite simple. It deletes the new definition for ``undue degradation.'' 
   H.R. 2262 changes the current standard contained in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act from unnecessary and undue degradation to just undue degradation, which is defined to mean ``irreparable harm to significant, cultural or environmental resources on public lands that cannot be effectively managed.'' 
   The new definition is dramatically different from the existing regulatory definition of unnecessary and undue. Under current law, unnecessary and undue degradation means impacts greater than those that would normally be expected from an activity being accomplished in compliance with current standards and regulations based on sound practices, including use of the best reasonable and available technology. 
   The definition now in this H.R. 2262 reinstates a Clinton-era change to regulations governing hardrock mining on Federal lands that was rescinded in 2001 after a very open, public review of the Clinton regulatory scheme. 
   The Clinton-era definition for undue degradation was specifically rejected. It was rejected by the Bureau of Land Management Environmental Impact Statement that reviewed the Clinton regulations and declared it to be too vague and too subjective. The BLM EIS process included scoping for the EIS, which included a formal 81-day comment period and 19 public meetings in 12 cities; placing the proposed regulations, draft EIS and related documents on BLM's Internet Web site; and finally, two public comment periods for the EIS, including 29 public hearings in 16 cities. 
   After this very thorough process, the BLM found that this definition was, essentially, an opportunity for the Secretary of the Interior to deny a mining company an operating permit, even though the proposed mining operation  would be in full compliance with Federal and State laws govern hardrock mining. This is what some people refer to as the ``mine veto.'' 
   The BLM found that the requirement to avoid irreparable harm to significant resources values which cannot be effectively mitigated has the greatest potential for affecting mining activities, both large and small. In some cases this provision could preclude operations altogether. 
   The Clinton-era regulations were spearheaded by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and Solicitor John Leshy. During the Elko, Nevada, field hearings this past summer, majority leader, Senator HARRY REID, made the following statements regarding the outcome of the changes to the regulation: ``Bruce Babbitt is a friend of mine. But for the mining he was awful.'' That's what HARRY REID said this year. It was in one of the hearings that we've referred to today.     
   ``He had people there that--John Leshy ..... He tried to destroy mining. Really ..... he didn't believe in it. He wanted it gone. And that created uncertainty.'' 
   This new definition for ``undue regulation'' is a lawyer's dream creating ambiguity fighting about whether we mine instead of how we mine. We don't need more litigation; we need more common sense. 
   This definition brings so much uncertainty to the regulatory process that we will see a further decline in investments and the exploration and development of our domestic mineral resources. And there is a potential when mines that are in production today transition into the new system outlined in title III or are in the permitting process to expand their operations that those operations could be denied a license to operate, leaving billions of dollars of infrastructure idle. 
   I can guarantee you that the coal industry, which has played such an important role in the economic well-being of the chairman's district, would not be able to operate under this definition. 
   This definition alone will drive more companies offshore, making us more dependent on foreign sources of mineral resources and adversely impacting the economic vitality of mining-dependent communities in the West, like Silver City, New Mexico. 
   Keep in mind that the mining industry pays the highest nonsupervisory wages in the country. It provides benefits including health care, retirement programs, college scholarships, and assistance for employees and their families. Tourism and recreation jobs cannot compete with these high-paying family-wage jobs. 
   I would urge you to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, keeping the current standard, protecting American jobs and access to domestic mineral resources. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. 
   Again, speaking today, we are wondering if the bill that we are talking about has an effect in all districts. And I would say we have a chart here which shows that rising commodity prices are driving people to stealing copper, stealing our minerals, and it is occurring in many of the districts, including the gentlewoman's district in California, where there has been a prosecution. And we have got 80 of these. We have a chart, but I won't show that. 
   The concept of cleaning up abandoned mine lands is one that we are deeply encouraged by and associate ourselves with, and especially as it affects watersheds. Nowhere are watersheds more important than in the West, and especially New Mexico, because so little water exists throughout the West. Anything we can do to clean up watersheds in general, but, again, the abandoned mine lands is something that we are very supportive of from this side. It relates back to the comments that we have made in our opening statement that I don't think that on the core issues that we are very far apart at all, that we could have gotten where we all would agree with the bill. So we would accept the amendment and congratulate the gentlewoman for her work on this in abandoned mine lands and watersheds in general. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to start talking about first what this amendment is not. First of all, it is not a cost increase. CBO has said there will be no cost associated with it. Also, it is not an effort to reestablish the Bureau of Mines at the Department of the Interior. Congress abolished the Bureau of Mines before I came to Congress; but a key component of that agency, the Minerals Information Team, was entrusted to the U.S. Geological Service. Unfortunately, USGS has not recognized the critical nature of this program or the importance of the information the MIT produces. 
   Today, at USGS, the Mineral Commodity Function is five steps below the USGS Director, and eight steps below the Secretary of the Interior. In contrast, the Energy Information Administrator is only one step below the Secretary of Energy. At DOI Minerals Information, it's just about like being a janitor; you have about that much access into the system. 
   The Resource Origin and Commodity Knowledge, ROCK, Act, takes the mineral commodity information function away from USGS and creates and funds a stand-alone agency using DOI resources. It restores and funds the function Congress sought to retain and protect in 1995. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that we did get into the discussion of the CBO here and the additional cost that would be implemented under this act. The underlying act actually has been scored at $441 million by CBO over 5 years, almost $100 million a year. I share the gentleman's concern about increasing expenditures, increasing bureaucracy, and would again request that we reconsider the  entire thing. But at the moment I would suggest that we do want to realize that two recent National Research Council reports stress that we are increasingly dependent on foreign nations for minerals critical to America and that we need to have an independent agency as called for in this ROCK Act amendment. 
   My amendment will establish the independent Minerals Commodity Information Administration and the Minerals Information Team to collect, analyze and disseminate information on the domestic and international supply of and demand for minerals, materials critical to the U.S. economy, and our national security. 
   U.S. businesses operate in a global economy, and virtually every manufacturing sector from aviation to textiles relies on the unbiased, comprehensive data reported by the MIT. This information enables American companies to use domestic resources effectively, forecast worldwide market conditions, develop informed strategic business plans, and respond effectively to short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in minerals prices, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, this is an honest, straightforward and commonsense motion which should be accepted unanimously. Its acceptance would help restore America's confidence in this body. 
   This motion addresses two issues Americans expect their elected representatives to address. Americans want more alternative energy sources so we are not dependent on people who hate us for our energy supplies. Americans want to make sure that their government does not take actions which destroy American jobs. The supporters of this bill promise it will not hurt jobs. My motion guarantees it will not hurt jobs. 
   They constantly promise that they want more clean energy to reduce our dependence on foreign supplies. My motion guarantees this clean energy. 
   Much of the controversy about this bill is about the importance of minerals and the jobs they support. Some say the bill will cost the kind of jobs this country needs and leave us begging other nations for the minerals necessary to produce cleaner energy right here at home. Others argue that it doesn't. My amendment resolves that question. 
   If adopted, my motion would ensure that the government is not taxing American production of important minerals used for solar power and nuclear power. 
   That makes sense. The government should not be taxing our efforts to produce more clean domestic energy. The last thing that we need to do is become more dependent on others for energy sources we plan to use to get off of dangerous foreign energy supplies. That's just common sense. 
   Secondly, my motion applies the ``first, do no harm'' standard to this bill as it relates to jobs. 
   As we have said here today, minerals mining jobs are the best nonsupervisory jobs available in the country today, according to government reports. This motion says that the government has to certify that this bill will not cost American jobs before it goes into effect. That's the least this country can do for working Americans, make sure that we don't lose their jobs because of our actions. 
   The supporters of this bill say it will not cost jobs. This gives them a chance to vote to ensure that it doesn't. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard today on the House floor that this is a work in progress, that H.R. 2262 is a work in progress. I am saying that the Nation's security depends on our good work today and we should not submit a work in progress to the other Chamber. I hope that the supporters of this bill will take this olive branch and guarantee jobs to Americans, not just make more promises to Americans. 
   We have heard promises this bill won't hurt jobs; this motion guarantees it. We hear promises about more clean energy to reduce our dependence on foreign supplies. This motion guarantees it. 
   My motion turns a promise into a legal guarantee. I urge its adoption by all Members of the Chamber. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for working with me on this motion to recommit that we are offering today. I believe that we are going to make this legislation much better. 
   Ever since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have been telling the American people that they should immediately report any suspicious activity. This important step is one of the best ways that we have to stop terrorism. In essence, the public is the eyes and ears for the security of the Nation. 
   Sadly, a lawsuit has been filed in Minnesota which named as defendants the Americans who were simply trying to protect themselves and their country. These everyday people have now found themselves subject to a lawsuit for simply reporting what they thought in good faith was suspicious activity. 
   We are in grave danger when terrorists and their sympathizers use our freedoms against us. Terrorists have abused our Nation's immigration system, our foreign student travel visa opportunities, and open society's freedom to travel. 
   On 9/11 the hijackers knew how the crew on the plane would respond and used that knowledge against the air crews to carry out their deadly attacks. 
   Now, we have imams who behaved in methods similar to those 9/11 terrorists and are now using our courts to terrorize the Americans who reported the behavior. They used a seating pattern that was similar to the 9/11 attackers. They asked for seatbelt extensions, and then didn't use them but laid them at their feet in an ominous gesture of disrespect. They did not sit in assigned seats. The loud criticism of President Bush and the war all added together to create a mood of uncertainty among passengers who were watching them.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to support H.R. 1980, the Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act of 2007, and would like to compliment the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) for his work on this and also Chairwoman Waters for bringing this important initiative for rural communities to the floor today.  
   This legislation recognizes the work of the Housing Assistance Council in providing housing opportunities for low-income families in rural communities, and most of the Second District is rural communities in New Mexico. There are many others across this country, but we feel the direct impact in New Mexico. 
   Although HAC has received funding through HUD appropriations since the early 1980s, the program has never been authorized. This bill would formally authorize assistance councils, which is important to ensure the continued success of the program and long-term goal of aiding individuals in low-income housing. 
   The Housing Assistance Council is unique in nature and the only nonprofit designed to help improve rural housing. HAC should be particularly praised for its work on self-help housing initiatives, which promote personal stability and financial responsibility for low-income housing. 
   Again I want to thank my colleagues for acknowledging the Housing Assistance Council's important contribution to affordable housing for rural communities, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. PEARCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1982, the Rural Housing and Economic Development Improvement Act of 2007. RHED is designed to provide grants to Indian tribes, State housing finance agencies, State community or economic development agencies, local nonprofit organizations and community development corporations. 
   H.R. 1982 was introduced in response to the administration's budget proposals for the fiscal year 2008, which zeros out the RHED program by consolidating it into the Community Development Block Grant program, CDBG. 
   This shows a continuing promise by the administration to more effectively manage its grant programs. However, preserving the one remaining outreach in HUD to rural communities is critical in helping our most impoverished citizens. 
   The Second District of New Mexico, which I represent, is one of America's most rural districts, and it is critical that Congress provide our rural citizens with the proper access to safe, affordable housing. For example, in the town of Columbus, New Mexico, near the Mexican border, there are citizens who have no running water in their homes. They must bring a pail to the center of town in order to get water for their families. Many times these individuals are overlooked because of geography, and we must protect their rights. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Hinojosa for recognizing the need for safe housing in rural communities like those in southern New Mexico. The need for this kind of program is great in the Second District, and I am grateful to assist in seeing that Congress is coming to the aid of the neediest families in rural areas. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Protecting our homeland requires diligence, resolve and common sense, and I salute my colleagues who drafted the bill. However, since we had no process in committee to discuss or amend the bill, we are simply left with asking rhetorical questions here on the floor. 
   We were told earlier that for $30 to $40 per container we were going to secure America. I hold in front of me my passport. I am about to get that renewed. Every 10 years we do that, and it is going to cost $82. I will tell you that we had secure communications, secure briefings in homeland security, how they cannot secure even our passports for $82, yet we are going to secure containers that are coming from the Middle East full of oil; we are going to secure containers full of vegetables; and we are not going to interrupt commerce. 
   We cannot even count on some of our friends to protect the intellectual property rights on compact discs, and yet we are going to trust them to offer the security of this Nation. 
   These are the questions that should have come up in committee. These are the questions that should come up today. These are the questions that are being ignored, and we are being asked to look the other way and declare the Nation safer. 
   I join with my colleagues in saying it is awfully important for us to make the Nation safe. The way we do that is to prosecute the war on terror, to take the will away from those people who would strike this country, to ensure that intelligence will provide us with the resources and the application of the resources to the areas of greatest threat. We cannot secure containers for $30 apiece when we can't secure the passport for $82.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   I did make my living in oil and gas. I never owned one oil and gas well; but I will tell you, we went down holes. We were plumbers, and we fixed the oil wells and so I have seen the cost and difficulty of producing energy from a very close point of view. My wife and I employed 50 people in a small company that simply repaired oil weapons. 
   Reasonable people can have different points of view, but I have watched the trajectory of the Democrat energy bills, first H.R. 6, the energy bill that came through our Resources Committee and now this Interior Appropriations. And I will tell you that from my point of view, the Democratic energy agenda is anti-American energy. It insists that we import more. It is going to send more jobs to China and it is going to make life harder for Americans. 
   The motion to recommit simply says let's have the secretary certify. If you reasonably believe that I am wrong about my assumptions, we are going to send this back to the secretary to certify that nothing in this bill will reduce the amount of domestic energy or result in increased imports. I think if you believe in your bill, you should not be afraid to cause that review by the secretary and that certification that we are going to protect consumers. Because every one of us hear from consumers every day, our constituents, that the price of gasoline is too high. It is too high because of the policies that we in America, we in this American government have caused. 
   Section 115 is a very simple section. It is the only research and development section for ultra-deep oil. I can tell you that the deeper you go, the more expensive oil is to get. And it is not for the big companies, it is for the small companies that can't have research and development. The only research and development money that is available for small companies is in section 115. It has been taken out of every other section. 
   Shale oil is title VI. Shale oil is two times all the reserves of oil and gas in the entire world. Two times. It would make us self-sufficient, and yet we are removing shale oil. 
   My friends, these are the reasons that I believe the policies that are being promoted are anti-American and pro-import, will send jobs to China, and will make life harder for Americans. 
   The Washington Post, in review of the very first shot of this Democrat energy agenda, H.R. 6, The Washington Post said, ``This is something Hugo Chavez would be proud of.'' 
   My friends, we are not on a track to make life easier for Americans; we are on a track to make life very difficult for the American economy and the American consumer.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   After a year of negotiations with the Senate, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2786, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and appreciate the hard work of Representative Kildee, Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Waters, our colleague on the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Watt, and Senators SHELBY, MURKOWSKI and DORGAN for their diligence and efforts in the other Chamber. 
   Over the last year, we have worked hard to come together and maintain Native American self-determination. I am pleased to have before us a piece of legislation that provides immediate solutions to Native American housing needs and includes important reforms to improve the authorization under NAHASDA. 
   I firmly believe the tribes are best equipped to understand the needs of their communities. They know where the worst housing and infrastructure and economic disparities lie. Over the past 12 years, NAHASDA has made tribal housing programs more flexible and given tribes the ability to rely far less on the Federal Government. My constituents who live on reservations and in pueblos tell me that this flexibility is working. H.R. 2786 will give tribes even more flexibility and autonomy to carry on their housing programs. 
   The legislation before us improves NAHASDA by streamlining oversight and allowing tribes to exercise greater discretion over a portion of their grant moneys for affordable housing activities. 
   Additionally, while this bill contains the practice of giving tribes more flexibility to develop housing and manage their housing programs, we need to continue to look ahead to address critical infrastructure and economic development needs. 
   I am pleased that this bill preserves my demonstration program which was included in the House-passed version last September. My program will make NAHASDA dollars go even farther. The demonstration program gives the tribes the same opportunities for economic development that States, cities and other units of local government across the United States already enjoy. 
   Currently, communities that receive direct funding from the Community Development Block Grant Program, the CDBG program, may borrow or issue bonded debt for up to five times their annual CDBG allocations. This is the section 108 loan guarantee program, and it encourages economic development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities and large-scale physical development projects. 
   Title VI of NAHASDA is similar to the section 108 statute and allows tribes to borrow or issue bonded debt up to five times their annual NAHASDA allocation for housing purposes. Unfortunately, the title VI program has been underutilized in part because the eligible projects are limited to low-income activities that do not generate sufficient income to pay back these loans. The demonstration program in H.R. 2786 fixes this by simply mirroring title VI activities to those activities allowed under the section 108 statute. 
   My economic and infrastructure development program also ensures that those who truly need economic support will get it first. I have done this by requiring applicants to show that 70 percent of the benefit of the proposed project will go to low income Indian families on Indian reservations and other tribal areas. 
   Our rural and severely impoverished areas greatly benefit from the loan guarantee program. These rural areas often lack basic infrastructure, and many times the only catalyst to encourage private companies to invest in  poorer communities comes only after a poor rural area has received one of these CDBG loans. 
   Harmonizing CDBG activities with title VI under NAHASDA will have a lasting impression on tribal economic development. Better yet, it will help employ and educate the lowest income individuals in the Indian community. 
   NAHASDA isn't about big government offering handouts to Indian Country. It is about handing up in order to maintain that special relationship the Federal Government shares with the tribes. It is about making sure Indian Country has the tools they need for a brighter future. It is about creating jobs and opportunities for Indian Country, and it is about ensuring and preserving the Native American way of life. 
   The NAHASDA reauthorization is critical to addressing Native American housing needs. Tribes need additional flexibility and autonomy to use Indian Housing Block Grant dollars efficiently and in a manner that makes the most sense for tribal members' specific housing projects. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you can see, the reauthorization of this program is critical to addressing Native American housing needs in New Mexico and across the United States. I would urge all of my colleagues to adopt and support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join the many people who have come to the floor tonight to talk about National Bible Week. 
   My earliest memories are of Mom reading the Bible to us six children. We grew up basically in the oil field, in the very low income strata of the oil field. My dad was a roustabout. My parents gave us those values of faith, family and freedom from the earliest age. And when my wife observes the truism that she read recently of the hand that rocks the cradle steadies the Nation, it applies in my particular life. 
   I've been a Christian from an early age, and so it was about 10 years ago that my wife observed that, you know, we profess to be Christians but we don't necessarily read the Bible every day, we don't have a discipline, and we began at that point to do that. 
   Now, my daughter says it best, that what we find written in the words in the Bible give context. They give us a way to perceive. It's a perception that we gain. 
   I would like to share a couple of things that stay with me constantly. One is in Micah, Micah, the sixth chapter, where the question comes up rhetorically, when we have done wrong, what should we do? And the writer asks: With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with 10,000 rivers of oil? Shall I offer my first born for my transgressions, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? And then we get the answer from the writer. 
   He has showed you a man that is good and what does the Lord require of you? To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. 
   This kind of a verse calms me down when things are urgent, when things are chaotic, and when I'm out of step. 
   Another significant verse is in Psalms 11. When, again, we have fears, the Psalms 11 addresses that. It's actually written by David, and he asks: How can you say to me flee like a bird to your mountain, for, look, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright and heart. 
   And the significant question then comes: When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do? 
   The answer is given almost immediately: The Lord is in his holy temple, for the Lord is righteous, he loves justice. Upright men will see his face. 
   Again, we are not so consumed by the fears of the moment, by the perils of the circumstance. 
   We have a bipartisan group; it's called the Congressional Prayer Caucus. I was one of the people who helped found that group. We meet every Monday night in the context that we meet under to pray for the Nation comes from Second Chronicles 7:14: If my people who are called by My name will humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will I forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
   Now, these words are spoken to those people who believe. It's not necessarily an instruction to those who don't share the belief, but simply a truism. 
   Today one of the deepest pleasures that I get is doing the same thing Mom did with me. I see my two grandchildren, Preston and Olivia, and were able to read the Bible with them in the mornings. They both are intent, listening, one 6, one 3. My daughter trains them daily. Again, I am remembering, the hand that rocks the cradle steadies the Nation. 
   I give thanks for those people who are dedicated to a belief system. I appreciate my belief system. I know there are others that other people rely on. But, for me, this Christian belief, this belief in Jesus Christ has been what has saved me.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2419, FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and it is always imperative that we discuss issues that are brought forward. 
   Members of Congress often point to other countries who abridge treaties, who abridge contracts of our companies working in those countries, and they claim foul. Recently Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil industry and the electricity and oil companies. Yet the people who work for oil companies that are U.S. oil companies trying to push back that takeover were told why shouldn't we do that, your own government is doing it; we have the right. 
   They are referring to the language that is in this bill that affects the offshore leases, the '98-'99 leases. The Washington Post described the actions that were taken back on H.R. 6, which are very similar to these actions, as ``heavy handed.'' The stability of contracts, this heavy-handed approach, an attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia, Bolivia, and others have been criticized for tearing up revenue-sharing agreements with private energy companies. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are doing things that affect oil companies and energy prices to Americans. I oppose this rule because it violates the rule of law.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. I commend the Chairman of the Science Subcommittee for bringing this legislation forward. 
   Last year under the Republican Majority, the House passed this same legislation as part of a more comprehensive bill offered by the gentlelady from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert. This legislation, called the ``Alternative Energy Research and Development Act,'' died in the Senate. But it's never too late to take bipartisan action on good ideas. 
   Reducing America's dependence upon foreign oil is an economic and national security  imperative. Achieving this goal requires us to exercise creativity and common sense. In particular, we must find ways to expand our use of biofuels in a safe and cost-efficient manner. 
   H.R. 547 provides very specific mechanisms to address the challenge of integrating ethanol and biodiesel fuels into our petroleum-based transportation system. In particular, this bill directs the EPA and the NIST to mitigate the harmful effects caused by the physical and chemical incompatibility of these fuels within the current infrastructure. H.R. 547 also tackles the quality concerns associated with Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and biofuel production. 
   As the Ranking member on the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee I remain committed to working with my colleagues across the aisle to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil. In contrast to H.R. 6, the regrettable measure the House passed a few weeks ago that increases our dependence on foreign oil, this bill constitutes a productive step forward--and I look forward to supporting other measures like it.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   Every year, over half a million people are sold into slavery and transported across international borders worldwide. Of those, more than 15,000 are brought into the United States. These individuals are sold into horrible living conditions which most often include forced labor and sexual slavery for many young girls and women. 
   The inhumane practice of involuntary servitude and sexual slavery must be stopped in the United States and victims should have proper protection from their captors. This deplorable treatment of human beings is intolerable. The idea of forced slavery is one which most Americans would find repugnant but unfortunately, it is all too often a reality. 
   Congressional action on this matter is woefully deficient. We must recognize the importance of stopping, monitoring, and capturing individuals as they illegally enter the United States. Fighting human trafficking at the borders would limit the trade of sex slaves in America as well as combat terror, crime and drugs to preserve American safety and quality of life. 
   Recent news reports have stated that Al Qaeda has been using our vast and poorly defended Southwestern borders to smuggle enemy combatants into the U.S. 
   Congress must find a way to stop smuggling of human beings across our borders. We must find a way to stop involuntary servitude and sexual slavery worldwide and we must find a way to help all people understand that America is the beacon of light and freedom that we all know it to be. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 3887) will help us stop this terrible trade, give victims the ability to be free and face their accusers, and help America shine our light around the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her yielding and for her work on the issue and thank the majority party for their work. We're involved in a very serious discussion here. 
   I was in the Air Force in 1970, in Reese Air Force Base in Texas in pilot training, and the Shah of Iran's son was in the class right behind me. I didn't know much about the Shah of Iran, coming from Hobbs, New Mexico, but we began to watch and began to visualize as he left training, and those Iranians who were in the training class with me left and went back home to Iran, what their life was like flying jets in the Middle East. And then in 1979, the Shah was suddenly out of power, just like that. The ayatollah came to power and instituted a tremendous repressive regime that continues to this day. 
   Now, the question that our friends on the other side of the aisle fail to ask is what is their plan to see that our friends in the Middle East have stability because, in fact, they're balancing the terrorists in their own countries every day. They're balancing them using our force and our will and our promise to help. 
   So what do our friends in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, what do they do? When I went to Israel earlier this year, Israel simply said they fall. If you leave Iraq, those nations fall. 
   Now, it's an uncomfortable truth, but somehow we're not going to talk about some uncomfortable truth these days. It's an uncomfortable truth that the entire Middle East is facing a problem of stability. If the entire Middle East faces a problem with stability, the entire world has a problem of stability because, if the Middle East exports about 25 to 30 percent of the world's oil, which it does, then the world oil market becomes destabilized, the world economy becomes destabilized, and in the end, the terrorists win because they have destabilized the world rather than defeat any of the forces in the world. That's been their long-term plan, to export instability, and they have been doing a very good job of it. 
   Now, the President after 9/11 said we're going to fight a war on terror that simply does three things: we're going to take away the training camps, we're going to choke off their funding, and we're going to take the fight to them. Now, you can agree or disagree that Iraq is a place of combat with the terrorists, but it looks like to me that the terrorists from all over the world are coming in there. Iran is providing terrorists and weapons, Syria, other nations; and so whether or not it appears that the war is there, our soldiers believe that they're actually fighting al Qaeda. 
   So the President's plan has definitely uprooted the training camps. We've begun to squeeze off the funding to the al Qaeda troops, to the terrorists worldwide, and we have taken the fight to them. But now then, when we retreat, when we come home, the question that has failed to be asked by our friends who have this resolution calling our troops home, it fails to ask what do we do for world stability at that point. It is a serious omission. It's not accidental. 
   I appreciate the gentlelady for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are told today that it's time to refocus on the war on terror. Yet as I read this bill, and I would encourage each one of you to go online and read H.R. 2956, I see no refocus on the war on terror. 
   I see nothing in H.R. 2956 which describes the threat from radical jihad. I see no plan. 
   We are told that we need to communicate with the White House, that we need to send a bold message to the President. I am sorry, he's right down the street. It's the people who are causing terror, worldwide terror, that the communication needs to be sent to. 
   Now, I can't tell you exactly what our troops are feeling as we debate these measures. 
   I can tell you that I was in Vietnam flying missions in Vietnam at the time that Jane Fonda gave aid and comfort to our enemy, and a time that this Congress was withdrawing support from that war. And I can tell you what soldiers at that time felt. They felt dismay. They felt betrayal. They felt like we had been led down a path. 
   If this were really an attempt by our majority party to deal with the situation that they are concerned about, it should have an immediate withdrawal date. But it lacks that because it's a political tool rather than an attempt to refocus on the war on terror. 
   I can tell you that it does not ask key questions, key questions like, how will unilateral withdrawal prevent al Qaeda, Hezbollah and other terrorist operatives already in Iraq from establishing robust training facilities from which to plan and execute additional strikes against the United States? 
   It fails to answer the question that both Israel and Jordan have asked when they said that unilateral withdrawal, much like the Democrats' plan, would have a devastating consequence on their countries and the region as a whole. 
   What impact will our unilateral withdrawal from Iraq have on the safety of regional allies, such as Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait? Those questions go unasked and unaddressed in H.R. 2956, because this is not a plan to refocus the war on terror. This is a plan to withdraw and hope that we can retreat home without anyone following us. 
   It just won't happen that way. The terrorists will come with us as we retreat. 
   I urge defeat of H.R. 2956.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi and gentleman from New York (Mr. King) for their work for homeland security because it is truly a bipartisan issue. It was my privilege to serve on the committee with both of them in a previous Congress, and I miss that service during this current Congress. 
   I rise today to compliment the majority for yielding to the will, the will of the American people, because the provision that does protect John Does from lawsuits was curiously stripped out of the conference report previously. I'm pleased, though, that today's final conference report includes those provisions protecting John Does from lawsuits for reporting suspicious activity. 
   In March, Mr. King and I teamed up as the House passed the sense of my Protecting Americans Fighting Terrorism Act as the motion to recommit to the Rail and Transportation Security Act, H.R. 1401, by a 304-121 margin. Again, that was 304 ``yeses'' to 121 ``noes.'' 
   Today, we finally adopt and send this provision, along with this bill, to the President, something that is not only a right step but a critical step. 
   This provision will make America safer, will make Americans more aware  of terrorist activity and will show the terrorists that we are standing strong in the war on terror. 
   Ever since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have been telling the American people that they should immediately report suspicious activity that they see. Citizens are on the front line of our domestic war on terror. Our Founding Fathers declared eternal vigilance be the price of liberty. 
   It was Brian Morgenstern, an alert American, who stopped the Fort Dix terrorists by speaking up and reporting what he saw on videotapes. 
   It was an alert ambulance crew in June who noticed the Haymarket car bomb in London, England. However, terrorists and their supervisors are trying to use our freedoms against us. 
   On 9/11, the hijackers knew how the crew on the plane would respond and used that knowledge against them to carry out their attacks. Last November, 6 imams who behaved in manners and methods similar to those 9/11 terrorists were reported to authorities. Now, those six imams are using our courts to terrorize the Americans who reported their behavior. 
   The John Doe provision in this act will simply help stop this terrible shakedown of alert and responsible Americans. If we are serious about fighting terrorism, if we are serious about protecting Americans and asking them to help protect each other, then we need to pass the provision that is in this bill today. 
   I know most Americans were shocked to know that this simple, commonsense issue became an issue of partisan sniping. We should have never had to fight over this provision. 
   Today, we're going to make a choice. The Israelis said it best, There's no room in the world for political correctness. Today, we're going to make that choice, choosing political correctness or securing the American people. We will tell the trial lawyers you cannot terrorize Americans in our courts. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this conference report. I thank the gentlemen both for their work.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this stay-the-course resolution, because it is, indeed, a stay the course. It says, blithely, that we support the troops, the troops are in Iraq, they are fighting. We support the fight. 
   We do not, on the other hand, support an escalation, which would be another course of action, nor do we present the other alternative that says bring them home. We can bring them home, increase or stay the course, and so this stay-the-course resolution is one that is very curious indeed today. 
   The last two speakers that I have heard say that there is no good military action left. That is a credible viewpoint. It is one that is expressed, and yet I ask my friends why did you not have the courage to simply say, if there are no goodwill alternatives left for the military, then bring them home. That is fair and adequate. 
   I have also heard that it is a misguided conflict. I have also heard that our soldiers' work is done. If their work is done, please have the courage to bring them home. 
   I want to speak today on behalf of our soldiers, the soldiers of today. I will do it while remembering the soldiers of yesterday. Through no fault of my own, I served in the Air Force during the Vietnam conflict. I say through no fault of my own, because I was not a volunteer. I got there because I drew a very low draft number. As time has proved, it was going to be the only lottery that I am going to win, but that lottery gave me a free pilot's certificate and sent me to Vietnam to fly in 1971, 1972 and parts of 1973. 
   I was in Vietnam during the time that Jane Fonda made her trip to the North, giving aid and comfort to the enemy. I was in Vietnam during the time that there were demonstrations in the streets back home. I was there during the time that our soldiers were cursed at and spit on. Today, as I beat around the back dusty roads of New Mexico, I encounter those same soldiers that I encountered back then. For those soldiers who are my age, who are on walkers, life has been difficult. 
   There is a common greeting for soldiers of that era. It is welcome home, brother, or welcome home, sister, because they were never thanked for their duty and they were never welcomed home with parades with yellow ribbons. We were snuck back into the country. 
   I have brought a couple of photos to help us remember, to remember the people who were trying to get out of Saigon, not just Americans, but those people who had sided with us. They are crawling up the ladder trying to get into the helicopter. The helicopters proceeded out to carriers, then the helicopters were pushed off the side of the carriers. This is the way we left Vietnam. 
   I bring this up because I am beginning to see the same thing today. My colleague yesterday spoke of this resolution and mentioned that the resolution was vague, where people of very different beliefs could believe that it represented them. If you support the war, you believe that it supports your position. If you are opposed, you will somehow believe that this is the one step that is going to stop us. 
   Yet it really does nothing, the vague language, that clever language points out, this is not a time for cleverness, it is a time for decision, because I will be a constant voice for our soldiers. I read and I hear the comments today. 
   I read when Chrissie Hynde says, ``Let's get rid of all the economic (expletive) this country represents! Bring it on. I hope the Muslims win!'' 
   I hear from the left, William Arkin, ``Those soldiers should be grateful that the American public ..... do still offer their support to them, and their respect ..... 
   ``So we pay the soldiers a decent wage, take care of their families, provide them with housing and medical care and vast social support systems and ship obscene amenities into the war zone for them, we support them in every possible way, and their attitude is that we should in addition roll over and play dead.''     
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle, I do not discount their intent, but I know what they are trying to do. They are doing the same thing that was done in Vietnam: they are trying to feed that hungry tiger that lives on the left, that hates the American way of life, that hates the American military, that will do anything to discredit, disrespect, and discount the service of our soldiers. 
   My friends, you will not be able to appease the left with this toothless resolution that you are presenting. You know that your own Members, some of your Members, have called for defunding; but defunding is going to allow the exit that looks like this, and it is going to allow the mass catastrophe, the mass killings that are going to occur, and that is all part of the problem. 
   But before you allow your friends, who would never vote for me, who disrespect our soldiers so much, before you empower them and before you encourage them, I would recommend that you think carefully about just cleanly bringing our soldiers home. 
   If you are going to do nothing in the resolution, you have an obligation to do no harm. This resolution does no harm. This resolution empowers our enemy, encourages our enemy, and encourages people who are going to disrespect our soldiers. I recommend a vote against the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PEARCE. (WASHINGTON-ROCHAMBEAU REVOLUTIONARY ROUTE NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, America is faced with an energy crisis today, and solutions have not been forthcoming under the current Speaker of the House or her leadership. The majority has failed in its effort to take any meaningful action to increase the domestic supply of energy for the American people. In a State like New Mexico, a very moderate income State, probably $25 to $30,000 a year is the average income, we find that the price of $4 gasoline is very difficult. 
   Last week in a story in the Albuquerque Journal, Associated Press talked about a young woman with cancer who was being treated almost 200 miles from her home. The family had to suspend visits by her young children to visit her because of the price of gasoline. Each day we're finding these sorts of impairments in our daily living while the majority simply says, we're in favor of energy. 
   I was listening with interest to the previous speaker, the gentleman from New York, and I would invite him to sign on a letter that we will be producing today that would go from the Speaker of the House to mention to President Bush about those 68 million acres of land that are not being used. Let's remove, first of all, the regulatory burdens that are stopping that land from being used and produced. In Utah alone, almost 1 million acres by one office which is 7 years overdue in putting out the land management plan that would allow people to move ahead. 
   Those are some of the acres that are moved from production that our friends talk about as if the greedy oil companies are sitting out here purposefully withholding production knowing that at all-time record highs, every company is producing every amount of oil and gas that they can get to, and they simply kind of twist the facts around. 
   So I would invite the gentleman to sign on to that letter indicating his willingness to press the President of the United States to push the BLM into getting these regulations out the door. 
   I would also be interested to see if the majority would recognize with us their failure in December by removing all shale oil from production. With one simple sentence in a bill in December, the majority removed almost 2 trillion barrels of shale oil from production, and again it tells me that maybe we have words on the House floor that differ from the words that are actually created in the votes. 
   I would also welcome our friends on the other side of the aisle to change their votes on the wilderness areas that removed over 100,000 acres from production because wilderness stops all development of oil and gas. And so again, I find some difference in the words that we hear on the House floor and the words that are actually put into place by law when we vote. 
   Additionally, there is a moratorium that limits 85 percent. We're told that the majority doesn't mind offshore production at all. Then go with us, sign a letter, and let's start producing just around the area, just in that spot where Cuba and China are drilling 47 miles off the coast of Florida. We have prohibited it ourselves through a moratorium in producing this oil and gas. 
   So I would ask the leaders of the majority party to go with me and sign on to this letter to take that one spot and let's allow American oil companies to produce where we're allowing the Chinese to produce within our Outer Continental Shelf area. 
   My amendment today to this House bill 1286 simply says that as we create this new trail system, we would like an accounting for all of the energy assets that are going to be affected by this bill. It's a very simple amendment. 
   The majority has, in fact, got a statement in the bill that says nothing will hinder, but too often we find that we do not know what has been hindered and what has not been hindered. So our amendment is very simple. Let's just get a report from the Secretary of Interior to tell us exactly what the stakes are, which resources might be limited, which might be hindered, and it's a very straightforward amendment. 
   I would appreciate if the majority would understand the reasons for this because we see every day that the American people are paying the price for the majority's opinion on energy. The opinion is that $4 gasoline is not too high, that in fact $4 gasoline will cause maybe a change within which we conduct our business; we ought to be converting to other forms of energy. The problem is we don't have wind cars, we don't have solar cars, we have no nuclear cars. America is on an oil and gas economy. We drive oil and gas cars, and as long as we limit the supply, we're going to drive the price higher. 
   It's not American consumption. American consumption actually has remained quite stable for the last 10 years. It's actually Chinese consumption. It's consumption from those developing countries around the globe that are pushing the price of oil higher. 
   Now, I did note with interest the comments that the majority party had done something for fuel efficiency. Actually, the majority party did nothing for fuel efficiency. 
   I ask for support for the amendment.
