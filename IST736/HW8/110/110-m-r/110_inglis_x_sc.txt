<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the ranking member for your work on this bill. 
   Two weeks ago the House passed the H-Prize Act of 2007. The H-Prize was overwhelmingly supported here in the House with a vote of 408-8, and last year 416-6. The H-Prize is a nonbureaucratic way for government to achieve its goal of harnessing America's entrepreneurial spirit to tackle our energy challenges. The best part is, if no one wins the government doesn't have to pay. 
   We need $6 million, Mr. Chairman, to fund the H-Prize at its inception. Of that amount, $1 million would be used to fund a prize for advancements in components or systems related to hydrogen storage, $4 million would be used to fund a prize for development of prototypes of hydrogen-powered vehicles or other hydrogen-based products, and $1 million would be used for administration of the prize competitions. 
   The Secretary of Energy was granted authorization for creating prizes in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The H-Prize gives structure to this prize authority in accordance with recommendations from industry, academia, government and venture capitalists. 
   I would ask the chairman if he would work with Mr. Lipinski, the gentleman from Illinois, and me to provide funding for the H-Prize as we move forward in conference with the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I thank the gentlelady. 
   I rise with the support of several Members of this amendment. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the gentlelady from California (Ms. Harman), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and I are offering an amendment that would require that light bulbs purchased in the Leg Branch appropriations would comply with the ENERGY STAR and Federal Energy Management Program identifications. The idea here is to save some money easily and to save a lot of energy, and of course energy is money. 
   Most Americans are still using, and most of the light bulbs in my house are incandescent bulbs that Thomas Edison invented more than 100 years ago. But only 10 percent of the energy of those light bulbs turns out to be light; 90 percent is wasted as heat. So we've got something better. And like many, I'm switching to CFLs. Those lights provide much more efficient lighting. And it's amazing to think that if every American just switched one incandescent bulb to an energy-efficient alternative, we would collectively save more than $8 billion in energy costs, prevent the burning of 300 billion pounds of coal, and remove 2 million cars' worth of greenhouse gas emissions from our atmosphere.  
   This small step in this amendment is part of something else that Mr. Lipinski and I are working on, which is a Bulb Replacement in Government and High Efficiency Technology, BRIGHT we call it, Energy Savings Act, along with Representative Harman, that would require GSA to replace burned out light bulbs with more efficient options like compact fluorescent lighting. 
   The BRIGHT Act has 82 cosponsors, and we look forward to its adoption. This amendment is a good step toward that goal. 
   Madam Chair, I am happy to yield to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Harman).

   In the meantime, we're improving the bulbs, making us more energy efficient here in the Capitol, and hopefully throughout these appropriations bills in this season.

   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I think that, as Ms. Harman just pointed out and as the Chair of the committee has pointed out, there are some issues involving the aesthetics. You've got to choose the right light bulb, that's for sure. We've heard some discussion this morning about how they glow moon glow, or whatever. Well, if you pick the wrong kind, they do glow moon glow. I've got some in my garage, and it's a really freaky kind of look in there. But I've got some in the house that look yellow and nice. 
   So you've got to pick the right bulbs. And of course in the historical context we have to pick the right bulbs. And we do have to deal with the recycling of these. Just like we don't have a sufficient program for recycling lead batteries around, we toss those in the trash, we have a problem with the mercury in these. But we can get there. We start by saving an awful lot of money and a lot of energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. (H-PRIZE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) for his work on a number of energy initiatives that we're collaborating on. This is one of those. I think it's a very exciting bill that won't solve all of our challenges, but it will get us down the road toward a brighter energy future. 
   And it's always helpful to have a picture tell a thousand words. This is a picture of a gas line in a province in China on August 17, 2005. That's a line of cars waiting to buy gas. 
   ExxonMobil tells us the global energy demand is expected to grow by 60 percent between now and 2030. So we've got to find something to do in order to get to a brighter energy future, one that does not involve the restricted supply that we have when it comes to petroleum. So what we've come up with is an idea of using the incentives of a prize to make it happen, to make some breakthroughs happen when it comes to hydrogen. 
   Well, the good news is we've done prizes before. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh won a prize for being the first to make a successful transatlantic flight. It worked with flight, and it worked again here more recently when the Ansari X-Prize was created to incentivize space flight. On October 4, 2004, Burt Rutan's Spaceship 1 became the first private spacecraft with commercial potential, succeeding in going into space twice within 2 weeks; and the result was they won the Ansari X-Prize. 
   So the concept here is to build on that kind of legacy and create the H-Prize. The good news for our colleagues is this shouldn't be a terribly controversial vote. The last time we did it, we got 416 votes in favor of the H-Prize. So it's a do-over with a 416-6 margin last time. So we're hoping that it's going to be successful here today on the floor. 
   As my colleague from Illinois just said, Mr. Lipinski was telling us that the concept is to incentivize breakthroughs in hydrogen technology; and, as he said, technical breakthroughs would be rewarded with a $1 million prize and then prototypes every other year, $4 million. And then the transformational technology prize, the big one, would be a $10 million prize, hopefully augmented by up to $40 million of private money that's authorized under the bill. 
   So the concept is to, basically, create the most nongovernmental way to achieve a governmental purpose, which is to break this dependence on oil. So we've created the H-Prize. It's a way of incentivizing entrepreneurs and inventors to come together and to create teams that can make this breakthrough. 
   The beauty of a prize, two beauties of the prizes to point out here to our colleagues, one is, if nobody does it, you don't pay the prize money out, so they've got to win it in order for us to incur the obligation to pay the money out. That's a good thing about prizes. 
   The second thing that's very important about prizes is the breakthroughs may come from way outside the normal realm that you would expect; and it could be that it's not the normal people or the normal suspects that might come forward with a breakthrough. It may be somebody way afield. 
   For example, hydrogen breakthroughs may come from biological agents that create hydrogen as part of their metabolism. That's way outside the field of where a lot of people are expecting hydrogen production to come from. But if you have a prize that isn't restricted as to how you create the hydrogen, then you get a lot more entrants, and you get interest from a broad range of fields that may come in with the out-of-the-box thinking that can transform our energy supply. 
   So I'm very pleased that we've got it on the floor today. I thank the gentleman from Illinois once again for his collaboration on these topics. I'm hopeful that today we'll pass it with a large margin and that we'll be successful with the other body and then a signature by the President, and this will be one of the ways that we can break this addiction to oil and move to a more stable energy future for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of challenging news stories about the economy, and we in upstate South Carolina have had some of those experiences ourselves. It is worth celebrating some of the successes. 
   On March 10, BMW announced an additional $750 million expenditure at their Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant, bringing their total investment to $4.2 billion. They will add 500 employees to the 6,300 already there and 1,500 employee jobs will be added among the suppliers. Those suppliers, by the way, have invested $2.1 billion in South Carolina and have 12,000 employees. 
   It is very exciting to have this kind of news. It is also exciting to see the technology that BMW plans to employ in Spartanburg. They are going to bring clean diesel for the first time to the United States. It is going to be in the brand new X-6, all of which will be made in Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
   That car will also get 30 miles per gallon. Frank-Peter Arndt, their board member, explained that even at 125 miles an hour on the autobahn, the X-6 with the deep clean diesel will get 30 miles per gallon. It is a wonderful success worth celebrating.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 59, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
   It is particularly helpful to have people from all walks of life in this body. It is especially helpful to have Mr. Lipinski as an engineer here, along with some other engineers, to cause us to focus on the crucial need for engineering education in this country. 
   My dad is an engineer. He lost this son to political science and the law. Not everybody can be an engineer. But the folks that can be engineers really will help us solve the challenges of the future. 
   Here is our challenge in terms of numbers: India is graduating somewhere north of 200,000 engineers a year; China is graduating nearly 300,000 engineers a year; and the United States is somewhere in the order of magnitude of 60,000 engineers a year. That doesn't bode well for us. 
   In a technological world, we need more engineers. We need people to enter science, technology, engineering and math education. And so it is a good thing to have a week to celebrate the importance of engineering to the history of the country and to the future of the country. I applaud the gentleman from Illinois' effort to bring this to the floor, and I am in complete support of the resolution and look forward to its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, especially since I am going to speak in favor of the bill. And the reason I am going to speak in favor of the bill and vote for it is because I think it is the beginning of a commitment to doing something about our energy dependence on foreign fuels. 
   Recently, I had the opportunity to be in Brazil. In the 1970s, Brazil made a commitment to move away from their dependence on imported oil and they developed ethanol from sugarcane. We don't have sugarcane, but we have something else that is in this bill. We have hydrogen, lots of it. In fact, it is the world's most common element. 
   So within this bill is the H Prize, which rewards entrepreneurs and inventors who can come up with a well-to-wheels transformation toward the hydrogen economy with a $10 million prize, hopefully augmented by $40 million worth of private money. This is patterned after the Ansari X Prize which incentivized entrepreneurial space flight. 
   So what we would hope to accomplish with the H Prize, which House Members have voted twice in favor of with over 400 votes both times, is to break through to hydrogen. I support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, you know, there's plenty of economic bad news around, coupled here and there, and we've had our share of those in the upstate of South Carolina, but there's also some bright spots, and those are very much worth celebrating. 
   Fluor Corporation's employment in Greenville, South Carolina, has gone from 2,500 in 2003 to 5,400 today. An additional 3,200 project-based workers help in projects around Greenville. Fluor is currently looking for 2- to 300 engineers to come help with significant new projects that they've won all around the world. 
   In fact, their growth has been so significant they've been a major cause of the drop in the vacancy rate in class A office space in downtown Greenville, going from 24 percent down to 11.9 percent in the central business district. 
   That's impressive, Mr. Speaker. It's worth celebrating, and especially worth celebrating is the fact that Fluor will now be taking over the contract at the Savannah River Site, where for 50 years, we've been producing and storing tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that will give us the opportunity to learn how to store hydrogen and break through to a hydrogen economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm not a scientist, but I play one occasionally at the Science Committee. And the good news is we have got some scientists at the Science Committee, great staff members and Members of Congress, like Dr. Baird, who is one of my tutors on this issue of ocean acidification. 
   Recently in a trip to the Galapagos, we had an opportunity to hear from Dr. Julian Sachs, who, along with Dr. Baird's tutelage, was able to explain to me finally why it is that the carbon sink of the oceans is going to create a problem for life in the oceans. And it has to do with that science experiment we did in high school with putting the egg in the vinegar, and a couple of days later, you come back and there's no shell on the egg. Well, that's the challenge. As carbon is absorbed into the ocean by higher CO  
   2 levels in the atmosphere entering in the ocean, driving down the pH, making the ocean more acidic, you end up with that scenario where the calcium-based shells of the organisms begin to dissolve. 
   The big challenge is the phytoplankton part of the food chain. That dissolves. It's a terrible thing to open up a hole at the bottom of the food chain. Not so bad if you're at the top of the food chain, but if you're at the bottom of the food chain, it's a terrible thing to open a hole, especially when a billion people around the world depend upon the ocean for sustenance. 
   So what all that means is this is a serious matter and something worth our spending time and effort and money on to research. So I am very happy to support this bill. 
   I am also very excited about an aspect of the bill that has been mentioned by several speakers already. That is the international cooperation that's called for in the bill. On another trip with Dr. Baird to Antarctica and then Australia, we saw a wonderful example of this with the NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Project, where we actually have NOAA employing two Australians who are doing work for NOAA in Australia, coordinating with the Great  Barrier Reef folks. And the result is America is there lending a hand and cooperating, improving not only the science that we generate but also my other committee, Foreign Affairs, better foreign policy outcomes; that we are showing ourselves to be a friend to the Australians, trying to preserve the Great Barrier Reef, which is obviously very important to people on the eastern shore of Australia. 
   So the international aspects of this may be reason enough to support the bill. But for all of the above reasons, I am very happy to support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it, and hopefully we will have this cooperation, find some breakthroughs in the science, and then figure out ways to apply those solutions to begin solving the problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The question before us, I think, is this: Is the risk of doing nothing greater than the risk of buying $700 billion of illiquid securities? The argument for it, of course, is that illiquid securities may turn out to be an okay investment. The best argument against it is it's basically socializing losses after Wall Street-types have pocketed profits. But, you know, when knowledgeable people tell us that there is a substantial chance of a depression, it's time to act. 
   Our financial markets have overdosed on credit. Truth be known, we have all overdosed on credit. The Federal Government, businesses large and small, families wealthy and poor. Working that overdose out of our system is going to take some time. But by buying up some of the securities that have fallen to a price below their value, the government might be able to stabilize the market and later sell off some of those securities at a profit. Some will be found to be worthless because they are so far removed from the original collateral, but some will have value, and we may just come out of this okay.

   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, there's plenty of bad economic news around, and we've shared in some of that in the upstate of South Carolina. But there are also some real bright spots. One of them is on Garlington Road in Greenville, South Carolina, where General Electric is currently looking for 200 more engineers. That would add to the 3,000 employees they have at that plant. Half are engineers, roughly the other half are manufacturing staff. 
   One of the most exciting things they're doing there is wind turbines. In fact, General Electric is now the number two installer of wind turbine units in the whole world, and they're made, in significant part, in Greenville, South Carolina. 
   If the renewable production tax credit is extended, and that's an important ``if'' for us here in the House, we need to do that; if we do extend that credit, General Electric expects that the United States will surpass Germany as the number one producer of wind energy in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's an exciting thing when we see new technology create jobs, especially when that new technology moves us away from dependence on oil and helps us break this addiction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that setting deadlines for withdrawal from Iraq is unacceptable. I am in agreement with the concept of adding a series of success checkpoints, and I suggested as much in a letter to the President 2 weeks ago. It worked before when we set deadlines for a new constitution and elections, and I think it could work again. 
   But withdrawal is the Democratic leadership's only solution if the Iraqis fall short of the benchmarks. That is simply too simplistic. It is too limiting. It is tying the hands of the President and the Pentagon. 
   We should have benchmarks, but the response shouldn't be all or nothing. These benchmarks should carry a gradation of consequences, rather than an all-or-nothing withdrawal.     
   Pulling back to the perimeter is an obvious step between surging and withdrawal. There are other gradations that our military leaders could propose to the President. 
   To begin an immediate withdrawal upon failure of a benchmark is like writing a lease with an eviction-only remedy for a late payment. It makes sense to have a section in the default paragraphs calling for a late payment fee before you begin the eviction. 
   The leadership in Iraq needs to know that they don't have forever to make the decisions regarding dividing up the oil fairly and regarding returning Baathists to positions of public service. They need to know they don't have forever in coming up with a working model of pluralism. We are providing their protection. We have the right to tell them to hurry. We have an obligation to our servicemen and women to tell the Iraqi factions to hurry. 
   But we don't need to tie the hands of our field commanders and our President with an arbitrary withdrawal date, predetermined by some political purposes and not by what is happening in the Iraq.  
   The circumstances on the ground in Iraq have changed at least three times since we went in--from an action against a dangerous regime, to an action against insurgents, to a civil war between Iraqi Shias and Iraqi Sunnis. 
   The circumstances may change a couple of more times before we get Iraq to reasonable stability, and, who knows, the Iraqis may ultimately want us to retain a base or two. 
   This bill overreaches. This bill improperly limits the options open to our commanders and our troops. This bill makes no provision for any number of successes in Iraq, which are still quite possible. And I urge its defeat.

<DOCNO>Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I wish to address three questions here on the floor today: Where are we? Where do we want to be? How do we get there? 
   First, where are we? We're in phase 3 of a conflict in Iraq. In Phase 1 we overran Iraq in response to an American national security threat. We won. 
   Then came Phase 2. We were forwardly deployed; the terrorists brought the fight to us; we busted up terrorist networks; America was protected from further attacks. We won. 
   Now comes Phase 3. At best, Iraq is engulfed in a sectarian killing spree. At worst, Iraq has descended into a civil war. 
   So where are we? We're thankful for the incredible work of our military in winning Phase 1 and 2. We're aware--and I think all of us are aware--that only the Iraqi people can win Phase 3. We're united in imploring the Iraqi people to choose order over chaos; pluralism over theocracy; and freedom over authoritarianism. As we had the help of the French, the Iraqis have had the help the United States. 
   But just as it was only American patriots who could decide the future of our country, only Iraqi patriots can decide the future of their country. It is a neo-con mistake to charge our war fighters with building an Iraqi national consensus. Iraqis must decide for themselves if they want to live in a unified, peaceful and pluralistic Iraq. No amount of American military might can compel that result. 
   So where are we? Thankful for success in the outcomes that we could control; aware of the outcomes that we cannot control. 
   Where do we want to be? We want the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country. The President is wisely pressing them to do so. We want the Iraqi leadership to make some key political decisions that could bring reconciliation. We want them to divide up the oil fairly, to allow banned Baathists back into positions of public trust and to develop a working model of pluralism. 
   We want the Iraqi leadership to know that they don't have forever, that they should settle these reconciliation questions quickly. We want them to know that we are not content to provide an overall security umbrella for their country while they dispatch death squads to kill their enemies and improve their sectarian positions. We want them to know that we're reaching for the button that would lower that umbrella. And we want to avoid the error of nation building. 
   The job of the U.S. military is to crush, kill and destroy the enemies of the United States. They are not nation builders; they are warriors. And they do their jobs very, very well. As commanded, our military entered Iraq to destroy what we understandably believed were threats to our national security. 
   We were successful in destroying those threats and thereafter in interrupting terrorist networks. Those were outcomes that we could control. 
   Now we are rightly asked for inputs that we can control but we are faced with outcomes that only the Iraqi people can control. It is right to evaluate the quality of our forces' inputs, but wrong to hold them accountable for outcomes beyond their control. Diplomats, statesmen, peacemakers and everyday Iraqis must work with us to develop a path to progress--a path that has milestones along the way and which has rewards for meeting those milestones and consequences for failure. Our military must help plan the path because they are the most stable and trustworthy institution on the ground in Iraq and because they are experts at planning and logistics. 
   Since our military is in control of the ``planning'' input, they will rightly be evaluated on the basis of the quality of that planning. Because they are the most trained and capable force in the world, our military must also continue to provide protection for the decisionmakers as they plan the path to progress. The quality of that protection is an input that will rightly be evaluated. 
   Because they are experts at discipline and structure, our military must help define the agreed-upon milestones, the rewards for meeting those milestones and the consequences for missing them. The quality of those inputs will rightly be evaluated. 
   Because they are capable, our military must provide strength for the first steps on the path. The quality of that strength and the capabilities with which it is delivered will rightly be evaluated. 
   Having well supplied those inputs, the American military will leave Iraq successful--in Phase 1, 2 and 3. If the Iraqi people follow the path to progress to a peaceful, pluralist and unified Iraq, they will have been successful. The path may lead to something less. 
   Any lesser outcome is the responsibility of the Iraqi people. So we want a path to progress, and we hope for the blessings of liberty for Iraq. 
   Now. how do we get there? The President has ordered an increase in troop strength in Iraq. He thinks a surge in troops will give breathing room for the development of a path to progress. 
   I'm concerned that a surge will have the opposite effect--that it will give breathing room to the death squads, that our service men and women will be caught in the crossfire and that the surge will end right where it began. In fact, that's what happened in Baghdad in August and September of 2006. 
   I'm concerned that a surge sends a conflicting message. On the one hand we're telling them, ``You don't have forever; you've got to make progress in solving these political questions; you've got to stop legging up on your enemies; it's your country.'' By surging, we may be saying, ``Not to worry, we're increasing the size of that American security umbrella; there's no urgency; we're here to stay; in fact, more of us are coming.'' 
   I want all Iraqi factions and leaders of factions to worry. I want them to see us reaching for the button that would bring that umbrella down. I want them to imagine the click of that button and the feel of the wind from the descending umbrella. 
   The resolution before us isn't written the way I would have written it, but it's the resolution before us. Resolutions are the way that Congress discharges its constitutional responsibility to communicate with the President. This resolution says, ``We disapprove of the surge.'' 
   Parties on both sides have added additional and conflicting meaning to those words. In the end, I just have to vote on the basis of the words. That's why I'm going to vote in favor of the resolution and express my concern about the effectiveness of the surge. 
   Unlike many others who will vote for this resolution, I will not follow it with a vote to cut off funding. Nor will I follow it with a vote to withdraw immediately. Both of those actions would be mistaken. 
   Some will say that I am too impatient and insistent for decisions from the Iraqi leadership. It's true that it took us nearly 100 years to figure out that slavery was antithetical to freedom. It took us even longer to figure out that women should have the right to vote. 
   But as I had the opportunity to say to one of Prime Minister Maliki's advisors in Baghdad in August, it is our right as Iraq's protector and our obligation to our servicemen and women to insist on a timetable for these decisions. I've only been to Iraq twice. Both times I found that the hardest thing was leaving. 
   While there, surrounded by America's best, I had the sense that I was at ground zero of mission and purpose. The Americans serving in Iraq are the most impressive people in the  world. Everyone of them is a volunteer. Everyone of them, everyone of their predecessors and everyone of their non-deployed comrades has offered his or her life in preservation of our lives. 
   America's best deserve our best--our clearest thinking, our freshest analysis, our steadfast devotion. Forget the political consequences; protect no one's ``legacy;'' don't worry about ``saving face;'' make sound decisions; take decisive action. Tell them what their mission is. Discharge the Constitutional responsibility of the Congress. Give them a clear description of the inputs we expect from them. Evaluate them on the quality of those inputs but don't hold them accountable for outcomes they cannot control. 
   Ask them to do accomplishable things. Don't ask them to do the impossible. 
   No amount of force can cause someone to choose freedom, and freedom cannot be given--it must be earned. We have provided the conditions under which freedom can take root. Iraqis must nurture the seed and water it with their own sweat and blood. 
   If they do so, Iraq will enjoy the blessings of liberty. If they don't, our military will nevertheless have been successful.

<DOCNO>Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a huge challenge in Iraq. It is a challenge for Democrats. It is a challenge for Republicans. It is a challenge for the President and for the Congress. We need an American solution to that challenge. The question before us today is whether this resolution is going to advance that solution or it is actually going to make it more difficult. 
   I am one of the 17 Republicans that wasn't convinced of the surge; but I am aware now that we are doing it. It is underway, and the plan is clear to have General Petraeus report in September. 
   I am not certain why it is that we should be debating today a resolution prior to that time because, between now and then, rather than having a succession of political kind of resolutions, we could be working toward an American consensus on this. I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that that consensus is not that far away. I think we can start with two very clear observations. First, our military has done exactly what we have asked them to do. And they have done it very well. 
   Second, we need to use the American concept of accountability. We need to impose accountability on the Iraqi regime and say to them, we have these benchmarks and here are some rewards for success and some consequences for failure. 
   And between now and September 30, if we work in a cooperative way, I think we can find a whole series of success check points that we can lay out for the regime in Baghdad. We can say to them, Republicans, Democrats, the President and Congress alike, can say to them, here are the things that we want you to accomplish, and we have the right to insist that you accomplish them because after all, we are spending $2 billion a week. But even more important than that, far more important than that, we have American lives at risk. So we have the right as their protectors. We want you to achieve these things. If you do, you get these rewards. If you fail, these are the consequences. We can lay out a whole series of those if we work together in a cooperative way. The President, the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, we can come up with that American solution and we can find a way forward in Iraq. 
   The question that I think the proponents of this resolution need to answer is, if you simply set the withdrawal date of April 1, what went with all of that accountability? What went with all of those success check points? The question really for the proponents is: How do you know by April 1, such a date in stone, that you will have succeeded? Why not work cooperatively between now and September, awaiting the report, to prepare a series of very carefully thought out success check points with consequences for failure and rewards for success? And think through the plan. As it is, I think there is not much of a plan; and, therefore, I will vote against the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we face three questions here tonight: Where are we? Where do we want to be? And how do we get there? 
   First, where are we? We are in phase three of a conflict in Iraq. In phase one, we overran Iraq in response to an American national security threat. We won. 
   Then came phase two. We were forwardly deployed; the terrorists brought the fight to us; we busted up terrorist networks. America was protected from further attacks. We won. 
   Now comes phase three. At best, Iraq is engulfed in a sectarian killing spree. At worst, Iraq has descended into a civil war.  
   So where are we? We are thankful for the incredible work of our military in winning phase one and two. We are aware, and I think all of us are aware, that only the Iraqi people can win phase three. 
   It is a neocon mistake to charge our warfighters with building an Iraqi national consensus. Iraqis must decide for themselves if they want to live in a unified, pluralistic, and peaceful Iraq. No amount of American military might can compel that result. 
   So where are we? Thankful for the successes and the outcomes that we can control; aware of the outcomes that we cannot control. 
   Where do we want to be? We want the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country. The President is wisely pressing them to do so. We want the Iraqi leadership to make some key political decisions that can bring reconciliation. We want them to divide up the oil fairly, to allow banned Baathists back into positions of public trust, and to develop a working model of pluralism. We want the Iraqi leadership to know that they don't have forever, and that they should settle these reconciliation questions quickly. And we want to avoid the error of nation building. 
   The job of the U.S. military is to crush, kill, and destroy the enemies of the United States. They are not nation builders; they are warriors, and they do their jobs very, very well. 
   As commanded, our military entered Iraq to destroy what we understandably believed were threats to our national security. We were successful in destroying those threats and, thereafter, in interrupting terrorist networks. Those were outcomes that we could control. 
   Now, we are rightly asked for inputs that we can control, but we are faced with outcomes that only the Iraqi people can control. It is right to evaluate the quality of our force's inputs, but wrong to hold them accountable for outcomes beyond their control. 
   Diplomats, statesmen, peacemakers, and everyday Iraqis must work to develop a path to progress, a path that has milestones along the way, and which has rewards for meeting those milestones and consequences for failure. 
   If the Iraqi people follow the path to progress to a peaceful, pluralistic, and unified Iraq, they will have been successful. The path may lead to something less. Any lesser outcome is the responsibility of the Iraqi people. So we want a path to progress, and we hope for the blessings of liberty for Iraq. 
   Now, how do we get there? The President has ordered an increase in troop strength in Iraq. He thinks a surge in troops will give breathing room for the development of a path to progress. I am concerned that a surge will have the opposite effect: that we will give breathing room to the death squads; that our servicemen and women will be caught in the crossfire; and that the surge will end right where it began. In fact, that is what happened in Baghdad in August and September of 2006. 
   I am concerned that a surge sends a conflicting message. On the one hand, we are telling the Iraqi leadership, ``Hurry up, you don't have forever.'' On the other hand we are saying, ``No, not to worry. We are increasing the size of the American security umbrella.'' 
   I want all Iraqi factions and all leaders of Iraqi factions to worry. I want them to see us reaching for the button that would bring down that security umbrella. I want them to imagine the click of the button and the feel of the wind from that descending umbrella. 
   The resolution before us isn't written the way I would have written it, but it is the resolution before us. Resolutions are the way that Congress discharges its constitutional responsibility to communicate with the President. This resolution says we disapprove of the surge. Parties on both sides have added additional and conflicting meaning to those words. In the end, I just have to vote on the basis of the words. That is why I am going to vote in favor of the resolution and express my concern about the effectiveness of the surge.
