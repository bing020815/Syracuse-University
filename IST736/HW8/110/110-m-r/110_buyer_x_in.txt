<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  
   As we discuss H.R. 1108, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the question before the House is not whether we want to decrease youth smoking as the bill is purported to do. The question is, after years of headlines and alarming stories about the FDA's failure to protect our Nation's food and drug supplies, do we in Congress believe that the FDA is in a place to take on a multi-billion dollar tobacco industry? 
   I believe that each one of us agrees that the FDA is under-funded and cannot perform its current functions. Over the past 2 years, this Congress has spent enormous amounts of time negotiating legislation to reauthorize programs such as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and the Medical Device User Fee Act. Not only did we reauthorize the programs as they existed, but we added to these programs and increased the FDA's workload. 
   In the past several months, there have been numerous hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee to try to determine what needs to be fixed at the FDA so that we can assure the American people that their food, their drugs, and their medical devices are safe. 
   Unfortunately, we all understand the realities that exist within the FDA. Foreign drug manufacturing facilities are mostly going uninspected by the FDA, and the inspections that take place are not effective. FDA's surveillance over the drugs on our market today is not where it should be. Bad actors are getting into our drug supply chain and diverting good drugs out of the supply chain and bad drugs into the chain. Hundreds of thousands of unregulated and potentially harmful drugs  are streaming into our country's international mail facilities every day and being sent to American homes with no FDA inspection or testing whatsoever. And, these problems only cover the problems with FDA's oversight over our Nation's prescription drug supply. We could go on about the problems that exist with our Nation's food supply. 
   It is important that we look back at our discussions over the past year in this Congress and the discussions that we have before us over the FDA's lack of resources and ability to fulfill the duties that we have vested in the Agency. 
   Every morning when I pick up the paper there is a new article about the dangers facing our country due to an underfunded and ill-equipped FDA. A few recent headlines have read: 
   ``FDA inspections lag in overseas drug factories.''--Washington Times (2/28/08) 
   ``FDA Chief is in a Budget Bind.''--WSJ (2/27/08) 
   ``FDA Needs $375 million more to address shortcomings.''--Congress Daily (2/27/08) 
   In fact, just this morning in an article in the Wall Street Journal, the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee is quoted as saying, ``There's a total inability of the FDA to carry out its mission.'' 
   Many of my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee have been vocal about the FDA's ineffectiveness in recent congressional testimonies. 
   The FDA is ``a sorry mess.''--Chairman DINGELL (7/17/07) 
   ``The warning signs are clear: FDA is an agency in crisis.''--HENRY WAXMAN (author of the tobacco bill) (5/5/07) 
   ``Unfortunately, as this Committee under both Republican and Democrat leadership has documented, FDA's resources have become woefully inadequate given the agency's expansive mission. Accordingly, the agency's ability to protect American families from unsafe foods, drugs, medical devices, and other products has radically deteriorated.''--BART STUPAK (1/29/08) 
   Despite these strong statements, these very members want to put a multi-billion dollar industry under an Agency that is not adequately performing its current functions. 
   The FDA itself has expressed its concerns about being mandated to regulate tobacco. The current FDA Commissioner, Andrew von Eschenbach, outlined his concerns in a recent letter to Members of Congress. Commissioner von Eschenbach wrote, ``Enactment of H.R. 1108 would redirect Agency priorities and resources to a new regulatory area, which is not only inconsistent with FDA's mission, but also diverts attention from the significant public health matters of the safety of food, drugs, biologics and medical devices.'' 
   And, if I remember correctly, none of the last few FDA Commissioners has supported FDA regulating tobacco. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask that we all think long and hard about that one big question before us today. Is the FDA ready to take on this multi-billion dollar industry in the midst of the challenges already before the Agency today? 
   I agree that we need to keep tobacco out of the hands of our youth. I agree with the statistics that show that people become addicted to tobacco while they are in their youth. I am concerned about the growing prevalence of disease and death attributable to tobacco in our country. 
   However, I believe that we have means to increase enforcement in our States to keep tobacco out of our children's hands. We do not need a new government bureaucracy which will inevitably be underfunded and ill-equipped to effectively regulate the tobacco market.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I need to discuss an amendment that was adopted at the committee that is not in this bill today. We, as a country, are facing a tremendous challenge, and that is, with the advent of the Internet, it is very easy for people to get on the Internet; they go to a Web site and they believe that they can order drugs and that the drugs that they order on the Web site can be the very same drugs that they get down at the CVS or the Walgreens or the local community pharmacy. 
   Every time the FDA does an inspection at our international mail facilities, they discover anywhere from 67 to 90 percent of the drugs that are coming in from the orders of these mail sites, are either adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit drugs. 
   Now, let's just do the math. Every day, 20 to 30,000 packages, pharmaceutical packages enter each of our 12 international mail facilities every day. The FDA only screens less than 1 percent. 
   Now, let's think about this. Just take 30 days, for a month, times 400,000 packages, you get 12 million, times 12 months, that is 144 million pharmaceutical packages. 
   Now, do the math with regard to the number that are either misbranded, adulterated or counterfeit. Now, let's just do really simple math, and just say, okay, we will give a little flexibility in there. That is 100 million pharmaceutical packages that are either adulterated, misbranded or counterfeit. We have a very, very serious problem. Now, that is with regard to the human consumption. 
   Now, you are saying, STEVE, what does that have to do with the Animal Drug Fee User Act here today? 
   Well, what I had hoped to do is, it is only a matter of time before the bad actors of the world enter this economic space, meaning, if they can scam the American people with regard to human consumption, you know what? It is really going to be easier for them to do this in the animal drug business because you are never going to know why that animal died.     
   We have a tremendous challenge. The FDA feels that they do not have the authority to destroy these misbranded, adulterated, or counterfeit drugs. So what's happening? You go to an international mail facility. When Customs finds one of those packages, they'll destroy it, but if that package then gets referred to the FDA, FDA feels that they do not have the legal authority to destroy that package. 
   Now when they feel they don't have the legal ability to destroy, they have adopted a ``return-to-sender'' policy. 
   Now let's think about this. The bad actors of the world, the counterfeiters and the criminal syndicates, are very sophisticated as to how they move these counterfeit packages from country to country to gain access into our marketplace. Then when we discover that package, the FDA, through their policy now, returns it to the counterfeiter. Think about that. Our own FDA that is there to protect us then becomes the enabler of the counterfeiter. So the counterfeiter takes the person's money and we return the merchandise that's counterfeit to the counterfeiter.  
   Now that is stupid. That's about as idiotic as I have ever seen. 
   So what did I attempt to do? Well, we're working on a food and drug safety bill in the committee, and I appreciate the gentlemen's work on both sides of the aisle. It's on human consumption. So what I had hoped to do here was say, Well, let's stop these bad actors and the criminal syndicates and the counterfeiters from entering into animal drugs. Chairman JOHN DINGELL agrees with that provision, and it was going to be in here. 
   The Democrat leadership said, ``No. We can't have that in this bill.'' Now that's a curious and puzzling thing. But what I will say is, and my agreement with Chairman Dingell is that this is an issue as a country in matters of food and drug safety that we, as Republicans and Democrats, must come together to protect the American people and to go after these bad actors around the world, the criminal syndicates who are preying upon America's most vulnerable populations. We have to enjoin together to do this. And that's my pledge to work with Chairman Dingell and JOE BARTON and other members of the committee, and I salute Mr. Matheson, for us to do this so not only do we bring protections on the animal side to go after the bad actors, we put protections in place on the human side. And we can do that not only in stopping the bad actors but also including electronic pedigree, and I will work with you to do just that.

   Mr. BUYER. In my conversations with the chairman, not only last night but also this morning, I will work with the gentleman to make sure that we can have this in the drug safety bill not only on humans but will also protect animals, so we will give the authority to the FDA to destroy. I will work with the gentleman. 
   But we also brought up in the conversation--I understand that a little pain could have been created here today. I want to work with the majority. In other words, they weren't forced to go through the Rules Committee and then we have a big fight on the floor. I agreed with the chairman. We withdraw the amendment. 
   But I want to work also--please work with Mr. Matheson and I on the electronic pedigree. It builds off of Chairman Dingell's paper pedigree so we can sophisticate America's systems for American people here as we also then fight the counterfeiters who are trying to gain access into our market. And I'll work with the chairman to do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (MEDICARE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank some of my colleagues for their vision back in 2003. They recognized that Congress does a good job talking about Medicare and the concerns about the future, but they realize that very few are very committed to addressing Medicare's challenges. 
   We, as a Congress, came together and worked with President Clinton in the 1990s when we did the Balanced Budget Act; and at that time, we even realized that Medicare was growing, the growing senior population was going to be a tremendous challenge to us; and in 2003 a small group of Members of Congress, they put in trigger legislation, and now this trigger, as the chairman said, goes into effect if the Medicare board of trustees certifies in two consecutive years that 45 percent of Medicare spending will come from general revenues in any of the upcoming 6 years. 
   Last year, the trustees certified this Medicare spending level; and again this year, they have certified that the spending is exorbitant and that the trigger has now been hit. 
   As directed by law, the President had no choice. He sent legislation to Congress to address this spending. We in Congress have a responsibility to the American people to act on the President's proposal. Unfortunately, last year my Democrat colleagues tried to remove this trigger so that they can continue to put off addressing the unsustainable cost of our Medicare program. Under their CHAMP legislation, they slipped in a provision that would have removed this trigger. In effect, it would have allowed Congress to continue to ignore Medicare's growing cost. 
   Even worse, the Democrats decided to ignore Medicare's growing costs; and when they do that, frankly it just shoves these challenges off into the future and onto the backs of our children, and that is something we should not be doing. 
   Last week, the majority leader and the minority leader introduced a bill to move forward with the President's proposal to bring Medicare costs back under the trigger level. That is the responsible thing to do. 
   This Congress now should act on this legislation. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service Health Care Spending, the United States will hit $4.3 trillion by year 2017, nearly double that of 2007, equating to nearly 20 percent of our gross domestic product. In 2007, health care spending accounted for 16.3 percent of our gross domestic product. But more of that cost is expected to shift to government agencies even as the Federal Government struggles to shrink our own deficits. 
   Medicare spending alone is expected to grow to $844 billion in year 2017. That's up from the $427 billion we spent just last year in 2007. So Congress must stop talking about Medicare and its potential insolvency, and we must take action. 
   Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care in the United States; and within the next 11 years, the Medicare trust fund could potentially go bankrupt. 
   Our Nation is at risk to lose this important health care program for seniors if we do not reform this program. Future generations will not have access, and that would be unfortunate. 
   This trigger has forced Congress to be honest with the American people about Medicare's dim future. The future of our Medicare program, as I said, is at risk. I ask my colleagues to join with me to change this trend and protect Medicare for future generations, and we can only do that by working together.

   Mr. BUYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would like to limit my remarks to the veterans' education benefits that's contained in the amendment. 
   I don't believe that there is a Member here in the House who opposes improving the GI Bill. What I find objectionable and, Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the lectures by the then-ranking member and now the chairman of Appropriations with regard to process over the years and how conflicted he must feel, the fact that his leadership has directed him to bring a bill to the floor that has not gone through the process and, matter of fact, that there's no bipartisanship in agreement. You had brought bills to the floor before that didn't go through the appropriations process, but you two had agreements. 
   So you must be incredibly conflicted at the moment because you have given us lectures on process, and now you've thrown all of your lectures out the window.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, he's thrown all of them out the window. 
   What upsets most of us who sit on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is in fact there was a response. Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin and Ranking Member John Boozman have a bill. It's called H.R. 5684, and that bill was amended through regular order in the House. And what that bill did was improve the existing GI model, and the entire committee passed it. 
   Now what has happened, instead of using the bill that came from the Veterans' Affairs Committee, she hijacked that process to bring a bill in the Senate that the House here has never even considered. We've never had any hearings on it. It might be the greatest of bills, but if we're about to do this, Mr. Murtha and others, for all of our comrades and buddies and pals, we better make sure it's done right. 
   So in this process, I also know, and I agree with Mr. Tanner's remarks, Mr. Speaker, about paying for. 
   Now I'm going to vote for this. I'm going to vote for it not because I like the tax provisions. I would have much preferred some offsets. I also recognize the Senate probably aren't going to go with the tax provisions. 
   But we better be smart about our business here because if this House adopts this bill, we're going to have to be correcting it in conference instead of doing our business like we should have done in the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand here to honor the Indianapolis Colts and Super Bowl champions. The Colts are a team that I believe represent the best of professionalism and goodwill. 
   My congratulations to Tony Dungy for his accomplishments in leading the  Colts to an overall season record of 16-4 and for becoming the first African American head coach to win a Super Bowl. I am most hopeful that such reference does not have to be made in the future. That is the goodness of America. Coach, you have also demonstrated that nice guys can win. 
   I also commend the passionate Indianapolis Colts who braved single-digit temperatures to welcome back home for the first time to the city of Indianapolis and the State of Indiana the Vince Lombardi Trophy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also learned something, though, that I think America should know about the Super Bowl. You see, the teams that actually play the Super Bowl actually get 17 percent of the tickets. Those tickets go to those fans of the two teams, and they are upper deck, end zone seats, which means that all of the prime seats of the Super Bowl go to all of the other owners. So what I am most hopeful is that America takes note here that actually the fans of the teams that get to play the Super Bowl really do not get to see much of their team in a Super Bowl. And so what happens here is the city who wants a Super Bowl in their city, they trade seats for votes. And so it is like, hey, if I want the Super Bowl in Detroit, and you are the team owner in Detroit, I will give you 1,500 seats at the 35-yard line. 
   By the end of the first quarter with all of the rain, you had over 10,000 empty seats. You say, what happened to the fans? Well, those are people there who wanted to see a football game, but do not necessarily like to sit in the rain because they didn't like either team. 
   So we need to redo how they do the Super Bowl and actually sit the fans where they can enjoy the game. So hopefully that is taken into account. 
   To Coach Dungy, the entire team, the owner Jim Irsay, the dedicated staff of the Colts organization and thousands of Colts fans, I offer my congratulations to the Colts for the Super Bowl victory over my father's beloved Chicago Bears. Go Colts.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1808, a bill to designate the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' which would honor one of our colleagues and one of my close friends who passed away this Congress. 
   Charlie Norwood was born on July 27, 1941 and attended both Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia and Georgetown University in Washington, DC. I have a close affinity to Charlie who was a dentist, like many in my family, prior to serving in the House of Representatives. 
   Charlie Norwood served as a Captain in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969. He began his Army career with an assignment to the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and in 1968, was transferred to the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam. He served a combat tour at Quin Yon, An Khe, and LZ English at Bon Son. During his tour of duty, he participated in experimental military dental practices that are now standard procedure for the Armed Forces. In recognition of his service under combat conditions, Norwood was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After his discharge in 1969, he remained a member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the World Wars until his death. 
   Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood served with us as a Member of Congress from January 4, 1995 until his untimely death on February 13, 2007. During his Congressional career, as a Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Charlie Norwood worked to pass a patients' bill of rights, aimed at giving people better access to health care, and spent his life supporting the overall well-being of veterans. Serving as a Member of the National Guard and Reserve Caucus, which I co-chair, he was a tireless guardian of our military and worked hard to protect TRICARE benefits, co-sponsored legislation to address military Survivor Benefit Plan inequities, and worked to get pay raises for our military members. 
   Mr. Speaker, honoring his hard work, and dedication to the military and our nation's veterans, as well as his love of nation by naming the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' is a fitting tribute to our late colleague and friend. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the full support of my colleagues on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 680 condemning the act of vandalism on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial last month. On the evening of September 7th vandals dumped an oily substance, which damaged 14 of the 140 black granite panels commemorating the lives of more than 58,000 men and women killed or missing during the war. The substance has been cleaned up, however I believe it is important for the American people to know what happened to this sacred shrine. 
   Mr. Speaker, while no one has yet been connected with the vandalism, anti-war protesters earlier this year defaced other Washington landmarks. In January, protesters spray painted a Capitol terrace. Protesters later defiled the Lone Sailor statue at the United States Navy Memorial. This pattern of attacks is a national disgrace. 
   When I stand before the Wall and look on those names, I feel great humility in the presence of what this memorial represents. These men and women died so that our very way of freedom might endure. I call upon the coward or cowards who defiled this shrine to come forward and accept responsibility, or go back under the rock from which they came. It is an obscene perversion that others would creep out in the dark of night to deface the memory of heroes. The memory of these patriots endures in our hearts, whatever hateful attacks vandals may attempt. 
   I would like to thank my colleague Representative John Carter of Texas for introducing this important legislation, and I thank the House leadership for bringing it to the floor.

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, this resolution expresses the support for the designation and goals of Hire a Veteran Week, and calls upon the President to issue a proclamation supporting these goals. It is identical to the legislation passed by the House in the 109th Congress on July 24, 2006. 
   America's veterans deserve special employment opportunity more than any other sector of society. These men and women have volunteered to put themselves in harm's way to preserve the Nation's way of life and economic system. They have worn the uniform from pole to pole, often risking their lives not only in combat, but also in exploring, rebuilding infrastructures devastated by natural disasters, providing medical care in remote locations, and transporting refugees from genocide. They answer the Nation's call to duty, asking in return only our support and our thanks. 
   Veterans are the most diverse communities in America. They come from every major ethnic and socioeconomic group. Today's veterans are goal-oriented, physically fit, know how to take and give orders, and are comfortable with technology. The best way to say thanks to veterans for their service is to give them the opportunity to prove their worth in the workplace. 
   I also want to thank Congressman John Boozman and Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth for their very effective work during the 109th Congress to improve employment opportunities for veterans, and particularly disabled veterans, and I look forward to their continuing efforts during the 110th Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for allowing this legislation to come to the floor for consideration, and ask that my colleagues support the bill, H. Con. Res. 5.

   I have to agree with my friend and colleague, Barney Frank. We watched someone of great strength suffer from the cruelness of cancer. And it was really hard to watch JULIA. 
   This is an individual that I spent more time in the airport with than ever here in Congress. And those of us who fly back and forth, we know what that is like. For 11 years in the Indianapolis airport is really where I spent most of my time with JULIA CARSON. She and I shared a subcommittee leadership on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, but that doesn't even come close to the times in the Indianapolis airport.  
   I would rather remember the lady that I first met. JULIA CARSON is an individual that, no, this is a lady that wore a big hat, with a witty personality, with a great smile, and a big heart. 
   And I also pity the individual that fell for any of her, oh, shucky darns wit, I just don't understand; can you help explain it to me? Because you lost if you believed any of that. 
   She suckered me in pretty good when it came to the support of the Midfield terminal with the Indianapolis airport. She had just got on the Transportation Committee. She understood the need for infrastructure for a city like Indianapolis and, gee, she wanted some of my help. And before I realized it, I am carrying the water heater, getting the letter, getting the support from all of the Indiana delegation, and said, oh, it would be okay if you go down and talk to the FAA. I mean, she was steering me the whole time. But I didn't mind. It was for the betterment of Indianapolis and Indiana. But don't let anybody fool you who was really controlling the strings here. It was JULIA. 
   And what a great lady. A great lady, because this Hoosier treated kindness like grain. She understood that, if she sows it, kindness will only increase. And I think she used that in her life. She used a kindness to go after her political enemies. She used that big smile and kindness to achieve great things. And it was also an enduring quality about her. And that is what I want to remember JULIA most by. 
   I have to end with this, because she loved her Indianapolis Colts. When it came to the redistricting in Indiana, and we all know what redistricting is like: sometimes maps and the lines can go down the alleyways and sidewalks almost. But she made sure that her district, that etched in and it took the headquarters of the Indianapolis Colts and the training facility because she wanted her boys, as she told me. I said, JULIA, I have got most of this territory all surrounded, and you went deep down the road and etched out and took them out. And she smiled and she said, Those are my boys. And she loved her Indianapolis Colts, and I am glad that she got to see the Colts have that Super Bowl on her watch, because it only made her smile even that much greater and that much bigger. And that is the JULIA CARSON that I remember and loved.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I support the Senate-passed version of the mental health parity legislation. It was carefully crafted between mental health groups and business groups. And everyone should note that not all of the mental advocacy groups support this House language. They see some dangers in it. 
   In particular, in the bill that we are discussing, employers are allowed to drop their mental health benefits, and there is great concern that employers in fact will do that because of the overly broad coverage mandates as specified in the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual which is included in this bill. 
   The American people must know that the bill before the House today, again, is not supported universally by mental health advocacy groups as the Senate bill is. Heather Wilson offered an amendment in the committee; it was defeated. I am very disappointed that no amendments were offered in the Rules Committee. This is, once again, shutting down the democratic process of this House. 
   I don't know what you have to fear. I am really concerned about that. I am also concerned about the pay-fors for this. To substantially increase the Medicaid prescription drug rebate as one of the offsets, this significant increase could have a detrimental impact, because when you increase these rebates, there is going to be a cost shift, and that cost shift is going to have a depreciative effect. The effect will be you will increase the price on premiums, you will have an increased price of drugs on someone else. 
   Also, I am very bothered that the second pay-for of the bill would limit Americans' access to the specialty hospitals. These are benefits that so many people are enjoying, these specialized hospitals. They have higher patient satisfaction, lower mortality rates, and lower overall costs for health care. So at a time when our Nation's health care costs are rising and the quality of our care is a top concern, I am very bothered that this provision would cut out that important market innovation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (GRANTING A FEDERAL CHARTER TO KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1692, a measure to grant a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association (KWVA). 
   Though the Korean War is sometimes referred to as the ``Forgotten War,'' it is among the most significant events of the 20th century. Communist military aggression was defeated and the United States and its allies sent a signal to the world that militaristic expansion of communism would be countered with force. 
   Nearly 6 million Americans served during the Korean War, and tens of thousands of them faced some of history's most adverse circumstances and challenges for the cause of freedom--by the time the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than 36,000 Americans had died, 103,284 had been wounded, 7,140 were captured, and 664 were missing. 
   The heroism displayed by Korean War veterans should never be forgotten. We can help honor the 1.2 million American veterans of the Korean War who are still alive today by granting a Federal charter to America's oldest and largest association of Korea veterans. KWVA is a 20,000-member veterans' service organization devoted exclusively to Korean War veterans. 
   That is why we should approve S. 1692 calling on Congress to grant a Federal charter to KWVA. This recognition is well deserved, and I am hopeful that Congress will act swiftly to approve this measure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. 
   Additionally, I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5854, a bill to grant a Federal charter to the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA). 
   MOAA is the largest professional association for military officers and the fourth largest  veterans group in the Nation. With 370,000 members, MOAA has a distinguished 79-year history of service to the military community, veterans, and their families. 
   Like KWVA, MOAA is among the veterans' service organizations without a Federal charter. In addition to the deserved recognition it would accord MOAA, a Federal charter would enable some state-level MOAA affiliates to participate on governor-appointed advisory councils to which they are presently excluded. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to grant a Federal charter for KWVA, and I would also encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 5854 to grant a Federal charter to MOAA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6048 would amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to provide for the protection of child custody arrangements for parents who are members of the Armed Forces deployed in supporting a contingency operation. 
   Very briefly, this bill would place restrictions on changes in child custody that a court could order during a period of a servicemember's deployment and upon the servicemember's return from deployment. Also, this bill would exclude consideration of military service from a court's determination of a ``child's best interests.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I would explain to my colleagues that the paramount consideration in child custody cases is the best interests of the child. The simple fact that a servicemember parent is subject to deployment should not be permitted to work against him or her in child custody cases. 
   At this time I would defer to the author of this legislation, Mr. Turner, who is an active member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, for a more detailed explanation of his legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. As a practicing attorney during my private law practice in Monticello, Indiana, I handled a number of child custody cases, and as an Army JAG officer on Active Duty I provided legal assistance to servicemembers in child custody cases. I have a practitioner's perspective on these issues, and, quite frankly, they are some of the hardest cases I have seen where two parents are in a legal contest over the custody of their child. 
   From my perspective, I appreciate Mr. Turner's objective of ensuring fair treatment of servicemembers in child custody matters when they are deployed and when they return home. 
   When I first learned just a few days ago that this bill had been introduced on the suspension calendar without any consideration by the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, I read the bill and had some questions. I wanted to know what were the official positions of the Department of Defense and the American Bar Association, Family Law Section. The answer was that neither had been asked for an official position, so none was available. There has never been a legislative hearing on this bill by any House committee to examine the legislation and to allow stakeholders to present their views. 
   Mr. Turner's initiative and passion on this issue is commendable. As this legislation moves forward, I would like to work with my distinguished colleague from Ohio to ensure that the final product does what we would all like it to accomplish. 
   Madam Speaker, this amendment to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act would, to the extent as applicable, have a preemptive effect on the existing body of State case law and statutory law in terms of substantive Servicemembers Civil Relief Act rights and protections, as well as the burdens of proof and procedures of each jurisdiction. However, I want to make clear that this legislation should be construed to provide additional remedies to those already available under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and State law. This measure is intended to expand the rights and protections of servicemembers, and not to result in any limitation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act as it applies to military family care plans, other custody cases, and family court matters not having a custody order in effect. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Turner for his active support and advocacy of our Nation's servicemembers and veterans, and I look forward to working with him as this bill goes to the United States Senate. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL FACILITY AUTHORIZATION AND LEASE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5856, the VA Medical Facility Authorization and Lease Act, which would authorize major medical facility projects and major medical facility leases for the Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2009. I want to extend my compliments to Chairman Michaud and Mr. Miller, and I think when Chairman Michaud thanked me for the interest, I think he meant, Thank you for the cooperation. I enjoyed working with you and your staff and the chairman in getting a bill to the floor. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill authorizes $2.2 billion to improve access to health care for our Nation's veterans. As we consider this construction authorization bill that includes VA's fiscal year 2008 and 2009 request, I would like to share my enthusiasm for the announcement Secretary Peake made on April 24, 2008, to change course in Denver and move to a joint facility, with which I know Chairman Michaud also concurs. 
   Secretary Peake announced that the VA intends to construct a new bed tower in partnership with the University of Colorado at Denver and the University of Colorado Hospital on university property at the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center campus. Madam Speaker, I have been a strong supporter of moving forward with a joint use facility and believe that the idea of collaboration promises significant value as we move in to providing veterans access to care in the 21st century VA system. 
   There has been a long and detailed history of planning for a shared facility to replace the existing Denver VA Medical Center. Discussions between VA and the University of Colorado Hospital regarding the relocation of the Denver Veterans Medical Center to Fitzsimons campus started in the year 2000, and I am pleased to see this collaboration again moving forward. 
   H.R. 5856 would provide VA to authorize in the amount of not to exceed $769.2 million for the replacement of the Denver, Colorado VA Medical Center. This authorization was requested by the administration in February in its fiscal year 2009 budget submission. 
   Madam Speaker, I recommend at this time that we retain this $769.2 million authorization for a major medical facility in Denver contained in this bill as a placeholder. However, as the planning and design of the Denver partnership is further defined, it will be necessary to amend the authorization of this project. 
   H.R. 5856 also includes authorization for the construction of a fifth polytrauma center in San Antonio, Texas. VA's four current polytrauma centers are located in Richmond, Virginia; Tampa, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. These centers provide a valuable service to injured servicemembers and veterans and are designed to provide comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services for individuals with complex, severe, and disabling traumas. Creating a fifth polytrauma center in San Antonio reinforces our commitment to the veterans and servicemembers who have honorably served our country by expanding access to the southwest United States. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Filner and Chairman Michaud with regard to the report language in the bill. We had some matters outside the bill that we needed to work through. I know the chairman had visited deep south Texas and I also went to deep south Texas to work on these issues that were brought to us by Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Hinojosa, and we were able to work through those, not only working with these members, being on the ground, talking to the veterans, working with the administration, and having that report language in here as we work with the University of Texas, I think, was prudent and wise. 
   I want to thank Chairman Michaud and Chairman Filner for working through these matters. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Rodriguez, when you go back to Texas over the Memorial Day break, I want you to share with your good friends in Deep South Texas how much I enjoyed the visit and their tequila. I don't know what it is about tequila that makes you either forget or remember the most, but I really enjoyed that, and you have much to smile for when you go back to Texas. 
   When I went to Deep South Texas, I also went to San Antonio and toured not only the burn unit at Brook and the Intrepid at Fort Sam Houston, but also I went over to the VA hospital and met with your hospital director and the team for the polytrauma center, and they are extraordinary. If you have the opportunity at all, I welcome you to visit the other polytrauma centers, or any of them. It is extraordinary what they do in that full continuum of care, and it is seamless as they move from the military to the VA and then back in. 
   There are always some bumps in the road, so as you take on this fifth site in your backyard, too often we place that burden on the families to be the case manager, and now in Wounded Warrior we say okay, we are going to assign case managers. But as we open up that fifth polytrauma center, we are going to look to your leadership to make sure the fifth site opens up and opens well. I just wanted to share that with you.

   I also would like to compliment Chairman Filner and Chairman Michaud with regard to working with myself and Mr. Latham as we addressed his concerns that were brought to the committee in Northeast Iowa. We also had other issues that were brought regarding Fort Ord. As we all know, CARES was sort of that snapshot in time, and now we are 4 years beyond CARES and it is almost being overtaken by certain events. So I appreciate Chairman Filner allowing us to work through some of these in our language, and we are going to have to address CARES No. 2 probably or redux here in the upcoming future.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, the ranking member. Thank you for bringing this today to the floor. 
   As all of us get to know Sam, and we see him daily, Sam's voice gives meaning to many who were held as prisoner and allows us to have a deeper appreciation of what it means to lose your liberty. And what Sam Johnson has been able to teach all of us is that someone may take away your freedom, someone may beat you and torture you, but they can never touch your character. And what Sam teaches us daily is it is about the power of the individual, and it comes from your character and it comes from who you are morally and spiritually as a person. It is about who you are with your values and your virtues that defines human dignity. When you define that and you're comfortable about yourself, it doesn't matter what someone ever does to you. 
   When you think about and you read the book on Sam Johnson's life, you have a much deeper understanding of what this man went through, but he was able to endure because he was comfortable with who he was as a person. 
   Now, what Sam does, and he is so humble, is that he then takes that and teaches all of us not only about what they went through, but how each of us, as Americans, should rise to understand each other with greater dignity. 
   With that, Sam, I think this is so fitting that we honor you today. I know that you feel uncomfortable about doing that. But you are able to give great voice to a lot of your comrades, many who also never came home. And it is not just for those from the Vietnam war; when you speak, you give voice to anyone who was a prisoner of war.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3889, as amended, which would amend title 38, United States Code, to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a longitudinal study of the vocational rehabilitation programs administered by the Secretary. I appreciate Chairman Filner for moving this legislation through the committee to bring it to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, too often we support benefit programs such as VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment without requiring or verifying how well the program is achieving its goals. In the case of the VR&E, the program has two goals: employment and developing independent living skills for those too disabled to work. 
   Unfortunately, there is too little long-term data to judge the program's success in preparing disabled veterans for their return to the workforce. H.R. 3889 would require the VA to study three cohorts of veterans for 20 years to determine the outcomes of their participation in this program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the foresight of my colleague, Dr. JOHN BOOZMAN, for bringing this needed legislation before the House, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (JUSTIN BAILEY VETERANS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5554, as amended, the Justin Bailey Veterans Substance Use Disorders Prevention and Treatment Act of 2008, would amend title 38, United States Code, to expand and improve health care services available to veterans from the Department of Veterans Affairs for substance abuse disorders. 
   Unfortunately, many veterans who have experienced combat trauma have difficulty dealing with the demands of military service and/or readjusting to home life often turn to alcohol and drugs to ease the pain that has become part of their lives. VA has dedicated more than $458 million to improve access and quality of care for veterans who require substance use treatment since it began implementing the Mental Health Strategic Plan in 2005. 
   H.R. 5455, however, would be much more comprehensive and require that VA provides a ``full continuum of care'' to veterans suffering from substance use disorders at all VA medical centers or through contracts with local providers. This full continuum of care would include comprehensive screening for substance use disorders in all settings, detoxification and stabilization services, intensive outpatient and residential care, pharmacological treatments, and peer-to-peer and family and marital counseling. 
   This legislation would also direct VA to conduct a pilot program for Internet-based substance use disorder treatment for veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. 
   Some of our veterans are confronted with a new form of challenge in their life, which for some is greater than the warfare which they had faced, where it has no clear front and has no clear refuge. And in the case of our OIF/OEF veterans in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 30 percent of those veterans who have received VA care have been diagnosed with a possible mental health problem and 12 percent of these with a possible substance use disorder. 
   Outreach to every veteran is critical, and I'm pleased that under the leadership of Secretary Peake, VA has started contacting nearly 570,000 recent combat veterans to talk to them about available VA medical care and benefits. 
   Providing a full continuum of care in all settings will go a long way to enhance access to care and help at-risk veterans recognize the signs, treat the symptoms, and overcome the stigma that prevents many veterans from seeking care.  
   Problems associated with substance use disorder can have lasting effects on the mental and physical health of our veterans, and I commend the Subcommittee on Health Chairman Michaud and Ranking Member Miller for their leadership on the bill. 
   We can make significant progress in ensuring that the mental health wellness care that veterans seek and deserve is available with the passage of this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 5664, as amended, a bill which would amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update at least once every 6 years the plans and specifications for specially adapted housing furnished to veterans by the Secretary. 
   I thank my colleague, Mr. Rodriguez of Texas, for introducing this bill, and Subcommittee Chairwoman STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN, Ranking Member Boozman and full committee Chairman Filner for their efforts to bring the bill before the House. 
   Madam Speaker, many of our most severely disabled veterans qualify for the specially adapted housing program that provides grants for up to $50,000 to modify the veteran's home. This bill would require the VA to update the handbook on adapted homes designs on a 6-year cycle, to include adaptations for a wider variety of disabilities and to provide the handbook to qualified veterans.     
   In the previous Congress, we allowed the homes of a family member to be adapted where the veteran temporarily resides. I think that was a good move that we had done that, and this measure that Mr. Rodriguez has brought is one that is prudent and it should be passed.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3819, the Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act, a bill to amend title 38 of the United States Code to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reimburse veterans receiving emergency treatment in non-Department of Veterans Affairs facilities for such treatment until such veterans are transferred to department facilities. 
   I commend my colleague from Ohio, ZACK SPACE, for introducing this bill. Providing health care services to those who have honorably served our country is an important mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, in an emergency, a veteran may not always be in close proximity to a VA health care facility. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2000 under Public Law 106-117, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act, Congress authorized the VA to reimburse or pay for the emergency non-VA treatment of certain enrolled veterans who have no medical insurance and no other recourse for payment.     
   Current authorities for reimbursement of this emergency treatment are discretionary, and VA medical professionals must determine after the fact whether an actual emergency existed where a delay in obtaining treatment would have been hazardous to that veteran. 
   This bill appropriately resolves the current billing issues and standardizes requirements for VA to cover the cost of an eligible veteran's emergency care. H.R. 3819 would standardize the definition of emergency treatment for veterans seeking reimbursement for emergency services rendered in a non-VA facility. 
   By supporting this bill, we remove the financial uncertainty for veterans in an emergency health care status. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   June 1996, Mr. Speaker. That is more than 5 years before many people believe the global war on terror began. But the terrible attack on our Nation on September 11, 2001, was by no means the first attack against Americans in the global war on terror. These 19 Americans were killed, and 300 others injured, by a bomb created at the hands of vicious and deceitful extremists who oppose the principles that we all share and that these airmen were helping defend. 
   These American warriors were in Saudi Arabia to aid in preserving freedom for our friends in Kuwait. They were willing to risk their lives on the other side of the world, far away from their families, far from home, to support a mission to oppose tyranny. We must always remember the price these Americans paid. We must always honor their sacrifice for the freedom of others. Today, I pay tribute to these American airmen. They were brothers, fathers, and sons, and I know their families still mourn their loss. Nothing will ever replace the precious life of a lost loved one, but I offer their families my prayers and sympathy. 
   These 19 American airmen represent the essence of what makes our Nation great. Their selfless service and the sacrifice that they made in the name of liberty is one that we shall forever be in their debt. We should never let them be forgotten.

   I rise in support of H.R. 5729, as amended, the Spina Bifida Health Care Program Expansion Act, which would amend title 38, United States Code, to  direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide comprehensive health care to children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida, and for other purposes. 
   Spina bifida is a developmental birth defect that affects the spinal cord. It is a debilitating disease that can cause a number of neurological problems including paralysis and cognitive disorders. 
   Under its current authorities, VA is providing monetary allowances, vocational training, and certain medical care benefits to more than 1,100 children of veterans from Vietnam and Korea who were born with spina bifida. The VA Spina Bifida Health Care Program began in 1997 as a benefit for children of Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. In 2003 Congress expanded this program to children of certain Korean conflict veterans as well. However, medical care benefits under the program are limited to those necessary for the treatment of spina bifida and related medical conditions. 
   Although VA is supporting about 90 percent of the health care needs of these beneficiaries, the current requirement to receive prior approval for services creates an undue administrative burden for those families seeking treatment for their children. As these children age, it is especially important that the complete and comprehensive health care is available to them. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 5729, and I commend the gentleman from Indiana for bringing this to our attention. This bill expands VA's authority to cover all health care services needed for those who suffer with spina bifida as a result of their parents' service to our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I was sitting here, and I enjoyed the comments of the Chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Edwards, and the comments of Mr. Wicker, and then I was disturbed by the comments of Mr. Obey. 
   Mr. Chairman, what I would say is he didn't go back far enough. I came here in 1992, and I heard the horror stories of what was occurring in the Appropriations Committee of how individuals would cut veterans programs to fund WIC and other programs. I was deeply disturbed by that. 
   Then I would watch as the Clinton years would flatten VA spending. I guess the gentleman forgot about that too. 
   I want to associate myself with Mr. Edwards' comments and Mr. Wicker's comments because this is a bipartisan issue, and I am deeply disturbed about Mr. Obey's comments to try to rewrite history here. Some of the language, inflammatory language, that he used is deeply disturbing to me. 
   Now, if the gentleman wants to talk about his issues and how he feels about the war, that's one thing; but don't allow those emotions to bleed into how we care for America's veterans. That bothers me. 
   We talk about how we got here. I recall the movie ``Born on the 4th of July.'' What did they depict in the movie ``Born on the 4th of July''? They depicted a VA system which bothered many people here in Congress. It was then Ken Keyser who worked for the Clinton administration who then thought that the best way we could improve our VA system is to move more people into the system. They set forth the priorities, but then they opened the system to the nondisabled systems. 
   When we opened that, we didn't really prepare the system for the number of veterans that came into the system. When I looked back here over the last 6 years, my gosh, we have almost doubled the veterans budget. 
   We also, as we are coping with dealing with the influx of veterans based on eligibility reform, I almost feel like, on the Veterans' Affairs Committee on a bipartisan basis, we are mechanics looking at different subsets of systems within the VA that need a tremendous amount of work. 
   It's easy for us to always talk about the health side, but there is such a strong disability backlog too. If it were just money, if we could just throw money on it, and that's what would solve it, Mr. Edwards, if that's what you could put in the budget, it would be solved. The reality is that's not what's going to solve it. What's going to solve it will be management practices and accountability. If we don't have that, it's not going to be solved. 
   The chairman of the committee is now on the floor. When he held a roundtable discussion, he learned that they were giving exams to those who are the case workers out there. When you get only 23 and 27 percent pass rate by the individuals who are actually working on these disability claims, I would say we've got a problem and we have to work cooperatively on those problems. 
   I want to thank the new majority. I want thank the new majority because you are different from the old majority. 
   The old majority, when I came here a freshman, and I was in the minority, because that old majority did things a little differently, and those weren't good budgets on behalf of veterans. But when you came now in the new majority, Mr. Edwards, I congratulate you, because you have done what you said you were going to do. I want to personally thank you for that. 
   But I just want you to know this, Mr. Edwards, there is much work for all of us, because it's not going to be just money alone. 
   When Mr. Obey brought up the issue about the funding shortfall, what I did is I went in and I began to examine the finance modeling and found the errors in the inputs in the stale data in the model, and that's how we made the corrections. So even though we put in the $1.5 billion, we only spent a third of that, and the other went for carryover. 
   So there's going to be a lot of management issues, and there's going to be  a lot of oversight that we going to have to continue to do. But as a baseline, let me congratulate you, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wicker, on a very good bill.

   Mr. BUYER. Picking up off the comment that Mr. Edwards had made in his opening statement about management, I think you're right on point. Good management of the resources and accountability is what's essential. 
   So when the chairman just spoke in the well and said, well, we don't have the money, that's not entirely correct because the GAO came back in 2005 and 2006 and said, we gave them sufficient resources allocated toward mental health, but they didn't even spend around $60 million that you had already given them in those cycles. 
   Mr. Edwards, you worked on those budgets. So it's not just giving them the money; that was my point made earlier. 
   So when Mr. Filner made the comment, they don't have the money; we had given them the money, then they didn't utilize it. And so I agree with Mr. Filner when he gets his angst about how it is that you don't spend money we gave you, yet you've got waiting lines. 
   It goes back then to the management question about the resources in which we get them, and that's where I'd like to work with you and work with the chairman of the committee.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, the only thing I would note, as I listened to the Speaker speak in the well, is that when the Republicans presented their budget proposal as an alternative, we spent $8 billion more than the majority in the 10-year scope, actually in the 5-year budget plan, $8 billion more. And we did it without increasing taxes. 
   So what everybody needs to understand here is, yes, we are increasing money here to veterans, but these are also the very same veterans which are about to be taxed.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object, this amendment is either ill-conceived or politically conceived in that the Deputy Secretary is the gentleman who came to the committee to testify, and that was by agreement at the committee. 
   So to say that the administration sent someone who was uninformed is not a good way to address this to our colleagues.     
   That was by agreement of the committee, and it was the Deputy Secretary of the VA who came in and who testified, and as a matter of fact, his testimony, that I will share with all my colleagues, is that he testified just last week during the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on the SEC bonuses, at which the author of this amendment was present and he said, by statute, senior executive presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed appointees are not eligible for performance bonuses. 
   Did you hear that? They're not eligible for bonuses. So what we have here is, the gentleman's brought an amendment that is either redundant, multiplicitous or unnecessary. 
   With that, I withdraw my reservation of objection.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (URGING AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONALITIES TO VISIT THE AMERICAN CEMETERIES, MEMORIALS AND MARKERS -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 392 that encourages Americans and people of all nationalities to visit American cemeteries, memorials and markers operated by the American Battle Monuments Commission. 
   More than 125,000 American war dead of the Mexican, Civil, Spanish American and both World Wars are buried in American cemeteries across the globe. Our overseas cemeteries are under the jurisdiction of the American Battle Monuments Commission. I believe they  are the gold standard in preserving the final resting place of this Nation's heroes. 
   I've had the privilege of visiting our cemeteries in Normandy, in Luxembourg and Cyrennes which is just outside Paris. I believe that those who work at these cemeteries, in fact, when I said they set the gold standard, it is a standard to which our VA cemeteries here in this country should achieve. It's emblematic, I believe, of our Nation's regard to those who made the highest sacrifice. 
   They are true shrines to Americans who came to lands that they had never seen, to fight for a people that they had never met. They fought for no bounty of their own and left freedom in their footsteps. 
   Normandy, the American cemetery, is probably the most famous of our Nation's overseas cemeteries. It is the final resting place of more than 10,000 Americans who died in one of the greatest and most decisive battles of the epic struggle against tyranny in World War II. This year the Commission will open a new visitors center to help communicate the story of this site to those who fought and died over its length and breadth in time. 
   I had the opportunity to deliver the Memorial Day address, along with my friend HENRY BROWN of South Carolina, at Normandy as I stood there on the cliffs at Omaha Beach in 2005, an experience that I will never forget. 
   When I visited the Luxembourg cemetery last year, I was in awe of the beauty of the white stone chapel flanked by two very large stone pylons as the centerpiece of this cemetery in which then-General Patton lies in rest before his men. These pylons have maps and inscriptions telling the achievements of the U.S. Armed Forces in the region. Inscribed here are the 371 names of missing who gave their lives near this site but whose remains were not recovered or identified. 
   The Luxembourg cemetery is also the final resting place for some 5,000 GIs who repulsed Hitler's final offensive in the Battle of the Bulge, including several members of the famous Band of Brothers, deposed in Steve Ambrose's book. 
   I think if you visited any of these cemeteries all over the world you can't help but walk away with the same feeling that I have, a strong sense of humility and very humbled that these individuals gave everything in the name of freedom and in the name of liberty. 
   I just encourage everyone so when you go overseas and you're on a trip, or you go to Paris, pause for a moment and go visit one of our cemeteries on foreign land. 
   And I'm pleased that after World War II we now make every effort to bring these bodies back to our own country. So from Korea and Vietnam and the first Gulf War, second Gulf War, we try everything we can to bring these bodies back. 
   And speaking of Korea, now that the chairman is here on the floor, I would even ask of the chairman, there is a bill that was filed by one of our colleagues to bring recognition to Raymond Jerry Murphy, to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in New Mexico after this Medal of Honor winner. And I've given you several letters as to why this bill shouldn't be brought up. We're hopeful that you could have brought this bill to the floor while he was alive, but now he has since deceased. 
   So I would ask the chairman if he has knowledge as to why this bill shouldn't be brought to the floor and given the same honor to which you're giving here with regard to this bill. 
   I yield to the chairman.

   Mr. BUYER. So the chairman would raise an issue of germaneness rather than addressing the issue of how we honor the men and women who serve this country. That is disappointing. 
   This is a Medal of Honor winner from the Korean War in which we tried to seek to give recognition, just like we're doing in this bill, in how we honor our Nation's sacred fallen. This is an individual of whom is so respected in New Mexico the entire delegation supports it. It passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. The Senate bill lies upon this desk, but the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee won't bring it to the floor, and I don't understand. 
   I will now yield back to the gentleman for a better explanation, rather than germaneness, as to why you will not honor this veteran that the entire delegation of New Mexico supports.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I think by silence, by omission, the chairman just spoke, and how disappointed I am that veterans, that he just said that he wanted to come to the floor, that he was going to take this moment as a thank-you to veterans and all they do; yet here we have an opportunity in bipartisanship to recognize this Medal of Honor winner from Korea, whereby he wouldn't even do it when the gentleman was alive, and now he's deceased, and he still won't even give this individual the recognition. Yet the Senate bill, in a bipartisan fashion, lays upon this desk. 
   I am very disappointed, and I don't know what it's going to take to get you to move this bill and give the recognition. The Governor supports it. The two Senators support it. The Members of Congress from New Mexico support it. All the veterans service organizations support the bill, and I support this bill. 
   And if you know of a particular reason as to why this Medal of Honor winner, Mr. Murphy, should not receive this recognition by having the veterans hospital named in his honor, please let all of us know, because if you're blocking this for political motive, now we're upset.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (CHIROPRACTIC CARE AVAILABLE TO ALL VETERANS ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank also not only you but also in particular Ms. Herseth Sandlin and Mr. Michaud for their work on this bill. 
   I'm pleased to support H.R. 1470, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act, that would require a phased implementation to provide chiropractic care in all VA medical centers by December 31, 2011. 
   Under a policy guidance that I gave under the House Republican alternative budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, we provided an additional $100 million for veterans medical services to support the hiring of doctors of chiropractic care at all 155 VA medical centers. I have history dating back to the 106th Congress for supporting chiropractic care. 
   The Military Personnel Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee worked to include chiropractic care services as a benefit in the military health facilities and through TRICARE. 
   VA is currently offering chiropractic care in 30 VA medical centers and provides chiropractic care on a fee-for-service basis for veterans who are geographically distant from a VA medical facility. In fiscal year 2006, the VA paid over $1 million to fee-based chiropractic providers to treat roughly 3,000 veterans, and I support the passage of this bill. 
   I would also note, Mr. Speaker, that I'm very concerned because the chairman just spoke that the reason, words to the effect, that he's brought these seven bills to the floor is to represent what a grateful Nation bestows. But what I'm concerned about the seven bills being considered today under the suspension of the rules, only one, H.R. 2199, is being considered with a bill report having been filed.  
   I believe this is yet another way in which the majority of this Veterans' Affairs Committee is breaking with past practices. When you do not file a report with a bill that comes to the floor, you are essentially denying Members of the minority the opportunity to file supplemental, minority and additional views on legislation under House rule XI, clause 2(i). 
   Since the time of Sonny Montgomery, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has filed bill reports with every veterans bill other than resolutions such as H. Res. 392 or a facility naming bill; which is what I'm asking for Mr. Filner to do to honor the recipient of the Medal of Honor with regard to the naming of the VA medical center in Albuquerque, NM, and the minority has thus had the opportunity to file views. 
   The veterans bills being considered by the House today, H.R. 67, H.R. 1660, H.R. 612, H.R. 1470 and H.R. 2239, were all ordered favorably reported, with the exception of H.R. 1470, ordered reported from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs with amendments. However, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs has filed no bill with reports on any of them. Not only does this deprive the minority of the opportunity to file views, but it deprives veterans and the rest of the interested public from having important legislative history which discusses the background of legislation and explains the committee's intent as well as the amendments.     
   All of this is compounded by the fact that most of these bills were ordered reported without hearings that would have provided an historical record for legislation. The majority also has not bothered to obtain the position of the administration on most of these bills. 
   There is no reason for taking such shortcuts. I would have filed additional views on H.R. 1660, in particular, if the opportunity had been available. These are not expedited pieces of legislation involving an emergency situation. There has been ample time to follow the customary regular order and do that which is right. 
   We will now be at a disadvantage when conferring with the Senate. I fully expect the House to pass these bills overwhelmingly, but it is not a good way to legislate on behalf of our Nation's veterans. 
   I understand all the committees operate under the suspension of the rules to bring legislation to the floor. I wish that there were a collegial relationship between the chairman and the ranking member. It does not exist, unfortunately. 
   If, in fact, he would confer and work with us, we wouldn't have to work these things out or make an attempt to work these things out on the House floor. 
   Once again, I will make an attempt, and I will ask Chairman Filner if he would call up Heather Wilson's bill and allow us, when we return after the Memorial Day break, to have Heather Wilson's bill, H.R. 1474, brought to the House floor under the suspensions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to you.

   Rather than working collegially with us, with regard to filing reports, it's just, well, we don't have to do it. We'll just bring it to the floor. It doesn't matter. Really? Is that how we're going to legislate? We're just going to be sloppy about the Nation's business? I don't think that's a proper way of paying respect to our Nation's veterans, and it's very unfortunate. 
   I yield to my colleague, the chairman of the committee, to respond to my question that will you permit, under the suspension of the rules, to consider H.R. 474 when we return after Memorial Day break so that we may honor Raymond Jerry Murphy and rename the Albuquerque VA Medical Center after him.

   Mr. BUYER. I do not yield for a parliamentary inquiry. I think the purpose of my yielding to the chairman was to get a good response, whereby we have criteria, before the committee, with regard to how we name VA medical centers. 
   There is an individual, all the criteria have been satisfied, and I asked a very simple question of the chairman, if he would suspend the rules and bring it to the floor. I have written him twice. He doesn't respond to the letters. It has passed the Senate. A bill lays upon the desk, and I asked a very simple question. 
   All he wants to do is a parliamentary inquiry. So maybe we will be enlightened if I let him do a parliamentary inquiry.

   I suppose what I should do is work with my good friend Mr. Michaud, who is the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, who has the ability to call this bill up and to mark this bill up. Obviously, even though he were to mark this up in the subcommittee, it would still be held at the full committee, if the chairman wants to continue to play politics.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill and compliment Ms. Herseth Sandlin for her work and Mr. Boozman.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill, as amended does two important things. First, it lowers the existing eligibility for servicemembers undergoing treatment prior to discharge to 10 percent vice the current 20 percent. Second, it clarifies existing law to reaffirm Congress' intent that VA provide vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to eligible service members undergoing what is normally long-term convalescence. 
   This bill will be especially important to service members being treated at our major trauma centers such as Walter Reed, Bethesda, Palo Alto and Tampa Bay. Many of these service members are facing what may be years of physical and emotional therapy and it makes good sense to begin the process of reintegration into the workforce prior to discharge from active duty. Voc rehab benefits available under this bill will also provide positive reinforcement to DoD and VA therapy sessions by concentrating on issues other than any residual disability(s) they may have from their injuries. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this bill to the Veterans' Affairs Committee and for his interest in outreach. 
   In the bill previous to this one, I brought up an issue with regard to how we give proper recognition to a Medal of Honor recipient, Jerry Murphy of New Mexico. Jerry Murphy, in his tenure at the Department of Veterans Affairs, even after he retired, was a champion of veterans outreach. Like many of my comrades, when they come back from war, they have seen a lot of things, far worse than what I have ever seen. They call themselves generally, Mr. McIntyre, the lucky ones, because one of their friends or buddies is in worse shape than what they are; they dedicate their lives to them. 
   That's exactly what Jerry Murphy did in his tenure, not only serving the Department of Veterans Affairs, but, in addition, he was the director of the Veterans Services Division of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, regional VA office from 1974 to 1997. This individual, dedicated his life and received not only the Medal of Honor, he also received the Silver Star. 
   What I would like to do, so America can reach out and touch and understand the type of individual who would dedicate his life to the service of his comrades, and he would push them in a wheelchair, take them to an appointment in that hospital. The individual he was pushing, they had no idea that they were being pushed by a Medal of Honor recipient. 
   This individual, Raymond G. Murphy, was a second lieutenant in the United States Marines Reserve, Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, and 3 February of 1953 was an important date, because on that date, for his conspicuous gallantry, and the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of Company A, and actions against an enemy aggressor force, he rose up and distinguished himself. 
   The citation that he received when he was given the Congressional Medal of Honor stated that although painfully wounded by fragments of an enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground, Second Lieutenant Murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-arms fire, skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement. 
   Undeterred by increasing intense enemy fire, he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams for the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety. 
   When reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements, Second Lieutenant Murphy employed part of his unit as support, and, during the ensuing battle, he killed two of the enemy with his pistol. 
   With all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of the friendly forces off the hill, and, through the suffering of intense pain from his previous wounds, seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared in the trenches. 
   After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party again to ascend the slope for a final check on missing marines. Locating and carrying the bodies of a marine gun crew back down the hill, he was wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms, artillery, mortar fire. 
   He also, once again, refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men, including all casualties, had preceded him to the main line. His resolute, inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Second Lieutenant Raymond Murphy, and he enhanced the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. 
   This was the citation he received, was given to him when he received the Medal of Honor. This is the same individual whereby the three members of the New Mexico delegation, led by HEATHER WILSON, have brought a bill, H.R. 474, to the floor about the VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he worked. As a matter of fact, he was always the humble servant. Even after his retirement, as I said, he became a volunteer. 
   This brave marine, who earned the Medal of Honor, chose to be buried wearing his VA hospital volunteer smock. This is the type of individual of whom, at a moment like this, as we go into Memorial Day, we think of these individuals, not only what they have done, not only at the moment of calling, it was most difficult during war, but then how did they dedicate their life. 
   Memorial Day, yes, it's that day, but it's also a day whereby, not those who just died in service to country, but what do they do later on with their life, and we think of them. Here is a gentleman, Mr. McIntyre, I know exactly this is the type of person you are thinking about, who dedicated themselves to outreach. 
   So I ask you to talk to the chairman, because he is the sole impediment as to why the House and the Senate do not honor this gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, this bill would authorize the VA Secretary to build a national cemetery in Southern Colorado. 
   Providing our veterans with a place of honor of repose is one of the most sacred missions of the veterans committee, and we have accorded this mission our support over the years. 
   The National Cemetery Administration's record of satisfaction among the families and its beneficiaries is the envy of the Federal Government, a reflection of the sound administration, the strong congressional support, free of political influence. Yet I have some concerns about the bill. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs has a well-established and proven method that uses distance and demographics to select cemetery sites. Congress has long deferred to that process, which is essentially free from this institution's political pressures. Since 1999, Congress has authorized 12 new national cemeteries, all of which went through this process. In the absence of political pressures, the Nation has benefited with a rational distribution of cemeteries that serve veterans their families, and the Nation very well. 
   This region of Colorado is not on any of the VA's strategic plans for new cemeteries in the next 20 years, nor was it identified by an independent 2002 Logistics Management Institute study that listed the areas with the greatest need for a national cemetery all the way to the year 2030. 
   Nonetheless, we have before us a bill to develop a cemetery in Southern Colorado, which has not been identified as a priority in any of these studies. Therefore, I ask the chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee if you have now, since having brought this bill to the floor, developed criteria with regard to the development of VA national cemeteries whereby Members will know what to follow when they file bills before your committee? I yield to the gentleman.

I would like to work with the chairman, because I believe in that answer we do not have the criteria at this moment, and I think all the Members in this body need to know what the criteria would be with regard to placing a VA national cemetery. We have given such  deference to the executive branch. And I know that both gentlemen from Colorado brought up the issue to us about rural areas in the country and felt that, given the way that these studies were structured, that this VA cemetery could never be built. So given that deference, the chairman was very responsive to you. 
   We took up an amendment by Mr. Stearns, which both of the gentlemen from Colorado had agreed to, whereby we did not want this to displace any of the other present cemeteries in the present priority. 
   I respect the gentleman, and I want to work with the chairman on coming up with criteria.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the chairman for amending this legislation to address my concern that, as originally drafted, the bill did not provide equity for those veterans whose eligibility period would have expired prior to the enactment of this bill. 
   At my request, the bill was amended to make sure that those veterans whose eligibility period had ended prior to the enactment and did not enroll in the VA health care would be eligible for an additional 3 years of VA health care services. All veterans who served in combat should receive the same level of care, and I appreciate the chairman for adopting and agreeing to this amendment. 
   In 1993, Congress enacted Public Law 103-210 to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide additional authority for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide health care for veterans of the Persian Gulf War. 
   The special health care authority allowed VA to treat those veterans who served in combat operations in the Persian Gulf for possible war-related illnesses, even though there was not definitive evidence that the disorders treated were related to wartime service. 
   Subsequent congressional hearings on Persian Gulf veterans health care highlighted the importance of early intervention in treating the kind of unexplained health problems experienced by many Persian Gulf war veterans. 
   In 1998, with the potential of renewed combat in the Persian Gulf, Public Law 105-368, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, was enacted. This law authorizes the VA to provide medical care and other medical services to combat veterans for a period of 2 years following the service separation date for veterans who served on active duty in theater of combat operations during a period of war after the Persian Gulf War, or in combat against a hostile force during a period of hostilities after November 11 of 1998. Members of the National Guard and Reserves may be eligible for this care if they meet certain requirements which essentially satisfy the definition of a ``veteran.'' 
   The experience of the 1990s taught us the importance of both increasing understanding of war-related illnesses generally, and ensuring that the VA is better prepared to treat veterans of future wars and military combat. 
   I would also, at this moment, like to thank my colleague, Mr. Salazar of Colorado, who shared with me his statement that he gave honoring the life of a great American, Raymond Gerald Murphy. And I had an opportunity to read his statement that he read into the Congressional Record, and I appreciate him honoring such an American. My only regret is that I never had an opportunity to meet someone like this. And I'm sure that he touched the lives of many, many people. 
   And so I suppose where we are, Mr. Speaker, is that with regard to how we recognize this Medal of Honor recipient by naming the hospital after him, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has specific criteria that we are to go by. And when you look at the specific criteria, we satisfy all the criteria. He's a Medal of Honor recipient. He has letters of support from all the veterans groups in the State of New Mexico, all of the recognized organizations, I have their letters here, Mr. Speaker, I'll be more than happy to get them to you, along with the support of the Governor, all the Members of Congress, and we should be able to get this done. There's no reason why we shouldn't. 
   So here we have a situation whereby the committee has specific criteria for the naming of a VA hospital. This Medal of Honor recipient clearly applies. It passed the Senate. Yet we don't have criteria, as the chairman just spoke on the last bill, with regard to the naming of a cemetery. Yet we did it just for a political reason. And so now it's difficult for me to figure out how to follow the leadership of the chairman. 
   We don't have criteria, but we take action on the floor. But where we do have criteria, we don't take action on the floor. So it is a puzzling moment that we have in how we are bringing these veterans bills to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Michaud, as well as the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Miller, for their leadership in developing this legislation. 
   H.R. 2199, as amended, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act of 2007, seeks to improve the treatment of veterans suffering with traumatic brain injuries, often referred to as TBI, and the care for veterans who live in rural communities.     
   However, I would comment that several of the provisions included in this legislation are similar to initiatives that already exist or are getting underway. For example, section 2 of the bill would require the VA to screen eligible veterans for symptoms of traumatic brain injury and create a TBI registry. These are also the recommendations of the President's task force on returning global war on terror heroes. In addition, in March 2007, Secretary Nicholson directed a number of changes to improve the way the VA provides care to our newest combat veterans. 
   These veterans initiatives include screening all OEF and OIF combat patients for TBI and for PTSD; providing each polytrauma patient with an advocate to assist them and their family; mandatory training for all VA health care personnel to recognize and care for patients with TBI; and establishing an outside panel of clinical experts to review the VA polytrauma system of care. 
   Additionally, the bill would provide five new centers for TBI research, education, and clinical activities. During the 108th Congress, we recognized the frequency and unique nature of the polytrauma/blast injuries resulting from the global war on terror. These injuries require an interdisciplinary program to handle the medical, psychological, rehabilitation, and prosthetic needs of the injured servicemember. 
   Public Law 108-422, the Veterans' Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004, directed VA to establish ``an appropriate number of centers for research, education, and clinical activities to improve and coordinate rehabilitative services for veterans suffering from complex multitrauma from combat injuries, and to coordinate these services with the Department of Defense.'' 
   The centers required in Public Law 108-422 became the Polytrauma System of Care. There are four centers located in Richmond, VA; Tampa, FL; Minneapolis, MN; and Palo Alto, CA. The committee strongly recommends that the new TBI centers be colocated with the VA's polytrauma rehabilitation centers. In this way, we can capitalize on the experience and expertise available at the polytrauma centers and enhance the ability to understand and treat the entire spectrum of the TBI injury from mild to most severe. 
   I want to thank Mr. Michaud for recognizing that we can actually get some benefits by the colocation of these services where TBI is already located. Because we take and concentrate such expertise, the colocation can only have benefits. And the gentleman worked with me, and I think because TBI have a number of comorbidities such as PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, and while these issues may appear with TBI, they may also exhibit themselves separately from TBI, and I think that is exactly what Mr. Michaud is trying to get to. So I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership and for bringing this bill to the committee, along with your staff, for their good work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to express my support for a provision in the bill that would require the VA to establish a TBI transition office at each of the polytrauma network sites. Not only is this vital for the DOD and the VA to provide for a seamless transition from active duty to veteran status, but it is also important for VA to aid in the coordination of veteran care between VA and other health care providers for services that could possibly not be provided by the VA. These transition offices would help coordinate veterans care for services not offered by the VA, and have the authority to arrange care with public or private entities to establish long-term neurobehavioral rehabilitation and recovery programs. 
   The bill also includes two rural health initiative provisions, one of which would establish a pilot program for vet centers in rural areas. H.R. 2199, as amended, included an amendment  offered by Mr. Lamborn of Colorado, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. This amendment will expand the role of the mobile vet center pilot program to include helping veterans in need of assistance in the filing of benefits claims.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments that he just made. Before you take off, this issue, and I appreciate your interest in it because this is one of our great challenges. We've got the best helmet that we put on our soldiers and marines in the field and even some of the Air Force personnel, Navy personnel. And it protects them against ballistics, and it's the best in the world. But when it comes to blasts and crash, what it does to the brain, we're now on the forefront, and we are pushing the boundary of our knowledge. 
   And some of the world's experts now are not only at the polytrauma centers, but in particular, when these soldiers end up at Landstuhl, Germany, that's where they are. So they can immediately deal with these neurotraumas. 
   And when the gentleman said that there could possibly be thousands, what we do know is that at the polytrauma centers, those who are actually being treated for traumatic brain injury, there's less than 400 cases. 
   But the gentleman is right with regard to individuals who may have had a concussion. Yet, how severe is the concussion? 
   And if the science is unknown, and we're trying to understand that. That's the purpose of Mr. Michaud's bill. And I appreciate the gentleman's interest, would love to continue to work with you in your interest. 
   I'd bring to your attention the Veterans Health Administration Directive 2007-013 released April 13, 2007, establishes the VA policy and procedure for screening and evaluation of possible TBI in OEF and OIF veterans. This directive states, ``Not all patients who screen positive have TBI. It is possible to respond positively to all four sections due to the presence of other conditions such as PTSD, cervical cranial injury with headaches and inner ear injury, for example. Therefore, it's critical that patients not be labeled with a diagnosis of TBI on the basis of a positive screening test. Patients need to be referred for further evaluation.'' 
   So we are in an area of science whereby the sand shifts directly under our feet, and I would look forward to working with the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve my time.

   Mr. BUYER. I have come to the floor because what is clear is there are no disagreements with regard to the VA-Milcon appropriations bill. There is no disagreement between the House, the Senate or the White House, which means that weeks ago we should have appointed conferees and we should have voted on this bill if in fact our priority, in a bipartisan way, is clearly that of the troops. 
   So I come to the well really bothered here today. The word ``gamesmanship'' has been used. The word ``partisanship'' has been used. When it comes to funding our troops, those words should never be used. A few years ago, almost 2 1/2 years ago, I met with Republican leadership and I wanted to get politics out of the military health delivery system and the VA. That is when I said get HUD out of VA and let's combine this. So what we have done by doing VA and MilCon, we do this so the authorizers and the appropriators can work together on the seamless transition issues so we get politics out of the arena. 
   And now to take this bill to which there are no disagreements and to attach it to a vehicle where there are disagreements, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) is absolutely correct, it places the bill at risk. 
   The last speaker talked about HHS. I am here to talk about funding veterans and our troops and the dependents and their families. We shouldn't be playing these games with the White House if our priorities are truly with America's most precious assets, and that is the men and women who wear the uniform, and to care for those who keep the watch fires burning and their children. So let's don't play these games. 
   I have to agree with John Boehner. There is a reason the American people look at Congress with a 14 percent approval rating. It is because of these types of games. 
   We are better than this. We are better than this. So let's come together like we passed this bill 138 days ago and keep our bipartisanship and send this bill to the President.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, in the fall of 2005, I had the House Veterans' Affairs Committee track OIF and OEF dental costs in the VA. In the fall of 2006, I requested the Army to report on and document Army reserve component dental demobilization treatment costs. 
   The Army Medical Command tasked its DENCOM to then study and document demobilization dental treatment requirements no later than 30 November, 2006. This study was considered insufficient by the then Surgeon General, General Kiley. We then spoke. He then instituted another study that was conducted in the fall of 2007. 
   I was briefed on the second study this past February by the Chief of the Army Dental Corps in San Antonio, Texas, and considered this study seriously flawed in its methodology, study construct, and assumptions. The DENCOM told me that dental care during demobilization was not their mission. 
   Shockingly, I then called upon General Cody, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; and Lieutenant General Schoomaker, the Army Surgeon General, the next day to express my concerns with the study and the lack of mission concern by the General of the Army Dental Corps for the demobilization dental requirements of our returning soldiers. 
   General Cody then quickly convened a study group to identify options and expeditious solutions to provide the same level of mobilization and demobilization dental care to the reserve components as it provides to the active component. General Cody signed the decision brief that recognizes and funds this serious gap in reserve component dental care. He signed the two decision memos last Friday, the day after the Armed Services Committee marked up the bill. I spoke then with the Vice Chief of the Army on Friday. 
   The amendment that I offer fully supports General Cody's decision to fund $22.3 million for mobilization and $8.5 million for demobilization of the reserve component dental readiness for fiscal year 2009. General Cody's decision will fund 2008 requests out of existing funds resulting in a rapid, measurable improvement, I believe, in overall reserve component readiness. 
   In an informal request of CBO, I've been informed that this amendment will have no impact on direct spending revenues.  
   I would like to thank Chairman Skelton,, Ranking Member Hunter Congresswoman Susan Davis, Congressman John McHugh, and Congressman Vic Snyder, as well as the staff of the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Republican alternative budget for fiscal year 2009. Overall, the Republican budget is $95.6 billion, the Democratic budget is $94.6 billion, and the President's mark is $93.6 billion. 
   Our budget will provide $49.2 billion in discretionary funding for veterans health care and programs. This is $2 billion above the administration's overall request and it is $1 billion over the Democrats' budget, and we do all of this without a $683 billion tax hike. 
   Out of the $49.2 billion in discretionary, $44.2 billion is medical care for FY 09. The House Republicans would provide nearly $1 billion more than the President's request. Included in that: We have about $213 million for mental health care; we increase $200 million more for improving health care to rural veterans; $150 million more on long-term care; $50 million more on medical care for veterans for OEF and OIF; we have $50 million more on dental care, which we also ought to be billing the Army for providing a lot of this. We also have $50 million more than the administration for polytrauma care and for caring for veterans with brain injury, i.e., traumatic or mild. 
   Republicans would also provide nearly $100 million more than the administration's request for medical and prosthetic research. We also add an additional $300 million for medical facilities and nonrecurring maintenance. 
   Mr. Chairman, to assist in the decreasing of the claims backlog and increased cybersecurity, we increase $200  million for the Office of Information Technology. Part of this money we are investing in funding to create rules-based adjudication systems for the veterans disability compensation claims. 
   The alternative also includes increases over the President's level in all funding categories, including the Office of Inspector General, grants for State cemeteries and extended care facilities and the National Cemetery Administration, among others. 
   Now, when we look at what the Democrat budget is doing, we have got a tax increase. This tax increase would hit middle-income veterans and their families, veterans who are low-income earners, and veterans who own small businesses. However, the Republican alternative would increase spending for veterans by $1 billion more than the Democrat budget, and we do this without increasing taxes on veterans. 
   I also would like everyone to note that I noticed, when I was back in my office watching the floor debate, there was a lot of waving going around of VSO letters. Well, the VSO letters, I think they would also love this Republican budget, because we increased veterans spending $1 billion more than the Democrats. 
   We also need to remember this: The very same Democrat majority this past year in the committee voted to cut $1 billion in veterans benefits. They did this on a party-line vote. They voted to cut $1 billion of veterans benefits, from who? From wartime disabled, elderly, and indigent veterans. So if you want to talk about who is going to stand for veterans, just go look at the vote in the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. They cut $1 billion. 
   Chet, that hurts. I know it is tough for you to defend. You didn't do it, and I know you will not stand for it.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about a highly controversial provision that allows for commercial importation of prescription drugs from any country, regardless of the safety of their prescription drug supply, and includes no safety mechanisms to protect Americans from potentially harmful drug imports. 
   My greatest concern is the number of counterfeit, illegal, and unapproved drugs flowing into the United States right now under a system which is closed to prescription drug imports. Today, Customs and Border Protection estimates that 273,000 prescription drug imports enter our country every single day--of which less than one percent are screened before being sent to Americans' homes. A 2003 report by the FDA found that 88 percent of the medicines imported into the United States were unapproved or otherwise illegal. 
   Mr. Chairman, administration after administration, regardless of the party in control of the White House, has been unable to certify the safety of our prescription drug supply in a market open to prescription drug imports. I strongly oppose prescription drug importation and encourage my colleagues to support the Kingston amendment to strip the appropriations bill of the harmful importation provision.

   We can battle it out. The democratic process is never meant to be pretty and easy.

And that's what kind of happened here, and I'm very bothered by it. 
   There is no ``time of the essence.'' Yes, this is a program that we came together in a bipartisan fashion and passed almost 10 years ago to care for children, poor and impoverished and to take care of them; and we've done that. 
   We can extend that existing program and work together in a bipartisan fashion, if that's what this was really about. But it's not.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express deep sorrow at the passing of our friend and colleague, CHARLIE NORWOOD. While most of us hope to make a difference in this world, CHARLIE NORWOOD certainly did that. He also made a difference in the lives of those who were fortunate enough to have known him. 
   CHARLIE was steadfast and did what he thought was right. He was an immovable object in the defense of principle, and when met with irresistible force, it wasn't likely that CHARLIE was the one who was moved. 
   During the development of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, I worked closely with CHARLIE and several of my colleagues to see if there was an alternative plan and how we were going to work this out. CHARLIE's contributions were insightful, they were valuable, and added considerably to the worth of our final product. During that process, he was constantly mindful of two things, and that was the need to help seniors who had no drug coverage and the need to be wise stewards for taxpayers. 
   Coming to Congress with a medical background, CHARLIE provided a point of view that enhanced any debate he entered. While witnesses before him, at the Health Subcommittee may have cringed at times under his questioning, the responses that were drawn out always added an important dimension to our debates. 
   CHARLIE will be sorely missed: in Congress, in the Health Subcommittee, but more importantly in all our lives. I give my deepest sympathies to his wife, Gloria, his sons Charles and Carlton, and his constituents.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that would provide $7 million of the amount appropriated in the Department of Veterans Affairs' VA Minor Construction account. These moneys shall be used for the VA to install alternative fueling stations at 35 of its medical facility campuses across the country. This is one of many measures that can be taken to address the impact of the rising energy prices and to alleviate our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   We have an energy crisis in this country, and unfortunately, some are not taking action before we leave on this August break. The House will recess, and we'll go 5 weeks, and we'll not be taking up meaningful energy legislation, but we have an opportunity tonight. 
   It was in 2007 that President Bush issued executive order 13423, ``strengthening Federal environment, energy and transportation management,'' mandating a reduction of the amount of petroleum consumption for Federal transportation. 
   In compliance with the President's order, the VA has taken steps to install E-85, ethanol fueling stations, at six VA medical centers--in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in Augusta, Georgia, in Cleveland, Ohio, in Danville, Illinois, in Little Rock, Arkansas, and most recently in San Francisco, California. 
   I would think that Speaker Pelosi would want other VA facilities in other States and members' districts to have the very same fueling stations that are available at the San Francisco VA medical center in her own congressional district. 
   According to the VA, it has nearly 11,000 vehicles that collectively travel more than 100 million miles a year. The VA acquired over 1,000 Alternative Fuel Vehicles in FY 2007, and 99 percent of these are flexible fuel vehicles that can use E-85. The installation of alternative fuel stations at more VA sites would have a huge impact on the reduction of greenhouse gases and in the amount of petroleum consumed. Based on recent discussions with the Department, I am confident that, if funding is provided, the VA could install alternative fueling stations at the 35 additional sites. 
   Mr. Edwards knows full well that he is about $662 million above the President's request and nearly $361 million more than in FY 2008. 
   So, again, in facing the tremendous energy challenge in this Nation, we must act collectively in a bipartisan fashion to reduce our dependence on bad actors around the world that control our energy supplies. There are more than a dozen alternative and advanced fuels in production and that used today, one of which is E-85, an 85 percent ethanol mixture, which in the United States is based primarily on corn. Investing in the use of alternative transportation fuel services is one way to help increase the supply of American-made fuel. 
   I think Mr. Edwards and I would agree we're anxious to get to nonedible fiber--cellulosic ethanol. 
   This use of renewable domestic energy sources will contribute to an enhancement of energy security, and it will reduce the reliance on foreign oil. The installation of alternative fueling stations on VA campuses will reduce greenhouse emissions and the VA's gasoline costs, and it will provide funds for direct health care services for the men and women who have taken the oath to defend the freedoms and our way of life. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I would like to thank Chairman Chet Edwards. I would like to thank Zach Wamp. And to my good friend from Texas that I've worked with for many years, we have a challenge in front of us with regard to an amendment. And the challenge is that I've prepared an amendment that $150 million, Mr. Chairman, would be dedicated under the minor construction account--for which there's a lot of dollars here--for the installation of appropriate solar electric energy roof applications. 
   Now, we had several meetings, Chairman Edwards, with a lot of lawyers, and the lawyers were looking at the applications of the rules and the processes. The interesting thing is, when we drafted the amendment--we're having the conversation that you said we didn't have time to do in private, so we're having to do it in public. So I have to do it now before we actually get into the details of the amendment. 
   So when I did the amendment, we put it at the end, on page 41 here, line 14. Now, when I put it there on the applications of solar, my assumption is that when you then look at all the general authorities, section 316, that's about colocation authority; section 2404, that's administration; 2406 is acquisition; 8102 is also acquisition--one is acquisition of land, 2406; 8102 is acquisition of medical facilities; 8103, that's minor construction. All these other sections have nothing to do with solar. 
   So my assumption, Mr. Chairman, when I put this in here, I did not put at the end of the amendment ``at VA medical facilities.'' My assumption is that, well, we're not going to put it on tombstones, we're not going to put it in a parking lot, and it doesn't apply anywhere else. 
   But when I talked with the lawyers, they're like, you know, Steve, you just can't do it like that. And you need to actually have at the end the words ``at VA medical facilities.'' So now I've got myself in a bit of a jam. 
   Now, Mr. Edwards, we can do this several ways: I could offer the amendment. I could then present all the arguments of solar and what the VA is presently doing in the 16 sites that they're proceeding with. And if you say, well, but I don't like the amount, I could do a UC, we could agree to a particular amount, we could add the language. We go to conference. If you say, nope, we're not going to have anything, okay. Well, what could I do? I could look at your language--which is general language--and say, well, that's fine; whatever you do at conference, that's fine with me. I'll just go down and I'll work with the Secretary. I'll negotiate with the Secretary and I'll take whatever those monies are and we'll do it that way. 
   But what I want to do with you, Chairman Edwards, is that you and I have worked together a lot over the years. And you and I are in agreement when it comes to alternative sources of energy. So let's be practical. If you want to say to me, Steve, don't do $150 million; lower the amount, add the language, we'll work this out in conference and we'll work with the Secretary, that's how we work these things out. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would provide $150 million of the amount appropriated in the Department of Veterans Affairs minor construction account for the installation of solar electronic roof applications. 
   Qualified solar technologies to be considered included, but not limited to,  distributed thin-film solar, amorphous crystalline, nano photovoltaic, and technology systems. What we're trying to do is harness the energy of the sun. 
   Alternative and renewable sources, such as solar power--whether it's wind, geothermal, hydrogen, biomass--all of these are extremely important. They play an important role in addressing rising energy prices and alleviate our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   We have an energy crisis in this country. Peak oil is approaching year 2037. We need to rebalance the Nation's portfolio. And in order to do that, we increase our Nation's energy supply to bridge ourselves beyond the alternative energy future in which we seek. We must begin to act and to take decisive measures to address the impact of high energy costs on the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   VA medical centers consume large amounts of energy, especially for advanced technologies such as CAT scans, MRIs, that are necessary to provide state-of-the-art medical technologies. 
   Between 2005 and 2007, VA's energy costs increased by 20 percent. Last year, the VA identified 16 potential sites for solar projects. It's in Calverton, New York; Gustine, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Fresno, California; West Los Angeles, California; Loma Linda, California; Long Beach, California; Dallas, Texas; Palo Alto, California; Sheridan, Wyoming; Reno, Nevada; Tucson, Arizona; Syracuse, New York; Buffalo, New York; West Haven, Connecticut; and Albany, New York. Yes, I am on the floor asking that we fund 11 Democrat districts and five Republican. 
   Last year, when they identified these, they did feasibility studies with regard to these 16 sites. This summer, the VA plans to move forward to install rooftop solar systems at two sites, Loma Linda and Dallas. 
   Solar technologies, they diversify our energy supply, they reduce our dependence on imported fuels, improve our air quality, and offset greenhouse gases. 
   And I'm also interested that, as we move toward American-made energy solutions, that we buy solar systems that are made in America, not ones that are made in China or in Germany or in other places. We should do it here. 
   At this point, I would like to clarify the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my amendment, after the word ``applications,'' insert the following: ``At VA medical facilities.'' 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Indiana?

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, it is important that we continue to invest now to reduce the energy costs into the future. The opportunity to employ this technology at the VA, the second largest department within the Federal Government, is now. 
   Now, I had hoped that we could have done this tonight. I'll continue to work with you, Mr. Chairman. 
   To the country, this isn't a good message to send. I will speak with the Secretary in the morning. I will work with him. I will let him know that you're sending down $662 million above the President's request, $361 million more than FY08. And because he has, right now, these 16 projects, I believe there's more than sufficient funds here to move on solar applications. 
   I would have hoped that we could have done this in a bipartisan fashion; that is really unfortunate. And I will work with the Secretary to ensure that alternative sources of energy are used in the VA. 
   With that, I yield back my time.

   Mr. BUYER. First, it's very unfortunate that solar would be kicked out on an attempt of a technicality. Let me go right to the point of order. 
   The amendment refers to title 38, U.S. Code, Section 8103. It provides VA the authority to ``construct'' and ``alter.'' So you can see that in the very first line; so 8103(a)(1) ``may construct or alter any medical facility.'' Now, it's any medical facility as the Secretary considers necessary for use of the site. Section 8101 of title 38, United States Code, defines the term ``alter'' with respect to medical facility means to repair, remodel, improve, or extend. So this section 8103 is general authority. Specific authority would come under--and this is minor construction. So under general authority, the Secretary has great discretion. With regard to specific authority, it would come under Section 8104. That would be designations of CBOCs, anything above $10 million comes under Section 8104. 
   What I refer to, and this is what the Parliamentarians make sure everybody has, it's the House Practice guide, the Guide to the Rules, Precedents, and Procedures of the House. So when I go to page 84, the authorization from specific statutes in this paragraph, Mr. Chairman, so this was page 84, and it's entitled under Authorization From Specific Statutes Or General Existing Law; so what I have done is refer to the general law, not the specific. This is the general law. ``Authorization for a program may be derived from a specific law providing authority for that particular program or from a more general existing law,'' which means organic law, or ``authorizing appropriations for such programs.'' 
   So what's happened over the years, it's not like the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Edwards. 
   Mr. Chairman, we don't bring that annual VA authorization bill. So what has happened over the decades, Mr. Chairman, is that we have always relied on the 8103 as the general authority provision. 
   Now, if you say, well, Steve, when you look at this amendment, when you look at the amendment, because you don't put ``VA facility'' at the end, well, then we might interpret that as applications to all other sections. Mr. Chairman, that's why I said the mistake that was made was, was that all of these other sections don't even apply to solar. There's only one of these sections that would apply to solar, and that is the medical facilities section, and that is the 8103. 
   So my appeal to you is that by putting this solar amendment here at the end of the paragraph, there is only one section here in which it applies to, and that's section 8103. 
   So when the chairman said you don't have the authorization, I would appeal to the Chair that general authority exists within the minor construction statute for us to do this, and that would be my argument on the point of order. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard?

   Mr. BUYER. Part of the challenges that we have been dealing with, some have to do with fiction. The Speaker was just on the floor and referred to promises. If the Speaker would not leave the floor--Madam Speaker? 
   How fascinating. You see, the Speaker was just on the floor, Mr. Chairman, and spoke fiction. While there had been anecdotal accounts of such promises which she has referred to, there have been no official written accounts of these promises. CRS has done an extensive research of the papers and writings of both President Roosevelt and General MacArthur and have not found any written proof that these promises were made. 
   It is very unfortunate that the Speaker would not have stuck around to listen to that. Several requests for her to stay on the floor, she turns and just walked on out. Now, why would she do that? She doesn't want to hear the truth. It is better to stand on the floor and just say this.

   Mr. BUYER. I appreciate the chairman having withdrawn the amendment since the Parliamentarians were about to rule in my favor, so I appreciate that, that the comments were parliamentary and permissible on the floor. 
   Let me say, the challenge that we have had here in the committee is that when Mr. Filner brought his bill he needed an offset, and the offset is that in order to come up with $1 billion, he used the Hartness decision. And that would take $1 billion from American veterans. Now, that is what got us all into this. 
   Now, the gentleman brings an amendment and tries to say, oh, no, I don't want to use the Hartness decision. The Hartness decision is extremely important, Mr. Chairman, and I want to address it here for a moment. Because in the committee itself, when I tried to strike the offset, I was defeated on a party-line vote. And there would be a tough vote here on the floor if we were going to vote to repeal Hartness. 
   The Hartness decision is that we give a pension to individuals who served during a period of war, are elderly, severely disabled, and indigent. It is bothersome to me that we would deny these individuals that pension to then give to someone else. Therein lies the challenge. 
   Chairman Edwards and I had a good conversation, and it is the offset with which many of us are uncomfortable about, and we are trying to figure out how best to navigate our way through this issue. And in the same spirit in which we are going to work on solar, we are going to work on this issue. But we are not going to repeal Hartness. 
   Hartness comes from a 2006 United States Court of Appeals veterans claims decision that overturned the Department of Veterans Affairs decision that denied an 86-year-old legally blind World War II veteran, Robert A. Hartness, a VA benefit called a special monthly pension. That is what they wanted to overturn. 
   The court reversed the VA's denial of benefits to Mr. Hartness, and required the VA to begin making those payments. The court held that the U.S. law requires an award of the special monthly pension to a veteran eligible for VA nonservice-connected disability pension if, in addition to being at least 65 years of age, he or she has a minimum disability rating of 60 percent or more, or is considered permanently housebound. 
   The VA determined Mr. Hartness to be 70 percent disabled due to loss of vision, and the VA has also determined that this offset would affect about 20,000 who would file for this type of decision. 
   So I am most hopeful, I know there is some agreement among myself and other members on both sides of the aisle that if we want to address the issue regarding the Filipino War Veterans of World War II issue, that should be addressed as a standalone. Let's do not repeal or overturn the  Hartness decision because you need $1 billion and so we are going to take it from World War II elderly, disabled, housebound veterans. That is a little bizarre and disturbing to me. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you in opposition to this resolution. Once again, it champions a dismally irresponsible and dangerous course of action. Setting a date certain for withdrawal of our troops from Iraq would envelope Iraq in a cloud of chaos and self destruction and expose us to a heightened threat of terrorism at home. It ignores the President's plan for success in totality. It makes no consideration for the effort to make progress on diplomatic and economic fronts--essential components for that success to occur. They offer no solutions in this bill, only criticism. 
   Mr. HOYER's failed attempt on April 19th to correlate my involvement regarding the U.S. efforts in Bosnia in the 1990s to that of the situation in Iraq today stretches into the realm of absurdity. However, what was clear from that debate was that Mr. HOYER at the time, as well as Mr. MURTHA, agreed that we should not tie the hands of our President in military operations, even in operations that the Congress did not approve. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me refresh everyone's memories of that debate which took place in this Chamber, a debate in which I was the lead sponsor of three significant resolutions or amendments that set the course of this Congress--all three which passed by significant margins with support from both sides of the aisle. 
   But before I begin let me remind the Nation that there are significant differences and some similarities between the debate of Bosnia and today in Iraq. First, Congress did not authorize the President to use force in Bosnia. Congress did authorize the President to use military force in Iraq. Second, we did not begin the conflict in Bosnia, but we did in Iraq. Third, the Republican majority in Congress did in fact try to work with President Clinton to find a solution. Former Senator Bob Dole and I with others traveled with President Clinton to Bosnia and worked with him to set benchmarks for the civil implementation of the Dayton Accords. I did not assign a date certain to define success for each benchmark, this would have been folly. At the time the leaders of the peace were once leaders during the war and they focused more on these differences than that which brought them together as a nation. President Clinton did a very good job focusing the Bosnian leaders to accomplish the benchmarks and move to resolve their differences and build their new nation. 
   Last week on the House Floor my colleague, STENY HOYER attempted to re-write the history of my involvement, claiming that I supported a date certain for withdrawal of our troops from Bosnia and therefore I should do the same with our forces in Iraq. The two contexts are dissimilar. Let me set the record straight. 
   On October 30, 1995, the House agreed to House Resolution 247, a bill that I sponsored with my Democrat colleague, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, by a vote of 315 to 103. Representatives HOYER, MURTHA, and PELOSI voted ``no,'' Mr. SKELTON voted ``yes.'' The bill stated that there should not be a presumption that the United States Armed Forces would be deployed to enforce a peace agreement that resulted from the negotiations regarding the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
   In early December 1995, the Dayton Accords concluded, laying a basis for the path to peace in Bosnia. 
   On December 13, 1995, I sponsored House Resolution 302 with IKE SKELTON, a bipartisan bill that passed the House by a vote of 287 to 141. Representatives HOYER, MURTHA, and PELOSI voted ``no.'' That bill reiterated the serious concerns and opposition to the President's policy that would result in the deployment of 20,000 members of the U.S. Armed Forces on the ground in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
   Despite the expressed will of the House, President Clinton chose to proceed with the deployment of those members of the Armed Forces to enforce the Dayton peace agreement in Bosnia. H.R. 302 declared the policy of the House was that the President should rely on the judgment of the commanders of U.S. forces on the ground on all matters affecting safety, support, and well being of U.S. forces. Congress also declared to furnish the resources to support the needs of President and the Secretary of Defense. 
   Also on December 13, 1995, the President expressed to Congress that the military mission in Bosnia would be accomplished in 1 year, and our troops would be pulled out no later than December 1996. No one believed that the goal could be accomplished within 1 year. A date certain does not define success, the mission does. 
   However, despite that assertion, in November 1996, without the consent of Congress, President Clinton announced that the timeline was slipping and that our troops would not be withdrawn until June 1998. 
   By that point, the United States Armed Forces had acted quickly to achieve their military objectives in Bosnia. In short order, the courage, dedication, and professionalism of those personnel resulted in a significant mitigation of the violence and suffering in that region. 
   However, the implementation of the civil infrastructure--the humanitarian support, the establishment of a judicial system and a validated police force--all of the fundamental parts that help make a society function had stalled and there was no definitive plan to remedy the situation. 
   In response, on June 24, 1997, I offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 that passed the House by a vote of 278 to 148. Representatives HOYER, MURTHA, and PELOSI voted ``no'', SKELTON voted ``yes.'' That amendment would have cut funding to U.S. military operations in Bosnia after June 30, 1998--a date set by the President. I did not set the date Mr. Hoyer, this was President Clinton's date. This amendment was later incorporated into the conference report that included provisions that would allow U.S. forces to remain if the President made certain certifications and accomplished certain benchmarks. While I used the date certain given to us by the President, I made it clear that I supported benchmarks that set the conditions for a withdrawal of U.S. forces after the mission had been successfully completed. 
   President Clinton had set an arbitrary date without articulating a comprehensive plan--he did not identify the conditions to be met into order to trigger a troop withdrawal from Bosnia. He simply set a date, and then revised that date. We in Congress took that date, and required certain benchmarks to be met, while at the same time allowing the President the flexibility to allow troops to remain if he thought it was in the interests of U.S. national security. 
   In Bosnia, we worked in a bipartisan manner with the President to set the conditions for success in Bosnia and gave the President maximum flexibility. Today, this President gets no such deference or flexibility from the Democrat majority. Mr. HOYER and Mr. MURTHA want to enforce a date certain for this President. They do not want to work with this President to set the conditions for success. They simply want to trigger a date for withdrawal, before the mission is done. 
   It is ironic that Mr. HOYER and Mr. MURTHA voted against that amendment--they did not want to set a date certain for withdrawal and tie the hands of their President. They wanted to give him the latitude that he needed to insure that the mission in Bosnia met with success; to re-establish civility, an effective government, a validated police force and civil infrastructure. Today, their position is the opposite. President Bush is not setting a date certain as President Clinton had done. 
   Speaker PELOSI, Majority Leader HOYER and Mr. MURTHA all are seeking to tie the hands of this President. They want to cut off funds to our forces who are only doing what this Congress has asked them to do. 
   Congress should not tie the hands of the President with a date certain for withdrawal from Iraq. Unlike President Clinton with Bosnia, President Bush had the approval of Congress to go into Iraq. He has given us a plan, conditions that must be met before we start to bring our troops home. Yet, Mr. HOYER and his party want to set an arbitrary date, a date certain for withdrawal that does not correspond to those conditions whatsoever--cut off funding for our troops who seek only to succeed in their mission. This is defeatist strategy. 
   We need to help establish a stable Iraq before we withdrawal our forces--the provisions in this bill do not allow us that flexibility and  the price that we will pay is chaos in Iraq and further exposure to terror here at home. 
   The majority leader of the Senate, HARRY REID talks about polling data from Senator SCHUMER that indicate ``political'' gains by their party on Iraq. It is unfortunate that the Democrat majority think of Iraq in terms of political points, not national security. If we do not resolve this issue with immediacy, the readiness of our troops will be compromised. They are struggling to determine how they will redistribute funds to pay for their operations while we are here politicking. We must stop the defeatist strategy of the majority now--the one by which they hope to gain political capital from to the detriment of our troops in the field.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am coming to the floor deeply disappointed that the Rules Committee has denied two amendments that would have protected veterans. We in the VA maintain a national formulary based on a system of deep discounts on prescription drugs through a system of price controls, and we maintain this national formulary. We're able to do that because we are able to purchase drugs at 76 percent of the non-Federal average manufacturing price.     
   It is a price control. But what is happening? The onslaught of the Democrat majority against pharmaceutical manufacturers continues. They want now to extend the price controls, VA pricing, now into DOD. 
   All I asked for was an amendment. The amendment would have asked for a certification from the Secretary of Defense to this Congress that their ambition to do this would not increase prices on our veterans. 
   The VA national formulary amounts to about 1 percent of the pharmaceutical marketplace. The more we extend these price controls, whether it goes into the DOD TRICARE pharmacy, they even want to extend it into Medicare. As you do that, we continue to cost shift. 
   I am deeply disappointed that the Democrat majority would make this onslaught, not just against pharmaceutical manufacturers, that gets their political juices going, but in the meantime they are going to smack veterans right in the face. It is very disappointing. Now, it is a simple amendment, and they should have made it in order. 
   There was a second amendment. The second amendment that I asked to be in order, that was also denied, was that I asked that with regard to this provision, whereby the Secretary of Defense may now be able to deny a drug being placed on the TRICARE formulary, if they do not offer the Federal pricing schedule, I asked that, with regard to this provision the Secretary shall not be able to exclude from the pharmacy benefits program any pharmaceutical agent that the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee determines to be clinically effective or that the patient or the provider demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee that it is clinically necessary. That's denied also. 
   I am stunned. I am stunned. But let's be very clear, America, what is happening. This is a socialist policy. You say oh, my gosh, Steve, don't use the word ``socialist.'' No, this is a socialist policy. A socialist policy is one of price controls. Why do we say we do that with regard to veterans? Because we say in the VA there is no greater classification of people in our society that we should be able to give these deep discounts to than our disabled veterans. 
   But then what does the Democrat majority want to do? They want to take these deep discounts then and give them into TRICARE, give them into the Medicare prescription drug program. They want to continue to use price controls. 
   What happens when you do that? Not only do you cost shift, but you also have a dulling effect on research and development that hurts, that hurts this country. I am deeply disappointed that these amendments were denied.

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Chair, I come to the floor once again to defend veterans and the country. And I'm also equally disappointed that there are not many veterans willing to stand in the well against provisions in the Defense bill that would increase the price of prescription drugs in the VA. 
   Now, why don't I have enough friends in the well? Well, they're going to have to answer for themselves for that question. 
   But what is occurring here in the House is an assault upon drug manufacturers in the country. There is this quest and design that, let's get what available drug there is out there to everyone at the lowest price. How wonderful that would be. 
   We, in this country, have a unique system. It's called the free market. It's called capitalism. We say unto the world, bring your greatest minds to America. You can go to the capital market, you can make an investment at risk to press the bounds of science that will increase the quality of life of our people and those around the world. 
   Yet, there's an assault upon that system. The assault continues. It began in January whereby the Democrat majority wanted to extend Medicare drug pricing by saying, let's take the VA Federal Supply Schedule and extend that into the Medicare. Bad idea. Democrats tried that back in 1990 and found out that, whoa, that increased drug prices to veterans, and repealed it. But they passed it again in January. 
   Now, what did they do in the Defense bill? In this Defense bill they've now taken the extension of the Federal Supply Schedule and extended it into the retail drug pharmacy benefit. 
   When I did the redesign of the TRICARE pharmacy benefit in the Department of Defense, I created not only the retail network pharmacy benefit, I created the out of retail network pharmacy benefit, and at no time did I ever, ever, believe that we would extend Federal Supply Schedule into the TRICARE pharmacy. 
   So what is about to happen? When you take the system in the VA and you extend that, and you create the pool and make it larger, you are cost shifting. And when you cost shift, you're going to increase these prices in the VA. 
   Now, in the VA that's about 7 million veterans. It's about 1 percent of the market. You say, oh, Steve, that's not a big number. Well, it is ironic to me how Members will pound their chests and say, well, you know, I said no to an increase in a pharmacy copay, but they're about to vote ``yes'' to increase drug prices for veterans when they vote for this Defense bill. This is wrong, and it should not be done, and I'm appealing to Members not to do this. 
   And I am disturbed, disturbed that my good friend, Ike Skelton, denied two of my amendments. I've worked for 15 years with Chairman Skelton on many, many different issues, and I am stunned that he would deny my opportunity to offer two amendments. 
   One was very simple. It would be to have the Secretary certify that before he could implement this program you have to certify it will not increase prices on the VA. Why would you deny that amendment? 
   They are going to deny the amendment because they know, going into this, that the creation of this program is going to increase prices on veterans. I just cannot believe we're about to do that here. 
   Secondly, we should listen to the experts. If you're about to deny a particular drug under the formulary on TRICARE, you'd better have a pretty good reason, and we ought to be able to go to the committee to do that. But they're not going to do that. At this point I am pretty disturbed.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Thank you very much for yielding. 
   I am back on the floor, and I am here to make an appeal to my good friend, IKE SKELTON. I am here to make an appeal, Mr. Chairman, because I need you to help me. Help me understand why I shouldn't be so upset here today. You have a provision in the bill that is going to open up the Federal Supply Schedule and extend that pricing into DOD whereby when you do that we expand the pool. When you expand the  pool, you cost shift. Not only do you cost shift, you are going to increase pharmaceutical costs onto 7 million veterans. 
   So our history here is that it was a Democrat-controlled Congress back in 1992 that said we are going to create the Federal Supply Schedule and we are going to do this cost control. Why? Because if anyone is entitled in our society to have this benefit, it is our disabled veterans. Then what happened? Then in the 1990s we sort of reformed eligibility with regard to the VA and expanded that criteria so the Federal Supply Schedule expanded beyond the disabled veterans now to all veterans. 
   And now what has happened, you want to expand it, Chairman Skelton, into the DOD TRICARE pharmacy benefit program. When you do that, we are going to increase the price of prescription drugs for veterans. 
   Do not go home and pound your chest and say I am denying increase in copays when you are about to vote for increases in drug prices for 7 million veterans. 
   Chairman Skelton, I offered two amendments before the committee, and they were both denied.

   Mr. BUYER. GAO even did an analysis of the expansion. 
   We asked them to look at it with regard to Medicare, when you tried to do it on Medicare, and pass the House. We know that any time you expand Federal pricing and you increase the pool, drug prices in fact will go up. 
   As a matter of fact in 1990, talk to Chairman JOHN DINGELL because he passed that back in 1990, and they realized they made a mistake and it increased the price on veterans, and we had to repeal it. I ask you to talk to Chairman Dingell.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Hunter and Chairman Skelton. 
   I am deeply concerned about the unintended consequences that section 703 may have on the price of drugs for America's veterans. I rise today and  ask for your help to request the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study of the impact of the proposed provision to provide Federal pricing authority to the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. I ask the chairman if he would be willing to request the GAO to conduct such a study. 
   I yield to Chairman Skelton.

   Mr. BUYER. Reclaiming my time, I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his support of this quest, and I believe that such a review will help alleviate any uncertainty with regard to this proposal, and I want to also thank Ranking Member Hunter. 
   To my good friend, Chairman Skelton, you and I have had a great history together in this body for the last 15 years, and I consider you a personal friend. I apologize to you for when I let my passion get to the side of me. I am deeply sorry if in any manner you took my words directly personal to you because I would be offended if you felt that way. 
   You are a genuine human being, and we all recognize that your passion and your support for the men and women who serve in the military is real and, more importantly, it is genuine; and equally, my passion with regard to the men and women in the military and our veterans. 
   You and I will agree more than we ever disagree, and this is a moment where we may find ourselves in conflict. If I crossed the threshold to my good friend, I deeply apologize to you. I hope you accept my apology.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR DAY -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 47--a resolution establishing a national day of remembrance, reflection, and celebration for those citizens who so valiantly defended our Nation and protected their fellow servicemembers through extraordinary feats of courage and achievement--recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   I extend a thank you to my colleagues from the House Armed Services Committee for leading the effort to commemorate the recipients of our Nation's highest military honor. As a Nation, we can never forget the sacrifices these men and women have made to keep America free. 
   The first Medal of Honor was awarded on March 25, 1864. As we approach this anniversary, let us reflect on the lives and deeds of those brave soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who have received this honor throughout our Nation's history. 
   In 1782, General George Washington started the tradition of recognizing the valiant actions of American soldiers by establishing what became known as the Badge of Military Merit. Washington presented a heart of purple cloth to three of his soldiers in August of that year, an act that was largely lost in history as the Revolutionary War came to a close. This honor was the predecessor to what we now know as the Purple Heart. 
   Though the Badge of Military Merit faded into the past, the idea of awarding a decoration to recognize the gallant efforts of our soldiers never died. In 1847, not long after the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, a ``certificate of merit'' was established to recognize troops who distinguished themselves in battle. No medal accompanied the certificate and the award was again discontinued at the end of that conflict. 
   During the Civil War another proposal arose to establish a medal, but the idea was rejected by then General-In-Chief of the Army Winifield Scott. The Navy, however, adopted this concept, and in December 1861, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation that established a Navy medal for valor. Not to be outdone by their friendly rival, the Army quickly followed suit with their own resolution to establish a similar award, signed into law in July 1862. 
   In 1863, Congress established the Medal of Honor as a permanent means to recognize our Nation's most gallant warriors. Since then, it has been awarded to almost 3,400 of our Nation's bravest citizens. 
   Today, the number of living Medal of Honor recipients is at its lowest point in history--there remain only 111 as of February 1. This resolution is a lasting tribute to those 111 men and women, the recipients who are no longer with us, and to those to come in the future who stood up and answered the call to protect and defend this land.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECT, ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I also want to thank our committee chairman, Mr. Filner, for working with me in a true bipartisan manner to expeditiously bring S. 1396 to the floor before we adjourn this year. I'd also like to thank the leadership of both parties for bringing this to the floor before we adjourn. 
   This bill would authorize $20.5 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out a major medical facility project to modernize patient wards at the VA Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia. 
   The President's budget submission for VA for fiscal year 2008 identified this project as the Department's number one major construction authorization request. Without this authorization, the VA would be unable to move forward with this needed project to update and improve patient services for veterans at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. 
   I also want to thank Senator Johnny Isakson for his efforts to pass this legislation in the Senate, and for the efforts of Senator Saxby Chambliss, who I've also personally spoken with. Both of these Senators have an interest in this project. I'd also like to recognize my good friends, Phil Gingrey and Tom Price, who both introduced a companion bill earlier this year, and for their work and advocacy on this legislation, to also include my colleagues Nathan Deal, Jack Kingston, John Linder and Paul Broun. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I also would like to mention the work of Lynn Westmoreland, also of Georgia, and once again, I think the clashes over the years between Mr. Filner and myself are legend. 
   We had a very good discussion yesterday. So I want all of our colleagues to know that Mr. Filner and I sat down. We had a good lunch. We had very good substantive discussions about a way forward, and we've come to the floor with this bill in a bipartisan manner. 
   We both recognize as we go into next year that the construction bill will be one of the top priorities for both of us to work together. It is very unusual to sever any construction projects out of a bill. I don't care whether it's the MilCon bill or out of the VA construction bill; this is highly unusual what we're doing here today. 
   But Mr. Filner and I are going to work together in a bipartisan manner for the greater interests of veterans in this country, and we're going to use this bill as a springboard to greater things. 
   In the end, I also want to reiterate my comments. Senators Chambliss and Isakson are strong supporters of our men and women in uniform and our Nation's veterans during their distinguished careers both in the House and the Senate. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (VETERANS' PROGRAMS EXTENSION AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6832, the Department of Veterans Affairs Construction and Extensions Act of 2008. 
   This legislation, which I am cosponsoring along with Chairman Filner is a bipartisan measure consisting of the construction bill the House of Representatives passed on May 21, 2008, as well as language from the bill I introduced on August 1, 2008, H.R. 6802, the Veterans Authorities Extension Act of 2008, and additional authorizations. 
   The provisions included from the Committee reported and House passed construction bill, H.R. 5856, would authorize major VA medical facility projects and leases for fiscal year 2009. Included in this legislation is an authorization of $66 million for construction of a fifth Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio, Texas. VA's four existing Polytrauma Centers are located in Richmond, Virginia; Tampa, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this past February, I had the pleasure of visiting the Audie Murphy VA Medical Center in San Antonio for a briefing on  this new project, which will provide state-of-the-art care to our severely injured heroes. The VA Polytrauma Centers are designed to provide comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services for individuals with complex, severe and disabling traumas. By creating a fifth Polytrauma Center in San Antonio, our commitment to veterans and servicemembers is reinforced by expanding access to the southwestern United States. 
   H.R. 6832 also will provide the extension of a number of important authorizations. These include: Repeal of the sunset on inclusion of non-institutional extended care services; Extension of recovery audit authority; Permanent authority for provision of hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans who participated in certain chemical and biological testing; Extension of expiring collections authorities; Extension of nursing home care; Extension of authority to carry out income verification; Extension of certain home loan guaranty programs; Extension of requirement to submit an annual report on the Special Committee on PTSD; Permanent requirement for the biannual report on the Women's Advisory Committee; and Permanent authority for VA's Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (which was previously passed this last July in H.R. 674). 
   The bill will also increase the number of veterans participating in the VA's Independent Living Program, and will enhance the refinancing of home loans by veterans. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner, as well as Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Michaud of Maine and Ranking Member Jeff Miller of Florida, for their efforts to bring this legislation through the Committee and on to the House floor for consideration. I would also like to commend the Committee staff for their hard work and bipartisan efforts throughout this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6832, the Department of Veterans Affairs Construction and Extensions Act of 2008.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2617, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008. 
   Each year, the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs bring before Congress legislation to adjust the compensation our veterans receive through the cost-of-living adjustment. Our Nation's veterans have sacrificed so much for this country, and we fulfill our obligation to them by providing this annual adjustment to their benefits to help them keep up with the cost-of-living. The House already passed H.R. 5826 on May 21, 2008. The bill before us is the Senate version of that same bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will provide our veterans an increase in their wartime disability compensation, additional compensation for benefits, clothing allowance, dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving spouses, and dependency and indemnity compensation to children. This is an important ``must-pass'' bill, which will ensure our veterans receive the increase to their benefits on time.  
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner, as well as Disability and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee Chairman John Hall, and Ranking Member Doug Lamborn for their efforts to bring this bill to the House floor in an expeditious manner. Our action on this bill today will be the final action before the bill is presented to the President for signature, and I encourage all my colleagues to support passage of S. 2617, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1527, as amended, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act. 
   I also want to thank my colleague, Jerry Moran, for his efforts and work on this very important bill he introduced to improve access to care for veterans living in highly rural areas. Veterans in rural areas are challenged by long commutes to VA facilities, and the limited number of providers in rural areas. 
   H.R. 1527 as amended would require VA to conduct a three year demonstration project to allow highly rural veterans in four Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with large rural populations to receive covered services  through non-VA providers. It would give those who live the furthest from VA facilities the choice to receive care closer to home at a local hospital or physician's office. To qualify, a veteran must live at least 60 miles from a VA clinic, 120 miles from a VA hospital or 240 miles from a VA specialized care facility when seeking that care. To ensure continuity of care, the legislation would require VA to develop the functional capability to exchange veterans' medical information between VA and non-VA providers in the pilot. The VA will be required to annually report to Congress on cost, quality, and patient satisfaction. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1527.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (HONORING THE SACRIFICES AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As the ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an obligation to help ensure that veterans and their families have access to the benefits and services they so richly deserve. More importantly, I have been an advocate for military members and veterans almost my entire life. I have been in uniform for 28 years while I served the last 16 years in Congress. It is a great part of who I am. 
   We have before us this House resolution to create a disabled veterans week. Now we should pause for a moment and say why is Congress bringing this bill to the floor at this time? You see, I view this bill on the floor at this time as an inoculation. It is an inoculation because the Democrats who control this Congress want to bring a bill to the floor where it will cut a monthly pension to wartime elderly disabled and indigent veterans in the amount of a billion dollars. So before the Democrats take a billion dollars away from disabled veterans, they want to stand and say I put my arms around disabled veterans, and we are going to create a week for America to celebrate them. 
   I am going to blow the whistle on you. I believe that it is a matter of principle that the Nation should not be taking money from one group of deserving veterans to fund benefits for others. However, you should also know that last month the Senate approved a bill that would cut $912 million in pension benefits for wartime elderly indigent severely disabled or housebound American veterans. A portion of the funding saved by this unprecedented cut in veterans' benefits would be used to fund oversized pensions for noncitizen, non-resident World War II Filipino veterans and for other veterans' programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the country is probably shocked hearing me say something like this. But, Mr. Speaker, we are here on the floor to ask for a designation that the country support the ideals for which men and women fought for and are now disabled, while in the same stroke this very Congress wants to cut veterans' benefits from those very same people when they are asking the country to celebrate their ideals. 
   The bill that was in the Senate is Senate 1315. There was a bill here in the House, H.R. 760. That bill was voted out of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on a party-line vote. That hardly ever happens. A party-line vote hardly ever happens in the Veterans' Affairs Committee. 
   They voted to eliminate a special monthly pension for severely disabled veterans over 65 who are receiving pensions for wartime services. The special monthly pension provides an additional payment of up to $2,200 per year to the most severely disabled veterans. In 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims overturned the Department of Veterans Affairs decision that denied the special monthly pension to an 86-year-old legally blind World War II veteran, Robert A. Hartness, who was also receiving a VA pension granted to low-income, disabled veterans. 
   The court reversed the VA's denial of benefits to Mr. Hartness and required them to begin paying this special monthly pension. The court held that the United States law requires an award of a special monthly pension to a veteran eligible for VA nonservice-connected disability pension if, in addition to being at least 65 years old, the veteran has a disability rating of at least 60 percent or is permanently housebound. 
   The Senate bill, S. 1315, would override the court decision legislatively, and it is also what H.R. 760 sought to do. According to the VA, more than 20,200 veterans could be affected by this unprecedented cut in veterans' benefits. 
   This cut in veterans' benefits that goes to the disabled is opposed by the American Legion, AMVETS, the National Association of Uniformed Services, and other veterans' service organizations. The following excerpt is from an April 25, 2008, letter to all Members of Congress from the American Legion: ``The American Legion believes the sacrifice of these heroes warrants relief. Balancing the books on the backs of the very patriots that protected and defended this Nation is unconscionable. Don't make a grave mistake in the name of fairness, equality, or even fiscal responsibility. Do what is right.'' 
   I wholeheartedly agree. Congress has an obligation to protect those veterans who are the most vulnerable. They have no voice; and, indeed, many of them are so severely disabled they are housebound and require aid and attendants. I personally find appalling the notion of taking benefits from these disabled veterans to create a new benefit for other veterans, especially those of a foreign nation. 
   There are better ways to fund new entitlements than to cut benefits from aging veterans who need us most, violating the principle of honor that defined their service and our obligation to both them and the Nation they served. 
   I believe that our veterans are our country's most precious asset. I also believe that those are the ideals for which you seek to recognize in the bill that is before us. I would remind every Member who votes in support of this bill, please recognize that when you come to the floor and there is presented to you a Senate amended bill that would repeal the special monthly pension for the Nation's most vulnerable veterans, those of whom are wartime elderly, indigent, disabled and homebound, that you remember the vote you cast this day. Because if you embrace to defend these disabled veterans who sacrificed for the ideals and the heritage of this country, do not cut their veterans' benefits. 
   It was done in committee. It was done in the Senate. We have to defend the most vulnerable and those who do not have a voice. 
   I support what is in front of us, but I do not support the rationale of inoculation before you bring a bill to this floor that will cut a billion dollars from these wartime elderly, disabled indigent veterans.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4264, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center in Tampa, Florida, as the ``Michael Bilirakis Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center.'' 
   Mr. Michael Bilirakis served in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955 and served Florida's Ninth District as Congressman for 24 years, from 1983 to 2007. As a veteran, Mike wanted to be a strong veterans' advocate in Congress, and specifically requested to be appointed to a seat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   Those of us who served with Mike on the committee well remember his hard work on what the chairman just spoke about, the issue of concurrent receipt. Since his first introduction of the legislation in the 99th Congress to eliminate the offset of the military pension  in order to receive the VA disability compensation, Mike consistently worked each Congress to have this legislation passed, including reintroducing the bill each consecutive Congress in which he had served. 
   When I served on the House Armed Services Committee as chairman of Military Personnel in the late 1990s, I went to Mr. Bilirakis and informed him that I had $25 million, and I wanted to address the issue of concurrent receipt. And what we did was we first took that $25 million and we said we're going to take care of those 100 percent combat-disabled veterans. And Mike and I felt pretty good about what we had done. We had moved incrementally, but we were going to take on this issue. Boy, did we find out that in the very next Congress we were being attacked. Here we thought we were doing great things on behalf of the veterans' community, and then Mr. Bilirakis and I then began to be attacked by all these other veterans who did not receive the benefits of concurrent receipt. Here we thought we were trying to do that which was best, open up the issue of concurrent receipt, address the 100 percent combat-disabled veterans, and then all of a sudden Michael Bilirakis and I were being attacked because we didn't do it for everyone. And Mike always took on these issues with great humor, self-deprecating humor, and for that I have great respect for him. 
   He also fought for the Survivor Benefit Plan and improvements for the widows of military retirees, dependency and indemnity compensation and survivors' benefits, veterans' equitable resource allocation, benefits and health care for former prisoners of war, hospice care for veterans, as well as the designation of the National Women Veterans Recognition Week. 
   Additionally, Congressman Michael Bilirakis sought and obtained funding for the following projects to serve veterans within his congressional district in the State of Florida. The Port Richey Outpatient Clinic, the Spinal Cord Injury Center at the James Haley VA Medical Center. We have the Florida National Cemetery, the Land O'Lakes Nursing Home, and the Sub-Regional Veterans Office in Tampa, Florida. Among his top priorities was obtaining the funding and resources for the Spinal Cord Injury Center located at the VA Medical Center in Tampa, Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, for all of his outstanding work on behalf of our Nation's veterans, it is most appropriate today that we consider this legislation to name the Spinal Cord Injury Center after Michael Bilirakis. 
   I had the opportunity to tour this facility. And I welcome all of my colleagues, if you ever have the chance to be in Tampa, to visit the polytrauma center; go by this spinal cord facility. It is one of the most remarkable facilities that we have in the country in which we care for these veterans. And it's only fitting, since Mike worked so hard on this particular facility, that it be named in his honor. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And to my good friend Michael, I know this is a little uncomfortable listening to your colleagues say nice things about you while you're alive, so I thank the chairman for doing this bill. 
   And we recognize you, Michael Bilirakis, because your presence here was significant. You heard a very personal admission on behalf of the chairman. And I think all of us on the committee could say the very same thing that the chairman had said. Michael was very good at keeping and maintaining civility, and it's about who he was as a person. 
   I also had the opportunity to serve with him on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. And we honor his work, not only on behalf of America's veterans, but I also remember his work on the Health Subcommittee. It worked out very well, his knowledge of Energy and Commerce along with his work on the Health Subcommittee on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. And he was able to integrate his work with Health and Human Services and NIH and research and met with the VA and research. Your work is highly recognized and remembered by the House. 
   But I also know that, Michael, if you were still here, you would be just as concerned as I am with regard to the high cost of energy because you voted on a lot of efforts to bring down energy prices for all Americans, which include our veterans.     
   So with that I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation before us in naming this spinal cord facility on behalf of Michael Bilirakis.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 2818, as amended, the Veterans Epilepsy Treatment Act of 2008. It's a bill to amend title 38 of the United States Code to provide for the establishment of Epilepsy Centers of Excellence in the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   I would like to thank the Health Subcommittee chairman, Mike Michaud, and Ranking Member Jeff Miller for their work on the bill. They determined that existing six new centers spread throughout the country without utilizing the clinical and scientific expertise available within the VA's polytrauma rehabilitation centers was probably not the optimal approach. So working in a bipartisan manner, this legislation was amended to ensure that there will soon be five polytrauma rehabilitation centers. 
   We also need to recognize that we have many of these 89,000 veterans who live in rural areas and also will be traveling distances, we need to acknowledge, to these rehabilitation centers; so there is an energy cost issue, which we are going to address here in a moment. 
   The VA has a long history of providing specialized treatment and research on epilepsy. In 1972, recognizing that head trauma, whether mild or severe, is a risk factor for developing epilepsy, the VA created dedicated centers  to improve the quality of care for veterans who may develop posttraumatic epilepsy as a result of military service. Today the VA operates seven sites with advanced capabilities to monitor and perform epilepsy surgery. 
   There are, as I said earlier, approximately 89,000 veterans, many of whom also live in rural America, with epilepsy enrolled in the VA health care system. And with the prevalence of combat-related traumatic brain injury among our returning OEF and OIF servicemembers, it is important that the VA is a national leader in the prevention, treatment, and research on epilepsy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me speak to a couple of matters relative here to the House in how we manage the House's business. First I will speak with regard to process. 
   We are bringing eight veterans bills to the floor all as individual bills. That is very concerning to me because these could have been placed all in one omnibus bill that we would then bring to the floor. It would create better management of the floor. So why is this brought as eight individual bills on suspension? My guess, Mr. Speaker, is that the House is now performing what I would call filling the time. Why are we filling time? Well, because this Congress isn't working on some of the most important issues facing this country. 
   We have about 35 legislative days left in this Congress. This Congress has not passed a single appropriations bill to run the government. This is a dysfunctional Congress, and we're failing to meet our responsibilities. So while we are not doing the responsibilities of the country, we have to fill time. So they turn to the Veterans' Affairs Committee and other committees and find what are all the bills that you've got out there that we can do on suspension, that we can do on the calendar? Let's fill the time. And that's what is happening here, and it's extremely bothersome to me. 
   Here the country is facing tremendous issues, whether it's the downturn of the economy, the issues relative to people leaving their homes. We have got an energy crisis with the challenge on how we're going to reduce our energy dependence on a lot of bad actors around the world. We have got the solvency of Medicare issue. We have got the Social Security issue. We have got the AMT patch. We have got immigration. No, this Congress, we're not going to work on those important issues, I guess must be the message that the country is receiving from our acts of today, because we're going to take up a lot of time here on the legislative calendar on eight individual veterans bills. Now, think about that. That's eight bills split up of 40 minutes on each bill. This is the House equivalent of dilatory tactics when it comes to working on what is important facing the country. 
   So I guess on the energy issue, I think my colleagues would immediately respond, well, my gosh, Steve, we just voted on price gouging. Okay. I think my Democrat colleagues think that to solve the energy crisis relative to the country, we are going to, let's see, tax the profits of oil companies. We're going to do price gouging legislation. Oh, there must be something going on out there in the futures market; so let's talk about speculators. Let's do nothing with regard to supply. 
   Now, I am in favor of these Centers of Excellence to advance and coordinate care for veterans with epilepsy. So why am I talking about these other issues? I'm talking about them because they are important issues also facing the country that this Congress is not addressing. And as we continue to work as a Congress to improve the quality of life for our veterans, we must examine the added burden that energy costs are placing upon those who served their country. 
   Americans are coping with increased energy prices, including veterans. Congress must act to decrease the energy costs. The energy bills we have been voting on in the House are fighting the smoke of the energy crisis in America, not fighting the fires. So my Democrat colleagues love to work on the demand side of the economic equation. Price is fundamental economics. You've got a supply and demand result in the increase in price. 
   We've got one of my colleagues here that wants a 50 cent consumption tax on gasoline. Why would they be proposing things like this? Well, you propose things like that because you want to compress demand on energy to change the American culture rather than opening up supplies. 
   Why is this such an important issue? It's an important issue because it impacts veterans. Energy price impacts veterans, and nationwide Americans are now spending nearly 4 percent of their aftertax income on gasoline. 
   So on this bill on epilepsy, we talked about the fact that we have got 89,000 veterans with epilepsy enrolled in the VA health care system. We now in this bill are saying that we are going to move them to the polytrauma centers. There are five polytrauma centers, which means that individuals to gain access to the polytrauma care centers now have to travel. How do they get there? They either get there through the airlines or through surface transportation. In order to do that, they're facing increased costs to the access of health care. That's why energy is also an important veterans issue. 
   We are importing over 60 percent of our oil from foreign countries, and as the price of gasoline increases, the cost of food, goods, and medical care go up. Veterans are being hit by increased prices at the pump, and Congress must make every effort to deal with the heart of the energy issue for every citizen and increase our energy supply. If we increase our supply, we will then decrease energy prices. 
   Many of America's veterans, as I said, live in rural areas, and they also then get hit the hardest by the increase in gasoline prices. While 4 percent may be the average amount Americans are paying, that figure has surpassed 13 percent in rural areas. Rural Americans are estimated to be paying now over $2,000 for gasoline this year, and this has a tremendous impact upon our--

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us creates these epileptic centers to be associated with the five polytrauma centers. In order for veterans to gain access to them, they have to be able to travel to get there. The increased price of energy is very important for veterans to be able to gain access to these centers.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, what I object to is the fact that the chairman of the committee must not care about the increased cost of energy prices on veterans in America. He must not care, Mr. Speaker, because he's so concerned that he wants to raise a point of order against me to silence the issue of the impact of energy prices at the VA on health care, on medical research? 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very, very pertinent and important issue. The increased prices to the VA, a few years back we had an emergency supplemental, and part of that was because of the increase in energy costs to the VA. This is a pretty important issue. 
   So let me now embrace your counsel, Mr. Speaker, to me.     
   H.R. 2818, as amended, will improve the VA's research. Now why do I mention research? Well, because what we're doing here, we recognize the VA has a long history of providing specialized treatment and research on epilepsy. So now let's talk about the impact on energy prices on research. It's a proper nexus, would the Speaker not agree? The Speaker is stoic. 
   H.R. 2818, as amended, I believe it improves VA's research, but as we look at this, the research activities consume high amounts of energy, and these activities include using CT scans, MRIs, other medical imaging technology. We use medical testing and other laboratory devices. Research laboratories require high amounts of security to protect personal medical information on research subjects. Laboratory data may examine heating and cooling systems to control specimen temperatures to ensure viability in our research activities. All that requires energy and in fact energy prices will impact the delivery of care that we do at our epileptic centers. 
   Facility energy consumption also involves power to run computers, printers, scanners, copiers, shredders. Some of these research, medical research projects require specialized lighting and may occur after hours when VA physicians have time to work in their labs and analyze data when these systems would then be shut down. 
   From 2005 to 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs' energy costs have increased by 20 percent. The VA's energy costs have increased 65 percent since the 2003 baseline set by Federal mandates in the OMB energy scorecard. 
   May I ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining.

   Mr. BUYER. The increasing cost of energy is affecting every sector of American life, including the services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which we are not immune to the effects of high fuel prices. Yet, our colleagues, it appears the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs committee, that is so upset now that I am talking about the increase in energy and its impact on the quality of care we can deliver in health care, are not providing the relief on energy costs. We should be looking at ways to reduce the energy burden on the VA. 
   So when I look at the energy baseline in 2003 in the VA on energy costs and its impact on how we can provide quality health care to our veterans, that baseline was $287.7 million. Today, that energy baseline--actually, my numbers are of 2007--was $475.5 billion. That is a 65 percent increase in VA utility expenses. 
   So with regard to the Speaker's counsel to me that I can talk about energy prices in the VA so long as there is a proper nexus, well, I think if we are talking about a 65 percent increase in fuel prices and its impact upon the VA and how we will be able to deliver not only quality research but also quality health care at our epileptic centers, I think is a pretty important issue. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. The gentlelady knows quite well, having been here a very long time, that the best way to utilize the floor time, which is extremely important on the important issues facing the country, is that we could have taken these eight veterans bills and consolidated them and brought them to the floor. That is not what we have done. 
   Half of the bills that we are talking about here today, Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentlelady, is that they are naming bills. They are naming bills. We could have managed the time of the floor much better. 
   So the gentlelady was absolutely correct. No one here should try to attempt to spin my remarks about filling time as if somehow veterans substantive legislation is not important. The fact that the time on the floor is what is extremely important. 
   We have 35 legislative days, approximately, to go. I know you're praising leadership, Ms. Brown, but this Congress, we have not done one appropriations bill to run this country. Mr. Speaker, I think that is correct. I think there are 12 legislative bills. We haven't done any of them. None of them have come to the House floor.

   Mr. BUYER. I reclaim my time. When the gentlelady brought up with regard to what you did when you were in charge--I will just share this with the gentlelady--the bills that have been brought to the floor here under suspension, in the past, for years now you and I have work together and served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Any time the bill would actually come to the floor, it was always by agreement between the ranking and the chairman and other members of interest, always by consensus and by agreement. 
   That is not what happened here today. That is not. We did that with regard to seven bills. At the last moment, another bill gets added. We had some general concerns with regard to the language in the bill. But, no, the chairman is going to have his way. 
   So I just share with the gentlelady that he wanted to roll the minority, no differently than how the Speaker has rolled the committee with regard to the GI Bill and others.

   Mr. BUYER. My point is that because this Congress has now chosen not to work on these very important issues facing the country, whether it's decreasing the energy prices, on immigration, solvency of Social Security, Medicare, all of these list of issues, we are not doing right now. So we need to be able to say, Okay, what are we going to do with our time. So we take the eight veterans bills that we have and split them each up individually, with 40 minutes on each bill. 
   I yield to the gentlelady.

   Mr. BUYER. I reclaim my time. If you want to honor the veteran, then help me help this Congress and the American people reduce energy prices that impact upon the VA and other departments of government, but in particular, our veterans today, this bill before us deals with the epilepsy centers. And in order for these patients to gain access to these epileptic centers, they are either going to have to fly or they have got to drive great distances to get there, and there is going to be a cost increase to do that. 
   So if we are facing now from 2003 to today a 65 percent increase in energy baseline at the Department of Veterans Affairs, carry that across all government. So, today we are going to honor the veterans? We can't do things in a vacuum, I would say, Mr. Speaker. We have to be holistic with regard to how we apply our policies that we do here in Congress. 
   So with regard to caring for the Nation's veterans, for which we all embrace, we can only do that if we can increase the quality of our health care; at the same time, increasing the access. If we don't work on the increase in energy prices, then it has a depression then upon the access to quality health care. 
   So we can invest all the moneys we like on improving the quality of care, but if we can't also get them access, then have we achieved the goal for which we desire?

I voted for your Amtrak bill and I support the increase in our transportation, and I appreciate the deference of the chairman for not objecting to your words being outside of the nexus of the bill. I think they were inclusive of the nexus of the bill, Mr. Speaker, because it is about transportation and how our veterans gain access to the health care system.

   I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado. He is a very valuable member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He and I have traveled part of the world together and I have tremendous respect for him. He also knows the Veterans' Affairs Committee works best when it works in a bipartisan fashion. So I turn to my good friend and ask for that help and assistance and best counsel that he can give to the chairman to stop the divisiveness that occurs on the committee by the actions he has been taking. 
   With that, I embrace the gentleman from Colorado. The gentleman should also know if the House is not going to address the big energy issues that also face America, and in particular your State with regard to oil shale and being able to access important sources of oil for this country, then I have to be able to create the nexus, Mr. Chairman, where I can, to talk about the impact of energy on this country and the impact upon veterans in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE YEAR OF THE AMERICAN VETERAN -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, my name is pronounced BOO-yer, B-u-y-e-r. It looks like ``buyer.'' The descent is from Alsace-Lorraine, pronounced de BOO-yea, and you just Americanized it. But we refer to it as BOO-yer. Thank you. 
   In the previous debate, Mr. Speaker, I would like the Record to properly reflect that the chairman had made a comment with regard to four naming bills that was not accurate at all. I support consideration of this naming bill and three other veterans' naming bills on the schedule today. I do wish to correct the record regarding the statement I understand Chairman Filner to have made during early consideration of H.R. 2818 that I, quote, ``objected to the consideration of the veterans' naming bills today, all four of them.'' 
   While I do not think Chairman Filner intended to dissemble about the matter, I thought I detected his impish grin for which he is so well-known. In any event, Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear that I support the consideration of veterans' naming bills. 
   I did ask Chairman Filner by way of my staff director to his to address specific drafting concerns I have about H. Res. 1291 before scheduling the resolution for the suspension calendar today; but that was not done so I will try to clarify the matter on the resolution with the author of the bill when it is considered. 
   I also need to clarify for the Record in the last debate that in response to Mr. Salazar's remarks, my dear friend from Colorado, that ``all of these bills were passed through committee.'' 
   The only bill which we are considering right now, Mr. Speaker, that was passed through the committee is H. Res. 1098. It was marked up and reported out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The other seven bills are being brought straight to the floor without committee report or action. 
   As the ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an obligation to help ensure that veterans and their families have access to the benefits and services they so richly deserve. More importantly, I have been an advocate for military members and veterans almost my entire life. I have been in uniform with the United States Army Reserves both on and off active duty now for 28 years. For the last 16 years, I have simultaneously served in Congress as I have also been in the Army Reserves. It is a great part of who I am. It is for this reason that I am proud to support H. Res. 1098 which supports the goals and ideals of the Year of the American Veteran. 
   As the chairman stated earlier today, there are over 25 million veterans in the United States who sacrificed by defending the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, and supporting the ideals of liberty all over the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution recognizes those sacrifices and commemorates the service of veterans in times of peace and war. This resolution also encourages the people of the United States to join the Commission of the Future of America's Veterans in celebrating the year 2008 as the ``Year of the American Veteran.'' 
   Before we pass this resolution, I believe that my colleagues should also pause for a moment and say why is this Congress bringing this resolution to the floor at this time. I view bringing this resolution to the floor at this time as a continued matter of the chairman attempting to inoculate the majority, inoculate because the Democrats who control this Congress, they want to bring a bill to the floor that would cut a monthly pension to wartime elderly, disabled and indigent veterans in the amount of nearly a billion dollars. So before the Democrats take nearly a billion dollars away from war-time disabled, indigent, homebound veterans, they want to stand and put their arms around veterans and say, We are going to name 2008 the Year of the American Veteran so it makes them look good just before they take a billion dollars from the most vulnerable veterans. 
   I need to inform not only the Members but the country so they know what this Congress is about to do. I believe it is a matter of principle that the Nation should not be taking money from one group of deserving veterans to fund someone else. In this case, the attempt is to take this series of dollars and if we adopt what the chairman had done in the full committee, it would be to take nearly this $1 billion and make these payments that would then go to Filipinos who fought with the United States during World War II. If we pick up what the Senate had done, they take nearly the billion dollars and they spread it out among a number of veterans programs of which a smaller portion then would be with regard to the Filipinos. 
   I bring that to everyone's attention because the President of the Philippines is in the United States and is here to deliver a resolution that passed through their legislature wanting our country to know that if Mr. Filner and this Congress is successful, they will not offset any moneys the United States will be sending to the Philippines. 
   So this matter before the House is very serious. The American people, Mr. Speaker, should know and all Members should clearly know that before we say that 2008 is the Year of the Veteran, we better make sure that is exactly what we mean. That we embrace those ideals before we take nearly a billion dollars and cut that from the very same soldiers that fought right next to those World War II Philippine veterans. 
   You think about this, we make it a law and say if someone is about to die, well actually, let me rephrase that. 
   We believe it is shameful and therefore make it against the law to actually go up and put your hand in the pocket of someone who is dead and steal from that person, take money away from them. Well, I think that is right. We should do that. 
   But then what are we about to do here with regard to these wartime elderly and indigent, homebound veterans whom are the most vulnerable. Many are lying in a bed. They are homebound. They are 60 percent or greater disabled, and now we are saying Congress, we are going to deny that monthly pension that goes to you. We are going to stop it, take it away from you. And oh, by the way, we are going to give it to the living because you are about to die, so we are going to spread it among other veterans, which will be the nonresident alien Filipinos that served valiantly in World War II.     
   Now, if in fact that's what Congress wants to do, fund it with some other source, don't take it from this vulnerable population. When I talked about what the Senate bill approved--actually, when I referred to it as almost $1 billion, it's $912 million in pension benefits for these wartime elderly, indigent, severely disabled, or homebound American veterans. A portion of the funding saved by this unprecedented cut in veterans' benefits would be used to fund, if we followed Chairman Filner's view, which would be a very oversized pension for World War II Filipino veterans; or if we followed the Senate's  version, we would take those moneys, reduce the size of the pensions and spread it among other veterans. We would be doing this in the very same year in which the chairman is asking we make the Year of the American Veteran. 
   Now, I suspect that most Americans would be shocked and dismayed that any Member of Congress, regardless of what party they are in, would propose such a drastic cut. But that is exactly what the chairman intends to do very soon. 
   What is more ironic is that today we are here on the floor to consider this worthy resolution that will recognize this year as the Year of the American Veteran while in the same stroke, this very Congress wants to cut veterans' benefits from the very same people from which we are honoring with this resolution. 
   The bill that I am referring to is Senate 1315 as amended which passed out of the Senate in April, and a similar bill that I earlier had mentioned is H.R. 760 as amended, which passed the House Committee on Veterans Affairs last July. Both of these bills contain this cut of nearly $1 billion. 
   When the Democrat majority passed these bills out of the Senate and out of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, they voted to eliminate, as I said, a special monthly pension for severely disabled veterans over 65 who were receiving pensions for wartime service. This special monthly pension provides an additional payment of up to $2,200 per year to the most severely disabled veterans. 
   In 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims overturned the Department of Veterans Affairs decision that denied the special monthly pension to an 86-year-old legally blind World War II veteran named Robert A. Hartness, who was also receiving a VA pension granted to poor, disabled veterans. The court reversed the VA's denial of benefits to Mr. Hartness and required them to begin paying this monthly pension. The court held that the United States Code requires an award of a special monthly pension to an eligible veteran for VA nonservice-connected disability pension if, in addition to being at least 65 years old, the veteran has a disability rating of at least 60 percent or is permanently housebound. 
   This, in the Year of the American Veteran, Senate 1315 and H.R. 760 would override the court's decision. 
   According to the VA, more than 20,200 veterans could be affected by this unprecedented cut in veterans' benefits. This cut in veterans' benefits is opposed by the American Legion, AMVETS, the National Association of Uniform Services, the Gold Star Wives of Americans, and other veterans' service organizations. 
   The following excerpt is from an April 25, 2008, letter to all Members of Congress: ``The American Legion believes the sacrifice of these heroes warrants relief. Balancing the books on the backs of the very patriots that protected and defended this Nation is unconscionable. Don't make a grave mistake in the name of fairness, equality, or even fiscal responsibility. Do what is right.'' 
   Well, I wholeheartedly agree. Congress has an obligation to protect these vulnerable veterans, and it's because I believe they have no voice, and indeed many of them are so severely disabled, they are housebound, and require aid and attendance. 
   While I recognize the service of the Filipino veterans of World War II, those who advocate for their compensation should do so from other funding sources. It should not be at the expense of our needy veterans. 
   I believe that we should not cut benefits from aging veterans who need us most to fund new entitlements. To do so would violate the principle of honor that defined their service and our obligation to both them and the Nation they served. 
   Mr. Speaker one of the provisions of the resolutions states, ``Resolved, that the House of Representatives (1) encourages the American people to recognize and acknowledge the sacrifices the American veteran demonstrates in the name of freedom.'' 
   How can the House of Representatives encourage the American people to acknowledge the sacrifices of American veterans when very soon afterwards, this very same Congress that is supposed to represent the people wants to vote to cut nearly $1 billion from these wartime elderly, indigent, disabled veterans who need it most? We are sending veterans, servicemembers, and the American people the wrong message if we do this. 
   So I would remind my colleagues who vote in support of this resolution to please recognize that when this legislation may come soon to the floor. Because if my colleagues join me in embracing our Nation's veterans, particularly those who are disabled by sacrifice for the ideals and the heritage of this Nation and truly want to thank them by naming 2008 the Year of the American Veteran, then I ask you do not cut their veterans' benefits if this bill is brought to the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, but I do not support the rationale of continued inoculation and a mixed message that will result in this cut of nearly $1 billion from these wartime elderly, disabled, and indigent veterans. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (EXPRESSING GRATITUDE FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE AMERICAN GI FORUM ON ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1291 recognizes the contributions of the American GI Forum on its 60th anniversary. Mr. Speaker, the work of the founder of the American GI Forum, Dr. Hector Garcia, is one that shows the determination of the American spirit. 
   Serving during World War II as an infantryman, as a combat engineer, and a medical doctor, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with six battle stars and achieved the rank of major. Upon his return from the war, he worked to encourage other Mexican Americans to educate themselves in the Democratic principles, and founded the American GI Forum in 1948 to fight for equal treatment for Mexican American veterans, including proper medical treatment and educational benefits. 
   In reviewing the current legislative priorities for the American GI Forum, it is evident their efforts have continued to instill in the Hispanic/Latino community the desire to achieve through liberty. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is one clarification that I think should be made regarding the resolution whereas clauses, and I will take these up in a moment here with the author of the bill. In particular, the whereas clause reads, ``Whereas, millions of veterans returning home from World War II look to the guarantee of educational, medical, housing, and other basic benefits by the GI Bill,'' and, ``Whereas, these benefits were denied in large part to Americans of Mexican descent and other Hispanics throughout the United States.'' 
   By having these two statements like this in the whereas clause, this statement implies systematic denial of benefits as a matter of policy by the VA. Individual accounts of bigotry most likely did in fact occur, but I have great concerns with regard to the drafting of the bill. I was very disappointed that the chairman would not work with the minority on the drafting of this bill. 
   Those of us who wear and have worn the uniform, we embrace the ideals that veterans benefits are to be extended without regard to race, color, or creed. As I said, I will have some questions of Mr. Rodriguez regarding the clarification of his intent on the whereas clauses. 
   Mr. Speaker, the work of the veterans service organizations like the  American GI Forum advocates for veterans and assists those of us in Congress and particularly on the committee of Veterans' Affairs to formulate policy that will help guide our country in respect to veterans' affairs. I commend the American GI Forum's work these past 60 years. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I have some questions on my time. I would like to inquire of the gentleman regarding his intent on the drafting of the resolution. In particular, the first and second clauses of the resolution. The first clause, ``Whereas, millions of veterans returning home from World War II looked to the guarantee of educational, medical, housing, and other basic benefits provided by the GI Bill''; and, ``Whereas, these benefits were denied.'' 
   As it's drafted, it basically says here are the benefits they looked forward to. And then we say, ``these benefits were denied'' and then ``in large part, to Americans of Mexican descent.'' 
   So in the whereas clause we are saying that here are benefits that millions of veterans coming back from World War II looked forward to, then in the drafting it says, oh, by the way, ``Whereas, these benefits were denied, in large part to Americans of Mexican descent and other Hispanics throughout the United States.'' 
   Now there are other individuals, other forms of odious discrimination of various kinds encountered by veterans, whether they be African American, whether they are women, individuals are Puerto Rican. There could have been many other forms of discrimination and bigotry in which people were subjected to in our country, not only back then but even probably of today. 
   What I was hoping we could do is that we are actually voting on a resolution on the floor, that this drafting is kind of awkward. I was hoping that we could try to correct that. 
   What I wanted to do is yield to the gentleman so he can tell us about his intent with regard to the legislation. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I rise in support of House Resolution 1231, a bill which would support the goals and ideals of Vietnam Veterans Day and calls upon the American people to recognize such a day. I thank my colleague, Mr. Shuler of North Carolina, for his efforts in bringing the bill to the House floor. 
   The American participation in the conflict of Vietnam began in March 1959 and continued until March 29, 1973, when the last remaining members of the United States Armed Forces were withdrawn from Vietnam. The conflict itself continued until April 30, 1975. During this conflict, considered the longest military conflict in U.S. history, over 3 million veterans answered their Nation's call to duty. More than 58,000 servicemembers lost their lives, and over 300,000 were wounded. This bill would designate for the first time a national day to recognize Vietnam veterans and commend them for their service to a grateful Nation. 
   While this resolution is belated, it reflects a better perspective on those who served in an unpopular war and who came home to indifference or outright hostility. That was wrong, and today, we acknowledge that our Vietnam veterans deserved much better. 
   Now, we recognize also that there are some that perhaps did not honor these veterans in the way in which they should have been, but I also want to recognize there were many people in the country that did recognize their service and honor them. 
   My grandfather was a World War I veteran who was a Legion commander of the post in Francesville, Indiana. My father then later became that very same commander. And I remember, even as a young man, the discussions about Vietnam and the support. And I remember a young man who even baby-sat for the four kids and later went on to Vietnam, and I remember the discussions. 
   But I came from a small town, and I don't remember the hostilities. I remember seeing war protesters on TV, and I remember the term ``hippy.'' I didn't even know what that meant, and I remembered all these things happening as a young man in the 1960s and early 1970s. And it was challenging for me because I didn't share that perspective. I wasn't brought up in a family that had the perspective of public protest and war protesting and those of whom would spat upon someone in uniform and treat them in outward disgrace. 
   I never understood that. I could never get there to understand that. I understand today that those of whom may have done that in the follies of their youth are filled with guilt, and I'm glad that they are overcoming those types of feelings. 
   And I will embrace what the chairman had just said, when he said never confuse the war with the warrior. And I think he's absolutely right. And so the country had learned some painful lessons with regard to the Vietnam War, and so if you've got challenges, don't take them out on the warrior, and so I embrace the chairman's remarks. 
   I was trained as a young ROTC cadet at The Citadel by Vietnam veterans, and I hold the Vietnam veteran in pretty high self-esteem because of the challenge that they went through in a guerrilla war. You know, they never lost a battle. Our soldiers didn't lose a battle, but they ended up losing a war. And we  learned a lot, also as a military force, in guerrilla tactics. And a lot of that is coming home to roost here in the successes that General Petraeus had also used here with regard to the surge. 
   In the war in which I had served in, the first Gulf war, that war, the first Gulf war, its success came from the leadership of the Vietnam veteran. Those Vietnam veterans were, in fact, the senior NCOs, and they were the general officers and the senior colonels, and they knew the mistakes of Vietnam. They also knew that in Vietnam it was as soon as they hit the ground, they wanted to know when their rotation would end, when do they get to go home. And so when we went in the first Gulf war, it was nothing about rotation. It was all about we're here to do a job, we do the job and get to go home. 
   So that leadership, the senior leadership from Vietnam, had a great impact upon our military heritage and our legacy. 
   And so acknowledging the service and the honored sacrifice of the Vietnam veterans, I want to thank the chairman for doing that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I yield back my time.

I commend my colleague from Washington, Doc Hastings, for introducing this bill. 
   Bud was a very outspoken Navy veteran of World War II. Along with his friend and fellow veteran Bill Forte, he worked tirelessly with local veteran service organizations and elected officials to establish this outpatient clinic in Wenatchee, Washington, which is about 148 miles from Seattle. Bud is recognized as the catalyst behind this outpatient clinic, but unfortunately, he passed away before seeing its opening. 
   This selfless example of service to veterans is an inspiration to us all and certainly should be recognized. Memorializing Bud by renaming the clinic will recognize his service as both a seaman and as a veteran advocate.

   I commend my colleague from Illinois, LUIS GUTIERREZ for introducing this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1994, under Public Law 103-446, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act, Congress established the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. 
   The Committee is comprised of veterans who represent their respective minority groups and are recognized authorities in fields pertinent to their needs. The Committee's goal is to: promote the use of VA programs, benefits, and services by minority veterans; make benefits and services more accessible to minority veterans; and, evaluate current programs and make recommendations on how VA can better serve minority veterans. 
   As I previously stated, authority for the Committee will expire December 31, 2009. By supporting H.R. 674, we eliminate the expiration date and permanently extend this important committee to ensure the perspectives of minority veterans are considered during the establishment of VA benefits and services. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (VETERANS DISABILITY BENEFITS CLAIMS MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5892, as amended, the Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act of 2008, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to modernize the VA disability benefits claims processing system, to help ensure the accurate and timely delivery of compensation to veterans and their families. 
   I commend the leaders of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Chairman John Hall and Ranking Member Doug Lamborn, for introducing and developing this comprehensive bill. Their bipartisan efforts will help make substantial improvements to the veterans' benefits claims process. 
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation payments fulfill our Nation's primary obligation to make up for the economic losses and losses of quality of life that result from service connected injuries. In recent years, VA has required increasingly longer periods to process the thousands of claims it receives each year. This has resulted in a backlog of benefits claims that VA has been struggling to overcome. 
   This bipartisan bill is intended to improve benefits claims processing so that our veterans receive their benefits with the speed and accuracy that they deserve. It is comprised of a number of recommendations for improvement that originated in other bills. Such recommendations include: better utilization of information technology, a quality and training assessment program for the certification of each VA claims processor, and a study of a new rating schedule to help ensure that the VA rating schedule, which consists of a complex set of regulations used to determine the appropriate level of compensation for veterans' disabilities, adequately compensates veterans for both loss of earnings and loss of quality of life. 
   Our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for the freedoms we cherish, must be assured that the compensation they receive for disabilities is based on information that is both credible and fair. 
   By supporting H.R. 5892, we will initiate steps to ensure that VA benefits and services are of unsurpassed value to veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (IMPROVING VETERANS' OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION AND BUSINESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6221, as amended, the Veteran Owned Small Business Protection and Clarification Act of 2008. This bill, as amended, would amend title 38, United States Code, to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to include in each contract the Secretary enters for the acquisition of goods and services a provision that requires compliance with the contracting goals and preferences for small business concerns owned or controlled by veterans, and for other purposes. 
   H.R. 6221, as amended, does 3 very good things for veterans. 
   First, it closes a loophole in the service disabled veteran-owned business provisions in Public Law 109-461 to require that any VA agreement with other entities to provide contracting services include provisions to comply with those provisions. 
   Second, the bill would expand the types of VA work study jobs on college campuses to provide more jobs for student veterans, and widen interaction between veterans, the faculty, staff and most importantly, other students. 
   Finally, H.R. 6221, as amended, would take provisions from H.R. 6272, introduced by Congressman Welch to create the Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) program, a modernized version of the old Service Members' Occupational Conversion and Training Act or SMOCTA. 
   Focusing on veterans whose military specialty does not translate well into civilian life and who do not have other training opportunities available under title 38, this bill will benefit veterans whose job skills no longer match what is needed by today's economy. 
   I appreciate our colleague from Vermont, Mr. Welch, for his bill which would renew funding for the old Service Members' Occupational Conversion and Training Act or SMOCTA. Again, in a bipartisan manner, the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee has brought us a bill that meets Mr. Welch's goal of providing a training program for veterans who finish military service with few or no skills that are transferrable to civilian life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I extend my gratitude to Chairman Filner, Subcommittee Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin and Ranking Member Boozman for working together to bring this bill to us as a bipartisan effort to make veterans more competitive in the job market. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6221.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2192, as amended, to establish an Ombudsman within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The extraordinary sacrifices of members of the armed forces have preserved our Nation's liberty and way of life. This bill will help ensure that these brave men and women, who took an oath to defend America, receive the highest quality health care available. 
   I want to commend the leaders of the Subcommittee on Health, Chairman Mike Michaud and Ranking Member Jeff Miller, for their bipartisan efforts in developing this bill. I also want to acknowledge Mr. Hodes for introducing this legislation to help meet the needs of our veterans. 
   In 2007, our Nation was outraged when unacceptable conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center were exposed in a news article. In response, President Bush established the Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes and the Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. Based upon recommendations from these blue-ribbon commissions, VA initiated various programs to better assist VA patients and their families. Such programs included: appointing patient advocates at each VA Medical Center, providing coordinators for returning OEF/OIF veterans, providing Transition Patient Advocates, and establishing the joint Federal Recovery Coordinator Program to assist seriously wounded service members. 
   H.R. 2192, as amended would establish a centralized office to monitor the performance of these employees, and provide veterans with a single point of contact for assistance with problems that cannot be resolved at the local level. The office would also track patient issues and complaints throughout the system and provide recommendations for improvements in policies, practices and procedures. 
   I support H.R. 2192, as amended, to ensure that our veterans receive the highest quality health care available. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2192, as amended.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4255, as amended, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide assistance to the Paralympic Program of the United States Olympic Committee, and for other purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the bipartisan manner in which this bill moved forward through the Committee. I want to especially acknowledge Chairman Filner for introducing H.R. 4255, the United States Olympic Committee Paralympic Act of 2008 and working with Subcommittee Chairwoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Ranking Member John Boozman to incorporate into the amended version of the bill several provisions from my bill, H.R. 1370, The Disabled Veterans Sports and Special Events Promotion Act of 2007. 
   In 2005, the VA and the USOC concluded an agreement to increase efforts to increase participation by disabled veterans in sports at all levels, as part of their rehabilitation from their injuries. I was privileged to participate in encouraging the USOC and VA to reach that agreement and by combining our two bills, we will give VA and the USOC Paralympics some of the resources they will need to meet that goal. I look forward to seeing the VA, USOC Paralympics and their partners ramp up their efforts and am excited that we will have at least 11 disabled veterans participating as members of the U.S. Paralympic Team in Beijing as a beginning of larger disabled veteran participation in the future games. 
   I am also pleased to see a renewed commitment to providing training opportunities for veterans that will be offered. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I believe you and I have created a bill that will encourage more disabled veterans to participate in sports from the local level up through elite competition such as the Paralympic games beginning with games in Beijing. Through the grant program, this bill uses the USOC and its partners to equip, train and support disabled veterans' sports and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 4255, as amended.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6445, as amended, the Veterans Health Care Policy Enhancement Act of 2008, to amend title 38, United States Code, to make a number of improvements to Department of Veterans Affairs health care policies. 
   H.R. 6445 is a bipartisan bill that includes provisions from four veterans' health care bills that were introduced by members from both sides of the aisle. I thank our new colleague on the Committee, Don Cazayoux, for introducing this bill. 
   H.R. 6445 would exempt veterans, who have non-service connected catastrophic injuries, from co-payment requirements for treatment at VA facilities. Such veterans require extensive medical care and many have limited financial means. The bill would also require the VA to implement a comprehensive policy on the management of pain experienced by veterans, encourage HIV testing for veterans, and expand the VA's authority to provide counseling for family members of veterans receiving non-service-connected treatment. 
   I am pleased that this bill also includes the text of H.R. 6366, the Veterans Revenue Enhancement Act of 2008. I, along with Mike Michaud, Jeff Miller and Henry Brown, introduced this bipartisan legislation to help VA better manage third-party collections, and provide additional fiscal responsibility for the department. 
   The provision would require VA to establish seven Consolidated Patient Accounting Centers (CPACs) modeled after the successful demonstration project in Asheville, NC. The concept of the Consolidated Patient Accounting Center, also known as CPAC, was included as a demonstration project in the Conference Report (House Report 109-95 and Conference Report 109-305) in 2005 accompanying H.R. 2528, requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to initiate a revenue improvement demonstration project within 60 days after enactment of the bill (Public Law 109-114). The VA followed the recommendations in the report, and created the Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Patient Accounting Center demonstration project located in Asheville, North Carolina. 
   The Asheville project proved to be very successful in enhancing revenue by more than $12.5 million in fiscal year 2007 and $6.5 million so far in fiscal year 2008. Building on this success, would enable VA to secure hundreds of millions of dollars that currently go uncollected. These funds could be used to further improve veterans' health care. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Veterans' Health Care Policy Enhancement Act of 2008.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6225, as amended, the Injunctive Relief for Veterans Act of 2008. This bill would amend title 38, United States Code, with regard to equitable relief with respect to a State or private employer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity for its bipartisan efforts in bringing this bill before us. Subcommittee Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin and Subcommittee Ranking Member Boozman have brought together some good provisions from several bills to improve upon existing Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, USERRA, and Servicemember's Civil Relief Act, SCRA, protections for our military servicemembers and their spouses. 
   H.R. 6225, as amended, incorporates provisions of H.R. 2910, introduced by Representative Susan Davis of California; H.R. 3298, introduced by Representative Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania; and, H.R. 6070 introduced by Representative John R. Carter of Texas. 
   The intent of the legislation is to encourage courts to utilize equity powers in appropriate USERRA cases that come before them. During discussion of the bill that took place during the full Committee markup, Subcommittee Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin clarified that injunctive relief is available under the discretion of the judge hearing the facts at a preliminary hearing, and that this section is not intended to create a new avenue of appeal in USERRA cases. 
   The bill, as amended, would also require colleges and universities to provide refunds on tuition and fees for students who are called up for active duty, and it would allow such students to reenter the institution at the same educational and academic status that was held at the time of activation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill would extend SCRA protections to enable servicemembers with deployment orders to more easily terminate or suspend service contracts without fee or penalty for such services to include cellular phones, utilities, cable television, or internet access. It would also add penalties to those creditors under SCRA who refuse to reduce interest rates as currently required. 
   Additionally, H.R. 6225, as amended, would allow a military spouse to vote in the same location of Federal, State and local elections as the servicemember, and pay taxes in the same State as the servicemember.  
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6225, as amended, provides members of the Armed Forces necessary protections that will enable them to make a seamless transition back to civilian life after their tour of duty is completed. These brave men and women put their lives on hold to ensure the freedom and safety of our Nation, and we owe it to them to provide relief when and where we can. 
   I support H.R. 6225, as amended, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   I rise in favor of this bill, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. For over 15 years, whether it was on the House Armed Services Committee or chairman of the personnel responsible for the military health delivery system or now at the VA, issues on seamless transition have been around. It appears that we can only measure success incrementally. For that, it is also unfortunate, because we deal with bureaucracies with both of these very large Departments and their subagencies. 
   Mr. Skelton had some challenges in front of him because his leadership rushed him to get this bill to the floor. He also then convinced Chairman Filner to waive the jurisdiction of the VA Committee so that this bill could get here.  
   I want to thank Chairman Filner for complementing the amendment that I had offered in the Armed Services Committee, and I also want to thank Chairman Skelton. I want to thank Duncan Hunter. I want to thank Dr. VIC SNYDER and JOHN MCHUGH for working with me on the amendment that was offered at the Armed Services Committee that profoundly enhances the seamless transition. 
   In its original form, the bill required a year-long pilot position on transition. Pilot programs can be useful in exploring new ground. But when it comes to seamless transition, and especially during a war, this is not new ground, and we need to proceed. 
   Back in 1982, is when Congress directed VA and DOD to work collaboratively together on health care. That was 25 years ago. I believe this collaboration is still being stymied by bureaucrats protecting their respective rice bowls. My amendment replaced the pilot project with system changes. It required a written transition plan for wounded servicemembers. 
   The bill would require an interoperable electronic exchange of critical medical information between the Departments and the use of the electronic DD Form 214, which DOD would provide to the VA. That allows VA real-time access to veterans' medical history. 
   There are countless examples of veterans seeking care at a VA facility, only to discover that their paper and military health records are not available. The lack of prior DOD health services is especially critical for badly wounded warriors returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The ability to transmit data between DOD and VA will speed the recovery of these warriors by avoiding duplication of unnecessary treatment or, more importantly, failing to provide lifesaving procedures. 
   Electronic exchange of critical medical information might also prevent bureaucratic intransigence on the part of VA. For example, I recently heard from a former Indiana National Guard member who was wounded in the neck and shoulder by an improvised explosive device. When he eventually filed a disability claim, the VA said the documentation in his military medical record was not sufficient to prove the injury was service connected. 
   Hopefully this rapid exchange of information will put an end to such bureaucratic injustices. Further, H.R. 1538, as amended, would require the use of a uniformed separation and evaluation of physical by DOD and the VA, but the VA could use more disability ratings. This cornerstone seamless transition eliminates the frustrating requirement for a servicemember to have two physicals, one at the military and one at VA. 
   I associate my comments with Mr. Filner. Too often, recently discharged veterans filing VA disability claims must undergo a VA physical because their discharge physical failed to address issues affecting the veteran's claim for benefits. 
   Corporal Murphy, for example, in a hypothetical, gets his discharge physical from Fort Hood, Texas, on June 3. A week later he files a disability claim to the VA for his bad knee. Meanwhile, 90 days later, his physical records at the National Records Center in St. Louis arrive. During that period of time, his medical records are not available to process his claim, and our corporal has already lost 3 months. This is foolishness. 
   The result is not only costly but also delays the processing of a veteran's claim and possibly entry into life-changing programs, like the VA's vocational rehab program. Finally, the amended wounded warriors bill would collocate VA benefit teams at military treatment facilities and other agreed upon sites to facilitate the transition of recovering servicemembers. Why should a wounded warrior undergo a lengthy period of convalescence and be required to seek out VA benefits counselors at VA offices that are usually far away from the MTF where the veteran is living. 
   Instead of making Airman Mendez, for example, go to the VA, it is time to mandate the VA to be present where the airman is undergoing treatment. This will give him timely access to VA counselors and benefits that process needed benefits. 
   These teams would provide preseparation counseling for recovering servicemembers, and records would be transmitted electronically from DOD to VA before the date of separation or retirement, thereby reducing delays, which now bedevil the system. Access to these teams would enable most veterans to leave the treatment facility with their VA benefit in hand. 
   My own personal experience over the past decade validates the importance of these reforms. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In the 1990s, Mr. Skelton, you can remember well that we drew down the size of the military. We cut all the divisions and the wings and the squadrons; and then we had to figure out how we could maintain all those military hospitals and the medical treatment facilities, all the forts and bases. And we found out, with limited dollars, we really couldn't do all of that to the level which we wanted, so we created three centers of excellence, at Brooke and at Bethesda and at Walter Reed. 
   And I do not want this debate today, for anyone who is working at Walter Reed, to feel as though this Congress is not proud of the level of respect and the enduring appreciation that we have of the doctors and the nurses and the technicians that provide the health care at Walter Reed, Bethesda, Brooke or any other medical facility, from the battlefield throughout the entire process. 
   We are very disappointed that we had single soldiers that were wounded, convalescing, being held in an unhealthy building. But for that to then be interpreted as though bad care was being delivered at Walter Reed is not a factual basis. 
   It is a curious thing, though, that one of our centers of excellence ended up on the BRAC; and that is an issue, Mr. Skelton, we are going to have to address. 
   I do want to also extend though a compliment to Mr. Hunter and Mr. Skelton, because you saw this one coming in 2004, because in the 2005 Defense bill you then created the Disability Claims Commission. It has been extended now and will not report until September of this year. So I want to thank you for seeing this one coming; and I wish that we could have gotten to those results much, much sooner.

But with this Disability Claims Commission sitting out there, and they have given 2 years now of labor, we are going to have to come back at this one in earnest.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. I compliment Mr. Ryan for his budget. I speak in support of the Republican alternative for fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. 
   In particular, I would like to address the veterans discretionary health care and programs which would provide $42.4 billion, most of it for health care. This budget is $2.9 billion above the administration's overall request. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Republican alternative would provide our Nation's veterans with an increase of $8 billion more than the Democrats over the next 5 years, without any tax increases on the very same veterans. That is a budget of $8 billion more for our veterans versus a tax increase of $392.5 billion on America's veterans. 
   Now think about that. They want to stand up and say, oh, we are going to be against enrollment fees and copays, but what are they really doing? They are increasing taxes on veterans to do what? Increase funding for veterans programs. Think about it. Over 25 million veterans they want to increase taxes on. 
   The assumptions behind the numbers of Mr. Ryan's budget here, within the $28.5 billion for medical services for FY08, House Republicans would provide $1.3 billion more than the President's request, including $463 more in increasing demands on VA health care system, $200 million for mental health over and above the President. These numbers are over and above the administration. $100 million more on OIF, OEF, $100 million for chiropractic care, $100 million for dental care, $80.2 million on long-term care, $50 million more than the administration on polytrauma care, $65 million for prosthetic and sensory aids, $25 million for blind rehabilitation. Republicans would also provide nearly $100 million more than the administration's request for the medical and prosthetic research. 
   We also fund $1.4 billion above the administration's budget for construction and facilities. This includes $585 million to the O&M accounts for improving our current medical facilities, an additional $691.7 million to support a substantial investment in the construction, renovation, planning and design of major medical VA facility projects, and $120 million for the gravesite expansion in the National Cemetery Administration. 
   When you look at the chart, the zeros on the chart, the dots here are the National Cemetery expansions. Those would include Calverton, New York; Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania; Canton, Georgia; Abraham Lincoln, Illinois; Dayton Ohio; Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona and Riverside, California. 
   When you look at the diamonds, what this would include would be advanced planning for construction projects in Tampa, Florida; in Bay Pines, Florida; Seattle, Washington; American Lake, Washington; Seattle, Washington; Roseburg, Oregon; Palo Alto, California; San Francisco, Loma Linda, Los Angeles; Dallas, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; Butler, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C. 
   In North Carolina it would be in Salisbury, Ashville and Fayetteville; Wichita, Kansas; Omaha, Nebraska. And in South Carolina, it would be in Columbia and in Charleston. In Alabama, it would be Birmingham. Perry Point, Maryland; Bronx, New York; West Haven, Connecticut. 
   With regard to major construction projects and full funding, that is depicted by the stars on this map, you would have in Los Angeles, California would be seismic corrections of $103.8 million; Fayetteville, Arkansas, clinical addition $59 million; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a campus consolidation of $105.5 million; Lee County, Florida outpatient clinic of $89 million. St. Louis, Missouri, is medical center improvements of $25.8 million. Columbia, Missouri operating suite replacement of $32.5 million. And in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a spinal cord center of $30 million. 
   With regard to how we get to the $8 billion differential, it is this: The Democrats assume an assumption over the 5 years of an increase of 5.8 percent. The Republican proposal over 5 years is an increase of 7.2 percent. What I did is I looked at the medical inflation plus utilization rate, and when you work those numbers, we actually come up with a differential of $8 billion. The Republican alternative is an $8 billion increase in veterans funding over and above the Democrat proposal. And we do that without increasing taxes on America's veterans. I think that is pretty important. 
   When I think about the taxes on America's veterans and families, let's see, those are tax increases on middle-income veterans and their families, tax increases on low-income earners, tax increases on veterans with children, those who own small businesses. Think about it. It is going to be an increase in marginal rates potential, the child tax credit reduction could be wiped out. You've got the increase in the marriage penalty, increase in death taxes, increase in capital gains and other tax increases. That is going to be upon America's veterans, and I think that is pretty disturbing. 
   So a $392.5 billion Democrat tax increase, who does it hurt? It hurts America's veterans. It hurts our wounded warriors. It hurts our low-income veterans. It hurts veterans with children. It hurts our veterans who are business owners. 
   Now think about this for a second. I want to go back to it. I support the copays, I support enrollment fees for proper utilization. But what is happening here? You see, my Democrat colleagues will stand up and say to the veterans community, oh, I don't want to increase any copays, I don't want to do enrollment fees, but what are they doing instead? They are taxing America's veterans, who in turn will then take those dollars and roll them back into veterans programs. But they are going to champion that we are not going to increase copays, I am not going to increase enrollment fees, but what I am going to do to 25 million veterans is I am going to tax them, not only during your life, but I am going to tax you when you die.  
   Thank you, for the time Mr. Ryan and I thank you and your staff for your hard work on this budget. It is a budget of which we can be proud. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Republican Alternative for Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution for veterans discretionary healthcare and programs would provide $42.356 billion, most of it for health care. This budget is $2.939 billion above the administration's request. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Republican alternative would provide our Nation's veterans with an  increase of $8 billion more than the Democrats over the next 5 years without any tax hikes on those same veterans. 
   Within our $28.5 billion for medical services for FY08, House Republicans would provide $1.3 billion more than the President's request, including: $463 million more for increasing demands on the VA health care system; $200 million for mental health care; $100 million more for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom; $100 million for chiropractic care; $100 million for dental care; $80.2 million for long-term care; $50 million more than the administration for polytrauma care; $65 million for prosthetic and sensory aids; and $25 million for blind rehabilitation. 
   Republicans also would provide nearly $100 million more than the administration's request for medical and prosthetic research. 
   We fund $1.4 billion above the administration's budget for construction and facilities. Included in this is $585 million for improving our current medical facilities and an additional $691.7 million to support a substantial investment for the construction, renovation and planning and design of major medical facility projects. The Republican Alternative also includes $120 million for the National Shrine Commitment of the National Cemetery Administration and expands gravesites in the following locations: Annville, PA; Canton, GA; Elwood, IL; Riverside, CA; Calverton, NY; Houston, TX; Elwood, IL; Dayton, OH; and Phoenix, AZ. 
   This is why the Republican alternative also funds an additional $691.6 million above the administration's request to support a substantial investment for the construction, renovation and planning and design of major medical facility projects. 
   $105.5 million for the consolidation of campuses in Mr. Doyle's district in Pittsburgh, PA. Constituents in Mr. Altmire's, Mr. Murphy's, and Mr. Murtha's district will benefit as well. 
   $103.8 million for seismic corrections in Mr. Waxman's district in Los Angeles, CA. Constituents all over the Los Angeles area would also benefit including constituents in Ms. Harman's and Ms. Watson's district. 
   $32 million for a Spinal Cord Center in Ms. Moore's district in Milwaukee, WI. Constituents in Ms. Baldwin's, Mr. Sensenbrenner's, and Mr. Ryan's district will benefit. 
   $89 million for outpatient improvements in Mr. Mack's district in Lee County, FL. Constituents in Mr. Mahoney's, Mr. Diaz-Balart's, and Mr. BUCHANAN's district will benefit as well. 
   $59.9 million for a clinical addition in Mr. Boozman's district in Fayetteville, AR. Constituents in Mr. Snyder's, Mr. Blunt's, and Mr. Ross' district will also benefit. 
   $92 million for medical center improvements in Mr. Carnahan's district in St. Louis, MO. Constituents in Mr. Lacy Clay's and Mr. Akin's district will benefit. 
   $25.8 million for operating suite replacement in Mr. Hulshof's district in Columbia, MO. Constituents in Mr. Graves', Mr. Skelton's, and Mr. Akin's district will benefit. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Republican Members also fund advanced planning for medical facilities. The funding represents about 5 percent of the estimated cost of the project and is an important first step in the construction of these new facilities. 
   $36.8 million for a co-located joint use medical facility with the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, SC. This project is in Mr. Brown's district but constituents in Mr. Clyburn's district will benefit as well. 
   $8 million for Poly-trauma center expansion and a bed tower in Tampa, FL. The project is in Ms. Castor's district, but it will also help constituents in the districts of Mr. Bilirakis, Mr. Putnam, and Mr. Young. 
   $1.9 million for seismic improvements in Seattle, WA. The project is in Mr. McDermott's district but will also help constituents in the districts of Mr. Dicks and Mr. Smith. 
   $6.8 million for inpatient and outpatient clinic improvements in Bay Pines, FL. This is in Mr. Young's district and the project will also help constituents in the districts of Mr. Bilirakis, Ms. Castor, and Mr. Putnam. 
   $26.5 million for land to build a new medical facility in Louisville, KY. This project is in Mr. Yarmuth's district but will also benefit constituents in the districts of Mr. Davis and Mr. Lewis. 
   $14 million for seismic correction in ambulatory care in Palo Alto, CA. This project is in Ms. Eshoo's district but constituents in the districts of Mr. Honda, Mr. Lantos, and Mr. Stark will also benefit. 
   $2.4 million for seismic corrections in American Lake, WA. This project is in Mr. Smith's district but constituents in the districts of Mr. Dicks, Mr. MCDERMOTT, and Mr. Reichert will also benefit 
   $3.6 million for seismic corrections for the mental health building in Roseburg, OR. This project is in Mr. DeFazio's district but constituents in the districts of Ms. Hooley and Mr. Walden will also benefit. 
   $2.9 million for a spinal cord injury center in Dallas, TX. This project is in Ms. Bernice Johnson's district but other constituents in the Dallas area will also benefit.

   $7.8 million to fix heating and air conditioning and clinical deficiencies in Omaha, NE. This is Mr. TERRY'S district but I am sure all Nebraskan veterans will benefit. 
   $1.8 million for outpatient expansion in Ashville, NC. This project is in Mr. SHULER's district but constituents in the districts of Mr. DAVIS and Mr. DUNCAN, of Tennessee, will also benefit. 
   Mr. Chairman, I now turn to my next chart, which shows the Republican alternative budget outlays for the next five years. 
   As you can see, the President's five-year average budget growth rate for VA discretionary spending is 1.60 percent, the Democrat's is only 5.8 percent and the Republican alternative five-year average growth rate is 7.2 percent. 
   This number accounts for the cost of medical inflation that is calculated by the consumer price index and annual increased use of VA by all veterans. 
   What this means Mr. Chairman is that over the next five years Republicans would increase spending by $8 billion more than our friends on the other side of the aisle and we will do this without a tax increase. 
   Mr. Chairman, at first blush the Democratic budget appears good for veterans, but it is really just smoke and mirrors. 
   The Democratic budget contains a $392.5 billion tax hike. This includes tax hikes on middle income veterans and their families, veterans who are low-income earners and veterans who own a small business. Democrats also blocked every amendment offered in the Budget Committee that would stop unfair taxes on veterans and their families. 
   Mr. Chairman, the last time Democrats were in the majority they passed the largest tax hike in history. Now, with only 3 months in office they have already broken their own record. This is the wrong message to send to our veterans and their families. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are a nation at war, and we will win this war. The best way to maintain morale of our servicemembers is not to micromanage the fight, pretending that's good for the troops; it is to make tough decisions here that will engender their confidence in our capacity to preserve the vitality of this nation while they fight for its freedom.  
   I believe that the Republican budget helps do exactly that, while honoring the promises we have made our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I recall March 6, 2003. I came to this floor and spent an hour and outlined the 17 resolutions before the United Nations in which Saddam Hussein continued his open defiance. That is what was also discussed. So what is lost from this debate is Saddam Hussein's recalcitrance unto the world. As a veteran of the Gulf War, that was ended by a ceasefire, where Saddam Hussein did not uphold his end of that agreement. 
   To the last speaker, he spoke about the political and economic, but in order for an infancy government to be able to survive, you have to be able to establish its political apparatus, you have to be able to give it its economic goals and a means to achieve them, but you also need to establish security. 
   Therein lies the President's plan. He met with the leaders of Iraq and he got some concessions from Iraq. ``In fact, you will take the lead, you will work with your parliament, you will achieve these political and economic goals as we work together to establish your security.'' That is the plan. 
   The Democrats only want to focus on one small portion of the plan, which is called a surge, which is disrespectful to the plan. But it makes good politics, and that is what is disheartening to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Schmidt).

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I stand before you in opposition to this resolution. It champions a dismally irresponsible and dangerous course of action. On its face, the resolution merely addresses the troop surge, ignoring the President's plan in its totality, as I said earlier. 
   I will now address our efforts to move forward on the diplomatic and economic front. With regard to the establishment of government capacities, the establishment of the rule of law is a necessity, for to have Iraq address the national plan of reconciliation, to have them pass enabling legislation for the Constitution and amendment process, and to set provincial elections, is extremely important. 
   With regard to the economic piece, the concession whereby the Iraqi government will seek to have a quasi-Alaskan model with regard to the revenue sharing of its precious assets is extremely important, because you do not want the distribution of the oil proceeds to go to regional leaders. It will only empower them and then weaken the unity Federal Government. 
   With regard to the debt relief agreements, much has been negotiated, but the neighboring Gulf States need to step forward, and upcoming meetings are at hand. 
   The debate seems to be on the security piece. There are those saying well, let's just back out completely. They use words such as ``withdraw to the United States'' and ``redeploy.'' But is that a plan? I haven't heard any form of military plan. They say what, we will just turn it over to them? Wow. 
   As we listen to the neighboring leaders, they express caution of cataclysmic consequences. I fear how America will be defined by our friends. Do you reach out to a child as you are teaching it how to walk, let go of the hand and let them fall and say it is up to you, and leave them alone? You are going to have to find your way to the kitchen. Or do you go back and help them walk? 
   I am concerned about how cold and callous the new majority is to this new infant democratic government. But I guess even more disconcerting to me is the politics behind this resolution. While the majority tells the American public that change must occur, that we are going on the wrong course, this amendment basically opts for the status quo, the same status quo for which they have attacked the administration, which they campaigned against last fall. 
   They offer no solution, only acting as the critic, and being a critic is the easiest role in the world.     
   Just sit back and just bark at someone, yet offer no plan of resolution for stability within the region. What is the plan of success for them? Silence. 
   Let us also address the undemocratic process under which their resolution was brought to the floor here. We stand here and debate how best to bring democratic government to Iraq, yet this majority in Congress shows the leaders in Iraq how to be undemocratic and deny a Republican minority a chance to bring a substitute resolution. I find that quite ironic that this Capitol that is supposed to be the most democratic process in the world is now undemocratic. 
   I beg of my colleagues not to play politics with the safety and security of this Nation. I must remind this body and the American people the threat we face. 
   Iraq is a critical front in the larger global war on terror. We are entrenched in a fight against masters of intimidation, bound together by an extreme, perverted ideology which they claim is a legitimate interpretation of Islam. 
   Our enemies seek to establish regimes that rule according to a violent and intolerant distortion of the Islamic faith, that is, to deny all political and religious freedoms and aim to establish sanctuaries for violence and additional attacks. They have no centralized command structure or place to call home. Instead, they exploit local conflicts to build a culture of victimization. They mobilize resentful, disillusioned, and underemployed young men and women and have mastered technology to aid them in their bidding. 
   Abu Masab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, explicitly warned that the establishment of a democratic Iraq is the death of al Qaeda there. Think about that. The leader of al Qaeda in Iraq says to establish a democratic Iraq is the death of al Qaeda. Yet, what does the new majority want? Pull-out of our troops, weaken the stability of that country, to be overtaken then by al Qaeda, instead of strengthening the democratic government, ensuring that they have an economy political apparatus and have the security to prevail, which is the death of al Qaeda. 
   Our resolve should be to succeed in this struggle, and we must be stronger in our resolve than their resolve to inflict terror. At every step they are watching our move, waiting for us to falter, fail, drop our guard, or just walk away. 
   General John Abizaid, the former commander of U.S. CENTCOM, described well the ramifications of letting Iraq fall to terrorism in his testimony before the United States Senate: ``The enemy's vision of the future would create a region-wide zone that would look like Afghanistan under the Taliban. Music would be banned, women ostracized, basic liberties banished, and soccer stadiums used for  public executions. The people of the region do not want the future these extremists desire. The more we talk about this enemy, the more its bankrupt ideology will become known.'' 
   This enemy uses suicide bombings, beheadings and other atrocities against the innocent citizens of the world to pursue its objectives. They are the enemy of freedom and wanting nothing more than to disrupt peaceful, civilized people everywhere. No one is safe from this hatred, and it is not restricted to the Middle East. Just ask those in London and Italy and other places around the world. This is a global threat. Iraq is not the limit of this beast's haven. 
   It is the challenge of our generation to destroy this enemy wherever it lurks. We cannot do it without the resolve, cunning, and above all vigilance. The price that we pay for freedom is eternal vigilance from those who seek to steal it away. 
   While we have not been attacked on our homeland since September 11, 2001, it is not for the lack of the terrorists' efforts. We have been fortunate to have spoiled and foiled several plots here in this country and around the globe. Yet, the fight is far from over. Chances are that today you feel safe in your neighborhood. You can walk to the store. You can play with your children at the local park or in your backyard without having the fear of being blown up by a roadside bomb or being shot by a sniper. You allow your children to go to the malls without fear of a suicide bomber. 
   It is that peace of mind, this feeling of safety that we are endowed as the elected leaders of this country to preserve at all costs. 
   I remind you that these extremists want to disrupt and destroy our every way of life. They are not equipped to do battle on a conventional battlefield. Instead, they look to disrupt our most basic freedoms, our securities and our institutions, public and private. The world is their battlefield. Their hope and their goal is to outlast our resolve. 
   It is our burden to bear, our generation's great challenge to defeat their hopes and objectives. We cannot cower and seek the sanctity of security in this challenge. You are not free when you cower. You have given in to the designs of the terrorists if you do. 
   This debate began with the Speaker asking whether or not this resolution will make our troops safer. The answer I believe is no. This resolution lacks courage. It lacks leadership and it lacks a forward way of thought. This resolution, to me, is pure political theater. The administration has given us a legitimate plan to work with, and the majority in this House has given us nothing but criticism and a path for an easy way out that virtually holds the door open for terrorists to destroy an infant democratic government and to open a way of access to the U.S. and our allies for terror. 
   I close with a thought from a past President who faced the trials of war in his lifetime. President Kennedy said, ``Let us resolve to be the masters, not the victims, of our history, controlling our own destiny without giving way to blind suspicions and emotions.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Thinking about this debate, I reflected back to when this House voted on the resolution to go to war and so thought I would better look up what I said, because I remembered something that was very serious to me and what was very curious was the years before 2001. 
   I had watched a lot of people vote against the defense bill. Yet coming off of September 11, there was this bravado about going to war, and I felt a sense of unease. So I thought I would go back and see what I said when I came to the floor on that day, and I would like to share it with everyone. 
   I said: ``I have seen great resolve uttered in this Chamber and the swaggering display of courage. 
   ``I can share with my colleagues, as a veteran of the gulf war, that war may be glorious in verse or prose, but in reality it is not. We are about to send America's finest, and that means men and women will die. It will be a noble cause, but we must remember the resolve of this moment, because in war it is chaotic. Not everything is going to go right. We cannot be 400 and 500 generals between the House and the Senate.''  
   Now, I said that back on September 14, 2001, trying to caution all of my colleagues, many of whom had voted against defense bills, now rattling sabers, feeling this bravado of let us go to war. 
   Now I have to ask, was that a false bravado because now, as war has gotten chaotic and has gotten hard and difficult, now they cower, and I have great concern. 
   So I ended with: ``We cannot have the bravado of today and then run at the first sound of the guns.'' 
   Please remember this day when it gets hard. 
   The gentleman I am about to yield to, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis), was chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee, and I remember him well because I had served as the chairman on the House Armed Services Committee at the time and served with Mr. Smith, and when we came out after Oklahoma City, then-President Clinton, very concerned about terrorism, and we passed our first anti-terrorism bill here in the House and many people were like, wait a minute, that was a domestic act of terror. 
   No, President Clinton began to focus abroad, not only upon the Russian Mafia, but he was also focusing on Osama bin Laden and other terror. It can be debated whether or not he took great vigilance on that front or not, but let me post a real compliment to Mr. Clinton because he turned to Hugh Shelton. 
   General Shelton was at the time the commander of Special Operations. I was very upset coming out of the House conference on the anti-terrorism bill because JOE BIDEN and I were trying to bring the country to roving wiretaps, but the country was not ready for it. So then it was defeated. 
   I then get on the phone and call General Shelton and bring him up to Washington, D.C., and I asked him a simple question: What are the top ten unfunded requirements that you have given Special Operations, the missions that you have to do in the dark world to secure America but you don't have the resources to accomplish them?     
   He sat down and he detailed them. More importantly, as President Clinton then named him, appropriately and wisely, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he worked then with JERRY LEWIS and prepared the force. So when America was hit on September 11 and we immediately sent those special operators into Afghanistan, they were prepared, they were equipped, they were trained to fight in the dark world and special operations, and JERRY LEWIS, his leadership, was responsible for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California such time as he may consume.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The mission here is to develop a country that can govern, sustain and defend itself, govern, sustain and defend. So under that, under govern, you have political. Under sustain, you have economic. And under defend, you have security. 
   So as I listened to my colleagues come to the floor and say it only requires a political solution, really? These are not inextricable. I also appeal for consistency. I just heard the last speaker talk about the necessity for national interests, so he said it is not in our national interests to be in Iraq. 
   Let's stop and think about that for a second. Let's be consistent. In the 1990s, Republicans operated under what was called the Weinberg Doctrine, that only commit U.S. ground troops if there is a national vital security interest. And that is how we kind of were guiding ourselves based off the Weinberg Doctrine. Then what happens? We have got Bosnia. We said oh, that is a European problem. Then the U.N. came in, the U.N. was ineffective. 
   President Clinton made a judgment, and he upset Republicans. He made a judgment that because of the atrocities in Bosnia, the ethnic cleansing that was occurring, that it took U.S. ground troops, a presence of them. Republicans at the time said there are not vital national interests at stake. Democrats then said, oh, that doesn't matter, this is a humanitarian cause. 
   Democrats said, it is okay to take U.S. troops, put them on the ground to stop the fighting for a humanitarian purpose. That is what Democrats said in the 1990s. Republicans were curious about all of this because it was against the Weinberg Doctrine. As a matter of fact, there were 315 votes. I brought a resolution to the floor, 315 Republicans; Democrats then said, oh, no, no, no, no. Don't put U.S. ground troops on the floor, and that was in the middle of the Dayton Peace Accords. 
   Bill Clinton was very upset with me. So the President brings me down to the White House and says, hey, work with me. So I said, I will, and we drafted benchmarks for the success of the civil implementation of the Dayton Accords. I worked with President Clinton. 
   Where do I hear you working for a solution in Iraq? Don't just be the critic. I ask of my colleagues, where is your consistency and your policies? If you are as consistent as you were for a Democratic President, it was a humanitarian cause in Bosnia, I don't hear you talking at all about the atrocities that occurred under Saddam Hussein.     
   The murders, the ethnic cleansing, a humanitarian cause, the effect it has not only upon the neighbors, the stability of the Middle East, but what about Israel? Do you want to turn your back on Israel?

   Mr. BUYER. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this past fall I had an opportunity to meet with 18 representatives of the European Union. The European Union is quick to say that we are not necessarily with you on Iraq. But boy, we are with you in Syria and standing tough on Iran. 
   Do you know what the message is? It is inextricable. You cannot pick and choose. The Middle East is so complex. So, Mr. Speaker, when you begged of me to address you the question, it is this: If we were to follow the Pelosi-Murtha plan, what happens to Israel if we leave a vacuum that is quickly filled by Islamic extremists in Iraq? Therein lies the question. 
   I believe we jeopardize the safety and security of a lone democracy called Israel, and we leave them to defend against a region filled with vipers who seek their annihilation. 
   Now, our friends who are also of Arab nations, they are partners in our coalition to help on the political and economic success of Iraq, and they are eager for us to also help Israel and the Palestinians resolve those differences. It is all inextricable.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would ask the last speaker if he could remain for a moment. I have such great respect for my colleague, Mr. Michaud of Maine. We have worked together on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We deal with the consequences of war. And so out of my respect for Mr. Michaud, I would like for us to clarify what may be a potential contradiction. 
   The gentleman said that, and correct me if I am wrong here, unanimously commanders did not ask for an increase in troops. According to General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and this was in his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on January 11, 2007: ``So, collectively, the military commanders, both U.S. and Iraqi, have asked for this increase. And those of us in advisory positions agree with their request. 
   ``General Casey and his Iraqi counterparts have determined that there are more forces needed ..... 
   ``To do this, we're going to need additional U.S. forces. General Casey and General Abizaid have asked for those additional forces, as have the commanders below them. 
   ``In addition, to reinforce success at Anbar province, the Marine commander out there has asked for, and General Casey and General Abizaid have asked for, an increase of about 4,000 troops out there ..... 
   ``So, collectively, the military commanders, both U.S. and Iraqi, have asked for this increase.'' 
   That was our testimony of our Chairman of the Joints Chiefs before the Armed Services Committee. So I will yield to the gentleman and ask if he was aware of General Pace's comments before the Armed Services Committee because it appears contradictory to the gentleman's statement.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a good listener of the gentlelady's remarks, I would think she would be in support of the President's plan. I agree with her when she was talking about what is necessary for Iraq to govern itself, but in order for this country to begin to govern itself, it also needs to have security, and the Iraqi people themselves must have a belief in the support of that new unity government. 
   Now, with regard to the Iraqis themselves, whom we have been training, that is, the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi police force, that is exactly what the plan is. The plan is for the Iraqis to take the lead. 
   So the gentlelady's remarks confuse me, because as she says, I want the political apparatus to do this, but I define Petraeus' need for additional troops as an escalation. Therefore, she advocates for the status quo, and everybody knows the status quo is for failure. The remarks confuse me. 
   The commander on the ground of our forces in Baghdad just said on January 26, that this is about Iraqis taking charge of their own security. In order for them to do that, we have to buy them time to continue to train and for the government to become more legitimate in the eyes of the Iraqi people. Earlier what I said, the mission is to govern, sustain and defend. You have the political, economic and security necessities to accomplish that mission. I think everybody in this body is going to agree. 
   When I met with President Talabani in August, we talked about the establishment of the rule of law, we talked about the implementation of the national plan of reconciliation, the distribution of the oil revenue, the modernization of their electrical grid. Promoting Iraqi unity was really deep on the President's mind. 
   I wrote a note here after I met with him. The note I wrote was I believe the unity federal government has a real challenge. Their challenge is to convince the Iraqi political, religious and civil society leaders to compromise for a sustainable settlement to support the new federalism. That is the challenge. 
   So I am challenged when I hear individuals say, well, on the security apparatus, let's just get U.S. forces out of there, we'll let the Iraqis take care of this. The question is, are the Iraqis prepared to do it alone? I haven't heard anybody say they are, that they can do it alone. 
   The Iraqis in turn said we still need coalition assistance, and so the commanders on the ground say we need these more troops to do this. We are sending General Petraeus, our best commander, to the field. 
   Mr. Speaker, a father-in-law of a soldier wrote this 10 days ago: ``From where I am sitting, it seems that threatening loss of funding for operations in Iraq, tying the hands of senior officers, to say nothing of the Commander in Chief, and proposing to legislate the conduct of this war, looks worse than cut and run. It feels like betrayal of the families who bear the burdens.'' 
   I can remember being in the desert in the first gulf war while this body debated a resolution on the utilization of force. I know what it was like to lose a friend in war. I shed the tears of my father when he lost buddies for his Army service in Korea. 
   Challenged by my own Member of Congress who voted against that resolution, I felt betrayed. While I was in the desert, I felt betrayed, so much so that I vowed while I stood at that cemetery in Lafayette, Indiana, the funeral of my friend, that I felt I still had a mission left, and it was to come help the country again. 
   So I ran against that incumbent Member of Congress who I felt betrayed me while I was in the desert in the gulf war. I had never run for any political office in my life. I was elected in this body at the age of 32 with so much to learn. 
   But I have never forgotten about the soldier, the sailor, the airman, the marine and the coast guardsman. I am so proud of them and what they do. 
   The world of an American soldier is more complex today than ever before, with technology, intricate rules of engagement designed to eliminate the loss of noncombatant life and a tough, innovative and savvy enemy. Our soldiers who are in the fight are watching and listening. 
   One wrote from Iraq 2 weeks ago: ``Until victory or until the perseverance and the spirit of the American will arose, victory in Iraq is achievable by our amazingly capable and determined Armed Forces. Their effort will only be undercut by self-serving politicking and pointless impatience. If we decide we want victory, we will have it. If we quit on our effort, we will have defeat.'' 
   Contending with the complexity of today's battlefield and the ripple effects of politics 6,000 miles away, our soldiers live and measure value by simple enduring imperatives. They place a lot of value in loyalty. They count on each other, loyal to each other, to their commanders and to their oath to defend the Constitution, and their love of country helps them do their duty. A warrior bears true faith and allegiance.     
   Members of our Armed Forces live and die by the readiness of their buddies to express their loyalty in the conduct of faithful duty. They expect no less of their leaders up the chain, whether they wear the stripes and diamond of a first sergeant, the eagles of a colonel, or the stars of an admiral or general, or their leaders in government, both executive and legislative branches. 
   Yet, in response, what do we offer? The fortitude of contradiction I say. The Senate unanimously confirms a new multinational force commander, General David Petraeus, whose most compelling value is perhaps his reputation for unrivaled understanding for his clear grasp of counterinsurgencies. 
   Yet the authors of the resolution before us seek to deny our best commander the manpower assets he has asked for to prevail. What a disturbing contradiction. The Senate unanimously says, this is our best commander. Before they vote and say we are going to send you, he says, I need these five brigades. Then this body drafts a resolution that says, we do not think he should have the five brigades. 
   I suppose we have the Senate and the House now in complete contradiction. General Petraeus is a decisive man who has a decisive strategy, and he intends to reinforce our troops and root out the enemy. Aside from the gratuitous gloom that is smothering the debate on Iraq, moving in reinforced strength to destroy an enemy is a time-honored and frequently successful course of military action. 
   It is so especially when conducted by a capable commander. We have already agreed that General Petraeus is such a commander. Many of us know that this is what our troops yearn to do. It is what Americans yearn for us to do, prevail. 
   Now, lest one of my colleagues is tempted to try some contextual mischief, we all know that military victory with the right strategy is only part of the equation of success in Iraq. Real success is not a quick, easy affair. I might offer success as defined by the establishment of a stable, popularly elected government, the rise of the rule of law, and the stability necessary to foster the growth of a strong middle class. 
   That will take a combined and continued effort using diplomatic, informational and economic levers. But those levers cannot fully operate without security. And that is the challenge I have in listening to this debate. We in Congress have confirmed General Petraeus and sent him now into battle. 
   And what now do some want to do with him? They seek to turn the House floor into a cockpit of battlefield wisdom to disavow his strategy. Some may say, go to Iraq, Commander. Disregard the strategy that you talked about in the Senate. Instead use your brilliance to conduct a feckless campaign of status quo. 
   The resolution before us disavows the human assets our commander needs to accomplish his mission. But then it says, we support the troops. How can you say we support the troops but you don't give the commander that which he says he needs? I do not understand. 
   I am a colonel in the Army Reserve. I have served for 26 years this Nation. How can you say to me, Steve, I support you. I will give you the beams, the bullets, the ammo, the water. I will  give you anything you need, but do not ask me for any troops and good luck on your mission. Because you do not get to ask for reinforcements. You do not even get to ask for anybody else. 
   As we know the Pelosi-Murtha real strategy is to slowly bleed our battlefield commander dry. They know he cannot prevail waging a campaign of the status quo. So some will slowly reduce funding for his Army in an effort for it to wither on the vine. And it to me is disgraceful. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, does this fit the definition of loyalty and support of members of the United States Armed Forces serving bravely in Iraq? 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Sometimes in the middle of debate when one gentleman refuses to yield to another gentleman, it can be for a variety of reasons perhaps, but sometimes it is because the argument is pretty weak. 
   So I have listened to this debate. I have not heard anybody on this side of the aisle call any of my Democratic colleagues unpatriotic. So the gentleman who just spoke protests too much. Maybe he has some deep feeling inside, has some guilt inside perhaps. I don't know. I can't speak to that. Only he can. I would be more than pleased to yield to him. I would extend the courtesy to him. But I just don't recall that at all. 
   As a matter of fact, I had to turn here to some staff that is with me because they are just as sensitive about this as I am and the seriousness of this debate. 
   The gentleman to my left is an Air Force Academy grad and he is the Air Force Reserves, and he flies C-5As right into Baghdad. He knows what that is like. 
   The two gentlemen right behind me, this gentleman right here, Jeff Phillips, served in the first gulf war, in the second gulf war, and has two Bronze Stars. This other gentleman over here, Jim Lariviere, served in Afghanistan and wears the Bronze Star. 
   So I turned to all three of these guys and I asked them, Have you heard anybody say or make someone feel as though they were unpatriotic? And the answer was ``no'' from these three men. 
   So please don't come and pollute the debate because it only makes you look silly.

   Mr. BUYER. I thank the Speaker. I am thankful that the gentlewoman gave the answer to her question, and the answer was that it was implicit. 
   It is very easy in debate to come down and to create a straw person and then attack the straw person. If the gentlewoman has felt that way, that is completely unfortunate. But please don't say you have been called unpatriotic. That is the exchange I had with an earlier speaker. Don't accuse Republicans of such things. I am disturbed by that and very bothered.

   Mr. BUYER. Now I seek to reclaim my time, because that is a legitimate question. 
   As the commander in the field, if you say to the commander, ``I support  you.'' All right? What is the commander going to say? The commander says, ``All right, I have a mission, and you say I support you.'' That means, I suppose, that I support you by making sure that you have been properly trained, that you have your uniform, that you have your ammunition, you have your helmet, you have your body Kevlar. You have what is necessary to accomplish your mission. But do you? If the commander says, ``I need more troops to accomplish that mission,'' you say, ``But you can't have those.'' Is that then supporting the commander? 
   That is why I pointed out the contradiction in that the Senate says to General Petraeus, ``We agree, you are our best commander to go over there.'' And before they took that vote, he said, ``I need those five brigades.'' So they passed the vote and they sent General Petraeus over. 
   Now we are faced with a vote that says I support the troops, I support the members of the Armed Forces. 
   How can we say, ``I support you, but, Mr. Commander, we are not going to give you the troops''? That is the point of the question. 
   So please don't try to spin it into something that says, oh, you are calling me unpatriotic. That is what I think is rather peculiar. 
   Mr. Speaker, does the gentlewoman have any other speakers?

   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There was a peculiar comment a bit ago from the gentleman from Ohio when he said, well, I didn't call you unpatriotic when you sent troops into battle and they didn't have their up-armored Humvees. What a weird statement to say. 
   You see, we prepare our force. So, for example, when myself and Colonel Phillips in the first Gulf War, those Hummers that we took in, they didn't even have doors on them. We didn't have doors on the side of those. We didn't go in with all the side plates and front plates, groin plates, neck plates, shoulder plates. We didn't do all that. Most of that, the body armor, was reserved for special ops. When you move in to counterinsurgency and then the enemy begins to use roadside bombs to attack our Hummers, what do we have to do? We respond. That is why I made the comment of what does our military do? They improvise, they adapt and they overcome, and that is exactly the same thing which our enemies do. So it was a very peculiar comment to say, well, we didn't attack you because. I don't know. It's so peculiar, I don't even want to comment anymore on it. 
   What I would like to comment on is the nature of the enemy and the significance of Iraq and the global war against militant Islamists. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to turn our attention to the nature of the enemy we face and the significance of Iraq in the global war against militant Islam. We often use the term ``global war on terrorism'' to describe our efforts since the September 11 attacks. I believe this is a misnomer. In reality, we are engaged in a campaign to counter a global, radical Islamist insurgency, a global jihad. This global insurgency is, in fact, a diverse confederation of Islamic movements that uses terrorism as only one of its many tactics in their war against the West. 
   On February 23, 1998, Osama bin Laden, leader of al Qaeda, declared war on the United States, Israel and the West in his statement ``World Islamic Front Declaration of War against Jews and Crusaders.'' Subsequently, bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, issued a statement after September 11 announcing a two-phase strategy for al Qaeda's war. First, reestablish the Islamic Caliphate, the historical and temporal authority of all Muslims that existed from 632 A.D. until 1924 A.D, and, second, use the Caliphate as a launch pad for a jihad against the West. 
   No one believes that Osama bin Laden directly controls this worldwide insurgency. Rather than a single monolithic movement, al Qaeda is but one movement that symbolizes a broad and diverse confederation of militant Islamic movements that operate around the world. This insurgency includes such wide-ranging organizations as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, the Islamic Army of Aden, al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Abu Sayyaf Group in Malaysia and the Philippines. In addition, Iran, a majority Shia country, backs numerous radical Islamic groups, including Hezbollah and Palestine rejectionist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. These wide-ranging and disparate groups are loosely linked ideologically, linguistically and culturally. They use family ties, personal relationships and financial links to coordinate their efforts. Thus, the global jihad plays out in a variety of theaters around the world. These include: 
   The Americas, where in North America we saw the September 11 attacks and as a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report stated, Federal authorities have shut down at least 25 charities contributing to terrorist activities since September 11. That is here in our own country. 
   In South America there is a strong al Qaeda presence in the tri-border area of Argentina, Paragiau and Brazil. 
   In Western Europe, where there have been recently uncovered plans for attacks against Great Britain and the United States and where insurgent financial networks and planning cells flourish throughout Europe supporting insurgent activities. 
   In the Southern Pacific, where the Bali bombings in October 2002 were attributed to an al Qaeda-linked cell. 
   In the Ibernian Peninsula and North Africa where North Africans were blamed for the May 2004 Madrid bombings and where there have been bombings in Casablanca, Morocco and Tunisia. 
   In the greater Middle East, where there are ongoing Islamic insurgencies in Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon and Israel/Palestine. 
   In East Africa, where simultaneous bombings in October 1998 in Kenya and Tanzania were coordinated from the Sudan. 
   The Caucuses and European Russia, where nationalist insurgencies in Chechnya, Georgia, and Azerbaijan have been co-opted by Islamic militants. 
   South and Central Asia, where the Taliban and al Qaeda continue to operate in Afghanistan and in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas. 
   And in Southeast Asia, where Islamic insurgencies continue in Indonesa, the Philippines and southern Thailand. 
   These Islamic insurgencies share a common goal. They are oriented toward the overthrow of the current world order and its replacement with a pan-Islamic Caliphate. They wish to change the status quo using violence and subversion in order to initiate a clash between Islam and the West. They use terrorism, subversion and propaganda to further their goals and initiate open warfare. 
   It will come as no surprise that most of the active Islamic insurgencies take place either within the historical bounds of the Caliphate, meaning North Africa, Spain, Turkey and the Middle East, or in areas claimed by the new broader pan-Islamic Caliphate, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Indonesia. These insurgencies contribute to what is called an arc of instability that reaches from Indonesia across South Asia and the Middle East to North Africa. 
   Where does Iraq fit into this global jihad? Iraq has become the front line in the open warfare of the global insurgency. In many ways, Iraq is a microcosm of the complex worldwide Islamic  insurgency. The centrality of Iraq to the insurgency became clear in a July 2005 letter to the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi from al Qaeda's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri. In discussing Iraq, Zawahiri stated: 
   ``I want to be the first to congratulate you for what God has blessed you with in terms of fighting battle in the heart of the Islamic world, which was formerly the field for major battles in Islam's history, and what is now the place for the greatest battle of Islam in this era.'' 
   Zawahiri went on to outline the larger strategy for Iraq. First, expel the Americans from Iraq. Second, establish an Islamic authority and reestablish the Caliphate. Third, extend the jihad neighboring secular Islamic countries. Fourth, eliminate Israel. Thus we see a clear statement from the number two man in al Qaeda that Iraq is centrally important to the global jihad. 
   Al Qaeda is not alone in operating in Iraq. There have been extensive Iranian involvement that has been alleged recently. On March 14, 2006, General John Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``Iran is pursuing a multitrack policy in Iraq, consisting of covertly supporting the formation of a stable, Shia Islamist-led central government while covertly working to diminish popular and military support for U.S. and Coalition operations there.'' 
   While the full extent of Iranian support is unknown, it appears that at a minimum Iran is supporting the 20,000-man Badr Brigade as well as the 2,000-man Wolf Brigade which is an offshoot. Just this week, administration officials announced that Iran was the source of deadly explosive form projectiles being used in Iraq. 
   Iraqis also grasp that Iraq is central in this global struggle. Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki told us here in a joint session of Congress, ``I know that some of you here question whether Iraq is part of that war on terror, but let me be very clear. This is a battle between true Islam, for which a person's liberty and rights constitute essential cornerstones, and that of terrorism, which wraps itself in a fake Islamic cloak.'' 
   The centrality of Iraq in the larger global Islamic insurgency cannot be disputed. Our enemies and our friends in the region grasp its significance. To fail in Iraq is to fail in the larger struggle. And our enemies are watching. They remember what America did not grasp the scope of the threat posed by radical Islam. Yet the signals were there: 
   In 1979, 66 American diplomats taken hostage, held in Iran for 444 days. 
   In 1983, a truck bomb kills 241 Marines at their barracks in Beirut. 
   In 1988, Pan Am flight 103 bombing kills 270, including 189 Americans, over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
   In 1993, six killed at the first World Trade Center bombing by militant Islamic terrorists. 
   In 1996, 19 U.S. servicemembers were killed at Khobar Towers. 
   In 1998, 225 people killed in bombings at our U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. 
   In 2000, al Qaeda's attack on the destroyer USS Cole kills 17 American sailors. 
   In 2001, September 11, killed 2,973. 
   Until 2001, we failed to properly react to this threat. The enemy perceived us as weak and believed that we lacked the will to fight. 
   This resolution before us, if approved, will signal our lack of resolve and I am troubled. It will be interpreted, I believe, by the forces of the global jihad that the United States lacks the will to persevere against the forces of radical Islam. It will give comfort to their thoughts, for they will know that we in Congress are uncertain and irresolute. In a war where information and willpower are more important than firepower, we must continue to send the signal that we cannot and will not cease to fight the enemy's vision of the world. You see, even if you have your way and you say we are going to withdraw the troops, whether they come back to the United States or whether they go to an over-the-horizon position and this new infancy government fails, we cannot cower to the security of America. This front continues. 
   The Bible states, ``If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?'' If the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow? This resolution, I think, sends the wrong signal to our friends and to our enemies and I urge my colleagues to support those troops, sound the certain trumpet, and defeat the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (VETERANS' MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CARE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2162, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008, as amended. I would like to say up front how very pleased I am with the overall bill, as well as S. 3023, as amended, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act, which will follow this bill. 
   Before us, this bill incorporates almost 50 veterans' health care provisions that have passed either the House or the Senate this Congress in 15 bills listed in the joint explanatory statement accompanying this legislation. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner and our esteemed colleagues in the Senate, Chairman Akaka and Ranking Member Richard Burr, for their bipartisan efforts to bring the compromise to the floor here tonight. 
   I would also like to commend Health Subcommittee Chairman Mike Michaud and Ranking Member Jeff Miller for their leadership and spirit of cooperation that enabled us to reach this compromise agreement with the Senate. 
   This comprehensive bill includes an array of substantive initiatives, and I would like to highlight just a few of them. 
   The chairman just mentioned the construction bill. And in particular, I'm very pleased that we have the $66 million to fund for the fifth polytrauma center. And at these polytrauma centers, very dedicated individuals do amazing work to help save America's most precious assets. And so funding for the fifth polytrauma center is extremely important. 
   I am also pleased that we have not only the facilities in Palo Alto, but also in Puerto Rico with regard to seismic corrections. We have increases in previous authorizations, not only in New Orleans, but also in Denver. And I'm most hopeful that the initiatives in Denver can be worked out satisfactorily that also please the Secretary of the VA. We also have increases with Orlando. So these three ongoing projects, New Orleans, Denver and Orlando, are extremely important to me. 
   I also recognize and I want to thank the chairman. At the last moment--out-of-scope revisions are always difficult for us, and the VA brought us one of the out-of-scope provisions that dealt with the outpatient clinic in Peoria. And I want to thank the chairman for taking this up, and I also want to thank the Senate for accepting this, because that facility in Peoria, there were some miscalculations. And had we not acted, the VA could have proceeded, but in the end it would have cost us more money.     
   Acting and taking care of this outpatient clinic in Peoria was the right thing to do. I want to thank the chairman for taking up this out-of-scope provision and also for the leadership of Ray LaHood of Illinois. 
   I also want to comment on the VA substance-use disorder and mental health programs. A full continuum of care for substance-use disorder will go a long way I believe to help at-risk veterans obtain care and overcome the stigma that may prevent them from seeking the services that they in fact need. 
   In order to ensure that VA implements a patient-centered pain care strategy that is effective and consistent system-wide, the bill will require the VA to develop and implement  a comprehensive pain management policy. 
   The bill will also establish a pilot program to allow veterans in certain highly rural areas to obtain care from their local community providers. This provision originated from legislation introduced by my good friend and long-time member of the VA Committee, Jerry Moran of Kansas. Jerry Moran is a real champion of rural veterans, and I applaud him for his hard work and dedication to this cause. This is a cause that has lasted now for several Congresses. 
   I am pleased that this bill also includes a measure I introduced, H.R. 6366, to help the VA secure collections from third-party insurance companies. This is an issue that I have been working on now for the last four sessions of Congress. Specifically, it would require the VA to establish seven Consolidated Patient Accounting Centers, or CPACs, modeled after the successful Mid-Atlantic CPAC over the next 5 years. I would like to thank Chairman Filner for working with me in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that this was included in the bill, and I also want to applaud the leadership of Mike Michaud and Mr. Miller. 
   This measure comes from a bill I introduced to help the VA better manage third-party collections and provide additional fiscal responsibility for the department. The Consolidated Patient Accounting Center was established as a demonstration project back in 2005. It proved to be very successful in enhancing revenue by more than $12.5 million in fiscal year 2007 in the demonstration project alone and more than $22 million over and above the goal as of August for fiscal year 2008. 
   Building on this success would enable the VA to secure hundreds of millions of dollars that currently go uncollected. What we did is we did a pilot. We found how successful that pilot project was over and above the projected revenue that we would get. And so we looked at this and said, well, this is something that needs to be rolled out across the country, and when we do this, we in fact are going to be receiving hundreds of millions of dollars. Those dollars then can be poured back in to further improve veterans' health care. 
   I want to thank subcommittee Chairman Mike Michaud and Ranking Member Jeff Miller for having joined me as cosponsors on this initiative along with the leadership of Chairman Filner. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, there are a number of other important provisions in this bill that are omitted from my remarks simply because of the result of the constraints on time. But I would like to conclude by mentioning a notable provision that would designate the spinal cord injury center at the VA Medical Center in Tampa, Florida, as the Michael Bilirakis Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center that the chairman spoke of. All of us have a great deal of respect for Michael Bilirakis, and I am very, very pleased that my good friend and this great public servant is going to be recognized. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge at this time the hard work of the staff of both sides of the aisle here in the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their work on this legislation, in particular not only the individuals of the House majority health subcommittee but also that in the House and the Senate. 
   With that, I want to reserve my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to comment on a provision from the ranking member in the Senate, Richard Burr, the provision to require the VA to provide financial assistance grants to very low income veterans families residing in permanent housing for supportive services, including outreach, case management, assistance in obtaining VA benefits and assistance in obtaining other forms of public benefits. 
   As we transition veterans from homelessness into permanent housing, these are provisions that in the last Congress Senator Burr was working very hard on, but did not come out as a result of the conference. He hung in there and we were able to get this done, and I want to thank Chairman Filner, who also accepted these provisions, and I want to extend my appreciation. 
   I also want to extend appreciation to the leadership and to some Members who worked very hard on Orlando in making sure that that becomes a reality. These are Members that seem to never leave me alone. In particular, Tom Feeney, Cliff Stearns, Corrine Brown, Ginny Brown-Waite and Ric Keller, working very hard to make sure that Orlando becomes a reality. 
   The last thing I would like to thank Chairman Filner for was accepting the provisions along with Chairman Michaud, and that was Ranking Member Jeff Miller of the Health Subcommittee sought to eliminate all copayments for hospice care. Those of us that have had to deal with a loved one that goes through hospice care understand how difficult and challenging that moment is in all of our lives. So for us to waive those copayments during that time period I think was the right thing to do, and I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on that. 
   With that, I encourage all Members to support this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3023, as amended, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. The manager's amendment before us is a compilation of the bipartisan provisions of 11 bills from both the House and the Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner, Chairman Akaka and Ranking Member Richard Burr for their cooperative efforts in bringing this bill forward to serve our Nation's veterans. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of both the House and the Senate staff. Our Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity is chaired by STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN and by Dr. JOHN BOOZMAN as ranking member. Both of them together have a proven track record of working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that veterans who are leaving active duty have meaningful career opportunities and the skills needed to pursue those opportunities. 
   Our Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs has also demonstrated its dedication to working on behalf of our Nation's veterans. I want to thank Chairman Hall and Ranking Member Lamborn for their hard work and bipartisanship in their efforts. 
   Madam Speaker, S. 3023 incorporates over 60 veterans' provisions that have passed either the House or the Senate, and that's what had to be negotiated here between the two bodies. Clearly, time doesn't permit me to expand on every one of these provisions, but I'd like to highlight just a few. 
   I am pleased that the Department of Labor will be required to collect data on the employment needs of Native Americans. The Department of Veterans Affairs will begin a 20-year longitudinal study of veterans who participate in the VA's Vocational Rehabilitation Program. This measure would also increase the time to 20 years that spouses of deceased or 100 percent service-connected disabled veterans have to use their education benefits. 
   There are provisions that extend the temporary increases in VA-conforming loan limits in the stimulus act of 2011 and that reduce equity requirements for VA-guaranteed refinancing loans. As well, there are provisions that  renew the adjustable and hybrid adjustable loan programs for another 4 years. 
   This bill expands the servicemember protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act in several ways. It also clarifies the VA's authority to purchase advertising as part of outreach efforts. 
   Madam Speaker, for me, one of the most exciting parts of the bill would authorize a new program at the VA to promote the increased participation by disabled veterans in adaptive sports. That is what the chairman was referring to. The bill would direct the VA to expand its cooperative sports activities with the United States Paralympics, and it would authorize $8 million to be used for grants to support an integrated adaptive sports program managed by the United States Paralympics and by partners such as the Disabled Sports USA, Blaze Sport, the National Parks Recreation Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Disabled American Veterans. 
   I want to thank Chairman Filner for his mutual interest in the disabled sports and for his efforts to ensure this bill was included. 
   Chairman Filner, your leadership here, not only for the United States Olympic Committee's being out in Chula Vista, is extremely important in making this a reality. So I appreciate your support, not only of our Olympic Committee but also for the fact that this has become a reality. So, because of your leadership and for the fact that we were able to take our mutual interests and to bring them together to serve a greater need, I applaud your leadership. 
   The United States Paralympic Team that competed in Beijing included 13 disabled veterans, several of whom were wounded in the war on terror. Now, a few years back, I visited Chula Vista. This was years back when the United States Olympic Committee had a very large board, and we had individuals who were really positioning to profitize off of the Olympic ideal, and it was very disturbing to me. We had a series of ethical blunders that occurred at the Olympic Committee. It was the Olympic Committee's darkest hour. 
   I came back to Congress. I met with Cliff Stearns at the time, who was on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He helped set a course for the reorganization of the United States Olympic Committee at a time when also then Senator McCain took action in the Senate and when the Olympic Committee also then created its own task force. The Olympic Committee had reorganized itself. We went into the past Olympics. Everyone was pulling on the rope in the same direction. It was very exciting. I took that relationship that had developed with the United States Olympic Committee and brought them to the VA to develop these sports programs. 
   The whole intent of not only this legislation but of what Chairman Filner is embracing is to use sports as a platform of healing, and I think that is extremely important. What we have done here is: As for these 13 disabled veterans who just returned from the Paralympic Games in Beijing, this group of wounded warriors produced four gold medals, three silver medals and three bronze medals. So I'm pretty excited about these spectacular Americans. 
   It's the wave of the future when disabled veterans who are competing with artificial limbs or with spinal cord dysfunctions will be commonplace. The program we are implementing here today will be the seed for the VA and for its partners to nurture and grow. 
   So I want to thank Chairman Filner for his leadership on this. This is so meaningful. I look forward next week to coming out to your district, Chairman Filner, and to going out to Chula Vista, out to the U.S. Olympic Training Center with the Secretary of the VA. Hopefully, you'll have an opportunity to be there. I'm pretty excited about these sports programs. 
   In Senate 3023, we will also enhance and improve veterans' benefits and the system that administers them. Such revisions include measures to increase the accuracy and the timeliness of benefit claims decisions and to enhance the VA's use of information technology. It will also look at VA disability compensation to ensure due consideration is afforded to veterans for their loss of earnings and their quality of life. 
   This is something that Senator Burr and I had introduced in a measure in response to not only the recommendations of the Disability Commission but also in response to the recommendations of the Presidential task force of Senator Dole and former Secretary Shalala. 
   The bill would also improve benefits for the survivors of deceased veterans. For instance, it would allow the substitution upon the death of a claimant for the purpose of acquiring benefits. That was Mr. Lamborn's provision. 
   The bill would also release survivors of deceased claimants of the frustration of the time-consuming process of starting the entire claims process from square one. 
   The bill would also create a VA Office of Survivors Assistance to ensure surviving dependents have access to benefits and to services and that such programs are responsive to the needs of survivors. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Hall and also Mr. Lamborn. I had asked the staff to go through this bill that we are looking at today, and I wanted to put authorship on all of the provisions so I get to see who are the authors of all of the provisions. So I want to thank Mr. Lamborn and Mr. Hall for their good work on the bill. Mr. Lamborn has a lot of authorship on a lot of different provisions. 
   But I see a lot of names in here. There is also STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN and Dr. BOOZMAN. These are two individuals who had a lot of years working together, and they define bipartisanship on the committee, Madam Speaker. They have a great work product. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman).

   Mr. BUYER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to extend compliments to the Speaker pro tem, the gentlelady from Ohio, for her attentiveness during this. As a former member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee yourself, and as a former chairwoman of one of the committees on Comp and Pen and Memorial Affairs, I appreciate your leadership here tonight. 
   I also would like to note that two members of the staff on the Republican side are not with us here tonight who gave tremendous contributions to both bills that we've had here tonight, on health and in benefits; that being the former Staff Director, Jim Lariviere and Jeff Phillips. Both of these individuals have been called to active duty, and both were promoted to Brigadier General. So Brigadier General Jim Lariviere tonight with the United States Marine Corps is on duty, and Brigadier General Jeff Phillips is also on duty with the United States Army. We recognize their contribution to these bills tonight, and wish them Godspeed and safety to themselves and their families. 
   With that, I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Filner and the leadership of your team and that of your staff, and to include my staff for their hard work and the cooperation with that of the United States Senate.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUYER. (MEDAL OF HONOR SPECIAL PENSION INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6980, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the amount of the Medal of Honor special pension provided under that title by up to $1,000. 
   The Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest award for military valor. It is presented by the President in the name of Congress, and is often called the Congressional Medal of Honor. Since its first presentation in 1863, over 3,467 Medals of Honor have been awarded to a total of 3,448 individuals (there have been 19 double recipients). 
   Under current law, a veteran who has been awarded a Medal of Honor is eligible for a monthly pension ($1,129 as of December 1, 2007). Eligibility for the pension is based solely on receipt of the Medal of Honor, and the recipient of the Medal of Honor must elect to receive the special pension. Receipt of this pension does not reduce any other benefits under U.S. law, and a veteran who has received more than one Medal of Honor is limited to receiving only one Medal of Honor pension benefit. 
   The legislation before us would increase the rate of this special pension by not more than $1,000, subject to appropriations. In an informal estimate provided to my office, the total cost of this bill would be $6 million over 5 years. The authority provided to the Secretary to expend the funds provided for this purposes would expire on September 30, 2013. After expending any funds appropriated for this purpose, the Secretary would not be authorized to further increase the rate of the special monthly pension. 
   Madam Speaker, over the years, it has been the honor of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to name facilities after a number of Medal of Honor recipients, many of whom have passed on, but 100 still remain with us and walk as humble heroes among a grateful people. We can never thank these heroes enough for all they have given to protect our freedom and security. The special pension increase seems like a small amount compared to the price these warriors have paid. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
