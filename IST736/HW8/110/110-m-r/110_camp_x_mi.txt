<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I come from a large family. My wife and I have three children of our own, so I have seen little kids stick their fingers in their ears and shout ``I can't hear you.'' 
   I never thought I would see the Congress do it, but that is exactly what the Democrats are asking us to do today, stick our fingers in our ears and shout at the Medicare trustees that we can't hear their warning. We couldn't hear it the first time they said it. We couldn't hear it the second time they said it, and we certainly don't hear it the third time they have said it. 
   The Democrats' response to the looming Medicare crisis is as childish as it is irresponsible. By repealing the Medicare warning, as this rule change would have us do, it is akin to be warned you are out of money and still going out for an expensive dinner and leaving the bill for the next group to sit down. 
   You know who gets stuck with the tab in this scenario? The American taxpayer, and it is a $1.5 billion tab in the first year alone. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Every year we fail to address entitlement reform, future generations are saddled with an additional $2 trillion worth of debt. 
   With the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund set to go bankrupt in a decade, I, for one, cannot ignore, and I urge my colleagues not to ignore these Medicare warnings. We should reject this resolution, and we should begin to transform Medicare so it can continue to benefit future seniors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans are increasingly concerned about the U.S. economy, and in Michigan economy is the number one issue families worry about. It's critical for Congress to address this issue and enact legislation that will encourage job growth, renew consumer confidence, and spur new business investment today. We can't afford to wait and waste time loading up a bill with extra spending measures. 
   The bill before us is a positive step and one we should take. I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery and the leadership on both sides for bringing this bill forward today. However, I don't know a single American who prefers a tax rebate, even a rebate as generous as this one, to a good-paying job. So by no means is this the only step we should take if we are to become truly competitive and create long-term job growth in this country. The Tax Code continues to be a drag on families and businesses. If we're serious about putting America on a growth track, we must tackle substantive tax reform sooner rather than later. 
   In 1960 America was home to 18 of the world's 20 largest corporations and their employees. By 1996, however, only eight of the world's largest companies and their employees were based in America. This shouldn't surprise us. The United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. While the average rate is 31 percent, the U.S. rate is a whopping 39 percent, exceeded only by Japan at 40 percent. 
   So before we congratulate ourselves on this economic stimulus package, we ought to address this jarring trend that is far more dangerous to American prosperity than next quarter's economic forecast. 
   I urge my colleagues to send this bill to the President as quickly as possible and to begin to address long-term strategies such as regulatory relief, tax reform, and expiring tax relief measures for sustained job creation and economic growth.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill clearly isn't about helping low-income children. If it were, it would have support from both parties and the President would be eagerly waiting to sign it into law. This is a missed opportunity. Virtually everyone supports providing health insurance to low-income children. But when a Federal health program for children starts covering not only families, but childless adults making three and four times the poverty level, it has clearly lost its focus. 
   It is clear that Democrats want taxpayers to fund, and the Federal Government to directly provide, health care benefits to millions of more Americans, even for those families making over $80,000 a year. They are using SCHIP as a vehicle and the children it is intended to cover as a shield to get one step closer to total Government control over our health care system. The current plan to expand SCHIP is in dire need of a second opinion. Instead of moving further and further away from the core mission, we should be reforming the program to ensure it is truly helping America's uninsured children. 
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stipulates that the proposed expansion would cover an additional 5.8 million Americans at a cost of $35 billion. Alarmingly, more than one out of every three individuals already has private insurance. The bill before us does little more than move children and upper-income families from private insurance plans to taxpayer-funded  plans. That is a prescription for the type of government largess that stifles economies and unduly burdens taxpayers. It is not a prescription for reducing the number of uninsured Americans. 
   State's and children's advocates should take a second look at this bill. Because of shoddy funding sources, this bill is likely to harm more States and health care programs than it helps. A Heritage Foundation study showed that as many as 28 States, including Michigan, stand to have a net loss of $10 to $700 million in revenue. 
   This bill is designed poorly, funded poorly, and will do little to help lower-income Americans obtain health coverage. The President should veto this bill. Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion, as we did nearly 10 years ago when the program was created, to make certain that children in America have access to a health care system.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I also want to commend the gentleman from Louisiana for his leadership, for his thoughtful approach to issues, for his service to the Ways and Means Committee and to the Congress, and especially for his friendship. 
   I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1424. Is this better than the original Paulson proposal? Yes. Is this bill perfect? Hardly. And this bill is better, especially for taxpayers. 
   The bill resolves the remaining tax items before the Congress. After months of delay, the House will finally do what Republicans called for back in June, pass an AMT patch without increasing taxes. Without the patch, more than 25 million American families would pay an additional $62 billion in taxes. We must provide this relief sooner rather than later, and I'm pleased this will finally be done without raising taxes. 
   By passing this bill today, Congress will extend for 2 years the wide array of important tax credits and deductions so many families and employers rely on. We are reaffirming to the auto industry and consumers that incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles will remain law. This is something I have pushed for hard in the House. And this new plug-in credit, like the hybrid credit that I offered in 2005, will spur consumer demand for alternative vehicles and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   With this bill, we are providing certainty to businesses that are investing heavily in research and development. The Senate amendment extends the R&D credit through 2009 and increases the alternative simplified credit. This is a step in the right direction. We must make the credit permanent to attract high-tech businesses and compete in today's global economy and to keep jobs here in America. Myself and Mr. Levin, my colleague from Michigan, have championed legislation to do just that, and I look forward to making this goal a reality in the next Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support this legislation so that Congress can provide stability to our financial system and give American workers and businesses the tax relief they so desperately need and deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We all support the goal of improving patients' access to treatment for mental illnesses. However, this bill represents a flawed approach that will ultimately do more harm for these patients by driving up costs and resulting in few employers actually offering any health care coverage to their employees.  
   This bill will place an unprecedented number of mandates on insurers and employers, which will increase the costs of health insurance for working Americans. Whether large or small, these costs get passed along to the purchasers of health insurance, employers and employees alike. 
   Dramatic increases in health care costs have already forced many employers to drop or limit health care coverage. This in turn makes it more difficult for their employees to obtain any health insurance, let alone mental health and substance abuse benefits. The mandates in this bill will only make the situation worse, making health insurance unaffordable for increasing numbers of Americans. This is why employer groups like the Chamber of Commerce, the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation are all strongly opposed to the bill before us today. 
   There is a better way to achieve the goals of protecting patients and ensuring they get access to the mental health care they need. Senators Domenici and Kennedy have crafted a bipartisan bill that is supported by mental health advocates, employers and insurers, and if that bill were on the floor today, I would vote for it. The Senate bill adopts a more targeted approach to defining covered conditions. 
   The bill also allows plans to determine the network of providers while maintaining parity for treatment limits and cost sharing. The Senate approach may significantly reduce the potential cost that could be imposed upon employers while still achieving the goal of mental health parity. 
   The Senate has worked with the mental health community to balance the needs of patients with the ability to provide quality, affordable and accessible health insurance. These compromises led the Senate to unanimously pass their legislation last September. Unfortunately, in order to pay for the costs associated with this bill the majority has also decided to shift costs to every American by increasing Medicaid rebates from pharmaceutical companies and limiting physician ownership in hospitals. Both of these proposals represent the view that bureaucrats, rather than markets, can better govern health care. At the end of the day, price controls and more government regulation increase health care spending and deny patients access to high-quality care. 
   Whether they want to admit it or not, the majority is increasing health care on every American twice under this bill. As more and more Americans are having difficulty affording health care, we should be looking to expand affordable health care options, not placing more mandates on employers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I will be our final speaker on this side, Mr. Speaker. 
   This debate is not really about who's for or against mental health parity, it's about doing mental health parity in the right way. The Senate unanimously passed a mental health parity bill last year, and there, Senators Kennedy, Domenici and Enzi worked in a bipartisan way and brought all affected parties together to reach a compromise that mental health groups, employers and health plans fully support. 
   What has really not been answered in the debate today, and I don't fully understand, is why put the entire DSM-IV manual in statute. It's a diagnostic code. It's not for coverage decisions on health benefits. That question has never really been fully answered. 
   Let's do the sensible thing. Let's vote this bill down and adopt the Senate bill. We can have a mental health parity bill on the President's desk by the end of the month if we followed this procedure. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, program continues to be an important program to American workers who are left out of a job because of increased imports or jobs moving overseas. When workers need assistance getting back on their feet, the TAA program is there to help them get a new job or new career. It is important for Congress to reauthorize this critical program that right now is helping 15,000 workers in Michigan. 
   I support the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. This bill provides more funds for training programs, increases the size of the health care tax credit, and assists workers who are in training programs with additional income support. I wish, however, that Chairman RANGEL would have made the health care tax credit permanent instead of eliminating it after 2 years. That being said, I believe it is important that the bill raises the amount of health insurance assistance from 65 percent to 85 percent. Now, out of work individuals will be better able to afford health insurance while they look for a new job. 
   In my district, where unemployment rates are higher than the national figures, the TAA program has been an invaluable tool in getting people into the classroom and into new, better paying jobs. The community colleges in my district have done a good job of expanding their curriculum to include new courses tailored to high-paying, expanding industries in Michigan. I remain committed to doing whatever it takes to maximize the Federal assistance available to help these workers and their families. In so doing, I will vote for the bill before us this afternoon.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7060, the majority's latest extenders package, a bill that will never actually deliver the tax relief it's promising because it will never pass the Senate and it will never be enacted into law.  
   I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee--it's time to be realistic. We are in the waning hours of this Congress, only a day away from our scheduled adjournment, a day or two or three. 
   Yet here we are, conducting another purely political exercise on a tax bill that is doomed in the other body because of our House majority's insistence on adhering to the misguided PAYGO rules. 
   Indeed, as the end of the 110th Congress draws near, it's interesting to see the application of PAYGO to expiring tax provisions remain as difficult for the majority today as it has ever been.     
   Throughout the year, Republicans have insisted that we should not have to raise taxes to prevent a tax increase. Democrats, meanwhile, have insisted that PAYGO requires us to find offsets for these tax extensions. Of course, the majority's adherence to PAYGO has been somewhat intermittent. It has been waived to fund unemployment benefits, and on the housing bill passed in July. And PAYGO has never applied to spending, which continues to grow at unsustainable rates. It has also been waived for extensions of some tax provisions, including just Wednesday on the AMT patch. Nevertheless, the majority has steadfastly refused to waive PAYGO for other expiring tax provisions even in the face of ample evidence that the Senate and the President are not in agreement with that position. 
   On Tuesday, the Senate acted on a bipartisan basis to find common ground on this issue. They agreed, by an overwhelming vote of 93-2, to approve a comprehensive tax relief package containing extenders provisions that are not fully offset, as many Democrats would prefer, but contain more offsets than Republicans would like. 
   Is the Senate's package perfect? Of course it isn't. But given the limited time left in this Congress, the Senate's comprehensive package is likely the only option that will lead to enactment of much-needed extensions of expired and expiring provisions, including the AMT patch, the State and local sales tax deduction, the research and development tax credit which is so critical for restarting our economy, and the extension of the subpart F exception for active financial services income. 
   Why is this our only option? Because the Senate, which has labored long and hard to develop that compromise, has indicated in no uncertain terms that it is not going to reconsider these issues again this year. 
   The Senate majority leader made that point on Tuesday on three separate occasions. In the morning he urged the House: ``Don't send us back something else. We can't get it passed. If they try to mess with our package, it will come back here, it will die, and we will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'' 
   In the early afternoon, he told a reporter that he had talked to House leaders and ``told them how important it is that we get a bill back like the one we sent them ..... If they send us back something different ..... it is dead, sorry to say.'' 
   And then, to make sure that there was no confusion, even later in the afternoon the majority leader said, ``If the House doesn't pass this, the full responsibility of this not passing is theirs, not ours.'' 
   So let's be clear. The Senate's comprehensive tax package, which passed 93-2, is the only clear path for enactment of the AMT patch and the tax extender package we are debating here today. Let me say that as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I don't like being told by the Senate what we should or should not do. This is not how I prefer to legislate, of course. However, with adjournment looming and with a continuing resolution that takes us into next year, it is time to be realistic, as the distinguished chairman said. We are headed down a path that will leave all of these critical issues unresolved well into 2009. 
   Simply put, the majority's insistence on paying for extenders has painted us into this corner. And, unfortunately, we don't have time to wait for the paint to dry. Failing to act on the extenders this year will be burdensome to businesses and families alike. 
   It is important to note, Madam Speaker, that the House majority's extenders bill contains no net tax relief. None. That is in stark contrast to the Senate's position. The Senate's comprehensive tax package contains approximately $107 billion in net tax relief after subtracting out the AMT patch, the disaster-related tax provisions and the mental health parity benefits from the Senate's package to account for the House's passage of those provisions as separate freestanding bills. We see that the remaining Senate extenders provisions by themselves provide approximately $35 billion in net tax relief. On the other hand, the House extenders bill provides no net tax relief to American taxpayers because every last penny of tax relief is offset with revenue raisers elsewhere, and that is not a good deal for the American taxpayer. 
   It is also a bad deal for U.S. businesses and employers that are trying to compete with their foreign counterparts. That is because the House bill provides a long-term delay, potentially until 2019, of the implementation of more rational worldwide interest allocation rules that are currently scheduled to go into effect in 2011. These more rational rules, originally enacted by Republicans in 2004, were good policy then and remain good policy now. 
   While the majority refers to those as an international tax provision, when implemented, these rules will actually help companies avoid double taxation on their foreign income, and we shouldn't push off for nearly a decade the effective date of a provision that will help American businesses and employers compete. 
   I would also note, Madam Speaker, that the House bill in many instances provides considerably less generous tax benefits than the Senate bill, including and especially with respect to energy-related tax benefits. For example, the House bill omits entirely a number of Senate proposals, including an extension and modification of the election to expense certain refineries, an energy-efficient home credit, and a special depreciation allowance for certain reuse and recycling property. In addition, the House bill places considerable limitations on a number of the Senate's other energy-related provisions, including a reduction in the maximum credit for plug-in hybrids, a key restriction on the credit for producing electricity from most renewable sources. 
   Moreover, unlike the Senate package, the House bill does not contain $3.3 billion in funding for the Secure Rural Schools Program. 
   Madam Speaker, when the 110th Congress convened last January, I had high hopes that these 2 years would be spent working on a bipartisan basis on issues people care about. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have real disagreements about what each side believes in. But, unfortunately, in the face of a bipartisan Senate solution to the extenders debate, and the ticking clock on this Congress, the House majority is still clinging to PAYGO on this bill. 
   Time is short, Madam Speaker. Whether we defeat the House bill now or whether the Senate rejects it later, this bill's life expectancy is exceedingly short. The sooner the majority sees that, the sooner we can begin debating the Senate's comprehensive package which would actually be enacted into law. I urge opposition to this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, frankly, in terms of responsibility, if the majority had exercised their responsibility, we wouldn't have let these extenders expire for 9 months and be here at the closing days of the session. We would have dealt with these earlier on in the session. 
   We've heard a lot of discussion about the House's role and the Senate's role. But as we know, we have three branches of government. And another important point in this discussion is the statement of administration policy, which is, that we have an SAP that says that this legislation, H.R. 7060, if  it were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend he veto the bill. And also in the statement, we have that the administration will support the bipartisan compromise in the Senate. 
   So this isn't just about turf between the House and the Senate and what our responsibilities are. It's also about what is actually going to become enacted into law. Clearly what we're doing today is not going to go very far. 
   So the question I have to ask is, why do we continue down this path? We've done this before on mental health parity, which we finally did accept the Senate language on. We've done it before on Medicare, where we finally accepted the Senate language yet this year. So there have been other occasions where we've done this. And I would just urge again my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation because its shelf life is very, very short. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. That is correct, Mr. Speaker. I am prepared to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We've heard a lot about the principled stand of the majority in terms of PAYGO, but I have to say that to inflict permanent tax increases on the American people to pay for temporary extensions of tax relief is just nonsensical. And let me just say that their application of this principle has been inconsistent at best. It wasn't applied for the unemployment benefits extension that we did; it wasn't applied for the housing bill; it hasn't been applied when they wanted to extend AMT, alternative minimum tax relief; it won't be applied to the stimulus package that's being put through the Rules Committee right now. 
   So to say that this bill is the only way because it has PAYGO when PAYGO is not applied in any kind of consistent manner across anything that they present to this House I think is an argument that really collapses under its own weight. 
   Secondly, we have clear indication from the Senate, as the distinguished gentlewoman from North Carolina so eloquently said, who has stated that they will not take up this bill. They've passed a bipartisan compromise 92-3. We would have bipartisan support for that bill were it to come to this body, were my colleagues to bring that forward. 
   Not only is it the other body, but it's also the administration. The President has said this bill would be vetoed if it ever reaches his desk. We know it won't get that far. 
   So recognizing that we have limited time left in this Congress, recognizing that it really takes three branches of government, it really takes particularly the executive and legislative branch to at least get a bill enacted into law, the third branch to make sure it's constitutional; but knowing what the other branch of government has said already about this bill, knowing that we don't have unanimity in the legislative side, it makes absolute sense that we bring forward the Senate bill. 
   Then on policy grounds, let me just say, the House bill has more tax increases than necessary, and the Senate measure includes a number of key items that are not included in the House bill that some of my colleagues have talked about today, particularly with regard to rural schools, but also especially in the area of energy. 
   When you look at this bill lacking the credit for small wind power systems, which is going to so help our dependence on foreign oil, the business tax credit for geothermal heat pumps, which is part of our all-of-the-above strategy trying to support wind, solar, alternatives, geothermal, nuclear, whatever we can to help lessen our dependence on foreign oil, and then also the bonds to help municipal and cooperatives to install wind and solar power plants. We see those operating all over the country, efforts to try to get these alternative energy sources up and running. And here we've delayed 9 months to move forward on a bill and then bring a bill forward to this body which is inadequate in those alternative energy methods. Also for refining capacity, for energy-efficient homes, those are critical. 
   And lastly, which is important to so many Members from the gulf coast still dealing with the aftermath of Katrina, the extension of tax credits for rehabilitating buildings in the GO Zone. 
   These aren't just minor problems. These are glaring omissions that have received bipartisan support in the Senate. They're lacking in the House bill. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this is really a very simple debate here. What we'd like to do is replace the text of the bill before us with the bill that the Senate passed this week by an overwhelming vote of 92-3, and there are three main reasons for this. 
   First, that bill provides more tax relief. It includes fewer tax increases, and it can become law. The Senate measure also has a number of key provisions that are not in the House bill. Most particularly, the research and development tax credit is enhanced in the Senate version, which is so important to getting our economy up and going again. This is just simply an extension in the House bill. It's not nearly enough to do the job. 
   Also, the House bill contains more tax increases, in addition to those that were in the Senate bill. The House bill further extends the effective date of what we call worldwide interest allocation rules which really make its difficult for our employers to compete in today's global economy. 
   Finally, I think the most important thing is the Senate bill is a bill that could get enacted this year. It's quite clear that the issues that we're debating today with regard to the House bill will never be taken up by the Senate, as the distinguished majority leader of the Senate has made on many occasions and have been made repeatedly on this floor, including the comment that: ``Don't send us back something else. We can't get it passed. If they try to mess with our package, it will come back here, it will die, and we will--we will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'' 
   So I would urge this House to reject this point of order and move forward so that we can actually have a debate on the issues that we've been talking about all morning, instead of short-circuiting this debate and making it impossible for us to offer an alternative to what the majority is trying to do. 
   We heard a lot about debate and openness and that the House is place where we shouldn't just say ``yes,'' we shouldn't just agree with what's happening. So I would say to my colleagues, if you're so interested in debate, why are you so afraid of having us bring this motion forward? 
   Let us have the vote on this motion to recommit, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of my amendment that would preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to the Medicare Advantage program. 
   My amendment is simple. It would prohibit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing any policy that would prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from enrolling in Medicare Advantage, which allows seniors the option of receiving their Medicare benefits through a private health care plan. 
   Today, 8.3 million Medicare beneficiaries, including millions of low-income minority and rural seniors, are receiving their health benefits through Medicare Advantage. Retired union workers are also attracted to this important program. In fact, in my home State of Michigan, 116,000 retired teachers, janitors, bus drivers and school cafeteria workers are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan to the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System. 
   Vulnerable beneficiaries choose Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare because it's often cheaper and comes with better benefits than traditional Medicare, like disease management programs and preventive care. Low-income seniors are more likely to enroll in Medicare Advantage, relying on the program's lower copayments and free preventive care. Medicare Advantage plans saved beneficiaries an average of $86 per month, compared to what they would have spent in traditional Medicare. 
   Additionally, Medicare Advantage provides protection against catastrophic health care costs not provided by traditional Medicare. For example, many beneficiaries can choose a Medicare advantage plan that would cap their annual out-of-pocket health care costs at $2,000. Minority beneficiaries are more likely to enroll in Medicare Advantage. 
   In fact, 40 percent of African Americans and 53 percent of Hispanics who depend on Medicare for their health care are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. 
   The NAACP recognizes the importance of Medicare advantage saying: ``By providing more comprehensive benefits and lower cost-sharing than traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans help racial and ethnic minority populations gain access to health care services that are critical to their long-term health and well-being.'' 
   For the first time, seniors have access to Medicare Advantage, regardless of whether they live in big cities or in rural America, in districts like mine. Rural seniors have voted with their feet. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has increased 300 percent since 2004 when just half of rural seniors had a Medicare Advantage plan in their area. 
   Rural beneficiaries clearly like their new options. Medicare Advantage is helping to provide flexible, affordable, modern health care benefits for minorities, low-income beneficiaries, seniors living in rural areas and union retirees. Congress must ensure that these health care benefits are available to qualifying beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to say that this is really a straightforward amendment. What it simply does is prohibit the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing any policy that would prohibit a beneficiary from enrolling in Medicare Advantage. 
   Now, obviously, if beneficiaries lose access to care by a reduction in funds to the Medicare Advantage program, and thereby benefits being reduced, that is something we want to try to avoid. This is a critically important program that, as I said, ensures millions of seniors that have seen rapid growth, and in particular parts of the country has made really great strides in covering low-income seniors, those in rural and urban areas, those in minority populations that might not otherwise have access to care, and we have seen enrollment increase 300 percent since 2004. 
   So I think in light of what is going on, it is important to reinforce our support for this strategically important program, but it is a fairly simple and straightforward amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Under the budget resolution put forth by the majority, every American should be aware that their wallets are going to get a lot lighter. As the economy softens and we lose jobs, the Democrat budget resolution prescribes an overpowering combination of tax hikes and wasteful spending that will have our economy reeling. 
   The one positive thing I will say about this budget resolution is that it provides Americans with an excellent glimpse into the future under a Democrat majority; more spending, more taxes, and more of Washington telling you what to do. 
   The majority has written a budget blueprint that imposes a massive, unheard of $3.9 trillion tax hike that will cause the average American household to pay $3,000 extra in Federal taxes next year. Washington doesn't need this money. Washington doesn't need to spend an extra $3.9 trillion of the American people's money on redundant wasteful government programs. 
   The bureaucracy is far from being starved of revenue. Especially under these economic circumstances, it is wrong for this House, for this Congress, for this government to raise taxes. 
   Under the Democrats' budget resolution Washington spending will increase because 44 million children will no longer qualify for the $1,000 child tax credit. It will increase because American couples will be hit by the marriage penalty. 
   Don't believe these taxes will just be on the rich. Under this budget, low-income Americans will be forced into a higher tax bracket. Worse yet, Federal spending will increase because Americans will no longer be able to pass on a lifetime of dedication, devotion and hard work to the next generation. Instead, Uncle Sam will reap a whopping 55 percent death tax. Taxing the living isn't enough for the Democrats; under this budget resolution, they even go after the dearly departed. 
   We should be cutting spending to balance our budget, not raising taxes. With rising food prices, energy costs, health care spending and other everyday bills going up, this is no time for Congress to ask Americans to pay more and make do with less. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this massive tax hike and vote ``no'' on the budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a missed opportunity. In Michigan, where the average price of gas is 12 cents higher than the national average, energy prices are a sore subject. Gas prices are too high, the U.S. is too dependent on foreign oil, and yet the majority party refuses to allow expanding our domestic supply of energy sources. 
   This bill misses the mark. H.R. 2776 is certainly creative in how it spends taxpayer dollars. Under this legislation, $6 billion will be given away to States for just about any project that has the word ``energy'' in it. 
   Republicans in the Ways and Means Committee debated this new spending scheme at length during the bill's markup. During that debate, we found out that States could use taxpayer money to buy hybrid Lexuses for State employees, construct indoor rainforests, distribute complimentary copies of Al Gore's ``An Inconvenient Truth'' in every classroom, or hand out energy-efficient light bulbs. 
   In my view, the new tax credit bond programs this legislation creates will fail to do anything to secure our Nation's energy independence because there is no requirement that they reduce greenhouse gases or increase energy production. 
   The bill, however, does have a few bright spots. It includes measures I have supported on plug-in vehicles, solar energy and energy-efficient programs for appliances and homes. I believe these initiatives have the potential to have significant impact on energy conservation. 
   I am disappointed the underlying bill does nothing to promote hybrid and advanced-technology diesel vehicles. In 2005 the Energy Policy Act was enacted. It included legislation that provided tax credits to consumers for the purchase of a new hybrid and advanced-technology diesel vehicle. With this tax credit, Americans can knock hundreds or thousands of dollars off the sale price of a clean fuel car or truck. This bill does nothing to help consumers better afford hybrid or advanced technology diesel vehicles. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to reject this flawed bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Democrats' flawed ethics proposal. This bill would actually weaken ethics enforcement in the House by adding an unnecessary and even unconstitutional layer of bureaucracy to an already failing ethics process. 
   During our work on the special task force on ethics enforcement, Republican Members consistently voiced our opposition to creating an ineffective, redundant, and duplicative committee. The Constitution explicitly states that the House is solely responsible for punishing its Members for disorderly behavior. Creating an Office of Congressional Ethics calls into question our constitutional duties to discipline our own Members. 
   Let me take a minute to point out some of the absurd provisions in the Democrat proposals.     
   First, board members of the so-called Office of Congressional Ethics would be appointed to 4-year terms, yet the House reassembles itself every 2 years and must renew its internal rules on a biennial basis. 
   Second, reviews by the board would advance on tie votes. This is undemocratic and runs contrary to our entire system of majority government. 
   Third, when board reviews are concluded, the findings are referred to the Ethics Committee for further action. This puts us right back to the failed system in which we find ourselves today. 
   Quite frankly, the most glaring failure of the Democrats' proposal is that it does nothing to address the problems inherent to the Ethics Committee. Rather than adding a layer of bureaucracy, ethics reform should address the problems plaguing the Ethics Committee. I support measures that reform the Ethics Committee by creating greater bipartisanship, transparency, and accountability in the investigations process. 
   We should require that all Members appointed to the Ethics Committee be chosen jointly by the Speaker and minority leader to end partisan gridlock. We should also mandate monthly status reports by the committee on pending investigations. The Republican proposal would implement these and other important changes, but the Rules Committee blocked consideration of our proposals. 
   My fellow Members, we must reform the House ethics process and restore a sense of public confidence and accountability in this institution. The Democrats' bill does neither. I hope you will join me in voting down this flawed partisan proposal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, House Resolution 49, which honors the dedication and contributions made by letter carriers across the country. 
   Being a representative of one of the largest congressional districts land-wise east of the Mississippi, I am well aware of the necessity of timely and efficient postal service. 
   Most of us rely on letter carriers of the United States Postal Service to deliver our monthly bills, drop off our favorite magazine, or ship an important package. 
   Amazingly, letter carriers delivered over 212 billion pieces of mail in 2005. That's 1.4 million pieces a day for every Congressional District. 
   Their dedication is accurately reflected in the unofficial USPS motto: ``Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.'' 
   This bill is a straight-forward resolution that expresses the sense of Congress that America's letter carriers make a vital contribution to the well-being and economic prosperity of our Nation and calls for a national day of appreciation to honor their service. 
   It is also important to recognize the contribution that letter carriers make to their communities through their community service efforts and charitable donations. These contributions are undoubtedly recognized by the American public as the USPS was voted ``The Most Trusted Government Agency'' earlier this month, for the fourth year in a row. 
   My fellow Members, we seem to spend a significant amount of time dedicating Post Offices; it is about time we honor those that work within them. I hope you will join me in saluting their efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   First, I would like to make one point perfectly clear. Republicans support health care for low-income children. We support reauthorizing the program we passed in 1997. And that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. After all, it was the Republican majority that created the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did it in a bipartisan manner. 
   Today, sadly, we do not have a bipartisan bill before us. When we talk about insuring the Nation's needy children, we should talk about it in a bipartisan way. And if the majority had crafted a bill that was just about helping low-income children, we would stand here today ready to overwhelmingly approve that legislation. 
   Unfortunately, this bill doesn't focus on low-income children. Instead, it draws scarce resources away from these needy children in order to take a giant leap toward universal, government-controlled health care. 
   Worst of all, this dramatic step comes at the expense of Medicare, seniors' health insurance, in order to give middle-class and even upper middle-class families a new Federal health benefit. 
   These are not minor cuts in senior health care. The majority's bill cuts or eliminates many Medicare benefits and services: $157 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, which are health plans that offer additional benefits to low-income seniors like disease management, vision, dental, and hearing benefits, and improves the quality of care they receive; billions in cuts to hospitals; billions in cuts to home health care services, to wheelchairs, to patient rehab facilities, to nursing homes, to dialysis patients, and to oxygen treatment. And because of a new insurance tax on every insured American, health costs to seniors and all Americans will go up. 
   I don't know about you, but I can't look a 75-year-old widow in the eye in my district and honestly ask her to give up her benefits so that a 45-year-old couple making $80,000 a year or more with a 21-year-old can receive government health care. 
   This bill did not have to be this way. It should not be this way. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I urge the majority to bring us back a bill that focuses on helping low-income children. That is a bill we can all support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, House Republicans strongly support the SCHIP program, and, as many speakers have said, this program was created on a bipartisan basis 10 years ago. We are advocating that the program remain what it was intended to be, and that was a program that helps low-income children who cannot otherwise get health insurance. 
   Had we been able to sit down on a bipartisan basis anytime over the past 9 months, I am convinced that we could have come to an agreement that reauthorizes this important program without turning it into a massive expansion of government-controlled health care. Instead, the majority first produced a massive expansion of SCHIP, partially paid for by cuts to Medicare. 
   Madam Speaker, fundamentally, the majority chose to shortchange the most vulnerable members of our society, seniors and the disabled, in order to force middle and upper middle-class families out of private health insurance and into a government program.     
   Then the majority was confronted with the reality that Members of the  other body would not cut Medicare, so they passed the Senate's version of SCHIP. That bill, instead of cutting government funds for seniors and the disabled to expand SCHIP as a middle-class entitlement, raised taxes on the working poor to expand SCHIP. 
   Now the majority is again forced to face reality. In order for a bill to become law, it must be signed by the President of the United States, and this President's position is clear: SCHIP should help low-income kids first. Before you expand coverage to families earning $62,000 or $83,000 a year, 300 or 400 percent of the poverty level, you need to cover children in families earning less than 200 percent a year. That is about $42,000 a year. That is just common sense, and is true to the original bipartisan spirit of the SCHIP program. 
   I hope we will be able to come to an agreement and not have the majority just simply roll over our legitimate concerns about this legislation. We need to sit down together to help low-income children, to fix the loophole that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to get government benefits, and to ensure that the SCHIP program is funded on a sound and honest basis. I look forward to that discussion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, this is a disappointing day. Instead of sending the President a bill he could sign, the majority chose to ignore calls for bipartisanship and chose to ignore the kids they proclaim to champion. 
   And what is their reaction to this forewarned veto? Did the majority immediately reach out to build consensus? No. Compromise? No.  
   Instead, the majority decided to stall, to put off dealing with the veto and put off finding a solution. 
   I ask one simple question: How does stalling a renewal of SCHIP for partisan gain meet the needs of low-income kids? SCHIP can be renewed without extending benefits to people making $82,000, without extending benefits to adults, without going down the path of government-controlled health care. 
   We can renew SCHIP without raising taxes, without cutting Medicare, without assuming there will be 22 million new smokers, and without cutting funds in year 6 by 80 percent and pushing the program off a budgetary cliff. 
   It's time for this Congress to get its priorities right to determine if we are results or rhetoric, if we are for kids or campaign tricks. 
   Let's pass a new SCHIP program, and let's send the President a bill he will sign. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As many of my colleagues have stated, passing this bill is an important step forward in protecting the health of every American. We should be proud of our efforts to work on a bipartisan basis to craft this legislation, and I want to recognize the efforts of the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman Biggert. This bill should be a model for our efforts to reform health care. 
   We all agree that individuals should not be discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. Employers and insurers should not be allowed to use genetic markers to deny employment or health coverage simply because they possess a particular gene. But genetic information can also be used to help patients. Health plans have an ability to interact with both patients and providers to highlight recommended tests and courses of action. 
   For example, a person that has a gene for a certain type of cancer would be recommended to receive more frequent cancer screenings. Knowing this, the health insurer would know to approve coverage for these additional screenings because they would be at a higher risk of developing that type of cancer. 
   We all preach about transforming medicine to provide more preventative care. Now, we are finally at a point where medical technology can be effectively used to deliver the preventative care that we envision. 
   I am certain that the use of genetic information is just the tip of the iceberg. As medicine develops, so must our laws and regulations; yet, we must be careful not to stifle these promising medical advances. I am confident that we can both protect patient privacy and improve the delivery of health care as this legislation does. 
   With that, I yield the remaining time from my committee to the gentlewoman from Illinois to control.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act. I want to thank Representative Pascrell for introducing this bipartisan legislation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I authored similar legislation in the last two Congresses. 
   Sewer maintenance is a serious problem for Michigan and the Fourth Congressional District. Many of the sewers in this country, including several in my State, were built during the 19th century. The problems associated with old sewer lines are especially rampant in low-lying coastal areas such as Michigan, where water runoff collects. 
   Sewer overflows discharge untreated or partially treated human and industrial waste, toxic materials, debris and disease-causing organisms into the environment and pose a grave threat to the environment and public health. In 2005, there were over 1,000 reported sewer overflows across the State of Michigan. These events spilled 20 billion, and I repeat 20 billion, gallons of sewage and wastewater onto the ground and into rivers, lakes and streams. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the total cost for repairing every sewer line in the country is $140 billion. Local governments clearly cannot fix this mess alone and meet their obligations under the Clean Water Act. 
   The Water Quality Investment Act goes a long way toward ending the public health and environmental crisis associated with sewer overflows by authorizing Federal funds to repair and replace outdated systems. I urge my colleagues to approve H.R. 569 today. 
   I would like to thank those individuals who helped move this legislation forward, including Mr. Pascrell, the sponsor, and for his long support of this legislation; Mr. Oberstar, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; and Mr. Mica, the ranking member of this committee.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today appears to be an exercise in futility. Not only has the President said he will veto it, but it has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. So why has a bill been brought to the floor that virtually is going nowhere? 
   Instead of this bill, the House should be voting on the bill the Senate passed last week. I wouldn't call it Senate blockage. It passed 88-5. The Senate prevents 23 million Americans from being hit by the onerous alternative minimum tax and does it without permanently increasing taxes. The bill before us includes $50 billion in tax increases. That is $50 billion in taxes the American public was never intended to pay and should never pay. 
   Last May when the Republicans were in the majority, we passed legislation to prevent the AMT from hitting middle-income taxpayers. We finished our work early and responsibly so the IRS had time to reprogram its computers and print accurate tax forms which prevented unnecessary confusion for taxpayers. 
   But here we are in December and the Democrats still have not finished their work on the temporary AMT patch. Unfortunately, because of their inaction, millions of taxpayer refunds will be delayed for months. Unfortunately, because of their actions here today, those refunds will be further delayed. 
   The IRS has warned the majority party that failure to act will result in $75 billion in refunds being delayed for taxpayers who file their returns before March 31 of next year. Millions more will be delayed to taxpayers filing after that date. Rather than take up the Senate bill which the President has signaled his intent to sign, the majority party in the House is wasting time by bringing up a bill that includes unacceptable tax increases. People are already paying high enough taxes. They are already paying enough in taxes. I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 4351.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, here we are on Tax Day, April 15, talking about a bill called the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act. A great title, but this bill falls remarkably short. 
   What this Congress should be debating today is legislation to simplify and reform the tax code. The tax code is over 67,000 pages long. It takes taxpayers 6 billion hours and over $260 billion to comply with current tax laws. That's unacceptable. 
   Instead of this bill, Congress needs to pass legislation to make filing tax returns simpler and fairer. While more and more Americans are demanding Congress make our tax laws easier to comply with, the Ways and Means Committee has held only one hearing on tax reform since the beginning of last year.  
   And just as the economy struggles in the face of problems in the housing and the credit markets, rising gas and food prices and an up-take on employment, the House Democrat budget proposes to hit families with the largest tax increase in history.     
   Instead of reforming the Tax Code and lowering the tax burden, the bill before us ignores both those questions. And while there are some good provisions in it, like I support the provision that no longer requires employees to keep track of the cell phone calls they make on their office cell phones, other measures in the bill make it objectionable. 
   I reject the majority's attempts to impose new administrative burdens on the use of health savings accounts. Millions of Americans are enrolled in HSAs because they provide consumers with the ability to affordably manage their own health care costs. H.R. 5719 will make it harder for people to save for their own health care.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. HSAs already have a built-in enforcement mechanism that seeks to ensure HSA funds are spent on qualified medical expenses. If a person spends those dollars on a nonqualified expense, they're subject to individual income taxes and a 10 percent penalty. The IRS also has the right to audit HSA withdrawals. 
   Americans are concerned about the cost of health care. Before Congress rushes to impose new burdens on HSAs, the one innovation that helps patient-centered, individual health care, helps individuals take control of their health care, we should find out first if there really is a problem, and then, how we can fix it without restricting the ability of consumers to take greater control of their health care decision making. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this flawed legislation.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's surprising how well the Democrat majority can turn good ideas like the extension of tax relief into bad legislation. Now, we have seen it before and it usually ends in gridlock. And, frankly, the American people are tired of the majority party's record of stalemate and zero accomplishment. But here we go again with another bill that is headed nowhere. 
   This bill could have easily passed the Ways and Means Committee and passed on the floor with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of votes. It failed to get a majority of Republican votes in committee and will likely fail to get a Republican majority here today on the floor. 
   Interestingly, a lot of what is in this package was written when Republicans were in the majority. The Republican bill was devoted to tax incentives; the  Democrat bill focuses on tax increase. This is a fundamental difference between our two parties. 
   It is a real missed opportunity not to deal with the alternative minimum tax, which means higher taxes for more and more Americans. That's why you're seeing key groups oppose this bill like the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform, Alliance for Worker Freedom, Americans for Prosperity, and Club for Growth. 
   So what the Democrats give with one hand they take with the other. They'll use words like ``PAYGO'' and ``revenue raisers,'' but the fact of the matter is those innocent-sounding words really mean tax increases. Permanently increasing taxes to pay for temporary tax incentives is a losing deal for the American people. 
   Congress will be confronted with many more expiring tax provisions in the coming years, and if the Democrats continue with this flawed logic, taxpayers will be hit with more than $3.5 trillion in tax increases between now and 2018 simply to maintain current law. With $3 and possibly $4 of gas and higher grocery bills, a sluggish economy, and a downturn in the housing market, the American public cannot afford higher taxes. 
   We don't need a fortune teller to tell us that, just like many of the other bills House Democrats have passed that included tax increases, this bill again is dead on arrival in the United States Senate. So we will be back here again at some point debating this bill again. So after we get through with today's exercise, hopefully we can get down to business and write a bill that will gain a majority of bipartisan support. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject increasing taxes and vote ``no'' on this legislation.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not some huge legislative victory, as some would suggest. Instead, it's about maintaining the status quo. 
   I am committed to finding a way around this unworkable physician payment system that we have now, which rewards volume over quality. Every 15 minutes doctors have to see somebody else. That system's just plain wrong. But let's be honest. This bill only buys us about 18 months, and where has that gotten us before, as the gentleman points out? 
   I would like to quote the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, who said back in 2006: ``I am glad that this bill includes a temporary update for physicians, giving us a little breathing room heading into next year. But we're still going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to dig ourselves out of the $250 billion hole Republicans created by kicking the can down the road the last few years. In the next Congress, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle work with me to address this problem once and for all.'' 
   Well, now we can add Democrats to the list of those digging the hole and kicking the can down the road. And at what cost? CBO estimates that up to 2 million seniors, mostly low income, will permanently, permanently, lose their current health coverage under this bill for a temporary 18-month increase in pay for physicians. Not addressing any of the longstanding problems in terms of rewarding value and not volume. 
   I can't in good conscience support this bill that pits seniors against physicians. It's a lose-lose proposition and I will vote to sustain the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMP of Michigan. (KATRINA HOUSING TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007, which was introduced by my friends, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   It is unfortunate that we continue to deal with the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes of 2005. The imprint left by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast has been well documented. Unfortunately, the slow pace of recovery has also been well documented, despite substantial efforts by the Ways and Means Committee and the Congress as a whole to provide direct and indirect support to the rebuilding efforts. 
   As part of that effort, the Congress enacted the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005. Among its provisions, the measure authorized a tenfold increase in Section 42 low-income housing tax credits for States in the Gulf Opportunity Zone. At the time, our hope was that putting a fast expiration on those credits would lead to the rapid rebuilding of this much-needed housing. Our experience, however, has shown otherwise. Delays in getting necessary permitting and insurance, combined with the high cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor, have created a situation in which many of the allocated credits are likely to go unused by the current December 31, 2008, deadline. 
   The good news for the GO Zone is that credits not used by the end of 2008 will not be lost. Instead, they will revert back to the State for future allocation. But the difficulties on the ground create uncertainty as to whether these projects will be placed in service by the end of 2008. 
   Witnesses at an Oversight Subcommittee hearing earlier this month warned that many deserving projects that had been allocated credits in Louisiana and Mississippi by the State housing agencies are going unfunded and therefore will not be built by the end of next year. 
   The measure before us makes several changes to the rules governing low-income housing tax credits in the GO Zone. These changes expire at the end of 2010. Hopefully, the modifications we are making today will allow the States to get these housing projects financed and constructed long before that sunset date. 
   It is my understanding from the Joint Committee that the cost of this bill is not the result of additional credits being used. Rather, it is that credits will be used more quickly than expected under current law. 
   Under these circumstances, I believe the changes in the bill before us are an appropriate response to the unique and unprecedented challenges in the gulf coast region and will help ensure that goals of the 2005 legislation are met. Unique circumstances sometimes require unique solutions. 
   Finally, I would like to comment on a provision of the bill being used to offset these costs. As originally considered by the committee, the measure would slightly alter the circumstances under which the government can levy the assets of an employer for unpaid employment taxes. During committee considerations, questions were raised about the provision, and I am pleased that the bill we are considering today contains an important modification to the provision that ensures that employers who unknowingly fall behind in their payment of employment taxes are properly protected. 
   On that count, particular thanks are due to the chairman, the staff of the IRS and the Treasury and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation for their help in working through this difficult but important issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me again express my appreciation to you and your staff for working across the aisle to craft this measure that I hope will make it possible for thousands of residents of the gulf States to go home soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As Yogi Berra once said, this is like d&#233;ja 2 vu all over again. I think it is important to highlight that this is simply a political exercise, that the Congress has already acted to extend the children's health program through 2009. So instead of debating real reform on this program, we have a political statement being made on the floor today. 
   I lost track at seven times we have debated this issue. As the gentleman from Texas said, it's somewhere between nine and 13. But it doesn't change the fact that expanding SCHIP beyond its original mission of covering low-income children is a nonstarter with the Congress. Yet the bill the President vetoed would do just that, and it would allow illegal immigrants to receive SCHIP, maintains coverage of adults in this children's health care program and continues to erode private coverage. 
   How is it that in my home State of Michigan 87,000 eligible children don't have health care while 39,000 adults are in the program. How is it that in Minnesota, 87 percent of the enrollees in this children's program are adults? 
   How is it that this low-income program is covering families in New York and families in New Jersey making more than $70,000 a year? No wonder New York wanted to go to over $80,000. 
   The answer to all of these questions is clear: The majority does not want a low-income children's plan. They want what HILLARY CLINTON called for in 1994, the first step toward nationalized, government-run, government-controlled health care. 
   We should not be diluting this children's program, and we should not be diverting money away from these low-income kids. 
   I am proud to have introduced the Kids First Act, a bill that would return this program to its root in insuring low-income children. It covers an additional 1.3 million American children, does not raise taxes and is fully funded. That is the kind of legislation we should be debating instead of continuing this stalemate time and time again that uses children's health as a political pawn. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this veto override. Now that we have extended the children's health program, I hope that we can truly reach a compromise on this important issue and ensure that low-income American children have health care coverage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think it's important to note that this bill allows States to document citizenship, and the Social Security Administrator has said that changing the law will make it easier for illegal immigrants to get SCHIP funds as well as other taxpayer-funded benefits. 
   And despite this being a program for low-income children, under this bill three-quarters of a million adults will still be on the program in 2012. Under this bill more than 1.6 million children will lose their private coverage. 
   And let's talk about the funding. The majority has created a funding cliff that dramatically increases Federal funding to enroll new children for the next 5 years; then cuts funding for the bill by 80 percent. This will force future Congresses to make a very difficult choice: to dramatically increase funding or let American children lose their health coverage. 
   The other problem with this bill is that it is estimated that the bill, because it relies on tobacco taxes for funding, would require more than 22 million new smokers. Now, if there is any consistent policy the government has had administration to administration it's the discouragement of smoking. Yet this bill relies on a false funding mechanism that would require 22 million new smokers. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Price.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   This Congress has already passed an 18-month extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program to March of 2009, and in that bipartisan extension an additional $800 million was provided to States to make sure that they could continue to provide health insurance to those already enrolled. 
   We have debated this many, many times on the floor, this flawed proposal. This so-called compromise bill did not have one hearing. I have great respect for this House as an institution, and part of that respect is the regular order of bringing bills to subcommittee, having hearings and giving people an opportunity to be heard on them so the public is aware of what is happening. This bill didn't have one hearing. It was given to the minority the night before the vote. 
   I think that kind of partisanship and politics, combined with the overreaching included in this compromise, it doesn't address the problem of illegals receiving SCHIP funds, it doesn't address the issue of adults in the program and focusing the program on children, it causes almost 2 million children to lose private coverage, and, not only that, has unstable funding by assuming that 22 million new smokers are going to be found over the next few years. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote against this veto override, and let's get to work on going through the regular process of having a hearing, bringing forward witnesses and fashioning a compromise that not just has House and Senate support, but under our system of government, before a bill becomes law, it has House, Senate and presidential support. So let's work together in the coming year and start off this year differently than last year, which, unfortunately, this was supposed to be the easy issue we were all going to be able to come together on. But I think a lack of process and really a bill that is flawed in many ways, as the debate here has shown today, makes it impossible to support. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote against the veto override. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, they say it's better to be a day late than a dollar short. In this case, however, the majority party is over a month late, costing taxpayers $75 billion. 
   As I listened to some of the previous speakers on the other side, just because they can't deliver on their promises, somehow it's our fault. But by postponing action on legislation to exempt 23 million Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax, the majority party has caused taxpayers, both those affected by the AMT and those who are not, to have their refund checks significantly delayed. 
   When Republicans were the majority party during the last Congress, we got our work done and fixed the AMT exemption amounts in May. As a result, no taxpayer funds were delayed. No additional taxpayers were forced to pay the AMT last year. 
   This year, under their majority, 23 million Americans will be subject to the AMT. Last year under a Republican  majority, 4 million Americans would have paid the tax. 
   The sad part is 23 million Americans should not have to pay the AMT.     
   They could have been shielded if the Democratic-controlled Congress was able to finish its work on time. 
   The Senate has already passed a 1-year AMT fix that did not include tax increases. They passed this legislation almost 2 weeks ago, and instead of immediately taking up this bill, the House Democrats have insisted the legislation include billions of dollars of permanent tax increases just to maintain current tax law and tax rates. 
   I'm glad the majority party in the House has finally seen the light of day. 
   And despite being much more than a day late and far worse than a dollar short, I'm pleased the House is finally getting around to passing this critical legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentleman yielding me this time. 
   I am glad we have the opportunity to vote on this legislation today which is critical to protecting doctors from receiving the 10 percent Medicare cut and providing certainty to the SCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance. 
   But let's not kid ourselves. This is the bare minimum and we are capable of much more. It is disappointing that the majority would not work in a bipartisan fashion to craft at least a 1-year reprieve from the Medicare cuts for physicians, as Republicans were able to do in previous years. This 6-month extension is simply putting the problem off and not solving it. The majority knew this 10 percent cut was coming. So what did they do? They passed a CHAMP bill that was fraught with problems that cut home health, skilled nursing facilities, devastated Medicare Advantage and the individual care, and would have left 22 States without one senior receiving Medicare Advantage. That was nearly 6 months ago. And what has happened since then? Nothing. 
   It is unfortunate that we could not come to a bipartisan compromise on SCHIP, which was and is within reach. A simple extension, while better than what the majority offered, and their offer was transforming a program to assist low-income children to an entitlement for families earning $80,000 a year, is much worse than what was possible. 
   As I said before on this floor, I stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion to address the looming cuts faced by physicians in Medicare. I hope we can see this legislation for the Band-Aid that it is and return next year with a commitment from leaders in both parties to enact real long-term Medicare payment reform.

   This program helps low-income Medicare beneficiaries pay for their Medicare premiums. While the QI program was extended under the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act enacted in July, some States were still facing shortfalls. 
   The bill we are debating today provides $45 million to ensure States like Alabama and South Carolina have sufficient funds to maintain Medicare enrollment for their low-income seniors. Importantly, this bill is fully paid for by requiring State Medicaid programs to electronically submit eligibility determinations to the Public Assistance Reporting Information System.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Medicare bills should be bipartisan and should be fully debated, not on some shortened suspension calendar. My question is just what about this bill worries the majority that they won't fully debate it? 
   Today we are discussing a serious issue, how to prevent Medicare from cutting physicians' payments by over 10 percent by next Tuesday. Make no mistake. That will happen if Congress does not act, and despite virtually every Member of this House being opposed to such a cut to doctors, here we are only a week away from that happening. 
   And, sadly, this shouldn't surprise any of us. Shortly after Congress passed the last short-term extension in December, the chairman of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee noted that he was inclined to do nothing to stop the cut from taking place. And that's exactly what this majority has done for the past 6 months: nothing. 
   In the last couple of days, this bill has been drafted in secret, and a recent version just appeared at 10 o'clock this morning, 278 new pages of bill. But this bill has been drafted in secret without committee hearings, without committee markups, without committee amendments, and without any chance for public review. 
   This is the most restrictive Congress in our Nation's history. Neither the minority or majority should find this way of doing the people's business acceptable. It is certainly not what the Speaker promised us or promised the American people. 
   Maybe that's why when you break the public's trust in this way, your approval numbers plummet. This is the most unpopular Congress ever, and that's saying a lot. The American people want an open, accessible, and accountable government, and they are not getting it from this majority. 
   So today here we are rushing to pass a bill that couldn't muster enough support in the Senate to even be debated and one that is sure to be vetoed by the President, if it ever got that far. It's the first time I have ever seen this House in such a rush to take up the scraps of the Senate, and, frankly, we would be equally wise to reject this so-called fix. I know I speak for all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle when I say we want to prevent this cut and, in fact, we want to provide physicians with a payment increase. Yet with this bill, we are cutting seniors' access to affordable health care under Medicare some $47 billion, causing 2 million seniors to lose access to health care through Medicare Advantage. What we give some providers we directly take away from beneficiaries. This is no way to manage Medicare. 
   It is my sincere hope that we can ultimately pass a bipartisan compromise this week. A compromise is imminent in the Senate as we speak. Physicians deserve no less, and certainly beneficiaries, America's seniors, and the disabled deserve no less. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to demand a Medicare doctor fix that is workable for all parties involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would just say, if we are really worried about cuts to physicians, why bring up a bill that has already failed in the Senate? 
   And frankly, I would say to my good friend that every person or group that supports this bill will also support the bipartisan Senate bill that is going to come over from the Senate later this week. 
   And let me just say, if anyone actually believes still that this bill is a serious effort to fix these problems, they need only look to page 253 of the bill. As my friend from Texas pointed out, this is the group that left a whole section out of the farm bill so we had to revote on it a second time. But here we will find a ``Sense of the Senate provision.'' And, Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, this is the House of Representatives. And this really raises the question of whether in the rush to bring this bill up for a vote the majority even read their own 278 page bill because they introduced it at about 10:00, 2 hours ago, or if they just simply copied the Senate bill word for word. 
   So, frankly, I think if we could look at the Senate bill that I just got an e-mail that their bipartisan issue is imminent, that they are working and they are close to a deal. This could have happened in the House as well if the majority had decided to honestly debate this issue. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill that is dead before it even arrived, as it has already failed in the Senate. 
   At this time I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This rule will raise $7.5 billion in taxes on U.S. employers. Higher taxes are just one consequence of today's rule. It turns a blind eye to the 58 tax treaties that have been negotiated by this Nation since the 1950s. 
   By ignoring those treaty obligations, that invites the retaliation other speakers have talked about. These are our friends and neighbors who work for these employers, over 5 million of them in the United States. And these aren't necessarily obscure businesses you've never heard about. The effect of this provision may be on companies like DaimlerChrysler, Michelin Tires and Miller Brewing. And I say ``may'' because we don't really know. We've never had a hearing. We've never had testimony. It is part of the American fabric that people have a chance to speak about laws and provisions that may affect them. There has been no voice given to the people that may be affected by these rules, the 5 million employees. 
   So I think to unexpectedly change these rules for these employers with zero debate is a dangerous precedent, and I will vote down the rule.

   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the so-called Tax Relief Act before us today gives us little to celebrate. In addition to the normal extension of Republican tax cuts, this bill includes an unprecedented amount of Democrat tax increases on the American public. Worse yet, this bill permanently raises taxes to the tune of $70 billion, all to collect taxes the Federal Government was never intended to get. 
   Let me repeat that point: this bill raises taxes to generate revenues the Federal Government was never intended to get. 
   The differences between our parties couldn't be clearer than on this bill. Republicans cut taxes while Democrats raise taxes. Facts are facts; and with this bill, the majority is permanently increasing taxes on Americans and setting the stage for the largest tax increase in history. 
   I support extending tax provisions like the R & D tax credit, the teacher tax deduction for classroom supplies, and incentives for conservation easements. After all, those are bills I have long supported. I also support shielding over 20 million middle-income Americans from the alternative minimum tax, better described as the mandatory minimum tax. But this is simply the wrong way to do it. Fortunately, the Senate knows and the President knows that. This bill will not pass the Senate and the President will not sign it. I hope my friends on both sides of the aisle will realize this bill is a flawed bill and should be rejected. 
   This is not the time to be raising taxes. Reject this legislation, and let us vote on a bill that really protects taxpayers from higher taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, at this time I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This bill, both in terms of its scope, expanding a low-income children's program to cover adults and middle-class families, and cost, $35 billion in new taxes and spending, remains unacceptable. And it's truly unfortunate. 
   This House, this Congress, and this President support SCHIP. The failure to form a bipartisan compromise to provide low-income American children with health insurance is nothing short of a failure of the majority's leadership. The minor changes, tinkering, clarifications we see today do not a compromise make. 
   Compromise, by definition, is a settlement of differences in which each side makes concessions. The previous bill doubled the cost of this program, and this bill costs a half billion more beyond that than the last one. The majority has not made one concession in this cosmetic re-draft. It's the same  bill with the same objections, and we should not compromise our principles to satisfy their political aims. 
   What we have before us is a bill that continues to allow Federal resources, 10 percent or more, to be diverted away from low-income children and given to adults, a bill that provides a back door to illegal immigrants to get Federal benefits to the tune of $3.7 billion, and a bill that continues to force at least 2 million families out of their current plan and into a government program.     
   While Southern California has burned, the Speaker has this House fiddling and posturing. Worse yet, the majority is manipulating that tragedy and is tying this vote to ensure our votes are reduced. It's as crass a tactic as I have seen in my time in Congress. 
   It is past time for the game to end, and it is past time for the majority to engage in a serious negotiation with us on how to renew and improve this program. 
   I urge my colleagues to again vote ``no'' and again send a message that low-income children's health insurance is not an issue to be politicized. We can do better than this.

   First, I would like to make one point perfectly clear: Republicans support health care for low-income children. 
   Second, I want to address something that was said on the floor the last time we considered this issue. It was said that failing to cast a ``yea'' vote would give new meaning to the phrase ``suffer the little children.'' However, it's the failure of this legislation to refocus benefits on low-income children that gives new meaning to the phrase ``suffer the little children.'' 
   If, as the verse continues, it is to these children ``that the Kingdom of God belongs,'' then why is this children's program failing to serve so many children? How is it that in my home State of Michigan 87,000 eligible children don't have health care while 39,000 adults are in the program? 
   How is it that in Minnesota 87 percent of the enrollees in this children's program are adults? 
   How is it that this low-income program is covering families in New Jersey making more than $70,000 a year? No wonder New York wanted to go over $80,000. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the answer to these questions is clear. The majority does not want a low-income children's plan. They want what Hillary Clinton called for in 1994, the first step towards nationalized, government-run, controlled health care. 
   We should not be diluting this children's program, and we should not be diverting money away from these low-income kids.

This is the kind of legislation we should be debating instead of continuing this senseless stalemate that uses children as political pawns.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4. It is a flawed piece of legislation. If there was ever a bill that should have gone through regular order in the committee process, it is this one, because we find as we look at it more carefully that there is much more to it than might appear at first glance. 
   First and foremost, we should recognize that Medicare part D is working. Ninety percent of seniors are covered. Thirty-eight million seniors now have prescription drug coverage. 
   Additionally, due to private competition, the cost of this program is continuing to fall. Estimates from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services have predicted that this program will cost $373 billion less over the next 10 years than was expected in 2005. Seniors are saving an average of $1,200 dollars a year because of those declines. 
   Market-driven reforms in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act are working to provide more choices and lower prices.     
   Rather than establishing a one-size-fits-all government benefits package, the part D program allows beneficiaries to choose from a range of plans that meet their unique needs and circumstances. 
   It is also important to note that the current private sector negotiating power of part D is greater than a government-run Medicare program. We have heard much from the other side about a government-run program having a bargaining power, but in fact, the four top pharmacy benefit managers cover over 200 million individuals. So they not only negotiate on behalf of the seniors in part D but also on behalf of all the other beneficiaries in their programs throughout the United States, including most Members of Congress in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. So this is over 10 times the number of Medicare beneficiaries than the Secretary would negotiate on behalf of. 
   Despite these facts, Democrats are continuing to push a bill that could significantly disrupt and dismantle the successful and popular Medicare prescription drug program. They want to remove private competition forces from this successful equation and, instead, have the Secretary of Health and Human Services interfere in and implement a price control system. 
   Medicare part D is successful because seniors are able to choose plans that cover their drugs and best meet their health needs. Government bureaucrats, instead, would be replaced and would choose what drugs seniors would get, and these bureaucrats would be allowed to set prices for Medicare covered drugs. 
   The government should not be responsible for making decisions that should be left to seniors. Currently, seniors are able to choose plans. I think we should continue to allow seniors to make their own choices and keep bureaucrats out of seniors' medicine cabinets. The Medicare prescription drug program is working, and we would be wise to resist the Democrats' plan to fix what is not broken. 
   We can continue to improve prescription drug programs, but we must closely examine these changes so Congress does not do more harm than good by enacting new policies. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this noninterference language that we have been talking about, that has been in legislative proposals for both Democrats and Republicans for the last decade, actually stops the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices. And the reason that this has been part of bipartisan legislation for so long and was actually a part of the motion to recommit in 2000 that more than 200 Democrats voted for is because it was important to structure a plan that allowed beneficiaries to work with their doctors, not with the government, to determine the best access to treatment and the best treatment that worked for them. That is why you have seen so many coalitions come out against this proposal, particularly those that work with the most vulnerable of the Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I would urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank him also for his distinguished service in the United States Congress, the United States Air Force, seven of those as a prisoner of war. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this nonbinding resolution. And I share with my colleagues, our servicemen and women and their families, the wish that this war was over and won. It is not, and the resolution before us today does nothing to resolve this conflict, does nothing to reduce the loss of American life, does nothing to stabilize Iraq and does nothing to advance our security. 
   I would like to use my time today to relate some of the comments that I have received from my constituents in the Fourth District of Michigan. From Big Rapids: ``The Congressmen and women who are opposed to these plans should come up with better solutions! Don't penalize our military men and women by making politics a part of their safety and well-being!'' 
   From my hometown of Midland: ``Please stop playing politics with our lives and the lives of young people who are defending our country.'' 
   From Alma: ``I am sick of the partisan politics. We went into Iraq united, but we have let politics divide us. It is time to realize some things are bigger than the political parties!'' 
   Friends, we may often disagree. But the facts are, regardless of how it began, and irrespective of the benefit of hindsight, we are at war and Iraq is the central battleground. 
   Islamic extremists are waging a jihad against us, and they are struggling to make Iraq a base camp. Our focus must be on winning; and, disturbingly, I see no mention of winning, succeeding, or victory in this resolution. That in itself is telling of just how the other side perceives this conflict: not in terms of defeating an enemy of America, but in terms of defeating a political foe. 
   Our troops deserve better. The American people demand more from their leaders. 
   Again, in the words of one of my constituents from Bannister: ``I hope Congress is tough enough to do what works, not just what is politically correct. We need to move carefully and deliberately, showing a united front, or we are again going to be the victims of some outrageous terrorist attack.'' 
   Sadly, the new majority does not seem to understand what so many Americans readily grasp. ``If you support the troops, you must support the mission or you send the wrong message to the enemy,'' as it was so aptly put by a constituent from Ashley. 
   From Farwell: ``Congress needs to get behind the President and help, not hurt, the morale of the soldiers that are fighting. They believe in their mission!'' 
   And I believe in them, which is why I cannot and will not support this resolution. 
   As I conclude my remarks, I want to leave you with two comments. The first is from Traverse City: ``We should all pull together and get the job done.'' 
   And the second, from an airman from Corunna: ``Thank you for the much needed support of me and my fellow airmen.'' 
   I hope that once we dispose of this nonbinding resolution, our focus turns to supporting our servicemen and women, making America more secure and achieving the victory our military personnel are putting their lives on the line for.
