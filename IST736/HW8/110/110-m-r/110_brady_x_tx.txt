<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, another day, another energy gimmick, it must be the 110th Congress. The American public, hammered by high fuel prices, is getting tired of the Jed Clampett energy plan put forth by Democrats. You just can't shoot at imaginary targets and hope that energy is going to come bubbling up. 
   Look at the record. Look at the record. In this past year Democrats said, if we can sue OPEC, we will lower gas prices. Have your gas prices gone down? They said if we pass use it or lose it, which was laughed at around the world, they said gas prices will go down. Have your fuel prices gone down? 
   Earlier they said we'll just stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and your gas prices will go down. Did they? The answer is no. 
   Today is just another gimmick. Depleting America's emergency oil nest egg at a time when the world is increasingly unstable in oil-producing nations like Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, why, that makes no sense at all. Tapping our emergency reserves for three measly days of energy, three, that won't lower prices, nor does it send a signal to the rest of the world that America is serious about taking responsibility for our own energy needs. You really believe the world market that uses 85 million barrels a day is going to look at this tiny amount and lower the prices? 
   If this bill were to pass--and it won't, it will fail again--at the end of the drawdown, America would be more dependent on foreign oil than when we started. And when it's replenished, we will have just bought oil at a higher price out of taxpayers' money. 
   So here's the question: How high does gas have to be before Congress will act? How many families will be hurt? How many small businesses will go under? How hard will our economy be hit before Speaker Pelosi allows an up-or-down vote on producing more American-made energy? 
   We voted on conservation, we voted on renewables. Why can't we vote on more exploration?

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, another day, another energy gimmick. It must be the 110th Congress. 
   The American public, hammered by high fuel prices, is getting tired of the Democrats' Jed Clampett energy plan. You just can't shoot at a bunch of imaginary targets and hope that energy is going to come bubbling up from the ground. Today is another such gimmick. Depleting America's emergency oil nest egg at a time when the world is increasingly unstable in oil-producing nations like Nigeria, like Venezuela, and Iran, why, even a hillbilly like me doesn't think that makes much sense. 
   Tapping our energy reserve for 3 measly days of energy, 3, 3 days of energy, that won't lower prices, nor does it send a signal to the world that America is serious about taking more responsibility for meeting our own daily energy needs. 
   If this bill were to pass, and it will fail spectacularly today, but if it were to pass at the end of the drawdown, America would be more dependent on foreign oil than we are today. We would be more dependent on foreign oil than we are today. And how does that solve the problem? 
   So here is the question: How high does gas have to get before Congress will act? How many families will be hurt? How many small businesses will go under? How hard will our economy be hit before our Speaker allows an up-or-down vote on producing more American-made energy? 
   Congress has voted on conservation, we voted on renewable and passed them both. Why can't we get a vote on more exploration here at home with our resources? Speaker Pelosi to the Democrat leadership, I know that you have the right heart. Tell the special interests to step aside. Make room for the little guy who doesn't have a lobbyist, who hasn't contributed to your campaign. Let them have an up-or-down vote on this floor, a vote now for the American Energy Act so we can produce more American-made energy so we can get serious about lowering gas prices here in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I don't need much of an excuse to give people back their own tax money, especially the way we spend it up here in Washington. So I support this measure and appreciate the leadership of President Bush and the bipartisan way this came together. 
   But let's not hold a parade for ourselves just yet. While economic estimates vary, I am somewhat skeptical about how much impact this tiny package will have on America's large and complex economy. I hope it does. But I worry this yet may become more a political stimulus package than a true economic stimulus. 
   The truth is our economy is so strong and resilient that it bounces back and recovers quickly from major challenges, whether it's the attacks of 9/11 or the dot-com crash. There's no question the housing downturn and future credit crunch are real and serious, and we ought to look at every way to limit their impact, but not in any way that prolongs those problems or creates an excuse for a spending spree that we cannot afford. 
   Our goal as a government should be to do no harm. At this point, this package accomplishes that.     
   In fact, incentives for small businesses I think will help create new business investment in the economy, which keeps and creates jobs. And we should never miss an opportunity to help families at all income levels to stretch their budgets, especially with prices so high. 
   In the end, we should remember that it is not Washington that creates jobs, but rather a business climate that rewards rather than punishes Americans for working smarter, for succeeding, and developing the innovations that our changing world demands.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last November Democrats looked the American people in the eye and they promised, they promised they would lower gas prices and become energy independent. Instead, gas prices are almost a dollar higher at the pump and America is more dependent on foreign oil than ever. 
   This new Democrat Congress has failed miserably; unless, of course, you count promoting energy-efficient light bulbs and threatening to sue OPEC, for whatever that is worth. 
   To be fair, there are good things in this bill, such as increasing gas mileage for cars and trucks and extending Republican tax incentives to encourage more energy-efficient technology and more renewable energy such as solar, wind, biomass and geothermal. 
   But this bill is disappointing because it launches yet another attack on Texas and American energy producers who are trying to create jobs and explore for new energy here in America. It also cripples the emerging biodiesel industry which is important to the Nation as we seek alternatives to gasoline. 
   Let me tell you this: OPEC is going to love this bill. OPEC is going to love this bill, but families who are going to pay more at the pump and pay higher electric bills at home are going to hate it. Thank goodness this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. 
   We need more energy, a balanced approach, not more higher gas prices and higher electric prices. This bill deserves to be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is a very unfortunate time when families are struggling to try to make ends meet with these energy prices, small businesses too. Basically, Congress is debating a bait-and-switch piece of legislation. 
   Democrats are hoping that the American public isn't smart enough to realize there are two oil fields in Alaska--ANWR, the one that has been put off-limits, is fertile with what we believe are vast oil and gas reserves. And the National Petroleum Reserve, which, by the way, has been explored out now for 70 years. 
   The difference between ANWR, and the National Petroleum Reserve, is the difference between Jimmy Carter and his brother, Billy Carter. ANWR holds vast reserves in a small amount of land that can be accessed much more affordably and quickly. The National Petroleum Reserve was first drilled for two decades by the U.S. Navy, the Federal Government. 
   Then for the next two decades it was drilled again by the U.S. Geological Service, again, the Federal Government. For the recent decades, it has been drilled by companies, three principally, two of them in the Texas area. Unfortunately, no major finds were there. That's why most of this area, it's big, but most of it hasn't been leased because most of it is a dry hole. 
   What they found instead is that there are some small finds along the edge, which are very expensive to explore, it costs about $1 billion to put an oil well there, and $10 million a mile to try to connect it back to the existing fields. Unfortunately, even doing that, even stringing those small finds together to try to produce oil has been held up by environmental lawsuits and red tape. 
   So the claim that oil companies aren't exploring and doing their best, they are investing billions of dollars there. To claim that there are vast reserves that merely need to be leased, the whole world has passed on these leases year and year and year again. You can offer them every 5 minutes, and they are going to pass on them again. 
   We need to quit playing games with the American public. We need to open up ANWR, the other Alaskan oil field, that holds a real ability for us to take more responsibility for America's own energy needs, for us to have some say  in that price of energy, to make sure that when families are filling up, they aren't filling up with oil from the Middle East or from Venezuela or that they are paying prices dictated by Iran and Nigeria and Russia, but more American-made energy. 
   Ignore this bait and switch. Let's get to real energy policy, real American-made energy in ANWR.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this proposal. For the first time in more than a decade and in recent memory, the new House leadership, and this is hard to believe, is attempting to keep secret the votes of one of our most important committees, the Rules Committee. It determines which bills are sent to the House floor, for how long they may be debated, and what amendments the people's House will consider. It is a critical part of our democratic process. Hiding these votes from the public, cloaking this committee in secrecy where backroom deals are shielded from the American voter, is an outrageous and arrogant step backward from open and honest government. This is abuse of power that must be stopped. And, sadly, I will file a Freedom of Information Act request on every Rules Committee vote so that the American public can see what this committee is trying to hide. 
   We ought to defeat this proposal

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (EXTENDING TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I stand in support of this legislation. I appreciate the chairman's leadership on extending it. I stand on behalf of Representative Wally Herger, who is author of this legislation and ranking member, lead Republican on the Trade Subcommittee of Ways and Means. 
   In my view, free trade is working on America's behalf. The free trade agreements we have today are producing more and more sales of American products and services around the world, nearly doubling those sales. Even though our free trade agreements are with countries that only represent 7 percent of the whole global market, in fact, they buy almost half of all that America sells and produces. In fact, we have a free trade surplus with these countries of over $5 billion. Conversely, much of our trade deficit, 80 percent of it are with countries we don't have free trade agreements with. 
   Nonetheless, at the same time we have to do a better job of helping those who lose their jobs due to the ever-changing world marketplace. We need to give workers more training options and more flexibility to get back on their feet as soon as possible. 
   Trade Adjustment Assistance has been successful in helping many adjust to job loss because of trade. The benefits, including the health coverage, tax credit, are very meaningful. Trade Adjustment Assistance can be improved in how it is administered to get people certified and trained more quickly, and changes can be made to get people back to work soon. However, this is an expensive program, costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion while providing assistance for about 54,000 workers per year. Accordingly, as the committee and as this Congress looks forward to covering additional workers who lose their jobs because of trade, we must look at it carefully to make sure we are getting the help to those who need it, that we are doing it efficiently, that we are giving them the educational tools they need to get back to the workforce just as soon as possible. And that is an area that I think will take considerable discussion, but I think there is common ground among Republicans and Democrats to try to make sure that we get as many workers back to work as soon as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the previous speakers as well that there are lots of challenges that face American workers these days. And whether it is from competition here at home or competition from abroad, technology, or just the fact that our economy continues to transition, families need help in moving with that transition, acquiring the education, the skills. We have a huge mismatch between the jobs available in this country and the skills of the workers who can fill them, and it is important that we bridge that gap. 
   I would close with this point that Congressman Herger has made, I think, in all of these hearings. Trade Adjustment Assistance is just one tool in a larger policy toolbox to help workers and families and communities adjust to the new global economy. Trade Adjustment Assistance isn't the proper response to all job loss. Currently we spend billions of dollars each year through a large number of Federal programs, including Trade Adjustment Assistance, to help Americans who lose their jobs. 
   I think, as we work on this, you take decades-old Federal programs that need reform today such as TAA, improve their effectiveness, improve their efficiency, make sure that we are really getting that help down to families that need it in a timely way, sometimes in advance of those job losses, with the education debit cards and other new ideas that can help these workers recover more quickly. I just think there is an opportunity to work together, Republicans and Democrats, to try to resolve this and find a real good solution for this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, economically, our Nation is a Nation of thirds. One-third of our States face steep economic challenges, one-third are chugging along with their traditional economies, and one-third are enjoying strong job growth and, in fact, record low unemployment. 
   This measure is well-intended. There's no question about it. But compassion isn't enough. Jobs are what is needed. 
   Instead of targeting workers in the struggling States that need both help with their bills and, more importantly, a new job, this measure provides no job training, no hope to laid off workers, workers that I know don't want a handout. They want an opportunity for a job that they can raise their families on. They want an opportunity for new skills. They want opportunities. 
   And like many one-size-fits-all Washington programs, this bill unnecessarily drains the precious unemployment trust fund an extra $8 billion by not targeting the help to the States and the workers who need it the most. 
   For hardworking Americans, though, what is most troubling is that this bill abandons the minimum work requirement that has, in the past, prevented the unscrupulous from gaming the system. By throwing out this reasonable requirement, that you actually have a real job before you get job benefits, people in some States can work as little as 2 weeks and receive government paychecks for 1 year. 
   Most Americans do the opposite. We work for a year, then we receive 2 weeks of vacation. In this bill, it's the opposite, 2 weeks of work and a year of Federal aid. And in fact, while it's been questioned that that isn't the case, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 4 States allow you to work as little as 1 week under some circumstances to receive benefits. 
   And what's unfortunate, who will pay the benefits that have been gamed? Hardworking American taxpayers who are struggling to make ends meet with record fuel prices because this Congress refuses to act to open up our resources and take more responsibility for America's own energy needs. 
   In conclusion, helping workers who need it the most, helping them find new jobs and stopping the gaming of our Federal aid is a bipartisan goal. Unfortunately, this bill fails on all counts.

Al Qaeda is not down and out but clearly back on its heels, rejected by the very communities and religious leaders it claims to fight for. 
   Now make no mistake, there are still serious challenges, including high-profile bombings, the need for Iraq's Government to resolve key issues now, and Iran's continued support for terrorism. But I am convinced the new strategy is working, and we have impressive leaders and impressive troops in place to see even more progress.  
   Mr. Speaker, while Congress has the right to debate this war, it has the responsibility to help win it as well. That means letting this new strategy work through the end of the year, or the beginning of the next, if we are truly serious about a stable Iraq and a safer America.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I agree completely with our Democrat friends: we need to invest more in renewable energy. It is the right thing to do, and it is long overdue. But doing it by taxing American energy companies more for exploring and creating jobs here at home makes no sense. 
   Let's be clear. This bill says, foreign oil and foreign jobs are good; American oil and American jobs are bad. And that is crazy. 
   The new House leadership may believe it scores in political points to target Texas energy companies and refiners, many of whom are union workers. But our communities don't think it is so funny and our union workers don't think it is so funny. 
   This bill punishes energy companies for doing the research that leads to successful wells. The old Tax Code had a perverse disincentive. If you failed in finding a successful well, you could write off expenses. If you are successful, though, we punished you for it. We changed that, because we think companies ought to do more research, not less, drill accurate wells, drill fewer of them, and have smaller footprints. 
   This provision is an anti-research and an anti-environmental provision. This bill declares energy jobs in America aren't manufacturing jobs. Under this bill, we treat energy workers, including high-paying union workers, as foreign workers. We treat our people as foreign workers. And farmers are manufacturers under this bill. Cartoonists are manufacturers under this bill. But those who work on oil rigs and refineries in Texas are foreign workers, and we don't touch the foreign oil companies at all. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this bill will not lower gas prices one penny. It won't lessen our dependence on foreign oil one barrel. This bill does not strengthen our energy security. Just the opposite. It does not deserve our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6, the ``Clean Energy Act of 2007.'' I agree with Democrats that we need to invest more in renewable energy, including new ways to fuel our cars. But by taxing American companies more for exploring and creating jobs here at home--and letting foreign oil companies off the hook--this bill says foreign oil and foreign jobs are good, American oil and American jobs are bad. That's just crazy. 
   It's bad energy policy--with big costs. Costs to the consumer at the pump, to the refinery worker in the Gulf, and to the retiree whose pension depends on the strength of American industry. 
   Don't be fooled--the special tax breaks they say the oil and gas industry gets aren't special at all. In 2004, at a time when manufacturing jobs were heading overseas by the thousands and we were increasingly worried about our foreign dependence on oil, Congress passed a bill that gave a tax incentive to all American manufacturers to get them to invest more here at home--including oil and gas producers. 
   A year later, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act that the Democrats say provided huge tax breaks to ``big oil.'' But they got that wrong, too. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, this bill imposed a net tax increase of nearly $300 million over the next decade. At the same time, we provided incentives for energy exploration in difficult terrains so that our country could take another step toward weaning ourselves off foreign oil. 
   And we're seeing an important result from these policies: Jobs. The U.S. energy sector employs more than 1.8 million Americans, with good pay--up to $30 an hour on average, and often with union benefits. 
   In Texas, energy independence is our economy's life blood. Over 35,000 people work in the oil and gas sector in the Houston area alone, and nearly a quarter of our nation's crude oil is refined along the Texas Gulf Coast. Drilling is at record levels and reserves of natural gas are growing. Production is holding steady. The cost of oil, which is historically volatile, is down. And while Democrats like to take a swat at record oil and gas profits, these same companies are putting those profits back  into infrastructure and technology--often more than twice their profits in a year. Margins are actually much lower. 
   But the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to our exploration and refining capacity in the Gulf unmasked just how vulnerable our energy sector is. Plans are underway to strengthen that capacity--but that progress could be jeopardized if we place an undue tax burden on our refineries. In an area of the country that's still recovering from these disasters, why strip away even more jobs by taxing an industry that is helping supply thousands? 
   What's even crazier is that House Democrats will now consider American energy workers, including oil rig and refinery workers, as foreign workers for tax purposes--just so they can raise taxes on U.S. companies. Under this bill, farmers, software designers, and even cartoonists are considered manufacturing workers, but Americans who go to work each day to supply energy for this nation are classified as foreign workers. Explain that. 
   Democrats like to claim that we need this bill to lower gas and oil prices. I'm not sure who came up with that theory, but common sense tells me that if we put a strain on domestic manufacturers, that only serves to give a boost to foreign competition--and a boost to prices. 
   At a time when some Americans are relying on Hugo Chavez to heat their homes this winter--we need to take a step back and clearly understand the consequences of our actions. Repealing these tax incentives would only serve to stifle domestic production of oil and gas, raise gas prices and home heating costs for Americans, send more jobs overseas, and increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   The new House leadership may believe it scores them cheap political points to target Texas energy companies, many of whom employ union workers, but our communities don't think it's so funny. And at a time we need more U.S. energy and less foreign oil, it makes no sense at all. 
   As I said before, I believe we should invest in the development of renewable energy and alternative fuels to protect our future and our children's future. But short-changing American jobs today isn't the way to do it.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have voted against this bill twice in the Chamber. I rise today in support of it. 
   This bill will now, in the right way, provide relief to American families who, after losing their homes in the past, have gotten a bill from Uncle Sam, and it is wrong. At a time when people struggle to keep their homes and they may lose them or have to sell them at a loss, we shouldn't be kicking them when they are down. This bill will right that wrong, giving taxpayers temporary relief for at least 3 years, and will also allow taxpayers to continue to deduct the premiums that they pay for mortgage insurance, which will help a number of people afford homes. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased that the Senate stripped from this bill something we sent out of the House twice, which was wrong. What we attempted to do was to increase the taxes on people who own second homes. Now, the original thought would be, that must be the wealthy. It's not; it's the middle class. In fact, 40 percent of all the home sales last year in America were to second homebuyers. And they're not the wealthy. The average income of those buyers was $82,000. So, we were punishing middle-class families for scrimping on their first mortgage so they could save up for a vacation home or resort home or retirement home or maybe even an investment. That would have punished families. It would have hurt, I think, many communities whose future relies upon retirees in resort and vacation homes, and would have deepened the housing problems here in America rather than aid them. A number of us fought against that provision. We're pleased that the Senate removed it. This makes this a very bipartisan bill that has strong support. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Let me point out, too, that I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Rangel on this, and I appreciate that he recognized this problem and moved on it. I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Andrews, who have fought for this legislation for many years.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I see faces of trade myself. I recently did a tour of our manufacturing plants. We have over 300 of them in the Eighth Congressional District of Texas from steel mills to paper mills. I watched the workers on those lines working every day to produce those products. Between one-third and one-half of those products are made for sales overseas. 
   What they find is that when they try to compete around the world, they aren't allowed to compete. America is so open for every product from every country. But when we try to sell our products and our goods, what we see are America need-not-apply signs all throughout this world. 
   Our trade policy is to tear down those signs, to give those workers in my plants a chance to sell their products around the world. There is a principle applied to the trade that we deal with today. The principle is, if you or I build a better mousetrap, we should be free to sell it throughout the world without government interference. If someone else builds a better mousetrap, we should be free to buy it for our family or for our business, again without government interference. That freedom to buy, to sell and to compete our products and our skills is an important economic freedom. 
   This trade agreement opens Peru's market, gives us the freedom to sell our products and goods into that country, for our agriculture community, for our manufacturing workers, and for our service community. As importantly, it reaffirms America's long-term commitment to both growth and prosperity here and at home in Latin America. 
   This agreement is important because for the first time in a long time, America is speaking as one voice on trade. Republicans and Democrats, this Congress and the White House are speaking as one voice to level the playing field for our farmers and our workers around the world. We are going from one-way trade to two-way trade. 
   These free trade agreements that we have with 14 to 15 countries are working. Today, they are only a small part of the world market, yet they buy nearly half of what my workers and America's workers export around the world. We are seeing growth in sales, growth in services, growth in products, and good-paying jobs in America. 
   One of the key points today is Peru is a great trading partner and they have been for 16 years. They have one of the most dynamic emerging economies in the Americas. They have instituted democratic reforms, they have decreased poverty, and they have improved their labor and environmental standards significantly. Why would we turn our back on a country and a partner like Peru? 
   It is time to go from a limited partnership of preferences to a full partnership of free trade with the country of Peru. Tonight I heard people say, well, the Peruvians don't support this. The workers don't support this. 
   How arrogant. The Peruvian Congress has twice voted overwhelmingly to ratify this agreement. They elected a President based on his support of this trade agreement. Their leading lawmaker's party ran on supporting this agreement. How arrogant it is for us to talk about Peru when their own elected leaders support this agreement. 
   It is important, not just about jobs for America, not just about jobs in Peru, it is important we remain engaged in Latin America. There is a reason why eight of our living Secretaries of State have implored this Congress to stay engaged. Now is not the time to build walls to Latin America. Now is the time to build bridges. 
   Now is the time to continue to stay engaged as countries like Peru reject the influence of Hugo Chavez and embrace democracy and free speech and the rule of law and labor rights and human rights. They are doing the right thing. We ought to be reaching out and responding more to them. 
   I will make this point. America does create jobs through trade. In 1995, when NAFTA first took effect, our economy was less than $7 trillion. Today it is more than $13 trillion. Back then we had 115 million people working in America. Today we have over 140 million people working in America. 
   Trade creates jobs, and look at the top 10 trade States whose jobs are dependent upon our sales: Texas, California, New York, Washington, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, all the top 10 States whose jobs are directly related to exports. Then we have the heartland States of agriculture and the high tech States throughout the country, all of which depend upon us opening new markets, tearing down that sign, and creating jobs. This is an agreement worth our support.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Thank you, Jim McCrery, for your leadership throughout the years on this issue and so many other important ones.     
   Congress must act. Our Nation faces the fiercest financial crisis in our lifetime, and for lawmakers entrusted with America's prosperity to stand by and do nothing, that's no longer an option. 
   I don't like this bill any more than my constituents do. The thought of our interfering in the marketplace, of spending taxpayer dollars for irresponsible Wall Street firms, it makes my constituents angry and me too. But the fact of the matter is these bad loans have infected too much of America's economy and they threaten the world's economy as well. And make no mistake, if these Wall Street financial companies go down, our businesses and families in Texas are pulled down with them. 
   Families in my district are already watching their life savings disappear before their eyes. I met a Texas worker. She only had $15,000 in her savings; she lost $8,000 of it over the past 2 weeks. I talked to a woman who stopped me in my car as I was leaving my neighborhood, and she said she and her husband have a small business. Their good customers can't get the credit to buy their products anymore. For the first time in 17 years since they started their business, she is truly frightened. And I ask myself why should our local families, why should our local communities pay the price in lost jobs and lost savings because of Wall Street greed? Haven't these Wall Street companies caused enough damage? 
   This is not my solution. This is not the only solution. America faces tough times. We're going to have to come right back in November, in my opinion, and bring about the reforms to stop this from happening again. But I am going to vote ``yes'' again to pull this Nation back from its economic brink and protect the families and jobs and small businesses in Texas.

   Just last weekend after a successful attack by Colombian troops against the terrorist FARC, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez expressed his outrage and ordered his troops to the Colombian border. He convinced Ecuador to do the same. There is evidence that Chavez has colluded with these terrorists and seeks to destroy the democratic government of Colombia.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I appreciate Mr. McCrery's leadership on veterans issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on the floor today that will provide additional tax relief to our Nation's veterans, especially those who are seeking to purchase homes. This bill ensures that our veterans who serve their Nation after 1977, including those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, can qualify for low-interest home loans financed by Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds. In Texas, this is important. This bill will enable the Texas Veterans Land Board, led by Commissioner Jerry Patterson, to expand its existing low-interest loan program to serve thousands of more Texas veterans. 
   For all the sacrifice our veterans have made to defend our country, it's only right that we help them own a home upon returning home.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there's no question, we need to do a better job of helping people who are laid off from their jobs. Even though only 3 percent of this country's jobs are affected by trade, if it's your job, it's an important one. 
   But when workers try to get help, what they find is this program is bureaucratic and inefficient and slow to respond. There's a big mismatch between the skills our workers have and the ready jobs that are available for them. But TAA does not do a good job of matching those skills and those workers. And I think there's been a good-faith effort to try to make this a better program, but, in my view, the underlying bill makes it a bigger program, not necessarily a better one. 
   TAA is a leaky bucket, and I think we're making the bucket bigger and we're pouring more money into it. I don't think we're fixing the holes that really harm workers. 
   For example, in the bill today we actually enhance duplication of efforts rather than streamline it. This bill prohibits a worker who's laid off for trade reasons to going to the local job training center to get help. In fact, what we require is a new State-run program that has no track record, has no proven success, and we relegate them to really a second tier training system. 
   In Houston we have WorkSource. It's at 35 different sites around our region. It helps about 340,000 workers laid off, has put 53,000 back to work at higher than average salaries. It's a great proven product. 
   Under this bill, a worker can't even go down the street to take advantage of those computers and that networking and that work with businesses, but we set up a less efficient one, unproven for them. It doesn't make sense. 
   I object to the pay-for as well. We are actually making U.S. companies less competitive as they sell overseas. As you know, today it's not enough to buy American; you have to sell American. We want to sell John Deere tractors and Apple computers around the world, and this bill, unfortunately, actually punishes those companies and hurts the workers for them. 
   The Republican substitute is more flexible. It's less bureaucratic, and provides some commonsense training programs that will actually get workers back to work at a job they can raise their family on, which is what I think there is bipartisan support for.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if we want good jobs for our families, it is no longer enough to buy American; we have to sell American, sell our products and services throughout the world. The good news is that, since January, what we are selling overseas is growing faster than what America is buying from overseas. 
   The way to sustain that positive trend is to keep finding new customers like Peru and Panama, Colombia and South Korea. If we are serious about creating better jobs, Congress should pass the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement this year. Korea is one of the top ten economies in the world. They are our seventh largest customer, and an even bigger customer for America's agricultural community. 
   This agreement will give us access to nearly 50 million new customers and open the door to competing better in the entire Asian market, including against China. This agreement will lower border taxes and barriers to America's manufacturers, technology, insurance and financial services companies, our farmers and ranchers. 
   This fall, Congress needs to spend less time settling old political scores and more time opening up markets for good old American products in Korea.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (TOM LANTOS PULMONARY HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Let me first thank Mr. Deal for his remarkable leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor. Without him championing it through the Energy and Commerce Committee along with Mrs. Capps, this simply would not be happening. I want to thank Mr. Deal for his leadership on behalf of many, many, many patients. 
   I would also like to take a brief moment to reflect on the loss of my friend and one of pulmonary hypertension's  most important voices in Congress, Tom Lantos. I know I speak for each one of us here when I say that we have dearly missed Tom's passion for his work and for the House of Representatives. 
   As chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Tom was regularly confronting some of the most pressing challenges facing our country in the world today. Nevertheless, it was his work on PH that he routinely cited the most important thing he was doing in Congress. 
   As many of us know, Tom's granddaughter, Charity, was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension several years ago. Ever since he had been a tireless advocates on behalf of PH patients and, in my opinion, a large part of why we have made so much progress over the last decade. 
   Like Tom, my involvement with PH is very personal. It is now more than a decade since the daughter of my very good friend, Jack Stibbs, was diagnosed with PH. Jack's daughter, Emily, was only 5 when her parents noticed at a community parade that she was struggling to bicycle fast enough to keep up with her friends. She always seemed out of breath and struggled to climb stairs. Doctors eventually diagnosed her with pulmonary hypertension. 
   PH is a serious and often-fatal condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. In PH patients, the walls of the arteries that take blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, thicken and constrict. As a result, the right side of the heart has to pump harder and harder to move blood into the lungs, causing it to enlarge and ultimately fail. 
   PH can occur without a known cause or be secondary to other conditions, such as scleroderma, lupus, HIV, sickle cell, and liver disease. Patients develop symptoms that include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness and fainting. 
   Unfortunately, these symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed, leaving patients with the false impression that they have a minor pulmonary or cardiovascular condition. By the time many patients receive an accurate diagnosis, the disease has progressed to a late stage, making it impossible to receive a necessary heart or lung transplant. 
   When Emily Stibbs was first diagnosed in 1977, the average survival rate for PH patients was just 2 1/2 years. There was only one FDA-approved therapy at the time, and the best that doctors could do was to make patients comfortable as their condition deteriorated. To make matters worse, there is very little research on PH being supported by the National Institutes of Health. 
   Fortunately we have come a very long way in a relatively short period of time. There are now six FDA-approved therapies for PH with many, many more in the pipeline. People are living longer with a better quality of life than ever before. Our Federal health care agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration are actively and aggressively engaged in the fight against PH. 
   Those of us here on Capitol Hill are more aware of this disease than ever before. The 247 Representatives who cosponsored our PH bill in the last Congress are testament to that fact. But there is still more work that can and must be done as pulmonary hypertension afflicts over 100,000 Americans and continues to strike women of child-bearing age in growing numbers. 
   Representative Lois Capps has joined me in introducing the bill before us today, the Tom Lantos Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act. This bill builds on what we have already accomplished and further emphasizes the need for more research, more training and more awareness. 
   Specifically, it urges the NIH to aggressively pursue collaborative research into better treatments and provides funding to increase physician and public awareness of the disease to ensure early and accurate diagnoses. I am proud of what we have done together and believe that a cure for PH is just around the corner, so long as we continue to keep the National Institutes of Health and medical community focused. 
   On behalf of pulmonary hypertension patients everywhere, I would like to thank Representative Lois Capps for her leadership of this bill, Energy and Commerce Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Joe Barton, Health Subcommittee Chairman Frank Pallone, and, as I mentioned before, my dear friend, Nathan Deal, again, whose leadership was remarkable. 
   I conclude with this, over the last 10 years, we have decided that if I did nothing else in Congress, I would find a cure for this incurable disease. 
   I appreciate so much the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, which has raised, over the years, $10 million for research and education; the chairman of the association, Carl Hicks; its great president, Rino Aldrighetti; Katie Kroner and Gavin Lindberg, who have spent many years advocating on behalf of our patients in the association; Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, who helped start the first Centers of Excellence for PH at the National Institutes of Health; and finally the staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, including Jessica McNiece, Aarti Shaw, Brandon Clark, and Ryan Long. 
   It takes a collaborative effort to tackle a disease like this. We are making progress, and I am eternally grateful for their support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the Carol White Physical Education Program was named after a longstanding and dedicated public servant here on Capitol Hill. Carol White, a long-time Chief of Staff for Senator TED STEVENS, who aptly named this program because they have dedicated their lives to trying to make this country better inside our schools and out. This program provides the funding basically to help schools initiate and expand their physical education programs, which is just a great goal, and many of the grants have been used for playground equipment on schools. 
   Physical education is important. I think we all know that. Our young people are becoming more and more static between video games and television shows and sometimes lack of outdoor recreation. We are seeing more obesity. It is important that PE be part of an integral curriculum of our schools. In fact, our States and local districts have targeted PE as an area that they want to reintroduce back to the curriculum for our children. 
   The only reason I raise this program up is to have some type of thoughtful debate about who should fund PE programs and, more importantly, what should our Federal priorities be. 
   I ask that because I know that today we are running a deficit. We have a major national debt. I know that every dollar that we spend above the deficit, and we will run a deficit again with the budget we are discussing today, but I know that every dollar that goes to our public debt is picked up by these same children we are trying to help where it will result in a tax increase for families. So it seems right and proper that we scrutinize every program regardless of how much we might admire the person it is named after. 
   This program has been rated by the program assessment rating tool as the results not demonstrated at this point. I imagine that is why the President did not request funding for it. Like the chairman, who has identified apparently 200 or more programs for dismissal, we have to make tough choices. 
   What we are seeking here is a simple question. In our rural schools and our smaller schools, they have the money to buy playground equipment or to build a swingset for kids. What they don't have is money to hire a special needs teacher. What they don't have is money to help kids read and write at grade level. What they don't have is money to help try to prevent the dropouts that are hitting our schools and a case where nearly half of our minorities in eighth grade or ninth and graduating to 12th grade. It just seems to me that from the Federal funding level, our local schools can afford a playground set. What we need to help them with is what they can't afford, which are teachers to help our special needs kids; equipment to help our kids with disabilities; teachers in science, in math, and technology subjects; food for kids who come to school hungry. Despite the merits and the goal which are so laudable for this program, it seems to me that we ought to set our highest priorities to help schools with what they cannot do today, which really is to help our kids read and write, to help our special needs students reach their potential, to try to stop this horrendous dropout rate in America. 
   So I would propose that we, as the President suggested, not fund this program, reserve those resources. And, again, these are tough choices you always have to make through the process. It is not much fun either way. I am sure the chairman did not delight in cutting any of the programs that he had proposed. It is just a way that we try to get closer to a balanced budget and try to prioritize where we fund our schools and our kids and, again, try to make the greatest use of every tax dollar we have. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Well, thank you. And I appreciate joining the two gentlemen from Georgia who continue to look out every day for the family's pocket books, rather than Washington's pocket books, which I fear is too deep. And the point I always try to make, I am in my 11th year in Congress, serve on the Ways and Means Committee, have worked on all of President Bush's tax relief. And I am convinced that Washington has all the money it needs. It just doesn't have all the money it wants. And there is a big difference between the two. 
   And tonight, as you and I talk, millions of Americans are scrambling at the last minute to file their taxes, rummaging through cabinets and drawers and bank statements, anxious to try to comply with the complicated Tax Code. And they are willing to pay their fair share. But our code is so complex that they worry. 
   Paying taxes is bad enough. But the time wasted in figuring them is almost worse. You shouldn't need an accountant to do your taxes, and you shouldn't live in fear of just making an honest mistake. For our sanity's sake, and I think for our children's sake, we really need to sunset this awful Tax Code and replace it with something far more simple, like a flat tax or my preference, a retail sales tax. And I love the retail sales tax because, can you imagine, can you imagine never having to fill out a tax return again in your lifetime? Never. Can you imagine the IRS being completely, totally out of your life forever? 
   And as we talk about how complex this code is, let's not forget we need to keep our taxes low. Tax Freedom Day for Texas families is this Thursday. And that is the first day since New Year's that Texans will start working for themselves and not for the government. For the rest of the country, on average, you have still got two more weeks, April 30. In fact, most families in America will get to the fifth month of the year. Can you imagine? The fifth month of the year before they stop working for the government and start working for their dreams, for their families, for what they want to accomplish in life. And I think most of us would feel better if we felt that Washington wasn't wasting so much of our hard-earned money. 
   My families are worried that the new Democrat budget allows President Bush's tax relief to expire, which would increase taxes on families in Texas $2,700 a year; $2,700 more for each, a typical Texas family. 
   I talked over the April work period with Kirk and Sandy Noyes of the Woodlands; visited with Marty and Ty Drake in their home in Livingston; Buck and Ava Anderson of Cleveland in their living room; sat down in the kitchen with Ed and Connie Heiman of Magnolia; Elmer and Pauline Hensley of Lumberton; Pat and Ashley Canfield of Huntsville. We talked about what that $2,700 would mean to their families, and they talked about the medical bills for their young children because co-pays and deductibles add up so quickly. They talked about car insurance, how expensive that is. Marty Drake is a police officer. He said, You know, I will work overtime, all of my high school football games, use all that money just to pay that extra bill. 
   One woman, who is it? Connie Heiman in Magnolia, she works at a doctor's office just so she can pay the health care. And she said, We don't have any extra money. And her husband runs the flooring store in Magnolia. He said, I can't work longer. I work 6 1/2 days a week as it is. 
   And my belief is that we are, despite what Washington thinks, we are an overtaxed Nation. And all you need to do is look at your own day to understand it. We wake up in the morning, get in the shower, we pay a water tax. We grab a cup of coffee, pay a sales tax. Drive down to work, pay a fuel tax. At work we pay, not just payroll tax but income tax as well. Get home at night, flip on the switch, walk in the door, turn on the lights, pay the electricity tax, pick up the phone, pay a telephone tax, turn on the TV, pay cable tax, kiss  our wife goodnight, pay a marriage penalty tax and we do that every day of our life. And when we die, we pay a death tax. We are an overtaxed Nation. 
   And in my belief, we need to continue, not just for our economy, but for our families, we need to continue President Bush's tax relief because our families can't take this extra hit. The marriage penalty will come back to life. That is wrong. In fact, Ways and Means, and I will finish with this, because we have other Members who need to visit as well. But we did the tax relief not for grins and giggles, but for two important reasons. One was fairness. The marriage penalty is unfair. The death tax is unfair. The State and local sales tax structure, it was unfair for other States to have an advantage. And another reason is to spur this economy. After 9/11, we took three big hits: 9/11, the recession and the wonderful Enrons and WorldComs of the world. Our economy took huge hits. We targeted tax relief, and we have had 40 straight months of job growth, created 7.5 million new jobs. We are going to risk that? We are going to risk this strong economy raising taxes on families and small businesses? It doesn't make sense. My belief is Washington needs to tighten its belt before we ask our families and small businesses to tighten theirs.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Thank you for your leadership on this issue. You come from a State, Illinois, that has a diverse blend of energy sources, and you've got a leadership role on the Energy and Commerce Committee. You know this issue. And you're right, ``no'' is not an energy policy. 
   I think this new Democrat Congress is completely disconnected from the real world. I say that because recently I held some roundtables at Mama Jack's Restaurant in Kountze, Texas, which, by the way, has great food and a great small business owner who's living the American Dream. And then I went to a new Chevron station earlier this week in Shenandoah, Texas, across from the Woodlands, where our family lives, and just talked to motorists about this issue. 
   What I found at Mama Jack's Restaurant were two small business people who basically say they work for free now. One was a florist. Another one, I forget what small business he was in. They basically said the price of fuel has eaten up all their profits for the week. 
   I talked to the sheriff of Hardin County, who said, basically, they run through their annual budget in law enforcement about halfway through the year. Now their officers aren't able to make some of the discretionary, positive, proactive calls they'd like to make. They 
   don't have the money to do it. 
   At the gas station, I talked to a painter who lives in Montgomery County, works all throughout the Houston area, who said, basically, that he used to make $500 a week, what his net was. Now his fuel eats up $250 of that. 
   I ran into a teacher, a guitar teacher, a young man who had a very fuel-efficient car. He actually sold his land in Willis and moved closer to where he works just because, as he said, ``We just can't take these fuel prices.'' 
   Yet look at Congress. Look at this new Democrat Congress. Since they've been in office, not only has the price of energy just skyrocketed, but look at  what it's done. The first thing it did to address energy prices, it passed a bill through the House to allow individuals to sue OPEC. To sue OPEC. What is that going to accomplish? 
   Then the second thing is this Congress began promoting longer-lasting light bulbs. Those are fine, but I don't think it's going to help lower the price at the pump anywhere. 
   Then they decided, no, here's the problem: We're apparently producing too much energy here in America. So they went after the U.S. energy companies. And what happened was 3 years ago, a Republican Congress, concerned about the loss of jobs overseas, changed the Tax Code. We basically said, look, if you produce and invest in America, create jobs in America, manufacture in America, you will have a lower tax rate than if you do that overseas. It makes great sense. Well, this new Democrat Congress said, no, there's one industry that we won't stand for. So they singled out the U.S. energy industry and said, no, we're going to tax you like you're producing, investing, and creating jobs in foreign countries; so we're going to treat you and your workers like you're a foreign investor. So at a time when we need more U.S. energy, we basically told our American energy companies, we're going to punish you for exploring here and producing and manufacturing in America, and, by the way, we're going to outsource good American energy jobs to other countries. We'll just make it more attractive for them. 
   And then this Congress apparently squeezed in between hearings on steroids in baseball and appearances by Julia Roberts, and we managed somehow to pass a measure to insist on more fuel-efficient cars. That's good. That actually is a good thing. But then this Congress went right back to punishing U.S. energy producers. The latest scheme out there is that we won't sell any military planes made in America, by the way, by American workers unless OPEC agrees to sell us more oil. So, in other words, our message to OPEC was: We want to do less, but we insist that you do more. It makes no sense at all. 
   I agree with you, Mr. Shimkus. We need a balanced approach to our energy. We need to take more responsibility as America for our own energy needs. We need to conserve more. Every one of us can do more to stretch our energy. We do need new technology because everything we touch can be made more energy efficient. And, yes, renewables are important. In fact, the Republican Congress is the one who put in place many incentives on wind and solar and biomass and biofuels types of issues. 
   But what your point is that I agree with, and, I think, the American public agrees with, is we do have to increase supply. We are, I think, a country of Americans that want more American energy. And the way we do that is to unlock our resources. 
   I'm from Texas. I have watched this Government push our energy companies deeper and deeper into the gulf coast, into riskier and more expensive waters, and then we wonder why the price of oil is higher. We've locked off most of our reserves along the gulf coast. We've locked off our Arctic energy, which is a tremendous, vast resource. We refuse to help work on the U.S. Naval Shale Reserve, which is another resource. Mr. Shimkus, for many years I have heard you talk about the need to take coal and turn it into super clean liquid fuels that can help again fuel our country as we go forward. 
   The good news is America has remarkable resources if we will just take more responsibility for what we need because our economy is like a growing young boy. We continue to grow. But other countries do as well. 
   I will finish with this: I've watched Congress blame everyone in the world for high oil prices except themselves. I think Congress ought to look in the mirror when it comes to high energy prices at the pump, and here is why: The high world oil prices reflect the new reality of this Democrat Congress. And what we have said is stable governments like America are no longer going to take responsibility for energy; so we are actually pushing more of the world's reserves into unstable countries, just as you said: Russia, Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria, and others. As a result, we pay a premium price because the rest of the world now knows that America, a stable government, has said no, we are not going to be part of the solution, we want other countries to. And, unfortunately, our motorists, our small businesses, our law enforcement are paying the price. America needs to take more responsibility for our energy.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, what is this Congress thinking? Why would we turn our back on Colombia, and then turn our back on America's own farmers and manufacturers and small businesses? 
   Colombia is one of our strongest allies in our neighborhood, in our neighborhood, fighting terrorism, reducing kidnappings, turning down violence in a very tough neighborhood. They need and want the support of the United States of America, and we are rejecting that support. Yet, today, Colombia is able to sell its products and goods into America. When we try to do the same for our farmers or our manufacturers or our small businesses, we are not allowed to.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think we are missing a historic opportunity to change the paradigm to really help workers get into a living wage for the long term. The fact is, an increase to $7.25 an hour will still leave a single mom with a child at or near poverty. And there is no doubt that a video store owner in Texas or anywhere else with five workers, when faced with a $25,000 increase in payroll and no chance they are going to rent that many more videos, are going to look at whether they can afford all those workers. 
   Remembering well the minimum wage jobs I held when younger and also having worked hard to make a small business payroll, I think we need new thinking. America's goals should not be to raise the minimum wage; our goals should be to get workers off it and into good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on. 
   So rather than recycle the same 60-year-old arguments, why don't we help workers break out of the minimum wage trap? Rather than raise the minimum wage, let employers create education debit cards where workers can take those debit cards to the local community college or the trade schools so they can get a real job. Let business and professions, whole industries contribute to those debit cards so we can train workers for the jobs of today which are crying for many American workers. And since Congress is eager to do this pay raise on someone else's dime, let small businesses deduct and receive credit those dollars, receive a tax credit for their education contributions above the current state of minimum wage.     
   In effect, rather than a jobs bank, create a skills bank for workers in the 21st century. Give workers an opportunity to get out of a struggling job that leads nowhere and give businesses the skilled workers they need to compete and win against international competition. We have done it before with welfare. The Republican Congress and Democrat President worked together. We sent a strong signal we would no longer give up on workers, relegating them to a subsistence living generation after generation. We ought to do it again. 
   I oppose this bill.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I know that good people disagree on this war, but, in my heart, this bill betrays our troops, ensures defeat and guarantees that when our fighting men and women come home to America, the terrorists will follow. 
   This bill cannot stand on its merits, but is brought with promises of spinach and peanuts and pork. 
   Not content to let our soldiers win this war, this bill instead substitutes a brilliant military strategy that gives our enemies this timetable: America will raise a white flag next year, but if you fight harder, we will quit sooner. 
   Thank God General George Washington wasn't hamstrung with such brilliance. 
   After the attacks of 9/11, I recall our enemies predicting America did not have the backbone or the will to persevere in this war. This bill proves them right. 
   On Monday, we buried one of our heroes in our community, Private First Class Cory Kosters. As I witnessed the remarkable courage and faith of his family, as I watched his flag-draped coffin presented at the National Veterans Cemetery surrounded by his friends and airborne brothers saying their final good-bye, I promised myself I will not quit on our soldiers, I will not quit on their mission. I will not guarantee America's defeat, nor allow future generations of Americans to live in terror because we lack the courage and conviction of the greatest generations that preceded us.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Joint Economic Committee on behalf of our senior ranking Republican, the Honorable Jim Saxton, I rise today to oppose the Democrats' irresponsible budget resolution that will only pave the way for major tax increases and hurt the economy. 
   You may recall that 15 months ago, Democrats took over the control of the House and the Senate vowing a new direction for America, and in truth, we've experienced that. Since Democrats took control of both Chambers, food prices are up, college tuition is up, health care costs are up, fuel prices are way up, unemployment is up, the deficit is up. 
   They vowed that they would do three things: They would pay every dime of this war, not mortgage the future. How much have they paid? Zero. They vowed they would not raise the debt limit. In fact, they called it immoral when we did it. So they did it very quietly without a vote in the first 60 days they were in control. And they vowed that they would pay as you go, that they would not allow any tax increases or relief to go forward without paying for them, and, of course, they failed at that as well. 
   And now we are at a time when the economy is on the brink of a severe downturn. The last thing we should be doing is telling Americans to expect to pay billions more in taxes in just 2 short years; $683 billion worth, the largest single tax increase in American history. That averages out to almost $3,000 per family every year. And I know $3,000 doesn't sound like a lot in Washington, DC, where we squander billions, but for families back in Texas, and I think most middle class families, that is far too much to bear, especially with prices being what they are. 
   I guess the question we always have, those of us who believe we ought to have lower taxes and less spending, is why does the Democrat budget insist that families tighten their belt but they don't do anything to tighten the belt up here in Washington? 
   Our public wants us to spend more wisely, not more. And they believe tax is too high. This budget is just the opposite.     
   I don't know of any economist that thinks tax increases are good for an economy in an economic slowdown, and the timing now is particularly bad. Our economy has suffered some serious shocks: Skyrocketing oil prices, the housing meltdown and mortgage crisis. We certainly don't need another one from here in the Halls of Congress. 
   And I have to tell you, too, I enjoy hearing about all the class warfare issues. So, we just asked an independent source, the Congressional Budget Office, are the rich getting richer under President Bush? They say the facts are just the opposite. Quoting from them, the period between 2000 and 2005 has not been a time of surging income inequality. Instead, the income gains of the top wealthy 1 percent actually slowed during this period. In contrast, between 1992 and 2000, President Clinton's years, the average income of the top 1 percent skyrocketed by 84 percent. So the king of inequality is President Clinton. They just want to try to hang it on President Bush.  
   And if you look at the charts, again by the independent Congressional Budget Office, it shows that for middle-class America, aftertax household income actually increased, the highest level since they've been recording these values. 
   And if you take a look at the total effective tax rate, what we've seen as well is that the tax rates and the cost for middle-class Americans has gone down to a historic rate as well. So, they are earning a record amount of income. They are paying a record fewer amount of taxes. And so middle-class families in America are trying to battle these high prices that this new Democratic Congress is bringing us by trying to keep just a little more of what they earn. 
   A major tax increase now, when Americans are planning for the future, will only add fuel to the fire and threaten to throw us deep into a recession. You only have to take out a history book to remember the tax increases imposed during the 1930s worked to worsen economic conditions during that time. And the economic growth in the 1990s came about because of spending restraint, and then what turned out to be an artificial economy. But Democrats, as I've said, would like the American public to believe that these tax hikes will only affect the wealthy. Let me tell you, it's going to affect middle-class America. They are dead wrong. 
   These tax increases the Democrats propose, the largest tax increase in American history, will affect real working families. Any individual that gets married, that has children, that receives maybe a nest egg from their small business or the family farm, maybe makes a good investment, saves for retirement, all of them, all of you will pay more in taxes. Is this what the American people want or deserve? And the answer is no. 
   Today, while we have Democrats say they are shooting at the wealthy 1 percent, what they are really hitting is middle class America because, as I said before, the rate of taxes paid for by the wealthy 1 percent is actually growing. What we need to do is keep taxes low for middle-class America. Those tax hikes will hurt workers and small businesses, the very people we need investing and growing, by taxing them an average of 12 percent more than we do now. That's 12 percent less money that they can keep to grow their business or invest in their company or maybe create another new job here in America. And unfortunately, raising those taxes is a big incentive for companies to move investments overseas instead of here at home. It's bad enough this Congress has tried to outsource U.S. energy jobs, now we're trying to outsource the rest of America's jobs as well. 
   And this Democrat budget, I can tell you, does not provide funding to keep the State and local sales tax deduction in place. They don't have any money for the research and development tax credit. They don't even have any money for the college tuition tax credit. What they say is, we endorse this tax relief. We endorse it. That's like having your son come to you and ask for allowance and you tell him, I don't have any money, but I endorse your idea of an allowance. 
   The Republican budget actually budgets for that tax relief to make sure that families aren't punished, middle-class families aren't hurt by $3,000 more every year of new taxes. And what we say is Washington ought to tighten its belt before we ask American families to tighten theirs. 
   And I'll tell you, too, not only does the Democrat budget raise the deficit, but this budget fails greatly and does not address serious entitlement reform, which is critically needed if we are to sustain Medicare and Social Security for future generations. 
   It ignores the inevitable and punts the problem down the road. Instead of making the tough choices today, which is what the American public wants, their budget is long on words, but short on action. They call on experts to develop ``options'' and saying that action is ``needed.'' More words, no action, and the problem gets bigger. 
   In just 7 short years, entitlement spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will consume nearly two-thirds of our entire Federal budget, and then it gets worse. These programs will grow to such a size that they will be equal to the cost of the entire Federal Government today, and Americans will have to pay twice the taxes just to keep it in place. 
   Our economic growth is at risk in this Democrat budget. It makes it more unfair for middle class America; it ignores Social Security and Medicare, which we need to make solvent and preserve once and for all; it raises the deficit; and it basically turns a blind eye to American families who are struggling to make ends meet with rising costs the way they are. 
   And they all say, well, we endorse the tax relief you have today. Well, Republicans don't endorse it, we embrace it. We include it. We pay for it. And we do balance the budget. And you know what we do? We make a huge sacrifice. We ask Washington to just slow spending by 3 percent. That's all we do. We're not asking to cut major programs. We're not asking for major sacrifices. We're saying, before you force our families to pay $3,000 more a year, why don't you just tighten your belt just a little, just 3 percent over the next 5 years. That's all we do to balance this budget. That's the smart way to balance the budget. That's the fair way, especially for middle class families. And for our economy, it's the smart way to revive jobs, to create a strong economy, and keep jobs growing in America. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would make the point that this new Democrat leadership promised to pay for this war. They vowed riding into office that's what they would do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I thank the gentlelady. 
   I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   I don't know where those fairy tales come from, I don't mean from the gentlelady, but some of these special interest groups. But I'm looking at the budget, page 37, I look at this title III called ``reserve funds.'' It doesn't have any money in it, but it is called ``reserve funds.'' It is empty. It says they have all these reserve funds for tax relief, middle-income tax relief, alternative minimum tax relief, higher education, and sales tax deduction. 
   Here is the problem: I then turn to the page where the line item is for these reserve funds, and it is zero. It is zero in the budget. All these tax cuts that are so important for families and small businesses will go away. In fact, if you ask the question, will those taxes increase in order to balance the Democrat budget? The answer is absolutely yes. Absolutely yes. 
   And the reason you know this is that every independent organization from government who has examined this budget knows and states, we will see the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Let us get down to this point, though. We do have common ground, the Republicans and the Democrats, on balancing the budget. There is no question about it. We believe it needs to be done. Here is the difference between the two parties. Republicans believe that we should not raise taxes on families and small businesses, that we should have spending restraint, just a small amount, 3 percent, Washington tighten its budget belt before families do, we tackle Social Security and Medicare in a meaningful way to preserve it, and we enact a 1-year moratorium on frivolous earmarks so we can stop using those hippie museums and the bridges to nowhere and those just embarrassments of spending, that we can go back and come up with a commonsense way of do it in moderation. 
   The Democrat budget has a different approach. You may like it. They raise taxes about $3,000 on every family every year in America. They have higher spending, the largest spending budgets in American history. There is no action to preserve Social Security or Medicare, and earmarks continue unabated. And we have already seen the results of this in the past year. When Republicans held control of Congress, we spent too much. We spent too much, and the deficit got as high as $412 billion in 2004. It was wrong. Every year we have whittled it down, until the last Republican budget was $162 billion deficit. That is better than half, but that is not good enough. And in the 1-year budget Democrats have had, they have more than doubled, $357 billion deficit projection according to the Congressional Budget Office, and this year's deficit may be larger than that. The compass is going in the wrong direction. America doesn't need to have their taxes raised. Washington needs to tighten its belt, especially before we ask our families to tighten their belt. We need to tackle Social Security and Medicare. We need to call a time-out on these frivolous earmarks. And we need some spending restraint that the American people believe that we can do. 
   This is a bad budget for the values and the future of America. It harms our families and small businesses and resorts to budget gimmicks. It will never be a balanced budget. The Republican alternative is a sensible one that will do that the right way. The right choice is the Republican budget. 
   With that, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this bill does do some good things, no question. It does focus on renewable energy, providing incentives for plug-in hybrid vehicles. It encourages energy-efficient homes and appliances in buildings. All of that is very good. We need to be more green as a country, and we need to have a balanced portfolio. Without question. But this is, I think, an extreme way, in some ways even a vindictive way, to achieve it. 
   In this bill, we create a tax on suburban moms for buying Explorers to take their children around town. We punish American companies for creating jobs here in America. We punish them for creating energy here in the United States. 
   There are 1.8 million jobs related to energy. What this bill does is encourage outsourcing. It actually decreases production in the U.S. of oil and gas and punishes companies for investing in the United States, a tax break that was not singled out for oil and gas. In fact, 73 Democrats on this floor supported the investment in new manufacturing and new investment in the United States. 
   This bill increases dependence on foreign oil; cripples America's fledgling biodiesel industry. It kills a major renewable diesel problem. There is no nuclear, no hydrogen, no new refineries, no transmission lines, no coal-to-liquid, no clean coal technology. 
   But it does have a study on the carbon footprint of the American Tax Code, which surely ranks just below suing OPEC as an effective way to lower prices. 
   Whether you call this a ``$6 a gallon gas'' bill, a ``hug Hugo Chavez'' gas bill, a ``less energy'' tax bill, the fact of the matter is we all want a new direction. But we want a new direction away from higher prices. We want a new direction away from dependence on foreign oil. 
   The truth is, we have to get serious about lessening our dependence on foreign oil. Light bulbs alone won't do it. New production of oil and gas, along with these new renewables, will.

I don't mind double-counting, but there is something offensive about triple-counting. I think that is what got Enron in trouble in the first place. 
   Today we are using this as an excuse to raise taxes and cut jobs and cut energy production here. It is not fiscally responsible. 
   And by the way, the tax on SUVs is not Hummers. It is above $15,300, and that is a lot of Explorers and a lot of small business vehicles.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on the floor today that will provide additional tax relief to our Nation's veterans, especially those who are seeking to purchase a home. This bill updates current law to ensure that veterans who served after 1977 can qualify for low-interest home loans financed by the Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds. 
   Back home in Texas, this bill is going to enable Texas' Veterans Land Board to expand its existing low-interest loan  program to several thousand more Texas veterans, several thousand, helping a new generation of veterans own a piece of the American Dream. Our land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, a Marine veteran himself, does an excellent job supervising this program and reaching out to veterans. This bill is going to allow him, and our State, to help more veterans get into a home they can afford. My thought is for all the sacrifice our veterans make to defend our country, it is only right that we help them upon their return home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds, for your leadership on our economic issues here in Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, a principle that is before us today is that Congress should not be bailing out speculators, lenders, or investors who have behaved irresponsibly. 
   If you bought a home that is too big for you, that you couldn't afford from the get-go, or you were betting that property values would go up in your region, that's tough. 
   If you lent money without income or means of those who were borrowing it, or you preyed, you preyed on people who didn't know better and then churned their loan repeatedly, that's tough. If you purchased securities without determining if the loans underlying them were sound, that is your problem. That is not the taxpayers', that is not your next-door neighbor's problem. 
   We do have a role in Congress and it is this, to address this issue: One, we should make sure that there is available, affordable credit for creditworthy borrowers. We need to make sure that we prevent this from occurring again. And we need to punish, aggressively punish, the bad actors who have infected our entire American economy. 
   The proposal we have before us today is well intentioned, clearly. I think Republicans and Democrats agree on the need to help where we can. It is well intentioned. It is not particularly effective. I have my doubts that it will help much at all. It is too little, too slow, too unfocused. It is, as you would imagine, a typical Washington reaction. 
   For example, a provision to allow States to have more authority for low income housing. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, we need more of that. That housing likely, knowing the process that works here, in the State of Texas and others, it will probably be 3 years before anyone moves into housing of that caliber. Way too late for this problem. 
   The property tax deduction for seniors who don't itemize, you always want to help people with their property taxes. But is a retired person really going to take $350 and buy a new home or buy a foreclosed home in their neighborhood? Not likely. 
   Even the tax credit for first-time homebuyers, a part that, I think, the philosophy of which I really like. But this no-interest loan is structured so low, $7,500, it won't allow them to buy a home. There are not many $75,000 homes on the market. If it's only a 5 percent down payment, there are, truthfully, not very many $150,000 homes that are in the areas of America that actually have massive foreclosures. Those tend to be either in the depressed areas or in the high-value States where a lot of people did bet on rising property values.     
   So I like the philosophy of it. I don't think it will help much. Thankfully it won't hurt. It won't hurt. There are good things in this bill. The FHA modernization and the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac I think are exactly appropriate. 
   But if our goal is to make sure we have available credit for creditworthy borrowers, I think this bill is a poor alternative to the Hope Alliance, which is moving faster and more effectively today and covering more than 90 percent of those who have mortgages and could have problems, or has already worked with 1.4 million families who need help moving them into new loans or moderating the loan they have today. And they are doing that without taxpayers underwriting any potential loss. That is, I think, the approach that works best and is already proven to work. 
   I will finish with this. I have said that there is nothing patently offensive in the amendment from Ways and Means. In fact, again, I think it is well intentioned. But in the underlying bill by Chairman Frank, there is something that is especially offensive. 
   I come from Texas. Our region was destroyed in Hurricane Rita, a hurricane that was stronger than Hurricane Katrina. We lost 70,000 homes that were damaged or destroyed. We lost more than $1 billion of our timber industry, our main crop. We still have 10 percent of our families who haven't moved back to southeast Texas because they don't have housing. Yet in Chairman Frank's underlying bill, he creates an affordable housing fund and dedicates $500 million to Louisiana and Mississippi to help rebuild housing in those areas. And yet for the same hurricane, and Hurricane Rita, in the communities that actually took in the Katrina families as they fled that hurricane, and then those same families have their own roofs torn off in southeast Texas, this bill says, ``Drop dead. Forget it. We are going to help those who are on this side of the hurricane.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman from Michigan's leadership and keeping the focus of Congress on the Constitution, what roles we play of a limited government. 
   I don't know if you can remember what you were doing last Wednesday, but I do. Last Wednesday is what we call Tax Freedom Day. It's the first day of the year that you and I start working for ourselves and our families. From New Year's Day up to last Wednesday, April 23, we were working just to pay taxes to our State, local and Federal Government. 
   If you think about what an overtaxed Nation we are, think about your day. You wake up in the morning, grab a shower, you pay the water tax. You stop and grab a cup of coffee, you pay a sales tax. And take your car down to work, you pay gas taxes. At work you pay two taxes, an income tax and a payroll tax. You come home at the end of the day, you open the door, turn on the light, pay electricity tax, turn on the television, pay a cable tax, use your phone and pay a telephone tax, kiss your spouse good night and pay a marriage penalty tax.     
   And on and on and on. Every day the rest of your life. And then when you die, you pay a death tax. No wonder it is so hard for families to make ends meet in America these days especially with the prices being what they are. 
   And the only thing worse than how much we spend on taxes, especially those we send to Washington and Uncle Sam, is how poorly Washington spends our hard-earned dollars. I am convinced, Madam Speaker, that we make horrible use of the dollars our taxpayers give us. And I'm convinced that if Congress in Washington were a manufacturing plant, we would manufacture spending. That's what we were designed to do. If we want our government to manufacture savings and efficiency, we need to retool the plant. We need to change the way Washington works. 
   I have a proposal that does that. This is a bill that I introduced as a freshman bipartisan Member with my good friend, Congressman Jim Turner from Texas. Well, we came in together as freshmen. It is the Federal Sunset Act. And what it does is its goal is to abolish obsolete agencies and eliminate duplications within programs because we know we don't spend money wisely. What the commission does is, bipartisan, made up equally of Republicans and Democrats, mostly legislators, but it also includes four members appointed from the public, and basically what it does is it places an expiration date on every Federal agency and program where they have to justify their existence or face elimination. 
   They have to justify their existence not on what they were for created 80 years ago or 60 or 40 years ago, but they answer the question, Do they deserve our precious tax dollars to date? Ronald Reagan once said, The closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal program, and he is right. 
   The other thing, of course, is once created, Federal programs duplicate themselves. They clone themselves, it seems like. For example, we have more than 300 separate different economic development programs. We have more than 100 separate, different, or separate job-development programs. We have 64 different welfare programs. There are so many urban aid, inner-city programs, different ones, that we could get in a car once a week and visit one in a week, and it would take us nearly 9 years just to see those programs in that one year. We waste and duplicate too much of America's hard-earned money. 
   The Sunset Commission has worked now in over 24 States, so it's a proven method of cutting wasteful spending. In my home State of Texas over the years, it has abolished 54 State agencies, consolidated 12 more, and saved our taxpayers nearly $1 billion. That's  in one State. I'm convinced it can do even more in Washington. 
   Our government, unfortunately, for all of the good things it does, is too big and too fast. It needs to go on a diet. And the Federal Sunset Commission isn't a crash diet. It's a take-off-pounds-sensibly diet where each party, who seems to talk about wanting to balance a budget, who always wants to talk about cutting wasteful spending but won't act to do it, it gives both parties the responsibility and the ability to work together to streamline this big, bloated Federal Government so that a Tax Freedom Day, whether it is April 23 this year or if President Bush's tax cuts are to expire, which they shouldn't, we would actually work until May, the fifth month of the year, until we start working for ourselves. 
   It is important that if we want to have lower taxes, more freedom and use taxpayers' money wisely, we need to enact a Federal Sunset Commission and enact it today. And I think that is the constitutional role of this Congress is while we may collect the taxes, we have even greater responsibility to limit its use as a government and to make sure they're used as wisely and efficiently as possible. 
   And with that, again, the gentleman from Michigan has led the effort here among Republicans and among the Republican Study Committee to better define our Constitution and Congress' real role. I think these days, that's even more important we do that.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. For 30 years, picking up on what you just said, the public doesn't have to take my word for how inefficient we are, even your words, Mr. Garrett, about how inefficient it is. 
   Recently, the Office of Management and Budget assessed over a thousand Federal agencies. They determined that nearly one-quarter are simply not performing. These agencies account for nearly $123 billion annually in increased spending, in duplicative spending, in spending that no longer works or helps anyone. And I keep thinking, what would our families do with $123 billion of their own money that they're sending us and we're wasting? What could they do for the families? What dreams could they reach? What decisions would they make and not rely on government to do that? 
   I just think that all of this is about giving more faith in people than it is in government, and I think that's what our Founding Fathers intended this great Republic to be.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Well, if I may just follow up. You made, sir, I think a key component of why we need this. Right now in Washington today, if you try to abolish an agency that has outlived its usefulness or you question programs that duplicate themselves, there is always someone who jumps up and says, well, you know, I remember they've done some good things in the past. Almost impossible to do it. The Federal Sunset Commission changes that around and it basically says to the agency, you must justify your existence to taxpayers, not just to law makers, but to taxpayers themselves. You have to prove your value and worth and success. 
   When I served in the Texas legislature, what I saw was in the 2 years before an agency was sunset, it was amazing how responsive they became, how quickly they returned your phone calls, how responsive they were on their letters. Now they were under the mistaken belief that their customers were actually the legislature. Their customers are the taxpayers. I want to reintroduce customer service back into our government, and I want agencies to know that if they drift far away from their original mission, if they do not perform and produce, if they don't recognize that they work for the public, the public doesn't work for them, they work for the public, if they forget that, they need to understand that on a regular basis they will be held accountable for it. And I think that's a part of our government today. Unfortunately, that is missing. 
   One thing, too, I've noticed, my experience in sunsetting at State level, the gentleman from Utah mentioned it, is that programs that succeed, that do their job, spend their money wisely, perform and are responsive to the taxpayers, they do beautifully in the sunset. They have no problem at all. It is the programs that don't do any of those that struggle. And my belief is that we should fund constitutional programs that deliver quality services to our taxpayers, and not a dime for those who don't, not a dime for those who don't. And what's interesting, we've had one vote on the House floor in 12 years on this. Congressman Turner and I offered an amendment to a bill, and it passed with 272 votes, 2-1 margin. Now, the bill it was attached to eventually died, those things happen here in Washington, DC, but it showed us that there is support. 
   We put this issue of a Federal sunset bill on a national poll some years ago, we wanted to know how America felt about it. Seventy-seven percent of Americans across every region believed we need a Federal sunset act and we should hold agencies accountable to the taxpayers. And I believe that done wisely and done well, this could be an effective tool for shrinking the size of our government, using our tax dollars more wisely. And in a time of war, in a time of deficits, I think it's even more important for both parties to pull together, find new tools they can both use day in and day out to try to squeeze the absolute best out of every tax dollar that is sent to us. 
   And with that, I would yield either to the gentleman from Utah or the leader of this special hour, the gentleman from New Jersey.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Well, again, I would praise the gentleman from New Jersey for being a leader and the gentleman from Utah on trying to reinvent government, take it back to the features, take it back to its roots and make it work for us. 
   I was intrigued by the gentleman from New Jersey's comments about our Founding Fathers because I was reading one of the many books about Thomas Jefferson. And he sent a letter back to a colleague, as the third President of the United States, where he expressed frustration that he was already struggling to try to close down Federal programs that had already outlived their usefulness. This was our third President, and he was already fighting to do that. It tells you what a challenge we have. 
   But I am convinced that if both parties really mean it, that we can accomplish this. I think if we spent less time in Washington holding hearings on steroids and baseball, you know, if we spent less time promoting longer lasting light bulbs, and those are good, of course, but the priorities of this country, I think this Congress especially is disconnected from the real world, from what real families face. And when people are paying so much out of their paycheck and paying so much at the pump, it just isn't a responsibility to use their money wisely, it's an obligation. It's in the Constitution. It's in principle. It's really a case in morality. But we're taking people's money and wasting it. 
   I hope people who are watching tonight will call their Member of Congress and ask why aren't they in support of the Sunset Commission, why don't they get on the Sunset Commission and use their thoughts and ideas to trim this budget? Because I'm telling you, we have Members of Congress, both parties, who I think can do an excellent job, but we have to have the will and the backbone to do it first. And I again applaud the gentleman from New Jersey for being a leader on constitutional issues here in Washington.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I hoped to comment on the Democrat energy bill tonight, but it is still under construction in the back rooms. 
   What I don't understand is why this Congress, this Democrat Congress, stands in the way of the American people and does not allow a straight up-or-down vote on exploring for more energy here in America. 
   Our Republican plan is simple: use less energy, find more sources here in America, conserve more, bring the renewables online, but let's explore more for oil and gas in our deep ocean waters and arctic reserve. That's the only way we can have an affordable bridge to the future. We can reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and again, give some help to the families and small businesses and school districts across this country who are suffering because of high gas prices. 
   Now is the time to act. Now is the time. We need a straight up-or-down vote.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for the RECORD, there is only one party that fought hard to make sure our seniors had life-saving drugs, even though our colleagues across the aisle had 8 years of the White House and control of the Senate and never brought a bill to the floor to help our seniors with their medicines. 
   And I'd point out that while many lobbyists in Washington support this bill, I've not heard from one hospital, not one nurse, not one physician, not one senior who supports this bill. 
   380,000, that's how many Texas elderly will likely lose their personal Medicare plan as a result of this bill. 107,000, that's how many seniors in the Houston-Beaumont-Huntsville region will see serious cuts in their Medicare Advantage plan, or be forced into other plans with less health care coverage as a result of $50 billion of unnecessary and drastic Medicare cuts. 
   This is kid care versus Medicare. And only in the poisonous environment of Washington do politicians pit children against their grandparents. It is a cynical and a false choice that will leave many seniors stranded without the health care plan that fits their needs. 
   I, like others, support covering more children for health insurance, but not at the expense of elderly. 
   I sit on the committee charged with preserving Medicare, keeping seniors healthy; and these Medicare Advantage plans are the preferred plan for many of our Texas elderly. They're especially critical to our rural and low-income and minority seniors because they provide a comprehensive plan with medicines and emphasis on prevention. 
   I also believe that before Congress expands CHIP to higher-income families, it should first help the children of low-income families which the program was designed to serve. Maybe we should subsidize the coverage for the bank president's kids, but shouldn't we first help the health care for the bank teller's kids? 
   Texas, like many States, barely covers half of the children already eligible for this; and, as a Congress, our goal should be to cover the children of working poor first.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, we have had a lot of debate tonight about the need for the affordable housing fund. This amendment relates to what I hope will be the fairness of the affordable housing fund. Right now in the first year the allocation for the affordable housing fund is restricted to Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, but only in Louisiana and Mississippi. 
   This is Hurricane Rita, the fourth largest hurricane in the gulf coast history. It was actually larger than Hurricane Katrina. On the Texas side, the area that I represent, as you can see here, we had 70,000 homes damaged or destroyed. That is 70,000 homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Rita. 
   Today, 18 months after that hurricane, what no one in America knows is that 10 percent of those who fled Hurricane Rita have yet to return to southeast Texas. Ten percent have not come home because they have no home in southeast Texas. 
   What this amendment does is provides a fair treatment for Texas communities devastated by Hurricane Rita. It takes the principle, same hurricane, same devastation, we should have same treat. 
   Under this amendment, Louisiana and Mississippi would still receive the bulk of the allocation at 70 percent and 20 percent, and Texas would be eligible for 10 percent. My preference would be to not take a dime from Louisiana and Mississippi. I understand how devastated those communities are. But I have seen the devastation in our southeast Texas communities. Our roofs are torn off and our homes are destroyed. Our people can't come back to their communities because there is no housing. And these counties are predominantly Democratic, poor, with heavy African American populations. Ironically, these were the same counties across the Louisiana line who were the very first to open their homes and shelters and churches to those fleeing Hurricane Katrina. Yet today, they can't rebuild their own homes, they can't return to their own communities because this is often called ``the forgotten hurricane.'' 
   What I am hopeful is that the current allocation is an oversight. And the fact of the matter is that the national media moved over so quickly over Hurricane Rita that not many people understand just how badly the communities were devastated. 
   I am hopeful that the majority will agree with me that we don't divide a hurricane along State lines and don't provide different treatment for the same hurricane for the same communities. Where we don't have homeowners in Orange whose homes have been destroyed with no help, but their cousin down the road in Lake Charles gets the help they deserve. That is not what this government is about. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment. We ought not have two classes of citizens in America: Those who have help from hurricanes and  those who are left stranded. I think this Congress is better than that.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the arguments that my friend from Louisiana has made, but I think it is important to understand that you can't tell someone in one State, your home is destroyed, your roof has been torn off, a tree has gone through it; but you are in this State, so we will help you. The exact same hurricane and the exact same devastation, forget it, take a hike. You deserve no help from us.     
   I don't think any citizen in America who has seen their home destroyed ought to have to compete against someone else in another State to get Federal help. I mean, aren't we supposed to be treating our citizens equally? 
   And when you have a hurricane that's devastated both sides of the State line, why are we dividing that hurricane along the State line? Mother Nature can't do it, and Congress shouldn't either. 
   We should help those people, regardless. One hurricane, same treatment, same devastation. I think we have a moral responsibility to help people who no longer can return to their homes, whether it is in New Orleans or whether it is in Orange, Texas. We have the exact same moral responsibility to help, and I cannot see how we, as a government, can justify different treatments, treating one group as second-class citizens when they've done nothing but suffer devastating damage and open their own homes and hearts and churches to help others. It is wrong. 
   Let's not divide this hurricane along State lines. Let's help these folks.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia giving me a few minutes. 
   I don't know anyone who would support a housing fund that turns its back on your citizens who were devastated by the fourth largest hurricane in gulf coast history. I also don't understand a Congress that has citizens compete against each other who have both lost their homes, who aren't just living in trailers. 
   My people, maybe we have 1,700 living in trailers, but we have another 10 percent who don't live in trailers who can't even come back to the communities that they used to live in, can't even come back. They're not living in trailers. They've moved away. They can't come back because there is no housing. 
   Their only fault apparently is that they were on the wrong side of the State line for the exact same hurricane, and it seems to me I would prefer not to pick a 70 percent, a 20 percent, a 10 percent figure. I wish there were a better way to do it. 
   But I do know this. We ought not pit families against each other for competing for dollars that they all need and provide one on one State line all the help they can get and another, we just turn their back. 
   I know how much this has harmed Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. There's no question about the need there. What I'm saying, there is an equal need for each family in southeast Texas who are poor, who are predominantly Democratic counties, heavily African American communities, the ones who rely and need this housing. I just think this body ought to look at all of them equally to provide that help if we can do it. 
   Perhaps this body will turn its back on these people. Well, I will tell you what, when it came to Hurricane Katrina, they didn't turn their back on the evacuees from New Orleans. One little town of 500 took in 500 evacuees on the very first night, doubled their whole population just to help. We had folks in Orange who stayed up for 72 hours straight helping people from New Orleans on buses who had lost everything and lost families. These are the same people we're turning our backs on tonight. 
   I don't know what the allocation is, Mr. Chairman, a fair one is. I honestly don't. I do know that we ought to provide equal help and equal hope to these communities devastated by the exact same hurricane.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, it is bad enough that Congress continues to play politics with the war, now they are playing politics with little kids.

It's a cop-out to all the political hacks in Washington who want to spend 2 weeks covering your television sets and our newspapers and radio airwaves with their misleading ads rather than sitting down with us. 
   Meanwhile, the working poor who are parents are wondering if they are going to have any insurance for their kids past Christmastime. It doesn't have to be this way. I was here in Congress when we started this program. We sat down together with President Clinton and worked out a good program. There are a lot of us Republicans willing to do the same today.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his leadership on trade issues. 
   I too rise in support of this bill. I think it is important for Peru to have the transition time to enact the free trade agreement we just worked on. It is important to buy additional time for us to discuss and ultimately pass the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. And I think it is important for our friends in Bolivia and Ecuador to understand that these preferences are temporary, that we want a full trading partnership with them, and it is important that they take concrete steps to move toward the types of signals and improvements in their country, in government, that would allow us ultimately to move to a full partnership for free trade. 
   When we began this trade agreement, trade preferences in the 1990s, our hope was to create jobs away from drug trafficking in these countries, and it has worked. Millions of jobs have been created benefiting not just the Andean region, but the American workers as well. But this bill is no substitute for a free trade agreement with Colombia. Today we are allowing these countries to sell duty-free, almost without restrictions, into the United States, competing against our workers. We are doing that to help pull them toward democracy, to stimulate their economy, to move them away from narcotrafficking. And it is working. But what we want ultimately is two-way trade. We want the ability of our factory workers, our plant workers, our steelworkers in Texas, for example, today they can go down to the store and buy products from Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador but when we try to sell the products they produce overseas, we are not allowed to. The barriers exist. How is that free trade? How is that fair to the American workers? It is to me irresponsible for us to not take up the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. This is a country with a growing economy. It is a strong ally to the United States. It has made remarkable progress on labor violence. They are in the midst of a civil war. And President Uribe is taking commendable steps, strong leadership steps to solidify that country, to bring democracy and the rule of law, to prosecute those violators. He has made remarkable progress in quelling violence against labor leaders. And indeed unions, productive unions in Colombia support this free trade agreement. For those who believe America is going it alone far too much in the world, it is incomprehensible we would go it alone without Colombia, that we would leave them, walk away from our commitments in that region. It is vital both from an economic standpoint and vital from a security standpoint that we take up and pass the Colombian Free Trade Agreement this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to burst anyone's rhetorical bubble here, but this is not a new direction in energy. We ought not oversell this bill. It has some good things we all support, renewable investments and renewables for wind and solar and biomass, hydro and others, which are really good, but 90 percent of this bill is just an extension of what is already in law today. 
   The only new direction in this bill is that we are outsourcing American energy jobs and raising prices at the pump. 
   A couple years ago, Congress, worried about too many jobs going overseas, sat down and worked out a new Tax Code that said if you invest, produce, and create jobs here in America, we will give you a lower tax rate than if you do the same overseas. What this bill does is it singles out one American industry, the energy industry, and says no, but not for you. We are going to treat your jobs like foreign jobs. We are going to treat your investments like foreign investments. We are going to treat you as foreign companies, just so we can take your money. 
   Here we are, almost 2 million American energy jobs at risk, people who have mortgages, have children, are day-to-day doing good work providing us energy, all of a sudden they don't matter anymore. As a result, here we are, facing recession, job losses in America, Michigan, Ohio, and across this country, and we are willing to outsource our American jobs overseas for a political exercise. 
   The result of this bill, there will be less investment in American energy, there will be less production of American energy, we will have more dependence on foreign oil, and we will have higher fuel prices. 
   Make no mistake, politicians are shooting at Big Oil, but they are hitting American energy workers and they are hitting families in the pocketbook. Whenever there is no argument left, you will hear this: ExxonMobil is making record profits. You will hear it over and over again. 
   Well, politicians in Washington ought to hold a mirror up to find out why there are record profits. We have locked off reserves in the gulf and ANWR. We have locked off oil shale. We are killing coal. We are chasing American energy deeper and deeper into costly offshore areas. 
   More and more of the world's oil reserves are held in unstable governments: Russia, Venezuela, Iran. No wonder prices are so high. The world knows Americans won't take responsibility for its own energy needs, won't explore in stable governments like ourselves, so the American public is paying a political tax at the pump because we won't take responsibility for our own energy needs. 
   What this Congress has done to lower fuel prices: allowed people to sue OPEC, promoted longer-lasting light bulbs, and, to their credit, directed higher fuel mileage, which is good for everyone but American automakers. 
   The false choice today is punish American energy, or renewable energy. No. This country needs to do both. Invest in America's traditional energy supply and go after new energy.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, it's appropriate that we talk about a $600 toilet seat because, indeed, this bill smells to high heaven. 
   The truth of the matter is you will hear a lot of wild claims made on the House floor today, but in truth the Joint Taxation Committee, Congressional Budget Office, and every other independent agency has testified that passing this bill will cost the American taxpayers more than $1 billion. It is a testament that this program is working and will continue to work to save dollars for the American taxpayer by going after those who owe their taxes on behalf of those of us who pay our taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 3056. This bill would eliminate a program that is actually making money for the government: overdue tax bills collected by qualified private companies from people that owe too little for the IRS to use up valuable resources in going after them. To date, the IRS has turned over 90,000 cases worth nearly half a billion dollars. And the dollars add up to the tune of $32 million collected since last month, and there's more to come. As I said, more than $1 billion over the next decade. 
   This is money that is helping to close the tax gap and is revenue that the Treasury Department can use to hire more employees. Under the program the IRS can retain up to a quarter of the collection to hire additional enforcement workers, and already some $5.7 million has been designated by the IRS for collection activities and $20 million has gone toward deficit reduction. So it is helping reduce the Federal deficit. 
   Some argue that collection agents have harassed taxpayers. The reality is that these agents are held to the same standards as IRS employees when it comes to protecting taxpayer rights. As a matter of fact, out of 51,000 cases, it was testified at our recent Ways and Means Committee hearing there were no, zero, violations of taxpayer privacy, zero. 
   These companies do face difficulties in finding the correct person, as the IRS does not provide the collectors with the taxpayers' last known phone numbers. This might be an area to look for reforming, rather than killing, this important program. 
   Some argue that the IRS could collect the same debts more cheaply if they could hire more employees. But the truth of the matter is these taxpayers have already been contacted four times by the IRS and they have not had luck in collecting them.

And, again, we have IRS employees with the ability to levy liens and fines, they are able to compel certain types of taxpayers to pay efficiently, and they can go after the larger, more complex cases very well. It is this group here that we've had difficulty collecting taxes from in the past that these proven tax collectors across 40 States have done such a good job collecting. And that is the bottom line; are we going to collect the taxes of the American people or not?

And I do wish that those telephone tapes could be played here on the House floor so members of the public as well as Congress could hear the professionalism of those phone calls as they seek to identify sensitively the individuals who do owe dollars to the American taxpayers. 
   I will point out, too, that if these debts were so easy to collect by the IRS, why did the IRS already have four opportunities to collect them from each taxpayer before they were turned over to these agencies, who have done such a good job, a solid job of collecting them?

I point out as far as efficiency, you don't have to take anyone's word on this floor if this program is working. Attached to this bill is testimony that says eliminating it will cost the U.S. taxpayers $1 billion.     
   So you don't have to take our word for it. The experts who are independent, who have looked at this issue, know this is an efficient program for the U.S. taxpayers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   MR. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, our information is somewhat different from the information just propounded. We believe indeed the record would show there have been 83 complaints. These complaints include taxpayers who have  received letters with another taxpayer's information inside. Now, if this isn't a taxpayer privacy violation, I don't know what is. At least one fine has been assessed, and this is in the early going of the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will acknowledge perfection is a pretty hard standard to meet, but they have not met perfection and they have not generated the money in collection that was advertised at the beginning of this endeavor. 
   With that, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to my friend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), who has long had concerns about this initiative and worked hard to end it.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I will be brief, Mr. Speaker. 
   We hear a lot of claims today about the efficiency of this program. But our agencies, the independent agencies, the Government Accountability Office and Joint Tax, make the point attached to this legislation that this program has worked, is working efficiently, and will save U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion. 
   You will hear today about abuses. But the fact of the matter is they can name not one in any independent agency, including the IRS, the Treasury. Examination of the program has showed 97 percent customer satisfaction, zero privacy violations, and zero Fair Debt Collection Act violations, zero, no matter what is talked about. 
   Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is, the question before us today is not about privatization. This is about credibility. This majority has talked about closing the tax gap, what is owed and what is paid. Yet today we will widen that tax gap by over $1 billion. So the question is will we walk the walk, or just talk the talk about the tax gap. 
   This partnership between the IRS and these private collection agencies is working for the American public. We ought to let it continue to work for the American public, because we can use that $1 billion for health care, for education, for helping our veterans, for a number of important priorities in this budget.     
   And we will have some type of a financial standoff here in a few months, yet we let $1 billion escape our grasp. I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it's sort of hard to listen to lectures about fiscal responsibility. For years Democrats have claimed that it is time to pay for this war; it's fiscally irresponsible not to pay for this war; it ought to be part of the budget. Have they paid for the war? No, not a dime. 
   For years they said it's irresponsible to raise the debt limit; it's all your fault; we cannot raise the debt limit. What did they do the first 2 months of this session? Raise the public debt limit. 
   For years they've said we need to pay for all our spending, pay for all our taxes. So what have they done? 
   I have a list of 27 different pay-fors that have been used multiple times already in this session. It's like using your home as collateral 27 different times. In the real world we call that fraud. 
   It's unfortunate we are here today. I honestly don't believe when Democrats created this tax in the 1960s that they intended ever to cover this many middle-class Americans. But it has happened. Republicans, to their credit, had killed the AMT in 1999, but President Clinton unfortunately vetoed it. Today it has gotten bigger and badder and worse than ever. It is appropriate that we move to both freeze and then to repeal the alternative minimum tax. But there are real serious problems with this bill. 
   Paying for a temporary tax of 1 year with a permanent tax is just, again, fiscally irresponsible. It is like taking a loan out to pay for a cheeseburger. 
   This bill ignores the need to continue tax relief for States that have State and local sales tax deductions, for college tuition tax credits, for research and development tax credits, even for teachers who take classroom supplies and pay for them out of their pockets, we're not addressing their needs. And those all expire at the end of this year. 
   Finally, I think it is a mistake to raise taxes in order to prevent a tax increase. What we ought to be doing is we ought to be sitting down together, Republicans and Democrats, figuring out a way to thoughtfully and carefully trim this budget, this big, fat, bloated, obese budget up here so we don't increase taxes. Before Washington asks families to tighten their belt, we ought to sit down and tighten our belt first. 
   This is a bad bill, a fiscally irresponsible bill, and I urge opposition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Dreier. And thank you for your leadership. I'm glad to join all the Members here tonight on this important issue. 
   The reason this country is so dismayed by the action last week is that it was such a huge loss for American jobs, for security in our hemisphere, and a big loss for America's prestige around the world.     
   Colombia's a remarkable trading partner, as you have noted. They are a remarkable study and model in progress, in democracy, and human rights, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps by rule of law and freedom of speech and freedom of trade, all the American traits that you have to admire. They're in our backyard. They're in our hemisphere. A remarkable trading partner. 
   I think last week many in America wondered just what happened to this great country. Who could imagine that America, with the world's largest economy, would cower from Colombia behind walls of protectionism? Who could imagine the world's strongest democracy would be afraid to even debate, even consider this agreement? And who could imagine, by changing the rules after we had already shaken hands and signed an agreement, that we would send a signal to the rest of the world that we are no longer not even a reliable trade leader in this world but we are not even reliable negotiators, that our word, our bond, our agreements mean nothing? 
   And the loss in jobs, as you know, America is wide open, Mr. Dreier. As you know, we can buy anything from almost any country anywhere we want in our communities.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. But when we try to sell our goods and services around the world, we find too much of it blocked. As we have said before, it's not enough anymore to just buy American. We have to sell American. We have to sell our goods and services throughout the world. But when we do, we find so much of the world is closed off, locked away from us. 
   Colombia, a great partner, has been selling their goods and services into America since 1991, but we face real barriers when we try to do the same, and this trade agreement creates that two-way trade. 
   For Texas I know it's critical. We're the largest seller of goods to Colombia. We sell about a little over a billion dollars a year in chemicals, construction, equipment and machinery and computers. And under this agreement we would sell another billion dollars of not only that but grapefruit and beef and financial services. A number of services our small businesses could sell into Colombia, our neighbor in the backyard and in our hemisphere. So we lost jobs here in America. 
   Colombia lost jobs because they lost a guaranteed market because by not acting, by changing the rules, they are now coming at a disadvantage to their neighbors, in Peru and Central American countries. So they actually lost ground from a jobs perspective. 
   And, finally, to turn our back on what a tremendous ally, as you have noted over and over, who has made such great progress, who we deserve to engage more and be a stronger partner with, not to turn our back on, it's a huge loss.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Yes. And he told us straight out, because we asked him, he said there is no thread, no direct or indirect thread at all, between the Colombian Government and any murders of anyone, much less union leaders. And he said what you've said, that this government has not only sat down to prosecute those who would commit violent crimes against union leaders but provides protection. In fact, it is safer to be a union leader in Colombia than just the general population might be. That is such an effort they have made. That government is providing a lower level of violence, a safer country for all citizens. 
   So the argument that they are targeting or that they are allowing it or just looking the other way is exactly  wrong, and the unions themselves told us that.

There have been a number of Democrat colleagues who have traveled to Colombia to see that remarkable progress firsthand, who have assessed it themselves rather than playing the politics of it, and who have been both public and private in their support for this agreement. I think all they would like is an up-or-down vote, a fair chance to debate this issue and bring it to the floor. I am confident with it would pass. And I am confident we would send a completely different signal to our allies like Colombia and the rest of the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I don't know what's being sold around here today, but there is nothing revolutionary about this bill. There are some good things in it, no question. But it is dangerously incomplete and it is tainted. 
   It includes a last-minute special interest provision that no one in America has ever had a chance to look at or consider. It is not revolutionary because it includes extensions of what's already law in America today, the research and development tax credit, that's so important to innovation America. The State and local sales tax deduction, important for families to deduct what they pay in sales taxes from what they owe Uncle Sam because sales taxes really add up fast, especially for younger families. Energy provisions, which are important for us to do renewable alternative fuels. All that is very good. Everyone supports it. 
   This bill is dangerously incomplete because it does not address a huge looming tax increase on most of middle class America. The alternative minimum tax, the second tax, that families find when they do their taxes or do their software for taxes, and they're okay, they don't owe Uncle Sam anything. We catch them with a second tax. And we said over the years that we'll do away with that. Republicans did do away with that second tax. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed it, and we live with it today. 
   This bill does nothing to stop the alternative minimum tax, the second tax, on American families, and we need to act now, not later to do that. 
   It is tainted because it includes a provision, $1.6 billion, a new tax break, for one special interest group, plaintiffs' attorneys with contingency fees. The wealthiest 1 percent of attorneys in America will receive $1.5 billion more of your money.

Yet we won't do more to help the refundable child tax credit. Those are single parents who are usually raising one or two kids and working several jobs. We offered the amendment. Instead of helping a trial lawyer buy a second private jet, why don't we help a waitress who's trying to raise her kids? Wouldn't that be a fair use of help and dollars? 
   So I oppose this bill. I believe we ought to do these extensions, and I believe this bill does not deserve support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, tonight, it is our opportunity to talk about the tax burden that families in America unfortunately must pay. 
   I am a six-term Member of Congress. I represent the Eighth Congressional District of Texas. It's a great district that encompasses a great deal of east Texas from the Louisiana border over to I-45. I live in The Woodlands, Texas, just north of Houston, with my wife and our two boys, a kindergarten son named Sean and a third-grader named Will, who goes to public school, Sally K. Ride Elementary School. We are  blessed to have a great school system in our community. 
   I have enjoyed serving on the Ways and Means Committee because for many years, as I've told my wife, I get to go to work each day trying to cut taxes from families and small businesses so they have less of a burden. It seems to me we have an overtax, and we are an overtaxed Nation. Most families pay more in taxes than they do for food and housing and clothing combined. Many families work, and most workers work into June and July, actually, after July 4th, before they have paid all their taxes. They don't start working for themselves until almost the seventh month of every year. 
   And just think about each of the days our families live. You wake up in the morning and you take a shower and you pay a water tax. If you get a cup of coffee, you pay a sales tax. If you drive to work, you pay a gas tax. At work you pay two taxes, an income tax and a payroll tax. You get home and turn on the lights, you pay an electricity tax. You turn on the TV, you pay a cable tax. Get on the phone, you pay a telephone tax. You get ready for bed and kiss your spouse and you pay a marriage tax. And you do this day in and day out for years until when you pass away, you pay a death tax.     
   We are an overtaxed Nation. This new Congress is bent on increasing that tax burden on America's families and those who create jobs. Already, this Congress has, in the House, approved over $110 billion, billion dollars, worth of new taxes. For those of us who believe the more you tax something the less that you get, what we are seeing is an all-out assault on jobs in America. We are taxing American energy workers. 
   This Congress seeks to tax American capital, American manufacturing, American small businesses, and tomorrow, this Chamber is set to take up two new tax increases: a major tax increase on the real estate partnerships of America who build our apartments and shopping centers, our office buildings and industrial parks, and another tax that would increase the tax on hardworking Americans who have scrimped hard and saved to buy a second home, maybe a retirement home for their family. 
   I am going to talk about this for just a minute, then I am joined with two of the leaders of the Ways and Means Committee who are going to talk about the alternative minimum tax, and we will talk about what is now called the ``mother of all tax hikes'' proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means, Charlie Rangel. 
   The two provisions I am talking about tomorrow that do not deserve to pass, one is a tax on the small partnerships that build America. Real estate partnerships are a routine, traditional, very responsible way to build facilities in our local community. This tax would tax those small businesses and partnerships, increasing their taxes $6.7 billion, billion, over the next 10 years. This tax increase is described by many as perhaps the most dangerous and risky tax increase on the real estate community since the 1986 tax law, whose changes drove many of our real estate into foreclosure, helped lead into the S&L, savings and loan credit problem, and will undoubtedly cost jobs in America. Some in Washington say, ``No, no, no. We are not targeting America's small business and real estate professionals. We are targeting Wall Street.'' The truth of the matter is that they are shooting at Wall Street; they are hitting Main Street. They are hitting our real estate partnerships, our energy partnerships, our venture capital and local groups that have done nothing wrong except build our infrastructure in our local community and help create jobs. 
   It is simply wrong, in my view, to tax these organizations. They are the traditional, predominate business model. This tax increase will not only cost jobs, it will cost construction jobs. It will harm property values and really lower government revenue at the local level. I think it is important that we not punish the real estate partnerships that are such an important fabric of our country. And why risk, why help drive more of this housing bubble? Why cause more problems for the real estate industry when, in truth, we can encourage more of this development? 
   The second tax increase we will face tomorrow, and I hope we will vote down, is a tax increase that hits small businesses, or actually hits families that have saved hard for a second home. It is proposed that we change the tax increase, the capital gains tax, on people who own a second home. Now, we did some research on this. What we discovered, a lot of people think this is the wealthy. We did research on it and discovered that 40 percent of all the home sales last year were to second homes, four out of ten home sales to second homes. And those who bought those homes weren't wealthy. According to the National Association of Realtors, on average, their income was about $82,000. They were buying a second home for their family. Some were investing for their retirement. Others have a favorite lake or river that they have always dreamed of having a cabin on or a lodge on and may have, in fact, done everything right. Many of them have scrimped on their first home so they could try to buy another for their dream in their retirement, for their family's quality of life. It seems to me when you look at punishing people who have worked hard to try to buy that home, we ought not do it. 
   When you look at the impact on your communities around the country, second home market's where it is very important to the local community. You see many of them in New England where you have buyers from New York, Washington, Philadelphia and all along the East Coast. You see many of them in California and in Florida where you naturally have retirees. But it is not limited to that. Arizona, North Carolina, all throughout the Midwest in areas where there are beautiful lakes and rivers and wide open spaces, then you have the high tech communities and others that invest in second homes. 
   It just seems to me that this is dangerous to discourage this type of investment. I think we risk in the future harming the property values in the communities that rely upon these resort-type of homes and vacation homes. It seems to me unfair that we would penalize and punish people who have worked so hard to save. We ought not be doing that. We ought to be rewarding that type of behavior. 
   My hope is that tomorrow as Congress or this U.S. House of Representatives considers these bills that, in fact, we reject these tax increases on the real estate partnerships that build America and reject tax increases on families that scrimped for a second home, maybe perhaps their dream home. 
   With that, I would like to yield to the ranking member, the highest ranking Republican on the Trade Subcommittee on Ways and Means. This gentleman is from California. He is a conservative who has led the fight for tax relief in many areas throughout the years here in Congress. And I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Herger).

In fact, the best solution is if you look at the next 10 years of spending in America, our government will spend nearly $50 trillion over the next 10 years. And I think many of us believe that rather than finding excuses to add tax burden to American families and small businesses, we ought to sit down together, both parties, and see if we can identify less than a trillion dollars of that.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for pointing out we do have a choice between higher taxes and tightening our belt here in Washington, D.C. 
   As a Republican, as a conservative, I'm convinced that the reason Republicans got fired from their job of leading Congress is that we didn't balance the budget. We didn't secure the border. We didn't lead with integrity. And I think it is a fair criticism that we should have done much better in getting a handle of this spending machine that we call Washington, D.C. 
   However, I hear all the time the reason we have record debt and the record public debt is because of our tax increases or tax relief spending and we did not pay for the war. 
   The truth of the matter is we are having record revenue here in America. After 9/11, during the recession and after 9/11, we actually saw a decrease in revenue the first time in years, not slowing, a decrease. We put in place tax relief to help spur the economy, create new jobs. Our thought was we want to create jobs around America, leave the money in the pockets of Americans so it can work around Main Street and the shopping centers and go to work, and it has done that. We've had 7 million new jobs created over the last few years, record revenues, double digit revenues coming in to Washington. Our problem is not our revenues. Our problem is spending. 
   We hear criticism that Democrats do not support tax relief or the new spending and they would have paid for the war. But the truth of the matter is the first President's tax relief was $1.3 trillion that Republicans proposed. Democrat tax relief was $1.2 trillion tax relief that they voted. 
   The second major tax reform, the Jobs Creation Act 2004 was passed overwhelmingly with nearly 80 Democrat Members joining in that tax relief. The spending on recovering New York from 9/11 was bipartisan, overwhelming. The spending on Katrina and Rita was bipartisan and overwhelming. Medicare, the Democrat Medicare plan was three times as large as the Republican plan. 
   In fact, all of the spending bills the Republicans proposed that Democrats opposed, they opposed not because they were too small, but they weren't high enough. 
   And so what we are faced today with is a choice between raising taxes to balance the budget. We're tightening our belts, working together, Republicans and Democrats, and I know up here that seems to be a poisonous thing to do. But the truth of the matter, I think most Members of both parties would like to balance this budget as best we can, as soon as we can. I don't think we ought to increase taxes to do it. There are better ways.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, let's check the facts. The facts are the only reason we're here today is because the Democrat Congress created this alternative tax. The only reason we're here today is because a Democrat President, Bill Clinton, vetoed the repeal of this alternative tax. That's why we're here today. 
   As for being fiscally responsible, let's check the facts for just this year alone. For years, Democrats have said it is irresponsible not to pay for this war; it's irresponsible to borrow for this war. This year, they have spent, with our support, billions of dollars for this war and didn't pay for a dime. 
   The majority leader stood on this floor and said it was fiscally irresponsible to raise the debt limit; yet they did it in the first 60 days in their own budget. 
   This year they have used multiple pay-fors, the same pay-fors, more than 20 times on different bills; just this week, the same pay-for on two different bills within 24 hours. That's like using your house for collateral over and over and over for different loans, which is called fraud, and they've even used budget gimmicks by directing our own budget office to assume there will be no terrorist attacks for the next 5 years so they can avoid their own PAYGO rules. 
   PAYGO, the way it is working this year is a sham. A sham. Being lectured on fiscal irresponsibility by this Democratic Congress is like being lectured on parenting by Britney Spears; it makes no sense at all. 
   What we need to do is sit down together and find a way to cut this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if you lose your job and lose your home or are forced to sell at a loss, only in America do you get a bill, a tax bill from Uncle Sam for forgiven debt. Having witnessed this during the terrible Texas recession of the 1980s, it is nothing less than shooting the financially wounded. There's no question this is long past time to correct this unfairness. 
   I applaud the authors of this bill, Representatives LEWIS and ANDREWS, and all of those who have helped bring this to the floor today. There is serious question, however, about the way we pay for it. 
   Raising taxes on the sales of second homes unfairly taxes families who live in one city, but are forced to work in another, and couples who have scrimped their whole lives to enjoy a retirement home they dreamed of.     
   It is a poor way to fund this bill. 
   This $2 billion tax hike unfairly punishes those who make their house payments to help those who can't or who find themselves in a bad situation. It's a false choice, completely unrelated to each other. And yet those who profited millions of dollars from the sale of predatory and risky loans walk away unscathed. What type of accountability is that? 
   Because this pay-for has had no real study, no in-depth analysis by Congress, I and others worry there may well be unintended consequences that damage the value of second homes and, in the long run, not today but in the long run, harm lake communities, vacation communities, and retirement communities around the Nation whose economies are dependent upon these types of homes. 
   There are better ways to offset the tax cost of this bill, including raising more than $1 billion simply by allowing government workers in 457 plans to have the option of a Roth-style IRA, an option available to millions of workers in the private sector. 
   I am hopeful that before this bill goes to the President's desk that a change is made, whether that recommendation or another. This is an important measure to help those who are losing their homes or are in a bad situation. There is surely a fairer, more thoughtful way to pay for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which would provide a short-term extension of current trade preferences to our Andean neighbors. 
   I have always supported the Andean trade program designed to help create alternative jobs and economies to those in the drug trade and to offer hope to these nations. 
   And it has worked. Millions of jobs have developed in the region in the flower industry, in agriculture, all that contribute to stabilization and economic growth, all of which are in America's interest. 
   But preferences which are one-way trade into America aren't permanent. They aren't designed that way because they matter. The impact on American asparagus farmers, which has shrunk by a third as a result of these preferences is a good example. And that's why it's imperative that we work with our Andean neighbors to transition to two-way free trade agreements that balance and strengthen our relationships. 
   Not only is two-way trade fair, but it benefits all parties by encouraging more permanent investment in nations where rule of law, property rights, democracy and higher labor environmental standards are insisted upon. This helps create even more jobs in the legitimate market, more so than the preferences do today. 
   As an example, Peru's legislature today voted to amend our agreement that incorporates important labor and environmental provisions negotiated by Chairman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery and others. 
   Approving the pending free trade agreements with partners Peru and Colombia have significant security and foreign policy implications as well by strengthening our hand against President Chavez in Venezuela and his corrosive influence in the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support the preference extension. We shouldn't disrupt current trade flows or hurt our friends in the region whose livelihoods depend upon this program, but we need to move forward in a timely manner with agreements with Peru and Colombia. 
   I am hopeful that Ecuador and Bolivia understand that one-way preferences are temporary and require a good faith effort on their part to address outstanding trade and expropriation issues if they wish to continue.

Mr. Speaker, this bill offers a false choice between helping our physicians and our pharmacists, who need fair reimbursement, and helping our seniors, especially those in minority communities and those in rural communities from being able to see a doctor who they know and knows them. 
   Unfortunately, this Congress is full of false choices. In Texas, I know if we pass this bill, we have got over 800,000 seniors, mainly in rural communities and in very poor communities, who will not be able to see a doctor, will not be able to get the health care that they chose under Medicare, because this Congress has decided that they are going to pit those poor seniors against physicians and pharmacies in our communities. Those false choices is why this Congress has the lowest approval rating since they began taking polls.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6327, the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2008. 
   This bill would extend for 3 months the excise taxes that presently fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. These are taxes on passengers' tickets and on jet fuel. They are due to expire next Monday. It's important we extend them because they benefit our Nation's airports, airlines, passengers, and pay the salaries of thousands of FAA employees. 
   This 3-month extension will also allow us additional time to consider some fundamental reforms to the tax structure that finances the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. 
   We need time to study how the burdens of the taxes that fund our airports and our air traffic control system are distributed among the users. 
   For example, higher fuel prices have led to higher ticket prices, which means Americans are paying more in taxes on their tickets since the tax is based on a percentage of the fare. I hope we will examine a new system that replaces the percentage tax with a more fair approach that is based on a departure fee, plus the mileage traveled. It seems to make much more sense. 
   We also need more time to examine proposals to modernize our air traffic control system to satellite, which promises to help cut down on congestion and delays and reduce fuel costs. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to help the airline industry keep fuel costs under control, does nothing to keep prices reasonable, does nothing to keep routes accessible and jobs stable for American families, businesses and thousands of airline workers today. 
   The escalating cost of jet fuel--which peaked at $175 a gallon last month, up nearly $100 from the beginning of this year--in this country is killing our aviation industry, and they can't make up the cost enough in ticket prices alone. This year, the airlines are projecting they will spend $20 billion more in jet fuel, and that will be a 72 percent increase from last year. 
   Now fuel costs consume almost 40 percent of the price of a ticket, which has tripled just in the last 7 years. Jet fuel has to compete against gasoline and biodiesel for refinery space, and gas continually wins out. We simply don't have enough supply or refinery capacity to produce enough affordable jet fuel. 
   In response to these record-high jet fuel prices, the airlines have laid off thousands of workers, cut service to hundreds of communities, raised ticket prices, and have started charging new fees even for luggage. 
   Americans are suffering. Our economy is suffering, and airlines are suffering because of these high fuel prices. I urge my colleagues to bring legislation to the floor that will finally address the core of the problem we all know to be: more supply, more American-made energy, less dependency on foreign sources of oil. And we don't need more gimmicks, gimmicks like suing OPEC, gimmicks like use-it-or-lose-it, gimmicks like windfall profits taxes. 
   We need to open up the closed areas in our waters and on our land to thoughtful exploration and production. We need to invest in existing technologies. 
   We need to develop oil shale and coal-to-liquid technology, which can go in our airline fuel tanks, as well as promote advanced biofuels instead of relying on food-based fuel. We also need to get more refineries online by streamlining the permitting process. We also should extend current tax benefits for renewable energy, as well as solar and wind technology. 
   So, while I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, I hope they will consider real relief for the airline industry, passengers and its workers to address the growing cost of fuel. 
   Congress has failed to act. Our airlines and their workers and those passengers have paid the price. It is time to produce more American-made energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   I would say these sky-high jet fuel prices are caused in part because America is doing less, not more, to take responsibility for our own energy needs. 
   We're blessed in this country with more than a 200-year supply of coal. It is affordable, but not yet clean. It can be, with the right technology, converted to super clean liquid fuels. Technology has existed in Germany since the 1940s and used in African countries for almost one-third of their diesel and other vehicle fuels. This Congress needs to act to create more affordable fuel here at home. 
   With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas whose district reflects a lot of the American-made energy that has created America, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This bill is an appropriate one. It is important in the airline infrastructure to find the right solutions. As America continues to grow, the aviation infrastructure needs to grow and upgrade as well. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Illinois' leadership on this issue because it is so vital to our future in America. 
   Equally important, I think, though, is the cost of energy in this country. It seems to me that while America has done less and less to take responsibility for our energy needs, we've seen prices go up and up. Under President Carter's Presidency, at the time of the last energy crisis America was only importing one-third of the oil that we needed each day. Today, it is the reverse; we import nearly two-thirds of what we use each day and we are now, unfortunately, subject to the whims of the global market on energy prices. As a result, in the airline industry we're seeing each day we can't open the newspaper without seeing the cuts to some community that depend upon service from airlines. We don't see some notices of layoff. I know in Continental, we're going to lose 3,000 jobs, 3,000 families being laid off through no fault of their own, except this Congress has not acted. It has failed to act to address lower jet fuel prices for the airline industry plus lower gas prices for America as a whole. 
   The solution is fairly direct. In addition to energy conservation, which we need to do more of, in addition to renewable energies, which are important, we need to also provide more traditional energy, the supply of oil and gas, coal and oil shale, that will help ease the transition to renewable energies and avoid the cost of layoffs, the unprofitable quarters, and the impact on our American airline industry. 
   I hope that this Congress will come together again, not on gimmicks, but on real substantive issues that Republicans and Democrats together can support that will create more American-made energy, more supply here in America, and lower gas prices. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this tax increase, however called, ripped from the headlines, ``Cayman Islands, tax cheats, tax dodgers, Caribbean.'' The only thing they didn't work in was Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. 
   The fact of the matter is I had planned to vote for this farm bill until this ``dark night'' tax increase. And here's the key. You hear them talk about 2002. The Treasury Department said ``close the loophole.'' There is a reason they're not talking about 2007, because since then, in the 5 years, this Congress closed those loopholes. The Treasury Department closed those loopholes. And that same Treasury Department they cite today says this is a tax increase that jeopardizes U.S. jobs, cuts investment to this country, violates tax treaties, and keeps companies from creating jobs in the United States. And it also punishes U.S. energy companies for exploring in our deep waters and for honoring their Federal contracts.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Well, isn't it my understanding as well that technology has long existed to turn our vast resources of coal into super clean liquid fuels, the type, because you always think of coal will help lower your utility bills at home, but the truth of the matter is the technology since the 1940s in Germany converted coal to diesel fuel, the type we use in our cars and trucks. And today some of our African countries are using coal, converting it to diesel for almost a third of all their transportation needs. 
   I recently talked to our major research company, the Woodlands Huntsman, to talk about coal and its conversion and could it be done. And their researchers just laughed. They said, are you kidding? Of course we can do this. 
   My understanding is the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, has introduced legislation to use the purchasing power of our Air Force, to use the purchasing power of our own government to accelerate that type of research and bring it into the marketplace so we can develop those super clean liquid fuels coming from an abundant resource that will be less dependent on foreign countries for our energy needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, for his leadership on this issue and his legislation, including leadership in the American Energy Act just introduced last week to try to force this Congress to finally get serious about taking responsibility for our own energy needs in this country. 
   I have been in Congress a while, but one of the best decisions my wife and I made was not to move to Washington. We live at home in Texas with our two young boys, six and nine years old. I commute to work each week here in Washington. We do that so I can stay closer to the families and neighborhoods in Texas that I represent. 
   Flying up today to Washington, I just was glancing at some of the headlines in our local papers. They read like this: Fuel costs forcing county to rethink current budget; county gives food banks a break at gas because they're getting fewer and fewer volunteers who just can't afford those high prices; trash companies increase rates to cover fuel costs so families will pay more for their trash pick up; fuel costs cause schools to raise food prices. So our children and the parents of children will be paying more for school lunches because of energy costs. 
   I just met with a number of our law enforcement agencies, our constables and Sheriffs and police forces, and they are not cutting their emergency response but they are cutting back on their community policing. They're patrolling within our neighborhoods to try and stretch their fuel budgets. Frankly, their fuel budgets are gone for the year. Small businesses, so many are telling me that they are working essentially for nothing these days. 
   What has this Congress done about it? Nothing really but gimmicks. I call it the Democrats' Jed Clampett Energy Plan. They shoot at a bunch of targets and hope that energy is going to come bubbling up from the ground just like old Jed found. 
   And look at the gimmicks they proposed. Democrats in Congress have said, ``Let us sue OPEC and we will lower your gas prices.'' Well, has anyone seen their gas prices lowered? They said, ``Let's force companies to use it or lose it,'' which frankly, every independent geological group in America just started laughing at. Did you see your gas prices go down? 
   They said, ``Let's stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,'' our nest egg for a rainy day in energy. Did your prices go down? Last week they said, ``Well, it's drawn some of that down.'' Of course, gas prices aren't going down significantly, certainly not because of these gimmicks. 
   The truth of the matter is as the speaker tonight, Mr. Shimkus, the gentlemen from Texas, Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Gohmert, have talked about is that three-legged stool of energy: more conservation, because we can all be more efficient in our homes in our daily use; bring those renewables on line--renewable energy not from food but from non-food sources; and then, of course, the third leg, we've had votes on conservation and we've done it. We have had votes on renewable energy, and we are achieving it. We've just not had a single vote on more exploration, more American-made energy. 
   Now, I think the first goal America should set is that we are going to take responsibility for two-thirds of our daily energy needs. Today we rely upon the rest of the world for that. We ought to take more responsibility for what we need here in America, and to do that is what the speakers in the Republican party are talking about tonight, all-of-the-above.     
   Let's explore offshore and those deep ocean waters that hold so much potential, proven reserves for us. Let's tap responsibly into ANWR. Let's convert coal to super clean liquid fuels, and let's tap the oil shale in America. Let's begin creating more American-made energy and more American-made jobs because, at the end of the day, even a hillbilly isn't going to buy the thought that we can just gimmick our way out of this problem, not with families and with small businesses paying what they do today. We've got an abundant supply of energy. We need more supply in America. We need to take more responsibility for our own energy needs. The good news is that we're capable of it. 
   So all we ask, and all of us tonight are asking one thing of our Speaker. Just give us a vote. Just let the will of the American people prevail. Let the little guy in the door for once. Give him a voice, Mr. Speaker. Tell the special interest lobby to stand aside. Let the little guy's voice be heard. He doesn't have lobbyists. He probably hasn't made campaign contributions to you. He's just paying the freight on energy prices he can't afford and that his family can't afford anymore. We need to let that voice be heard. 
   Before we leave in August, give us a vote, just a single vote. Let the American public's and let the little guy's voices be heard in Congress again so we can develop more American-made energy here in America. That will lower prices. 
   With that, I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (ESTABLISHING AN EARNED IMPORT ALLOWANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support, with my colleagues, of H.R. 6560, a bill that as has been said will make certain changes to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, which the House passed exactly 3 years ago yesterday. It will also make changes to our African trade preference program and will extend the generalized system of preference for one more year. 
   The changes to the DR-CAFTA agreement will encourage the use of American-made fabrics in the production of pants in the DR. This helps to support American textile jobs, and it gives the Dominican Republic more flexibility to strengthen its competitiveness, too. So it is a win-win for jobs here in America and for jobs in Central America as well. It's a small change, but it can help American exporters and Dominican producers, and it's evidence of how the agreement has created economic benefits for all participants. 
   In fact, if you drill down a little deeper into this agreement, in the past 3 years, even though it's really not fully implemented, Guatemala, for example, has not only shown remarkable economic progress and growth since the CAFTA agreement was put into place, but a lot of their jobs that they're creating are in the rural areas, in the poorest of the poor. So they're helping not just the number of a few big producers; they're helping the average person in Guatemala by raising the standard of living and by their having some hope for the future just as it is creating jobs here in America. 
   What we have learned over the years is that it's not enough to simply buy American. You have to sell American. We have to aggressively sell our American products and services all throughout this world. 
   For the U.S., as it has been pointed out, our $1.9 billion trade deficit with the six partners in Central America has now turned into a $3.6 billion trade surplus thanks to this agreement. That means we're selling more than we're buying and that we're supporting good paying American jobs in manufacturing, in services, in transportation, in logistics, and in agriculture. 
   We recently learned that, if you take all of our current free trade and fair trade agreements, we see the same trend, that deficits are turning into surpluses across the board. We now have a surplus of nearly $3 billion, and our free trade agreement partners, who are only a small part of the world economy, now account for half of all that America sells overseas. So we are creating some of the best customers for American products and for American workers here in our agreements. 
   In fact, if you look at the American economy today, nearly 40 percent of our economic growth comes from selling our products all around the world, and we're selling them to the countries we have these agreements with. They are great customers, and we need more of them. 
   What I've realized is that, as to the giant sucking sound that was predicted for trade agreements, it turns out that that's the hot air deflated from the critics who've been proven wrong about each one of them, especially about CAFTA. This is yet another reason why this Congress needs to pass the U.S.-Colombian Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   Like Central America before it, Colombia already enjoys access to America. They can sell their products almost duty free into the United States, but when we try to sell our products back into Colombia, their tariff is almost 14 percent, much higher than Central America's was before. They don't create a level playing field for American workers. We want to have two-way trade and equal competition. 
   An agreement would lock in Colombia's trade preferences while creating a better investment climate for the country, which would help build its legitimate economy, which is dynamic throughout this region. A stable Colombia is good for the United States and for the hemisphere. 
   If you've been following the news, you've seen remarkable progress by Colombia and by President Uribe on  human rights, on labor rights and especially, just lately, on its remarkable rescue of the American hostages after their being 5 years within the FARC. They are taming the terrorist organizations with our help, and they deserve our continued support in that effort. 
   Madam Speaker, the Central American agreement has helped to bolster ties with our partners in the region. It has helped to create U.S. jobs and to encourage economic growth in neighboring countries. Colombia will do the same. I reiterate my call for the leadership of this House to schedule an up-or-down vote on Colombia this year. Given the nature of our trade laws, it will be too late if this gets put on hold until next year, and we will have missed a critical opportunity to strengthen our relationship with an important partner in the region and to create fair trade for Americans. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the whole world is watching America. Let's not turn our back on Colombia. Let's not show the world we're economic isolationists--afraid to compete or afraid to hold out our hand to partners in our backyard. Let's not as a Congress be beholden to a few special interests. Democrats and Republicans, Defense Secretaries and Secretaries of State agree that this is one of the most important foreign policy decisions that we can make. The whole world is watching. Let us schedule a vote for Colombia and pass it this year.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, there are good things in this bill. 
   I think it's important that we address the AMT. It was created in 1969 by a Democrat Congress for the wealthy. Now it's affecting our teachers and our firefighters and just average families. 
   There is a State and local sales tax deduction in this bill, very important for families because sales taxes really add up fast. But these tax increases are troubling and risky. Like AMT, there are unintended consequences that will damage our economy. 
   We are launching an assault on the real estate and housing industry, increasing taxes on second homes and leveling a potentially devastating tax increase on real estate partnerships. 
   Now, these real estate partnerships, there are a lot of them. People say, oh, it's just corporations. There are 1.1 million partnerships who have done nothing wrong in America but build apartments in our communities, shopping centers, office buildings and industrial parks. This tax is seen as the most potentially devastating tax on them since 1986, which launched massive loan defaults and foreclosures. These are traditional real estate partnerships. 
   And people say, well, we are aiming at Wall Street. Well, they are aiming at Wall Street, but they're going to hit Main Street America, and the result is lower property values, fewer construction jobs, and risky lending in real estate partnerships who have done nothing wrong. 
   And finally, this bill levies a $2 billion tax increase on families who have  scrimped their whole lives to get a second home. These are not wealthy people. The average income is about $82,000 for those who buy a second time. And 40 percent, four out of 10 sales last year were second home buyers, people who scrimped on their first home so they might have a cabin or a place by a lake or something for their family to retire to. These higher taxes are going to damage their investments. They're going to lower property values. It's going to hurt every community across this country that relies upon these second homes. Whether you're at the lakes, the river, or out in the parks, these tax increases are dangerous.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I look at our families in Texas, everything seems more expensive these days, whether it is getting your kids through school or paying medical bills or insurance or paying light bills; and it is tough enough for family budgets to stretch as it is. I just cannot imagine why we in Washington would hand our families another tax bill for $2,700 for Texas families and expect them to like it, especially since we can balance this budget without that tax increase. 
   When I talk to our Texas seniors, the first thing they tell me is, please stop spending our Social Security money, quit spending the trust fund; that is our money. Yet, the Democrat budget spends that Social Security trust fund. The Republican budget for the first time in 40 years stops spending it, preserves it for Social Security. 
   When I look at small businesses, who are the backbone of our country and really struggle to make payroll, I used to be a Chamber of Commerce manager. I know how hard it is to meet that payroll. And 26 million small business owners, we are going to hand them another tax bill of about $4,000 on top of what they struggle today? That is just asking too much, especially when we can balance the budget without those tax increases, without taking senior's Social Security, and do it the right way. 
   That is why I respectfully disagree, strongly disagree with this bill and why we need to pass the Republican alternative. It makes much more sense for our families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Saxton, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   A couple of corrections here. Let me make the point that the American economy is still one of the strongest in the Nation, in the world, the largest economy in the world. We have had 42 straight months of job growth. We have created 7.6 million new jobs under President Bush. We have low unemployment. And this was all done as President Bush inherited a recession as he took office. 
   I should make note that President Clinton inherited an expanding economy. President Bush inherited one that was slipping into recession. And you don't need to take my word for it. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Laureate and President's Clinton's own chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, observed the economy was slipping into recession even before President Bush took office. 
   So let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about this budget. I actually think it is a healthy thing that we are arguing over how to balance the Federal budget. That is something that ought to be a goal of both parties. 
   And, frankly, as a Republican, I am convinced one of the reasons we got fired from management of Congress is that we forgot to pursue a balanced budget. We forgot to limit spending. We forgot to try to look out for the American taxpayer. 
   I oppose this Democratic budget because it increases the Federal deficit by billions of dollars next year. It continues to raid the Social Security trust fund, and it does include the largest tax increase in American history. And that is not only fiscally irresponsible, it means a staggering $2,700 tax increase for our average Texas family of four. 
   Now, this budget will spend nearly $3 trillion next year, and we will impose almost $400 billion of tax increases to finance new Federal spending. If you look at what it does, it allows President Bush's tax relief to expire, bringing back the marriage penalty, bringing back the death tax, cutting the child tax credit in half, and raising the income capital gains and dividend tax rates. 
   And their budget, closer to home, next year it also kills the State and local sales tax deduction, which I and others on both sides of the aisle worked so hard to restore. That State sales tax deduction saves Texas families $1 billion annually, and they will see a new tax increase shortly after this holiday season. 
   And what is, I think, most absurd, I was listening to the chairman of the Budget Committee's discussion on shenanigans and I thought, I have not seen a bigger shenanigan in any budget in history than what is called the reserve account in the Democrat budget. What they say is, we will do tax relief for middle-class families, but we will pay for it with the reserve account. You ask, what is in the reserve account? And not a single dime, not a single dollar. It is as if someone said, here is a check for what I promise you, but the bank account is empty. I don't know if there will be money in it ever. I don't know how to put money in it. But, trust me, here is a check. Those reserve accounts are the biggest shenanigan. 
   And after years of criticizing President Bush for not eliminating or at least reforming the alternative minimum tax, the Democrat budget doesn't allow for even 1 year of it, which means an additional 20 million Americans will be hit by this growing tax next year. 
   I am backing an alternative budget, the Republican budget, that balances the budget in 5 years without a tax increase and ends the raid on the Social Security trust fund. 
   It seems to me tonight we have probably as clear a choice as we have had in many years between the Democrat philosophy of balancing the budget and the Republican. 
   The Democrat philosophy in this budget is, we will balance it, which is good for them. We balance it by increasing spending and increasing taxes on hardworking families. 
   The Republicans approach is, we will balance it a different way, by limiting the spending and by keeping the tax relief that families need. And there has never been a clearer choice. 
   And I think, too, I look at the promises that were made last campaign by  our new majority. We are going to reduce the deficit. Yet, under this budget, the deficit will actually increase $36 billion in 1 year, $36 billion. That compass is headed the wrong direction. 
   They said, we will stop spending the Social Security trust fund, but they spend all of it this year and in every year. And they say, we promise middle-class tax relief, but, instead, they provide tax increases on families and small businesses and single moms with children. 
   In a moment I am going to go through some of those tax increases which, frankly, as expensive as life is these days for most families, I know our families in Texas can't quite handle that big a hit. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

It turned out that much of it was false, based on the supposed paper accounts of Enron and WorldCom and others. Too many families woke up after the Clinton administration and realized that retirement fund they had counted on their whole life wasn't worth the paper it was written on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman does make many relevant points, just not relevant accuracies. 
   The truth of the matter is he claimed that the Democrats balanced the budget in 1994, but there was a $200 billion deficit in 1994. In fact, it was the Republican Congress that balanced the Federal budget for the first time after 40 years of Democrat leadership in Washington, D.C. 
   The gentlewoman from New York claims that manufacturing jobs were lost under President Bush, but manufacturing losses began in 1998, 1999, and 2000 under President Clinton's administration. 
   And while I agree with the gentlewoman that the $9 trillion debt is unconscionable, I will point out that in every budget that we passed in the 10 years that I have been here, Democrats voted against it because it was not spending enough. And the gentleman in front of me just said we haven't spent enough on Katrina, we haven't spent enough on education, we haven't spent enough on health care; yet they say we shouldn't be spending this much. And that $9 trillion debt, when I go onto their Web sites, when I look at the press releases on all the pork barrel projects, I brought home this highway fund, this university research, I brought home this special program, now, either they didn't support that spending or they are just claiming credit for that spending. 
   You can't have it both ways. You can't be fiscally responsible. You are spending too much. No, you are spending too little, and I am taking credit for what you did. 
   The fact of the matter is when we look at the Democratic budget, what we see is a massive tax rate, massive new spending, all in an effort, I think, to reclaim the title of the biggest government possible.     
   I try to explain this to my taxpayers back home and my families, what does this budget mean to you? 
   You look at an elderly couple in Texas with $40,000 income. That is where the husband and the wife is still working. Under the Democrat bill, this elderly couple in Texas, their tax bill would rise by $1,000 a year. That is a lot of money for a senior citizen and his wife. 
   A family of four with $60,000 in earnings, that is maybe a firefighter and a secretary, this bill would increase their taxes by $1,800. A family of four, which probably is struggling already to make ends meet. 
   For a single parent with two children and $30,000 in income, that is a single mom working in the local school district, under Republicans, at the end of the year she would get back almost $2,500. Under the Democrat tax increase bill, she would get $1,600 less. 
   I know in Washington $1,600 doesn't seem like a lot, but when you are a single mom working at the local school district with two kids, that is a lot of clothes, that is a lot of car insurance, that is a lot of medical bills for young people. This budget hands these families a tax hit that, frankly, they can't afford. 
   Taxes will rise, on the average, for 26 million small business owners by almost $4,000. That is a lot of payroll. That may be the only profit they make all year. 
   Then, by eliminating the lowest tax bracket, you are going to take 5 million taxpayers in America who didn't have to pay taxes, we are going to hand them a tax bill and say we want to do this so we can spend more in Washington. So that we can try to balance the budget on the backs of hardworking families in America, we are going to spend more. 
   What my Democrat friends have never figured out is, Washington has all the money it needs. It just doesn't have all the money it wants. It is time we know the difference. 
   I am supporting the Republican alternative, which balances the budget without this massive tax increase. In fact, there is no tax increase at all. For the first time in many, many years, it does not spend the Social Security trust fund, which is just critical.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Pomeroy). The gentlelady from New York is recognized to close.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I voted to create the children's health care program, and I believe in it. But let's be honest. These changes are more cosmetic than Dr. 90210. This bill still isn't paid for. It still doesn't cover poor kids first, and it still allows abuses like subsidizing adults to continue. 
   And what's especially sad is that today, while the California tragedy unfolds, most Americans see homes in flames, lives lost, and families huddling in football stadiums as their life's possessions go up in flames, the Washington Democrats see political opportunity. 
   While dedicated California lawmakers rush home to their communities, Democrats rush their bill to the floor. 
   It seems like none of us in Congress, either party, ought to look like vultures circling above the burned out homes of California families gleefully eyeing a cynical chance to try to pass their partisan legislation. 
   This proves what we said all along. This isn't about the children. It's about defeating George Bush. Some hate him so badly they will sacrifice whatever morals and integrity to win at all costs. 
   Democrats promised to change Washington, but it's business as usual up here; and it's the children who lose. 
   As parents we teach our kids to sit down and work out their differences, that fighting doesn't accomplish anything, that big boys and girls find a way to work together. When this political trick fails, and it will, why don't we apply the same lessons up here and work together to find a reasonable, fiscally responsible way to help cover our kids who need our help?

She can't afford to drive to it. Just on Sunday. I talked to small businesses that now work, painters and plumbers and others, who now basically work for free because gas prices have eaten up all their profits. I visited this last week with our law enforcement agencies, who are no longer able to be proactive in the community. They are just responding to calls because they burned through much of their fuel budget for the year already. 
   In each case, every one of them asked me, Why isn't America doing more? Why isn't America taking more responsibility for our own energy needs? We import two-thirds of all we use. We are capable of doing more. In each case, they said, Look, take a message back to Congress. No more gimmicks. No more gimmicks. We need more American-made energy here in the United States to get our fuel prices down, to be less dependent on Middle East fuel, to have some say over the prices that our families and small businesses pay.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, that gentle reminder is not enough. It is despicable to have a Member of this Congress accuse this President, any President, of willfully blowing the heads, quote, blowing the heads off our young men and women over in Iraq and Afghanistan. Having a brother who is an Army medic and served in Iraq, having spent this weekend with a family who lost their son in Iraq, it is beneath contempt, beneath contempt, to have a Member of Congress stand here and accuse the President of, in effect, assassinating our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is dead wrong. And it is beneath contempt as well that we will sit here silently and allow such a remark to be tolerated, accepted if not embraced. And I will guarantee you, no Member on this side will stand up here and disavow those remarks, unfortunately, today. 
   It is bad enough that we are playing politics with the war. Now we are playing politics with our kids. The claim that the Republicans don't support this program is equally untrue. We created it. This is a great program. It keeps kids healthy. It helps their families avoid serious illness, keeps them out of our emergency rooms. It is a great program. 
   When we created it, we did it the right way. We sat down with the President, President Clinton, and we worked out a good plan for kids. And then, more importantly, we believed in it enough to pay for it. We paid for the whole 10 years. This plan does not. It is only half paid for. It is only half paid for. It is just like these predatory loans; the first years are affordable, and then it balloons beyond what we can pay for it. If we believe in it, let's pay for it now. It allows abuses to continue. It doesn't cover the poor kids first. 
   My question is, why don't we sit down, why don't we quit playing political games with our kids, sit down with Republicans and Democrats with the White House and find a solution that is right for our children.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Ways and Means Committee, proud to have helped create the Medicare prescription plan; it is really helping a lot of our seniors in Texas, especially those who are very poor and have some of the most expensive illnesses. 
   I think we can do more to improve the Medicare prescription drug plan, we ought to work better together; but I oppose directing the Federal Government to interfere with the successful Medicare prescription drug plan. 
   If you look closely, this is a senior scam. I am warning my mom, who is on Medicare, that this is just another senior scam. It sounds fantastic, but when  you read the fine print, you realize the only savings you get is, if you just restrict the drugs that she can get, you limit where she can go to get them, and every expert says this won't save a dime. Sure, I can save everyone in this room costs on their medicines. I am just going to, like the VA does, I will tell you, you can't have those medicines and you can't get them where you need them. 
   Our seniors, my mom has a choice of 4,000 drugs, if she was in the VA, she would get a choice of a thousand, most of them generics. Now she has 55,000 pharmacies, hopefully she won't go to all of them; with VA, she would get to go to 300 of them. If she tried to find the drugs she needs, a one out of four chance she would find the one she really needs. 
   The truth of the matter is that we ought to be working together to help improve Medicare. We ought not be trying to score political points. We ought to be helping seniors lower their drug costs. 
   This is a scam; and I predict it will not ever become law because this scores political points rather than helping seniors with their medicines. Let's find a way we really can work together for our seniors.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, watching television late last night I was reminded of the vivid contrast between Congress and the war on terror. On the one channel I watched Members of the House theatrically debating this nonbinding, that means pretend, resolution, while the other channel showed an American chopper hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and billowing black smoke, falling in the death spiral to the ground, killing all American soldiers aboard. 
   Tonight our soldiers face real bullets and real explosive devices; we debate a pretend resolution. I wish I could say this is merely a waste of time, but it is far more damaging than that. As Lincoln warned, a house divided itself cannot stand. Yet today our Congress stands divided for all the world to see. Our enemies are smiling and our soldiers are sick at heart. 
   Don't take my word for it. Let me read you an e-mail I received this week from a decorated Army soldier who served in the gulf war and again in Iraq on this war on terror. 
   He writes: ``The troops support the mission, support the President, and support the surge. We are moving the brigade out of here soon. I cannot be more adamant about the fact that partisan politics is hurting the mission and the morale. We want to win the war not the White House.'' 
   I fear that some see that in the other order. The troops want to complete this mission. Congress wanted a change in the strategy, they got a change, now they don't want to support the change. That is exactly why Vietnam vets complained about politicians not allowing them to win. And this is not Vietnam all over again, but the politicians are making the same mistakes they did back then. 
   Let the generals run the war; you guys handle immigration. Well, listening to this debate, perhaps we should just turn the running of the war over to Congress. Unbeknownst to America, apparently the most brilliant, articulate military strategists have to be here in Congress. But a word of caution to my fellow MacArthurs and Pattons. It is easy to run a war when you are 6,000 miles from Baghdad and hold a microphone for a gun. 
   There can be only one Commander in Chief. The moment Congress begins interfering in battlefield decisions is the moment we are assured of losing this war and that moment is dangerously near. 
   I support this surge. If our military leaders and the Commander in Chief need these extra soldiers, I am behind them 110 percent. Am I certain the surge will work? No. But I am certain the consequences of failing in Iraq will ultimately cost us many more innocent lives and a much darker future, not just for Iraq but for my family and yours. 
   In Iraq and Afghanistan we are in a battle of wills. Should America retreat, should we withdraw prematurely, we will not only cement our reputation as a Nation that talks big and acts boldly, but at the first sign of difficulty shows no will, no backbone, no strength to keep our word. 
   The world saw our lack of will in Vietnam, they watched us run from Somalia, and today they see our backbone disintegrate over Iraq. They watched us for a quarter of a century, we wished away the terrorist attacks in Khobar, the USS Cole, and the first World Trade Center bombing. 
   Finally it hit home and already some in Congress are flying the white flag. Think. Nations like Iraq and Afghanistan who oppose terrorism are faced with a choice. They can live with terrorists among them or live in a free society with the protection and the backing of the world's greatest democracy. That is us. With their lives and the future on the line who will they choose? Is it not sad that today the world has just about decided that America will not keep its word, America cannot be counted on? 
   Terrorists know that while they can never hope to defeat our military on the battleground, they are assured if they just hold out, they can defeat us in Congress one opinion poll at a time. This is a test of wills, and whether we got here for the reason you agree with or not, it is a test. I believe we are here for the right reasons, and it is incredibly naive to believe that all of the terrorist organizations in the world were conveniently gathered in Afghanistan, like a Rotary Club. 
   We are wrong to pursue terrorist safe havens other than those that harbored al Qaeda on the some wobbly theory we should not pursue drug cartels other than the ones we believe smuggled in the drug that destroyed your child.  
   Due to technology and financing, terrorists are not limited to states and regions, and we have to pursue them. But whether or not you agree with how we got here, we are there in Iraq. And the nation of Iraq and our Nation have everything riding on the line. Eliminating Iraq as a safe haven for financing, training terrorist groups in the Middle East is a mission we must complete for our sake. 
   Thomas Edison once observed many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. If we fail in Iraq, we sentence our children to a lifetime of fear, of fear of going to the mall safely, going to work each morning and returning home safely, the fear of going with friends to a sports stadium without being torn apart in an explosion. 
   If we believe the price of war is high, wait until we endure the price of terror here in America. Our soldiers are giving their blood, what are we giving them? A resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill. 
   There's no question that if Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were to collapse, it would deal a serious blow to our economy, and nearly every community would feel the negative effects. But this bill fails to give taxpayers enough confidence that the two mortgage giants won't be back again for another dip in the trough. 
   I'm concerned that we're unduly putting a massive burden on taxpayers for Wall Street's bad decisions and those of speculators who took on risky mortgages. 
   I believe that before we use taxpayer dollars to potentially increase the national debt, provide an unlimited line of credit, and allow the government to buy a little less than $1 trillion in stock in private companies, then Congress needs to insist on these three conditions. 
   First, unlike today, Freddie and Fannie must be required to have the capital standards necessary to ensure their fiscal stability. 
   Secondly, that over a set period of time they are gradually reduced in size so that America's housing eggs are not all in one basket. 
   And finally, that the leadership of Freddie and Fannie be replaced. The millionaire captains who grounded this ship have proven they are not capable to steer us to calmer waters. 
   I am also hopeful that should this plan work, I unfortunately believe the underlying bill on housing misses the mark. Rather than a $300 billion bailout for the housing areas, what we've seen as an alternative is that the HOPE NOW Alliance, the private sector, has stepped forward to help 1.7 million homeowners transfer from those high ARM rates, adjustable rate mortgages, to fixed rate mortgages so they can keep their home. 
   And I fear, too, that the way we pay for this bill, which would hurt American companies creating jobs here in America, and raises taxes on those with second homes, vacation homes, investment homes, retirement homes, will further hurt our housing economy at a time we simply can't afford it. 
   Reluctantly, I oppose this bill.

If the White House and this Congress are convinced the plan will calm the waters, then I am certainly hopeful it works. But this bailout fails in one important aspect: it doesn't fully solve the problems that brought Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to this crisis point, so taxpayers have no guarantee that these two companies won't be back again for another handout. 
   Before we use taxpayer dollars to potentially increase the national debt, provide an unlimited line of credit and allow the government to buy nearly a trillion dollars of stock in private companies, then Congress needs to insist on three conditions.

And third, that the leadership of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae be replaced immediately. The millionaire captains who grounded this ship have proven they are not the ones to steer us to calmer seas. 
   I am skeptical that the proposed new Federal regulator is strong enough to take these necessary steps so it is essential that Congress insist on adding these safeguards in law before we put the taxpayers on the hook for the bailout.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support in H.R. 7006, the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008, a bill that provides targeted tax benefits to victims of federally declared natural disasters. 
   As the chairman and gentleman from New York said, we have had a tough year here in the United States for disasters across this country; most recently, Hurricane Ike which hit the gulf coast and Texas especially. Ike will likely be the worst storm to hit Texas in 50 years. Ike damaged or destroyed about $52 billion worth of homes and businesses. It was far worse than Hurricane Rita that just hit us 3 years ago. And this is the region of Texas that was so quick to open their homes and their hearts and their churches to those victims of Hurricane Katrina, so it feels a bit like we are being piled on. 
   We look to areas like Galveston and Bolivar, and Orange and Bridge City where the storm surge destroyed thousands of homes and damaged businesses and left people homeless. Today, 11 days after Hurricane Ike, despite heroic efforts, 250,000 people are still without running water and many more are still without power as the Texas heat continues to bear down on them. 
   So these folks are suffering. They need our help now. Damage from the hurricane was widespread, and lives were disrupted and destroyed. Yet here it is 11 days after Hurricane Ike, and to its credit, this Congress, which I have criticized at times as not moving quickly enough or substantively enough, has moved quickly to respond to the needs of not just Texas, but Louisiana, the Midwest and throughout this country. I am grateful to them for that. 
   I am encouraged that Congress responded so quickly, and I urge my colleagues to support this assistance. 
   I, along with my friend and colleague from Houston, Al Green, along with the Texas delegation, introduced a bill much like Congressman Kind's to provide even more expansive tax benefits to Hurricane Ike victims. While we hope that Congress will consider it in the future because it has some key provisions important to our recovery, this legislation today is a very good step forward, especially coming so quickly after the hurricane. 
   This bill will provide Texans and others much-needed help through a variety of tax relief measures. One provision is enhanced casualty loss deductions, which in plain English just allows families to write off more of the property loss from Hurricane Ike and other disasters without regard to their adjusted gross income. 
   We have increased low income housing tax credits by $2 billion under this bill. That is important to help those who most need housing. 
   Another provision is the ability to allow States to use mortgage revenue bonds to provide loans to repair or reconstruct homes and rental housing units that are now unsafe for use as residences because of hurricane damage. 
   In addition, we all must recognize that the business community, those who provide our jobs, experienced severe disruption and damage from Hurricane Ike. To help businesses recover quickly, this legislation will allow them to write off and immediately expense costs for disaster recovery, including demolition, repair, cleanup and environmental remediation. 
   Any business with net operating losses from the disaster, and there are many, will be allowed to carry back those losses for 5 years, which means they will be able to put more money back into recovery and put workers back to work and getting back into business which is important for property values and sale tax values in our affected communities.     
   Also, the Treasury Department is authorized under this bill to permit States to issue $13 billion of tax-exempt bonds to finance the replacement, the repair, the reconstruction and renovation of business property damaged or destroyed by a federally declared disaster like Hurricane Ike. I believe these private activity bonds are a critical tool to help damaged businesses through these hard times. 
   And we should not forget the remarkable charitable work that people and businesses provided to their friends and  neighbors in hard times. I witnessed this myself throughout our district that was hit so hard. We've seen this in past disasters. To assist those who come selflessly to work so that they do not get hit so hard by the high price of gasoline, the mileage reimbursement rate for charitable work will be increased and, moreover, limits for charitable relief contributions in response to a federal disaster are waived. 
   This is a very important bill. And while I strongly believe and hope that Congress might take a look at additional measures in the future, this bill is a crucial first step, and I strongly support it. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. I yield myself, for closing, as much time as I may consume. 
   Disasters are so hard on families and especially on small businesses and on communities as they try to recover, whether it is the flooding in the Midwest or wildfires in the West or Hurricane Ike, Hurricane Gustav or hurricanes that have hit Florida. It is just a terrible time. 
   And I know in our case, you always know your own communities best, and we saw 8- to 10-foot storm surge in Orange County that went over the levees, flooded one-third of that town and most of its historic district. It completely flooded about 6 feet up in every home in Bridge City. I think out of almost 4,000 homes, 15 were left untouched. 
   And when I was there touring the area, we toured it the day after by boat, and these are land cities. We could see the devastation, and today, those communities are trying to recover and those families are trying to repair their homes. 
   The problem we have is that Hurricane Rita, which had just come through 3 years ago, wiped out all the hotel-motels, had wiped out all available rental housing. So our workers in our energy refineries and shipbuilding and chemical refineries are staying 90, 100 miles away in available hotels, driving each day an hour-and-a-half each way to try to pull the carpet and the sheetrock out of their homes. They have all their possessions in the world piled in the front yard for insurance adjusters to appraise or for others to just simply take away. 
   And to give them hope that they can recover, it's important Congress do all that we can, and these tax provisions help those families and small businesses try to take those first steps, which is why not only do I strongly support this, I appreciate the gentleman from Wisconsin's long effort to provide disaster relief throughout this country. 
   I appreciate Chairman Rangel and the Ways and Means Committee taking a leadership role to move this bill to the floor before the session is over. I appreciate the support of our Texas delegation, Republicans and Democrats, as we move forward. 
   I strongly support this and appreciate the responsiveness of this Congress. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Again, I want to thank you for your leadership, and this is a great piece of legislation. 
   I was remiss in not recognizing my colleague, Congressman Al Green from Houston. He's the lead Democrat cosponsor with me on the Texas portion of disaster relief. He is tied up in Financial Services today working on issues. I know he is here in spirit, and I just wanted to publicly thank him for his role as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRADY of Texas. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Reynolds, thank you for your leadership, as well as Mr. Neal, on trying to not only keep more middle class families from being hit by the alternative minimum tax, but hopefully to find a long-term solution where there is no AMT looming over our families. 
   The truth of the matter is, this was a tax created many years ago to hit the very, very wealthy in America, at the time just 155 or so, who did not pay taxes. Unfortunately, it wasn't indexed. It is now each year more and more attacking middle class families who frankly are still struggling to make ends meet. Then after they do their regular taxes, they find they have a second tax that comes after them and catches them even if they didn't owe on the first. 
   So this Congress has taken seriously the need to not allow the AMT to hit more families. This action today makes sure that 24 million American families are not hit by this second tax at an average tax rate increase of about $2,400. For a lot of families in America, that is real money in a big way. 
   It is time to repeal the AMT permanently. It is time for both parties to work together to do that. I look forward to the day when we can bury it and help protect our families.  
   All year long, Republicans have urged Democrats to enact a clean AMT patch without tax increases and to do so in a more timely manner than occurred in 2007. 
   Last year, House Democrats' insistence on linking the 2007 patch to unrelated tax hikes resulted in the patch being enacted later in the year than ever before, causing headaches and uncertainty for taxpayers and the IRS alike. 
   On May 21, 2008, and again on June 25, 2008, Republicans supported Motions to Recommit that would have provided a clean AMT patch--without tax hikes. Unfortunately, Democrats opposed those common-sense proposals, putting us on the same regrettable path as last year--toward another historically late AMT patch. 
   Today, just days before Congress's scheduled adjournment, the Majority has finally acknowledged the obvious: an AMT patch that is offset with tax increases stands no chance of being enacted. 
   Unfortunately, instead of considering the Senate's comprehensive, bipartisan tax package that addresses not just the AMT patch, but other critically important tax priorities as well, the Majority is pursuing a piecemeal approach that seems unlikely to advance in the Senate. 
   During debate on the comprehensive Senate package on September 23rd, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made precisely this point, stating: ``I say to my friends on the other side of the Capitol, the House: `Don't send us back something else. We can't get it passed.' If they try to mess with our package, it will come back here, it will die, and we will ..... have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'' 
   While it is a welcome development that Democrats have abandoned their efforts to patch the AMT by raising taxes, the Majority should be working with the Senate to ensure enactment of all our critical tax priorities. 
   An estimated 26 million taxpayers will owe higher taxes for 2008 because of the AMT, according to the latest Treasury Department estimates. This is sharply up from about 4 million people last year in 2007 that would have been affected if Democrats had not agreed to patch the AMT without tax increases. 
   The AMT was created in the late 1960s to ensure that fewer than 200 high-income taxpayers couldn't avoid paying any income tax at all. The AMT was intended as a fail safe mechanism, NOT as a tax Increase. However, the tax is now hitting the middle class and hitting them hard. 
   From 1992-2002, the number of filers paying AMT increased tenfold to 1.3 million people. By 2010, nearly 1 in 3 tax filers will be subject to the AMT. 
   Although the AMT is highly progressive, the distribution of AMT liability will shift toward tax units with lower incomes. In 2006, taxpayers with $500,000 or more in income will pay 47 percent of the tax. By 2010, they will pay only 16 percent. 
   Over 80 percent of households with incomes between $100,000-200,000 and almost half of those with incomes between $75,000-100,000 will pay the AMT by 2010 (compared to 4.8 percent and 0.7 percent in 2006). 
   Simply put, Congress should act decisively to prevent $61.5+ billion of tax increases on the American people. Not patching the AMT means an average tax hike of $2,400 for over 25 million taxpayers. 
   Delaying action on patching the AMT hurts taxpayers. According to Treasury Secretary Paulson, the failure of Congress to enact an AMT patch earlier in the year results in delayed tax refunds totaling approximately $75 billion for as many as 50 million taxpayers. Tax compliance is onerous enough for Americans without Congress getting into the mix to make it even harder!
