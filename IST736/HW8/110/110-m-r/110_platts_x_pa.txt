<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1309, the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007. 
   Open and accountable government make up the cornerstones of good government. This legislation before us today seeks to strengthen these cornerstones. 
   The Freedom of Information Act was signed into law over 40 years ago, in July 1966, enacted after 11 years of debate. FOIA established a statutory right of public access to executive branch information. 
   FOIA provides that any person has the right to obtain Federal agency records. Originally, the act included nine categories of information protected from disclosure, and Congress has added additional exemptions over time. 
   Balancing the need for open government with the needs to protect information vital to national security and personal privacy is a constant struggle. Federal Departments and agencies are operating in the post-9/11 information age and face 21st century security, information management, and resource challenges. 
   As we seek to achieve this balance we must remember the words of Thomas Jefferson who said, ``Information is the currency of democracy.'' FOIA is an essential tool to ensure that the citizens of our great Nation have access to information in the way that Thomas Jefferson envisioned. 
   Over the past several years, the Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Finance, and Accountability, on which I had the privilege to serve as Chair, conducted multiple hearings on FOIA implementation.     
   In response to legislative proposals introduced last session in the House and Senate, as well as the oversight conducted by the subcommittee, President Bush issued Executive Order 13392, entitled Improving Agency Disclosure of Information, on December 14, 2005. This document sought to improve the overall processing of FOIA requests, creating a more citizen-centered and results-oriented approach to information policy. And I certainly commend the administration for their efforts. 
   In response to that effort, though, we believed further work was needed. On September 27, 2006, the subcommittee marked up legislation very similar to that legislation before us here today. Specifically, the OPEN Government Act, introduced by my colleague from Texas, LAMAR SMITH, like the bill before us today, would close loopholes in FOIA, help requesters obtain more timely response, and provide FOIA officials with the tools they need to ensure that the Federal Government remains open and accessible. 
   While the legislation before us today includes provisions not included in Representative Smith's legislation from last session and to which he is currently opposed, I certainly want to commend Representative Smith for his leadership and dedicated efforts to improve the Freedom of Information Act and to make government more open and accountable. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Waxman of the full committee and subcommittee Chairman Clay for their efforts in moving this legislation forward quickly and, as well, recognize Ranking Member Davis of the full committee and Ranking Member Turner at the subcommittee for their efforts. 
   This legislation is about open and accountable government. I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, is a bipartisan bill which seeks to restore protections for civil servants who report illegalities, gross mismanagement and waste, and substantial and specific dangers to the public health and safety. 
   H.R. 985 contains many of the provisions of legislation which I introduced during the 109th Congress, H.R. 1317. It represents consensus language crafted through bipartisan negotiations among myself, Chairman Waxman, Ranking Member Davis, Representative Van  Hollen, as well as the majority and minority staffs of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and interested stakeholders groups such as the Government Accountability Project. I certainly would like to thank all who have been involved in this process. 
   To provide context for the legislation we are considering today, it is important to review the legislative history in the area of whistleblower protections for Federal employees. 
   As a result of finding that the civil service protections of the time were inadequate, Congress, in the first Bush administration, enacted into law the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, of 1989, which expressly stated that ``any protected disclosure of waste, fraud and abuse by a Federal employee is covered by the law.'' 
   Unfortunately, as interpreted by the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal circuit court, loopholes began to develop in the WPA. Accordingly, Congress strengthened the law in 1994. 
   It is noteworthy that the report accompanying the WPA Amendments of 1994 expressed great frustration with the way the WPA was being interpreted. According to the report, it states, ``Perhaps the most troubling precedents involved the Board's inability to understand that 'any' means 'any.' The WPA protects any disclosure evidencing a reasonable belief of specified misconduct, a cornerstone to which the MSPD remains blind.     
   ``The only restrictions are for classified information or material, the release of which is specifically prohibited by statute. Employees must disclose that type of information through confidential channels to maintain protection. Otherwise, there are no exceptions.'' 
   Unfortunately, we are once again largely back to where we started. Since the 1994 amendments, 177 whistleblower cases have come before the Federal Circuit Court; however, only two whistleblowers have prevailed. Among the reasons are a number of decisions which have continued to create exceptions to the law, including decisions stating that an employee is not protected by the WPA if the employee directs criticism to other witnesses or a supervisor in an attempt to start the process of challenging misconduct, or the information disclosed was done in the course of the employee's ordinary job duties, or the information disclosed has already been raised by someone else. 
   In addition, the Federal Circuit Court has stated in one case that: For a Federal employee to reasonably believe there is evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse, as required by the law, he or she must overcome with irrefragable proof the presumption that the agency was acting in good faith. 
   This is an unheard of legal standard, defined in the dictionary as ``impossible to refute.'' In other words, the agency pretty much has to admit to the waste, fraud, or abuse. 
   H.R. 985 would clarify congressional intent that any whistleblower disclosure includes disclosures ``without restriction to time, place, form, motive, context, or prior disclosure made to any person by an employee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of the employee's duties.'' In addition, H.R. 985 would end any uncertainty about the irrefragable proof standard, making it clear that the ``substantial evidence standard'' applies to all five categories for legally protected whistleblowing disclosures. Appellate courts could not impose additional burdens for a particular category, as I understand occurred in the case of White v. Department of Air Force with respect to ``gross mismanagement.'' 
   Other provisions within H.R. 985 which are either identical or similar to provisions within previous versions of this legislation include: 
   Allowing employees the option to have their claims decided in Federal District Court if the Merit Systems Protection Board does not act on a claim within 180 days; 
   Ending the monopoly jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over appeals under the Whistleblower Protection Act; 
   Conducting a GAO study on the revocation of security clearances in retaliation for whistleblowing; 
   Extending whistleblower protections to the Transportation Security Administration baggage screeners; 
   Enhancing whistleblower protections for employees of government contractors; 
   Codifying an anti-gag rule that was first included in the Treasury Appropriations bill for 1988 and every year thereafter; and, 
   Continuing protections for whistleblowers who were subjected to prohibited personnel actions prior to their agency or unit being exempted from the WPA. 
   In conclusion, I would like to once again thank each of the parties who have been involved in the ongoing development of this critically important legislation. I would also like to thank those courageous citizens who have blown the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. If we truly want to eliminate waste, fraud, and gross mismanagement throughout the Federal Government, then we need to empower and protect our Federal employees who are on the front lines of government operations and best positioned to witness this waste, fraud, and gross mismanagement. This legislation provides such empowerment and protection. I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PLATTS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 985. It is important for any number of reasons. The bipartisan nature of this bill itself is I think in many ways reason enough. We have reached across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that we do what is right for the American public, for the traveling public and for the safety of all of us. 
   Mr. Chairman, as an intelligence officer myself, I know full well from firsthand experience the importance of having lines of communication open so the right information is getting to decisionmakers, and that right information can often include telling us what is not going right, what has gone wrong and how we can fix it.     
   It is vital that people have the opportunity and avenues and conduits through which they can give good information, information when things are going well and information when things are not going well. All of this ultimately makes us a safer, stronger Nation. That is why I urge all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 985.

   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the Merit Systems Protection Board to rely on a consistent standard for clear and convincing evidence, which is the burden of proof that must be met to sustain an agency's affirmative defense that it would have taken the same personnel action in question independent of an employee's protected contact. 
   Under the amendment, clear and convincing evidence will be defined as ``evidence indicating that the matter to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain.'' This standard is consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent and administrative decisions for remedial employment statutes. 
   By way of background, when Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, it intended to toughen the legal burden of proof for a Federal agency's affirmative defense once a whistleblower establishes a prima facie case of retaliation from ``preponderance of the evidence'' to ``clear and convincing evidence.'' However, just the opposite has occurred. The clear and convincing evidence standard is now the primary basis cited to rule against whistleblowers in decisions on merits. 
   The reason behind this is that the Merit Systems Protection Board has created a unique test for clear and convincing evidence which is inconsistent with long-established judicial and administrative norms. In assessing the standard, the board considers three factors: 
   First, the merits of an agency's stated independent justification for acting against a whistleblower; second, whether there was a motive to retaliate; and third, whether the action reflects discriminatory treatment compared to that afforded employees who have not engaged in protective conduct.  
   The three-part test leaves the board with broad discretion in any given case with respect to how many criteria an agency must demonstrate and what level of proof must be demonstrated for each factor. 
   Adoption of this amendment is necessary in order to restore congressional intent in passing the Whistleblower Protection Act.     
   Through the WPA and this legislation we are now considering, Congress has defined the terms for two of the three tests an employee must pass to obtain relief: ``reasonable belief'' and ``contributing factor.'' For the administrative process to function as intended, Congress must also define ``clear and convincing evidence.'' 
   Accordingly, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment. I appreciate this amendment being made in order by the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This amendment is intended to address situations in which an employee faces retaliation for being associated with whistleblowers through his or her testimony in a legal proceeding, and to encourage cooperation with Inspector General and Office of Special Counsel investigations, as well as compliance with the law. 
   Oddly, under current law, whistleblowers who make their disclosures of waste, fraud or abuse in the context of another employee's legal appeal, a grievance hearing, an Inspector General or Office of Special Counsel investigation are not given the same protections as other whistleblowers, such as those who blow the whistle on national television. This simply does not make sense. 
   My amendment would rectify this situation in three ways. First, the amendment would clarify that a protected disclosure cannot be disqualified because of the forum in which it is made, such as through witness testimony in another employee's appeal. 
   Second, the amendment would establish more realistic burdens of proof, the same as exist in most whistleblower cases, for those who were retaliated against because they testified on behalf of an employee exercising their legal rights, because they cooperated with an Inspector General or Special Counsel investigation, or because they refused to obey an order that would have required a violation of the law. 
   And third, the amendment gives these whistleblowers access to the same due process rights as other whistleblowers. 
   Testifying under oath, cooperating with an Inspector General or Special Counsel investigation, and refusing orders to violate the law are all important ways by which public servants can expose waste, fraud and abuse in the government. Accordingly, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. I thank the ranking member for yielding me the time. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Access to Student Loans Act. While not a complete solution to the current credit crunch that exists in the student loan market, this bill is a very important and strong starting point to ensure that students can continue to obtain affordable loans for their education. 
   I am especially pleased that the manager's amendment included a provision that I was planning to offer as a stand-alone amendment to the underlying bill. Specifically, this provision will permit the Secretary of Education to enter into forward purchasing agreements with student loan lenders when purchasing loans through the newly established secondary market. This contractual agreement will provide the necessary confidence for lenders to not only participate in the market, but to continue to originate loans for students. 
   Some lenders, such as the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, PHEAA, in my home State, have recently announced that they will not be originating additional loans due to the unstable market conditions. This could result in difficulties for students in Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, in obtaining the loans they need. 
   It is imperative that Secretary Spellings at the Department of Education continue to work with Congress, as well as Secretary Paulson at the Department of Treasury and Chairman Bernanke at the Federal Reserve Bank, to provide access to capital sources for use in originating and purchasing loans. 
   Last month, I joined with the majority of my colleagues in the Pennsylvania delegation in sending a letter to Secretaries Spellings and Paulson and Chairman Bernanke requesting that they adopt both a short-term strategy to inject revenue into the student loan market and a long-term strategy to prevent future capital market disruptions. 
   While H.R. 5715 is a very important step in the right direction, the actions of Secretaries Spellings and Paulson and Chairman Bernanke will continue to be critically important to getting the student loan market fully back on track. 
   I certainly commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for bringing forward this bipartisan piece of legislation--and, as the ranking member said, in such a quick fashion--the committee leadership and staff in getting this bill to the House floor aimed at providing relief to both students and lenders. 
   Again, I also thank the chairman for including language in his manager's amendment providing for forward purchasing agreements. Allowing these agreements with the Department of Education will help to stabilize market conditions and thereby encourage lenders to originate more loans. 
   I strongly support this legislation and encourage a ``yes'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution to support the goals and ideals of National Community College Month. 
   Community colleges are centers of educational opportunity. For over 100  years, they have been inclusive institutions that welcome all who desire to learn, regardless of wealth, heritage or previous academic experience.     
   Since their creation, community colleges have grown tremendously in numbers and have changed with the times. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, there are over 1,000 community colleges in this country serving about 11 million students. No other segment of higher education is more responsive to its community and workforce needs than the community college. 
   The community colleges help provide the country with professionals in fields like computer technology, law enforcement, homeland security, nursing and other health care fields. About 50 percent of new nurses are educated at community colleges, and close to 80 percent of firefighters, law enforcement officers, and emergency medicine technicians received their credentials from community colleges. 
   Not only do community colleges serve a unique role in graduating students with specific skills, but they are also extremely affordable. Tuition and fees at public community colleges average less than half of those at public 4-year colleges and one-tenth the tuition and fees at independent 4-year colleges. 
   In my congressional district, the Harrisburg Area Community College is a shining example of the important and successful role of community colleges in our Nation's higher education system. In fact, I am fortunate to have two branches of the Harrisburg Area Community College in my congressional district, in York and Gettysburg. Graduates from HACC begin careers in fields currently experiencing shortages such as nursing, early childhood education, and law enforcement. I have seen firsthand the successful partnerships created between the community college and local businesses. 
   We hope to continue to build on the support being given to community colleges through the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The reauthorization is an opportunity to look at every program individually and determine if it is helping us meet our goal of providng a quality and affordable post-secondary education to every American. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution honoring the goals and ideals of National Community College Month. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 112, supporting the goals and ideas of a National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. I would like to thank my colleague from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for her leadership on this issue and for introducing the resolution we are considering here today. 
   Child care is an integral part of the daily routine of millions of families with young children. Working parents depend on child care so they can earn the income needed to support their families, as well as ensure that their children are well cared for in safe environments while they are working. As a result, approximately 63 percent of children under 5 years of age are in some type of regular child care environment each week. 
   High-quality child care, care that provides a stable, safe, stimulating environment, helps children enter school prepared to learn. Research has repeatedly shown that children who receive high-quality child care demonstrate greater mathematical ability, greater attention and thinking skills and fewer behavioral problems than children who receive low-quality care. 
   Quality care is directly linked to the quality of the educators, helping children to grow, learn and gain new skills is rewarding. However, it's very physically and emotionally taxing, as educators work long days, must be constantly alert, deal effectively with disruptive children, anticipate and prevent trouble, and provide firm but fair discipline. As a result, many child care workers leave the profession. The turnover rate in this industry is roughly 30 percent per year. 
   Compensation and additional training are important variables to ensure a high quality child care environment for our children. We need to attract and retain educators who have the caring, consistent relationships that are critical to children's development. I am pleased to commend our Nation's child care providers for their dedicated service to our Nation's children and their families. 
   I think it's important that we are taking time to recognize the critically important work of child care providers and the importance of doing better when it comes to their pay and benefits. 
   As a parent myself, my children, now second grade, fourth graders, went through a preschool program that was exceptional, it was certified. In that facility, we had both the preschool program and a very high-quality child care center as well. We saw the benefits to our children personally of that professional setting. An important part of being able to retain professional workers, staff, in those settings, is the pay and benefits. 
   When we look at the quality of these facilities, if we don't reduce that turnover rate, that 30 percent turnover rate, we will continue to be challenged to get somebody new in and get them up to speed. That impacts the quality of the care provided. 
   So I, again, commend the sponsor of the resolution for helping to raise national recognition and the importance of this issue, and urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The Florida Gators team will certainly go down as one of the best teams in the history of college basketball. After winning back-to-back championships this year, Coach Billy Donovan said, ``I sit up here very, very humbled, because I think I was fortunate enough over the last 2 years to coach a group of guys that has to go down in history as one of the greatest teams of all time.'' 
   The love for the game and each other, the hustle and hard work that the players exemplified the past 2 years is something they certainly learned from their head coach, Billy Donovan. At the young age of 41, Coach Donovan is now in some elite company being one of only four active coaches to have won multiple championships. 
   I extend my heartiest congratulations to Head Coach Donovan, all of the hardworking players, their fans, and all members of the University of Florida family, including another distinguished graduate of the University of Florida who I would be in trouble with if I didn't mention when I go home tonight. My next oldest brother, Mark Platts, graduated in 1987 with a master's degree from the University of Florida.

   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support House Resolution 344, congratulating charter schools and their students, parents, teachers and administrators across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education. 
   Charter schools are innovative public schools with a simple interest in providing a quality education to children in their communities. They explore new educational approaches, such as longer school days or extended school years, and are free from most rules and regulations governing conventional public schools. 
   These schools meet the student achievement and accountability requirements under No Child Left Behind in the same manner as traditional public schools and they often set higher individual goals to ensure that they are of high quality. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from New York, Louisiana, Connecticut, elsewhere around the country in recognizing these innovative public schools, and I am proud to recognize this week as National Charter Schools Week. 
   I commend President Bush for his recent proclamation stating, quote, ``recognizing the important contributions of charter schools,'' as well on the executive branch side; and again urge a ``yes'' vote for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Chair, the adoption of this amendment would help to ensure sufficient competition among the designers and manufacturers of water and wastewater treatment equipment across the country. It is premised on the idea that small firms ought to have the same chance at bidding on a project as large firms. In addition, with there being a critical need to upgrade our water and sewer infrastructure, requiring States to ensure a full and open competition would likely reduce the cost of the program and help finance additional and much needed projects. 
   This amendment would simply provide that, ``No specification for bids shall be written in such a manner as to contain proprietary, exclusionary or discriminatory requirements other than those based upon performance, unless such requirements are necessary to test or demonstrate a specific thing or to provide for necessary interchangeability of parts and equipment.'' 
   The amendment further provides that, ``When in the judgment of the grantee, it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 'brand name or equal' description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement, and in doing so the grantee may not establish existence of any source other than the brand or source so named.''     
   The language found in this amendment is the same competition requirement that was applied to grants provided under title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. While not identical, it is also very similar to a competition requirement adopted by my home State of Pennsylvania for its revolving fund. 
   I appreciate the Rules Committee having made the amendment in order, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. PLATTS. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I rise here today to welcome as guest chaplain on the floor of the House of Representatives Rabbi Irwin N. Goldenberg, a constituent, friend, well-liked and well-respected religious leader in my home community. Rabbi Goldenberg has served at Temple Beth Israel in York, Pennsylvania, since 1973. 
   With Rabbi Goldenberg's retirement set for June 2008, numerous members of Temple Beth Israel approached my office and suggested he be invited as a guest chaplain. I was very pleased to have forwarded the request along to Father Coughlin and am grateful that Rabbi Goldenberg was able to give the opening prayer this morning. 
   Rabbi Goldenberg is a graduate of Rutgers University and Hebrew Union College. He is married to Joyce Meschmar and has two grown children, Rachel and Dahlia. 
   In addition to his general rabbinic duties, Rabbi Goldenberg has taught countless adults, children and teens at Temple Beth Israel and its religious school. He has also taught at York College and Gettysburg College, both located in the 19th Congressional District. Rabbi Goldenberg has also been extensively involved in his community, from being a member of the board of the York Jewish Community Center to teen pregnancy mentoring at the YWCA to serving on the task force on domestic violence. 
   It is a true honor to have Rabbi Goldenberg with us here today. I thank him for the prayer that he offered and I wish him the best for an enjoyable and relaxing retirement in the years to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (Announcement by the Chairman -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Chairman, before I address my amendment I certainly want to commend Chairman Obey and the ranking member, Mr. Walsh, and their staffs for their dedicated work on this very important appropriations bill. I sincerely appreciate their efforts. 
   Madam Chairman, literacy skills are the cornerstone of our education system. I think that we can all agree that students who struggle with reading face challenges in all subject areas in school. 
   Unfortunately, children of parents who themselves have difficulty reading English are even more likely to perform at low literacy levels. For this reason, my predecessor, the Honorable Bill Goodling, former Republican chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, established the Even Start Family Literacy Program. 
   Even Start is the only Federal education program that teaches literacy skills to both parents and their children. Through this program parents receive the necessary skills to become a teacher to their children and to improve their lives. 
   Even Start serves the most economically and educationally disadvantaged population in the country. According to a Department of Education report, 84 percent of Even Start's families are at or below the Federal poverty level. Nearly half of Even Start families have an annual household income of under $6,000, and 84 percent of Even Start adults do not have a high school diploma or GED. 
   Even Start is a program that provides disadvantaged families with an opportunity to provide a better life for their children. Parents enroll in Even Start to become better parents, to further their education, and to improve their children's chance of success in school. 
   At the Even Start centers in my hometown of York, Pennsylvania, I've witnessed firsthand the positive and significant impact that this program is having on parents and children alike. 
   The Even Start program has yielded successful results. A 2005 Texas A&M study has found that, on average, employment rates rise from 17 percent to 51 percent after program completion. In addition, wages increased by more than 25 percent. 
   Despite these positive results, and even with the Appropriations Committee's approximately $17 million proposed increase over the fiscal year 2007 funding level, the underlying bill's proposed funding level for the Even Start program is 60 percent less than the amount provided in 2002. Even Start centers struggled this past year to keep their doors open, and many had to close their doors permanently because of this drastic funding cut. 
   For these reasons, I've introduced this amendment to H.R. 3043. My amendment would increase the appropriations for the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Program by $50 million, bringing its total appropriation to $149 million. While this increase may seem significant, it's important to put the proposed level of $149 million into perspective. Even with the increased proposed in this amendment, the total level of funding for Even Start will still be 40 percent less than the funding levels provided in fiscal years 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. In fact, the underlying bill's funding level is less than what was provided even 13 fiscal years back, in 1995. 
   I certainly thank Chairman Obey for his support and advocacy of the Even Start program throughout many years. The Even Start program helps our most disadvantaged parents better their lives for themselves and their children. 
   I hope all Members will join me in supporting the Even Start program. I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS HIGHLIGHTED THROUGH NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 293, which supports the goals and ideals highlighted through National Volunteer Week. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from New Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) for introducing this legislation and bringing it to the floor here today. 
   As we have heard, National Volunteer Week has been celebrated since 1974, when President Nixon signed an executive order establishing this annual celebration of volunteerism. 
   As we now celebrate another National Volunteer Week, we are reminded that community service takes place through efforts both large and small throughout our great country. This year's Volunteer Week theme is Inspire by Example, and countless individuals of all backgrounds and ages inspire others every day through their efforts to address the common concerns of our neighborhoods, communities, Nation, and world. And I know personally that it was the example of my parents, Babs and Dutch Platts, volunteering in our community as a Sunday school teacher, a Little League coach, running the school candy sales; their example of volunteerism for me and my four siblings helped to inspire my interest in public service and pursuit of this very position I now hold. 
   Our country has seen the inspiring example of our citizens' willingness to serve others in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and rebuilding efforts along the gulf coast, and in response to countless other tragedies, large and small, that touch lives every day. 
   Community service isn't just about responding to disaster. It is also about lifting a hand to help a neighbor, teaching a child to read, restoring a neglected park, and numerous other acts of good will that reaffirm our common humanity. As cochair of the National Service Caucus here in the House with Representatives CHRIS SHAYS, DORIS MATSUI and DAVID PRICE, I am particularly interested in seeing the spirit of volunteerism celebrated and extended to as many Americans as possible. 
   As this resolution says, more than a quarter of this country's population volunteered in some capacity from September of 2005 to September of 2006 at an estimated value or benefit to our country of $280 billion. I certainly hope these numbers continue to grow. 
   I also want to express my thanks to the thousands of organizations and their leaders across the country that capture the spirit of our volunteers and bring that spirit to bear in a concentrated way to relieve suffering, provide opportunities to the needy, to clean up our communities, and bring hope to millions. These organizations and the public and private partners that support them provide needed infrastructure to support the energy of our community service providers. 
   As this resolution states, National Volunteer Week will continue to raise awareness of the role that volunteers play in local, national and international communities, and their commitment to improving lives, strengthening communities and fostering civic engagement. 
   Again, I thank my colleague, Ms. Shea-Porter, and urge my colleagues to support National Volunteer Week and to support House Resolution 293. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (COMMENDING THE KANSAS JAYHAWKS FOR WINNING THE 2008 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1096, commending the University of Kansas Jayhawks for winning the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I basketball championship. 
   On April 7 of this year, trailing 60-51 with just 2:12 left in regulation, the University of Kansas Jayhawks mounted a comeback that will go down as one of the most memorable in NCAA history. In overtime, the Jayhawks defeated Memphis 75-68 to win the national championship, its fifth national title in school history. With this win, the Jayhawks achieved a school record for all-time season wins, posting a 37-3 record during their run for the title. The Jayhawks finished the season with a 13-game winning streak, securing the Big 12 Conference championship in addition to the national title. 
   Jayhawks guard Mario Chalmers was chosen as the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament Team along with guard Brandon Rush and forward Darrell Arthur. Seniors  Jeremy Case, Darnell Jackson, Sasha Kaun, Russell Robinson, Rodrick Stewart and Brad Witherspoon ended their collegiate careers with a national championship. In addition, this was Head Coach Bill Self's first NCAA title. He improved his all-time record at Kansas to 142 wins, 32 losses. 
   KU has a rich history beyond the basketball court as well. Opened in 1866, the University of Kansas is a comprehensive educational and research institution with 29,000 plus students and more than 2,000 faculty members. KU includes the main campus in Lawrence, a city of about 88,000 in northeastern Kansas; the Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas; the Edwards Campus in Overland Park; a clinical campus of the School of Medicine in Wichita; and educational and research facilities throughout the State. 
   Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winners have graduated from this great university, and many pharmacists, teachers, nurses and doctors have begun their careers at KU as well. 
   Today, I would like to congratulate Robert Hemingway, KU's Chancellor; Lew Perkins, the Director of Athletics; the student athletes, the students, alumni and all fans for the Jayhawks' historic win. 
   I'm happy to join with my colleague, Representative Moore, in honoring this exceptional team and all its accomplishments, and wish them continued success in their future endeavors. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1119, which supports the goals and ideals highlighted through National Volunteer Week. I am proud to have introduced this resolution, with my National Service Caucus cochairs, Representatives CHRIS SHAYS, DAVID PRICE, and DORIS MATSUI, as well as Representative BUCK MCKEON.  
   Mr. Speaker, National Volunteer Week was created in 1974, when President Richard Nixon signed an executive order to establish the week as an annual celebration of volunteering. Every year since that time, each President of the United States, along with many Governors, mayors, and other elected officials, have signed a proclamation promoting National Volunteer Week. 
   This year, National Volunteer Week is being recognized this very week, April 27 to May 3. Various events are being held throughout the Nation to promote the 2008 theme of ``Volunteer to Change the World.'' 
   Throughout the history of the United States, Americans have valued an ethic of service. Volunteering not only has a positive impact on local communities, but also on the volunteer himself or herself. Those Americans who give their time to serve are valuable assets to our local communities, and National Volunteer Week is our opportunity to thank them for their service and to encourage others to serve. 
   Across our country, Americans of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities are donating their time and talents to schools, churches, hospitals, and local nonprofits in an effort to improve their communities and serve a purpose greater than themselves. According to data collected over the past 30 years by the United States Census Bureau, Americans are volunteering at historically high rates. Between September 2006 and September 2007, 61.2 million Americans donated their time to help others, by mentoring students, beautifying neighborhoods, restoring homes after disasters, and much more. 
   In fact, earlier this week I had the pleasure of participating in a recognition ceremony at a local senior center, the Red Land Area Senior Center in York County, Pennsylvania, where dozens of senior volunteers and others were recognized for thousands of hours of donated volunteer service time in 2007. In fact, the top two volunteers recognized, Jim Fitzkee and Leona Deardorff, each contributed almost 700 hours of volunteer service to this center in 2007. 
   Volunteering is not only a rewarding but a necessary aspect of meeting the most pressing needs facing our Nation, including combating crime and gangs, poverty, disasters, illiteracy, and homelessness. Volunteering is also an important part of maintaining the health of our citizens, as research consistently shows that those who volunteer, especially those 65 years of age and older, lead healthier lives than those who do not engage in their communities. The intangible benefits alone, such as pride, satisfaction, empowerment, and accomplishment are worthwhile reasons to serve and give back. 
   Today I would like to recognize the diligent efforts of our major federally funded community service and volunteer service programs, thank the millions of dedicated and caring volunteers for their service, and encourage all Americans to give of themselves to make a difference in their local communities. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1119. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL 2008 AS NATIONAL SARCOIDOSIS AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1149, expressing support for the designation of the month of April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month to bring attention to this disease, its potential causes, and the need for research on the causes and potential treatments. 
   Sarcoidosis is a noncontagious systemic disease of unknown origin that causes inflamed, microscopic growths called granulomas that often affect one or more systems in the body, including the lungs, skin, eyes, and nervous system. This disease is sometimes difficult to diagnose. 
   The American Lung Association reports that more than 90 percent of the people diagnosed with sarcoidosis experience some degree of problem with their lungs which may reduce their ability to absorb oxygen. Because of scarring caused by the inflammations, between 20 and 30 percent of people with pulmonary sarcoidosis end up with some degree of permanent lung damage. Although death is relatively uncommon, mortality can occur due to lung failure or if the disease causes serious damage to a vital organ other than the lungs. 
   It has been observed that the disease occurs throughout the world in all races and both sexes, although gender and ethnicity may have an impact on the risk of developing sarcoidosis and its severity. Women and people of African descent, along with those of Scandinavian, German, Irish and Puerto Rican descent, are particularly prone to the disease and its more chronic and serious manifestations. The reasons for this are yet unknown. 
   The cause or causes of sarcoidosis remain a mystery. Our best medical evidence to date has not discovered the extent to which lifestyle, environment, or heredity affects the development, severity, or length of this disease. 
   The American Lung Association reports that most researchers believe that the disease involves an altered immune system. Some studies suggest sarcoidosis is caused by a respiratory infection triggered by bacteria or a virus, or even by exposure to burning wood. Others suggest possible occupational or environmental risks. And some studies also show that sarcoidosis may run within families, suggesting a genetic link. 
   Medical science has developed treatments that manage the symptoms of the disease, but no treatment is clearly effective for a prolonged period, and there is no cure. 
   Considering the broad reach of this disease, across people of different genders and ethnicities throughout the  world, and the lack of scientific evidence as to its cause or a cure, it is important to acknowledge the efforts of individuals and organizations to observe National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month and work on promoting awareness and the search for the cause and effective treatments. I am pleased, therefore, to stand in support of this resolution and ask for a ``yes'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1154, supporting the mission and goals of Workers Memorial Day in order to honor, remember and pay tribute to the workers who have been killed or injured in the workplace. 
   Monday, April 28 marked the 20th annual Workers Memorial Day, a day to honor our Nation's workers who were injured or lost their lives as a result of incidents in the workplace. 
   I was honored in my district in York, Pennsylvania, to participate with the York Adams County Central Labor Council in a Worker Memorial Day ceremony where three individuals were remembered following their deaths in the workplace in 2007, and pay tribute to them, with their families being in our thoughts and prayers and our sympathies going out to them on the loss of their loved ones.  
   We remember and pay tribute to all Americans who have given the most to ensure our Nation's economic growth and sustainability. On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to guarantee a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. 
   Employers, employees, and the local, State, and Federal Governments have all shared in the mission of protecting our Nation's workforce. I would note, Mr. Speaker, that labor organizations are not specifically mentioned in the resolution, but certainly they have played a critically important role in promoting and enhancing workplace safety. We all aspire to have hazard-free workplaces, and the combined efforts of these groups and individuals have moved us closer towards achieving this goal. 
   According to OSHA Administrator Edwin Foulke, Jr., in 2006, the Department of Labor reported that the Nation's injury and illness incident rate of 4.4 per 100 employees was the lowest ever recorded. Additionally, fatality rates remain at historic lows. Clearly these numbers show that workplaces are getting safer, but we must ensure that this trend continues. 
   April 28 also commemorated the 37th anniversary of the start-up of the Department of Labor's Occupation Safety and Health Administration. We commend OSHA for years of hard work and dedication. From day one, the agency has promoted a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. OSHA's regulations, educational efforts, and enforcement activities have enhanced both workplace safety and success across the United States. 
   Moving forward, it is important to remember that OSHA cannot guarantee the safety of our workers by itself. OSHA cannot write and enforce rules effectively if it does not receive adequate funding and valuable input from all interested stakeholders. We must ensure that our efforts to enhance workplace safety provide for this funding and input. We must maintain a strong commitment to work with OSHA on its mission of protecting the American worker. 
   Even one workplace injury or fatality is one too many. Workers Memorial Day serves to reaffirm our commitment to protecting all employees. On a day when we remember those who have sacrificed so much, it is clear Americans must work together to ingrain a culture of safety in all workplaces. I am pleased to support this resolution and ask for a ``yes'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1100, congratulating the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team. 
   Since the program began in 1911, the University of Iowa wrestling team has had a rich tradition and a history of producing champions and outstanding collegiate athletes and coaches, and this year proved to be no different as the top-ranked Hawkeyes wrestling team clinched its 21st national team title in the NCAA championships. In addition to the team title, the Hawkeyes also crowned two national championships, Mark Perry and Brent Metcalf; seven All-Americans; and six Academic All-Big Ten wrestlers. 
   At the helm of this outstanding team sits Head Coach Tom Brands, who was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year and the National Wrestling Coaches Association's Coach of the Year. Coach Brands, a former Hawkeyes wrestler, 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and four time All-American, is in his second season as head wrestling coach at the University of Iowa. 
   Former head coach and Olympic gold medalist Dan Gable should also be commended for his leadership and guidance provided to the current 2008 championship team. Throughout his tenure, Coach Gable helped establish one of the most successful wrestling programs in the Nation. 
   The University of Iowa wrestling team has brought honor to themselves, but I would be remiss if I failed to also recognize the university for its outstanding commitment as a public university. Established in 1847, Iowa has won international recognition for its wealth of achievements in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Iowa was the first United States public university to admit men and women on an equal basis and the first institution of higher education in the Nation to accept creative work in theater, writing, music, and art as theses for advanced degrees. It established the first law school and the first educational radio station west of the Mississippi, broadcast the world's first educational television programs, and developed and continues to hold preeminence in educational testing. 
   I extend my congratulations to the University's president, Sally Mason; Athletics Director Gary Barta; Head Coach Tom Brands and his staff; all the hardworking wrestlers; their fans; and the entire University of Iowa community. 
   I am happy to join with my distinguished colleague Representative Loebsack in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.

   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1130, recognizing the roles and contributions of America's teachers in educating and nurturing our Nation's children and thereby building and enhancing our Nation's civic, cultural and economic well-being. 
   A teacher's role in student development is irreplaceable. All of our lives have been influenced by the teachers that directed our classrooms, classrooms where students acquire the knowledge necessary to become a part of our Nation's future. 
   Showing teachers appreciation and recognition during the upcoming National Teacher Appreciation Week which takes place next week helps to remind us how important teachers are and what an integral role they play in the lives of our Nation's citizens. It is important that we recognize teachers for the critical work they do in improving our Nation in so many ways. 
   Teachers today devote more of their lives to teaching young people than ever before and spend more time on professional development, their own education and on class preparation outside the classroom. Teachers spend an average of over 50 hours per week on teaching duties and an average of $443  each year out of their own pockets to meet the needs of their students, all the while earning an average annual salary of slightly more than $31,000. 
   The future of our Nation's children is dependent on the individuals to make these time, energy and monetary commitments, and they deserve recognition for their service. 
   On a personal note, I certainly am honored to recognize the teachers I had in kindergarten through 12th grade in the New York suburban school district and know but for their support and guidance, I would not have had the opportunity to pursue my dreams, including the dream of serving in this very body, the United States House of Representatives. 
   Behind the upbringing of my mom and dad, my teachers, Dorothy Mirtz, my third grade teacher who is now 97 years old and still going strong as I visited with her just a few weeks back, my eighth grade teacher, Earl Lucius, who took the lessons of my parents of community service and inspired me to pursue a career in public service, they and so many other teachers and administrators I had the blessing to interact with in my education and career played a critical role in my life, as teachers do in all of our Nation's children's lives, in the past, the present and the future. 
   So I am honored and pleased to stand in support of this resolution, recognizing the important roles and contributions of America's teachers and support National Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   I certainly thank my colleague, Mr. Graves from Missouri, for introducing this resolution, and encourage an ``aye'' vote in favor of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I certainly support the underlying goal of this legislation about making higher education more affordable for our citizens, and I plan to support this legislation to move the process forward because it is an important goal we are after. 
   I know from personal experience the importance of student loans. I am probably one of the few Members of this Chamber that was elected while still paying for student loans. In fact, my wife and I could not have afforded our undergraduate degrees and our graduate degrees without the support of grants and loans, and we were delighted when we were able to pay the loans back a few short years ago. 
   While I support the underlying goal, however, I need to raise concerns about the manner in which we are attacking this issue and some of the substance of the issue. 
   First, the process. This bill has not been allowed to have committee hearings. There has been no opportunity for amendments in committee, and certainly no opportunity for amendments here on the floor. In fact, we have a closed rule, no amendments. If we had followed regular order and taken this bill through the committee process, we could have taken a bill with a good intent and made it a good piece of legislation on behalf of all of our Nation's citizens and done even better than we will do today. 
   I also need to address the failure of this legislation to address the reason that students are in need of more and higher student loans, the reason they need to borrow more and more, and that is ever-increasing tuition rates. 
   To the great credit of the distinguished gentleman from California, in previous years we sought to address that issue. He led the charge to try to work with the institutions of higher education across this country to be reasonable, to be responsible. This legislation does not address that at all. 
   I am often surprised when higher education institutions lobby for greater loan limits, and they don't disclose to their students the reason that they need higher loans is because those very institutions keep raising their tuition rates. This bill does not address that unfortunately. 
   I am also very disappointed that this bill does not address the ability of students to get into colleges, those up-front costs and the initial costs. This is about graduates who are in repayment. It does not help new students to help families get their children into school. 
   Unlike the Deficit Reduction Act, and this was addressed earlier by one of the previous speakers, that legislation actually gave additional assistance to students in going to school, significantly higher grant program amounts, I think over $5 billion in new grant programs; lower loan fees that the distinguished gentleman from California addressed, from 4 percent to 1 percent; higher loan limits for those early years of college. 
   It made it more affordable for students, especially low- and middle-class family students, to get into college and to pay their bills as they were in college. This bill does not address that. 
   Finally, while I certainly support the pay-as-you-go approach and voted in favor of that reform this past week, this bill achieves that goal in a gimmick fashion. The way it spreads out  the reduction and pays for this is not true pay-as-you-go. And I think if we are going to do right by our citizens, in this case by those seeking and getting higher education opportunities, we need to make the tough decisions and truly pay for what we are providing in assistance. 
   I will vote in favor of this legislation to move the process forward, but I hope as it moves forward and we get to work with the Senate, that we will do much better in truly assisting the students who are trying to get into school or who are in school now with the cost of higher education. If we do so, as we have done in the past in some important ways with the Deficit Reduction Act, we truly will be about helping our Nation's students.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I certainly appreciate his leadership on this very important issue. I do appreciate the ranking member's issues he has raised and that perhaps this amendment doesn't go far enough in what it includes in the type of renewable energy that is acknowledged. 
   I would say that this is a starting point. If we support this amendment, if we get into conference, then we can build on this to look at other options. But we have to start somewhere. I think this is a good starting point. 
   So I rise in support of this amendment which would establish a National Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard of 15 percent by 2020. A 15 percent RPS is an important step that we can take to meet our growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly manner and decrease our dependence on foreign oil and create more jobs. 
   A study by Woods McKenzie found that a 15 percent RPS would decrease the price of natural gas by 15 to 20 percent, decrease wholesale electricity prices by 7 to 11 percent, for a savings of $240 billion to consumers and would avoid almost 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide by the year 2030. 
   In addition, a Federal RPS would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. In fact, the top five States that have been hit hardest with the loss in their manufacturing economy over the past 6 years, California, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, and my home State of Pennsylvania, would benefit most from the creation of new agricultural and manufacturing jobs because of the passage of this amendment. My home State of Pennsylvania has established an RPS of 18 percent by 2020. 
   Since its inception in 2004, the Renewable Energy Standard is associated with the creation of several thousand new jobs. Projections show that a national RPS would create an additional 7,000 jobs in my State alone. Momentum has been steadily growing for a national RPS. Currently, almost half of all States have implemented such an RPS standard. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe a national RPS is an important step to make to reduce pollution and lessen addiction to foreign energy sources. I urge a yes vote, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5563, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act, which will strengthen our Nation's national and community service programs. As you know, we debated this legislation for hours last week and adopted some very positive amendments. I'm pleased that the majority has included these amendments in the bill, as well as the Republican motion to recommit, which will ensure that adequate criminal history checks will be performed on anyone seeking a federally funded national service position, and that individuals who are registered sex offenders or convicted murderers will not be selected for such positions. 
   While it was my hope that the duplicative Energy Conservation Corps is struck from the bill during the conference because the bill already addresses that through other sections of this legislation, I'm proud to be part of this effort to provide more flexibility for existing community service programs to ensure that the most innovative and effective grantees continue to receive funding and to increase the accountability within the corporation. 
   Programs such as Foster Grandparents and Learn and Serve truly impact the lives of America's most needy. AmeriCorps and NCCC participants engage often disadvantaged youth and provide them with a sense of pride and civic responsibility. These programs are truly win/win and provide a tremendous return on the Federal investment. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, and Chairwoman McCarthy for working with me, and for all the staff who have made this effort a success. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote and hope that my colleagues will support these commonsense reforms to our national service programs and to support the GIVE Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 6358, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act. H.R. 6358 puts protections in place to guard against abuse, neglect, and death at residential treatment programs. These residential treatment programs help seriously troubled teens with drug addiction or behavioral or emotional problems. For many parents, they are a last resort when no other treatments or interventions have worked. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle share a commitment to protect young people enrolled in residential treatment programs. Even one instance of abuse, neglect, or death is one too many. 
   The bill we are considering today has been developed in an effort to reach a bipartisan consensus. It's important to note that the provisions in the version of this bill that the Education and Labor Committee reported in May have been revised or edited, including the requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a new bureaucracy to inspect every private residential treatment program in every State, and the requirement creating a new private right of action for lawsuits. 
   This legislation ensures that the standards required in the bill apply to both public and private residential treatment programs. The language also contains strong background check requirements that ensure that before coming into contact with children, potential employees are thoroughly scrutinized with tools, including the National Sex Offender Registry and an FBI fingerprint check. 
   Stopping child abuse is a necessary and essential function of State and local government. It is clear to me that the most effective and appropriate way to protect those enrolled in these programs is to require States to establish a system of standards, licensure, and regulation to ensure that States are working to stop instances of abuse and neglect at residential treatment programs. The Federal role is to ensure that States live up to their vital responsibilities in stopping abuse in these facilities. 
   In this bill, the responsibility for licensing and inspecting these programs rests with the States and is tied to their receipt of funds under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The role of the Federal Government relates to establishing minimum standards and investigating instances of abuse and neglect upon a referral from a State. 
   I think Members on both sides of the aisle can agree that there's still more work to be done. Just yesterday, Congresswoman Bachmann offered a proposal to strengthen parental notification and consent requirements regarding prescription medications given to teens at residential treatment facilities. Hopefully, this important issue will be further addressed as this legislation moves through the legislative process. 
   In closing, it's important to acknowledge the great progress that has already been made to strike a bipartisan consensus. I especially want to commend Chairman Miller, Subcommittee Chairwoman McCarthy and Ranking Member McKeon, along with their staffs, for working together to strengthen this important effort to protect our nation's teens against abuse and neglect in residential treatment facilities. I stand in strong support of this important legislation and encourage my colleagues to also support it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2371, a bill providing for technical changes to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. This bill includes two necessary clarifications and corrections to ensure that this act, a series of financial aid changes made through this year's budget reconciliation process, is implemented as Congress intended. 
   The bill before us today would make some, but not all, of the important technical amendments that are needed to ensure that the Department of Education is able to put this law into place in a manner consistent with congressional intent. The bill clarifies the untaxed income and benefit items that are to be included in the needs analysis formula for purposes of determining what a family can actually pay for their child's education. It also ensures that borrowers selecting the new income-based repayment plan will not face a penalty simply because they are married. Finally, the bill also provides technical amendments to the TEACH Grant program. 
   There are several other important technical corrections in a bill that the House passed prior to the Thanksgiving Day recess. The changes clarified that members of the Armed Forces Reserves are eligible for student loan deferments when they return home after serving abroad. The House-passed bill also encouraged families to adopt older children by permitting any student that was in foster care through the age of 13 to be treated as an independent student, even if the child was adopted after the age of 13. Unfortunately, most of these changes will not be enacted because our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol eliminated them from the bill, despite the bipartisan support shown for these important reforms here in the House. 
   These reforms are technical in nature, but their consequences will be far-reaching. Prior to the Thanksgiving Day recess, the Education and Labor Committee unanimously passed a bill to expand college access and affordability. Consistent with that goal, this package of technical corrections will improve our financial aid programs by clarifying the intent of the recently enacted College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2517, the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007, which will amend the Missing Children's Assistance Act to authorize appropriations and for other purposes, and I want to commend both the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy), the chairwoman, for their leadership on this issue at the committee level and with the sponsorship of the legislation. And also on my side of the aisle, I commend the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) who will be speaking shortly for her leadership on this very important issue.     
   Every year, thousands of children are abducted or go missing. In 1984, Congress recognized the need for greater coordination of local, State, and Federal efforts to recover these children, and established the Missing and Exploited Children's Program under the Missing Children's Assistance Act. This act addresses the needs of missing, abducted, and sexually exploited children. The program was created to coordinate and support various Federal missing children's programs through the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP, and includes the authorization for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   The National Center is a not-for-profit corporation mandated by Congress which works in partnership with the Department of Justice. The center is funded in part by Congress and in part by the private sector and serves as the national resource center and clearinghouse for information on missing and exploited children. The National Center carries out many of the objectives of the Missing Children's Assistance Act in collaboration with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The National Center provides assistance to families and law enforcement agencies in locating and recovering missing and exploited children, both nationally and internationally. While the National Center receives leads on abducted, runaway, and sexually exploited youth and disseminates this information to various investigative law enforcement units, the center  itself does not conduct the investigation of these cases. 
   The National Center's Federal funding supports specific operational functions mandated by Congress, including a national 24-hour toll-free hot line; a distribution system for missing child photos; a system of case management and technical assistance to law enforcement and families; training programs for Federal, State and local law enforcement; and programs designed to help stop the sexual exploitation of children. 
   Today, more missing children come home safely than ever before; however, there is still important work to be done. Hundreds of children still do not make it home each year, and many more continue to be victimized by acts of violence. In fact, children are the most victimized segment of our society and crimes committed against children of all ages are the most underreported of any victim category. 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has worked with law enforcement on more than 133,000 missing child cases, and has played a role in reuniting more than 115,000 children with their families. With a 96.2 percent recovery rate, up from 62 percent in 1990, the National Center has analyzed more than 500,000 reports of crimes against children on the Internet and referred them to law enforcement, resulting in hundreds of arrests and successful prosecutions. 
   Today, law enforcement is responding more swiftly and effectively to reports of missing children. There is a national network in place, and parents are more alert, more aware, and talking to their children about their safety. With the changes made through this legislation, the Missing Children's Assistance Act and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will continue their important efforts focused on protecting our vulnerable missing children. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson) for his sponsorship of this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PANCREATIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support House Resolution 257. This resolution will to help increase awareness for pancreatic cancer, the deadliest of all cancers. 
   Mr. Speaker, few Americans may understand that pancreatic cancer is a horrific killer. This year alone, over 37,000 people will be diagnosed with this disease. Sadly, 99% of those diagnosed will lose their lives due to a lack of early detection tools. 
   Many Americans are not aware that pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers; only 4 percent of patients will survive beyond 5 years after diagnosis. This is why it is a moral imperative for Congress to work to increase awareness of this deadly cancer. 
   I became aware of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (known as ``Pan CAN'') through a constituent of mine, Bob Hammen, who lost his wife to this terrible disease. Pan CAN is the only national advocacy organization which provides support for pancreatic cancer patients and their families. 
   In their efforts to raise awareness for pancreatic cancer, Pan CAN regards each November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. H. Res. 257 supports Pan CAN's efforts to raise the awareness which is desperately needed to improve early detection methods and treatment for this disease. 
   Mr. Speaker, because all of our fellow citizens have family, friends, and neighbors who are regrettably vulnerable to this dreaded disease, I urge support from my distinguished colleagues for this resolution here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 793, which, as was well delineated, reauthorizes this very important legislation, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. 
   I am honored to join with Representative Bill Pascrell in introducing the House version of this legislation, which expands support systems for individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury. As the gentleman from New Jersey referenced, for the past 3 years, I have had the privilege of serving with him as cochair of the Congressional TBI Task Force. 
   I am pleased to recognize my distinguished colleague from New Jersey for his tremendous leadership and dedication related to TBI research and treatments over the course of many years. I have been delighted to serve as cochair for 3 years, but, long before that, the gentleman from New Jersey has been leading this effort and been a real champion of the importance of this work. I have been honored to work with the gentleman from New Jersey to bring awareness to the unique issues that surround TBI, such as frequent misdiagnoses and barriers to adequate and meaningful treatments. 
   Most Americans do not fully understand the amount of devastation caused by TBI each year. Most people do not realize that the incidence of TBI is greater than the incidence of breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries combined. 
   Additionally, TBIs can manifest themselves in various manners, from a small behavioral change to complete physical disability and even death. Brain injuries affect the whole family emotionally and financially, often resulting in substantial medical and rehabilitation expenses. 
   The TBI Act of 1996 produced extensive research at the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the incidence, detection and diagnosis of TBI. The time has come to better use these results and translate them into more extensive treatments. This is an important part of what Senate bill 793 aims to do. 
   In addition to expanding the research of NIH and CDC, this legislation will build on the support systems that States have already implemented to increase the independence and productivity of individuals living with TBI. 
   Soldiers returning from Iraq have brought much-needed attention to the variety of symptoms associated with TBI. Thanks to the state-of-the-art body armor with which our men and women overseas are equipped, these heroic individuals are able to survive violent attacks while receiving blunt force to the head. Studies have found that over 60 percent of all soldiers wounded in an explosion, vehicle accidents, gunshot wound to the head or neck sustain a traumatic brain injury. 
   This legislation provides additional support for States to integrate veterans into community-based treatments after these heroes return home from combat. 
   This is a bill aimed at helping individuals who, due to traumatic experiences, may never live their lives the same way again. Senate bill 793 builds on current research and support systems to help vulnerable individuals lead a more comfortable, productive and independent life. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and, I, again, commend my colleague from New Jersey for his great leadership in advancing this cause.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. I appreciate the ranking member for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5876, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act. This legislation will create and enforce safety standards for residential treatment facilities that serve to rehabilitate troubled youth. 
   While many residential treatment facilities for teens, such as boot camps and substance abuse treatment programs, provide effective rehabilitation services for troubled youth, it is the few bad actors that bring us here today. Families send their teens to residential treatment facilities many times after all other options have been exhausted. Though many of these programs involve extreme physical activities as part of their treatment plans, no child should be forced to endure suffocation, dehydration, or other types of physical abuse that surfaced during hearings that the Committee on Education and Labor held earlier this year. 
   While I supported the original bill, I believe that this manager's amendment makes the bill even stronger, and I thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for working together on this very important issue. 
   The substitute places the responsibility of monitoring and enforcement of these safety standards in the hands of each State government, rather than officials here in Washington. In addition, the manager's amendment would ensure that all facilities that provide treatment to children, public or private, are subject to safety standards. 
   I want to stress that not all residential treatment facilities are abusive or bad actors--in fact, quite the opposite. Through the process of considering this legislation, I have heard from many facilities which are proud of the positive impacts that they have had on the lives of teens. I've also heard from graduates from these programs who believe that they owe their lives to a treatment facility. 
   This bill, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act, aims to ensure that all programs are working in good faith to achieve these goals and do not use violence or intimidation under the guise of treatment. 
   Again, I'd like to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for working together to improve this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment and ultimately to support H.R. 5876, legislation that is critically important to the safety of our Nation's children.

<DOCNO>Mr. PLATTS. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today, and I certainly rise also in support of H.R. 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. This program will certainly strengthen and finally reauthorize the Nation's national and community service programs. And after 15 years, this reauthorization is certainly long overdue. 
   I want to add my words of praise and thanks to my Chair, Chairwoman  McCarthy, as well as to the full committee Chair, Chairman Miller, and the ranking member, BUCK MCKEON, for their important leadership in moving this reauthorization forward of this very important program that promotes active involvement of citizens of all ages. 
   In 1973, Congress passed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, DVSA, to foster and expand volunteer service in communities while helping vulnerable and disadvantaged populations such as the elderly and the poor. DVSA authorized the National Senior Volunteer Corps, made up of the Foster Grandparents Program, the Senior Companion Program, and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. 
   Seventeen years later, Congress passed the National and Community Service Act, NCSA, of 1990. NCSA aims to address unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs, as well as to renew a sense of civic responsibility by encouraging citizens to participate in national service programs. Authorized under NCSA are Learn and Serve America, AmeriCorps State and national grants, and the National Civilian Community Corps. 
   Both DVSA and NCSA are administered by the Corporation for National Community Service, and both laws were most recently amended in 1993 by the National and Community Service Act. While authorization of appropriations for both laws expired at the end of fiscal year 2006, these programs have remained funded through annual appropriations measures. 
   I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2857, the GIVE Act, and believe that this bill makes commonsense improvements to our Nation's national service programs. Not only does it provide increased flexibility for States, but importantly, and as referenced by Ranking Member McKeon, it also increases accountability and efficiency within the administration of these programs. 
   H.R. 2857 strengthens existing community and national service programs by providing year-round service opportunities for students and elderly alike, and further encourages involvement of disadvantaged youth. This legislation also expands eligibility requirements for senior serving programs like Foster Grandparents and the Senior Companion Program, ensuring that individuals with an interest in serving have options available to them. Finally, the GIVE Act reauthorizes DVSA and NCSA through fiscal year 2013. 
   Recent natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as the wild fires in California, have showcased the important efforts of AmeriCorps and NCCC volunteers. I am proud to be part of this effort to strengthen national service programs and ensure that participants can continue to aid disadvantaged and needy populations. And I have seen firsthand in my district the great work of senior citizens in the Senior Companion Program and young citizens in AmeriCorps partnering with Habitat for Humanity to truly make a difference in Central Pennsylvania. And we know that these efforts are being replicated across the country. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I hope that all will join in supporting the GIVE Act and vote in favor of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   As a number of speakers have talked about their own experience and the gentleman from Connecticut, through his work in the Peace Corps, these opportunities to participate in the programs that are funded and authorized under the National Community and Service Act impact not just those who receive the benefit of the work done, but those who actually participate. And with a family member who has participated in AmeriCorps, I have seen that impact on that individual and how they were a stronger person and better prepared for the rest of their adult years because of having been part of AmeriCorps.

   Mr. PLATTS. I want to commend the ranking member for offering this manager's amendment which makes several very important changes to the GIVE Act. 
   Most importantly, this amendment includes the language that would allow the Corporation for National and Community Service to support individuals who fill national service positions in small organizations that do not receive AmeriCorps grants. 
   This language was originally proposed by Mr. Souder in committee, and the manager's amendment reflects the bipartisan approach and the bipartisan compromise that was reached to infuse more individual control and local flexibility into the national service programs. 
   Also, I would like to reference that this amendment injects fair competition into the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program by requiring all programs to be competitively reevaluated by fiscal year 2013. For too long, these programs have continued to receive funding without any effort to determine if those programs are successfully making a difference in their communities, and this amendment will ensure that this is no longer the case. 
   So, I urge a ``yes'' vote in support of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

This amendment is similar to a study and pilot program dealing with veterans that was authorized through an amendment that passed in the committee. While I hope that as this bill moves forward we do not end up with studies and pilot programs for so many different areas that we lose our focus on the bill's priorities, I do believe that it is appropriate activity for the corporation to undertake this effort. 
   In general, unemployment remains extremely low by historical standards, despite concerns about the economy. However, for those communities such as the maker of the amendment referenced in her home State of Ohio that are experiencing unusually high job losses, it would be wise to explore ways to target national service efforts towards addressing those concerns. 
   Therefore, I support the amendment, and encourage a yes vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Chairman, while I certainly understand the focus and intent of this amendment, I rise in opposition and worry that this amendment will create more bureaucracy and administrative costs rather than focus on getting dollars out to the participants in the programs. 
   The focus of the GIVE Act is on streamlining our national service programs to make them more effective, efficient, and accountable. To do that, we have refocused a number of programs and added priorities to others to ensure that national service funds are being spent on initiatives that meet the most pressing needs. 
   We have accomplished that by working within the existing program structures rather than piling new programs on top of existing programs with similar purposes. I share the gentleman's concerns in the area of energy conservation. I believe a better approach to this issue would have been to work within existing structures. In fact, this bill already does that by addressing energy usage and conservation in a number of areas. 
   Learn and Service, a new Summer of Service program, includes a focus on energy conservation. And in the innovative program section of that program, energy conservation is specifically included as a type of program eligible for funding. 
   Under the National Civilian Community Corps, energy conservation was specifically added as a new purpose for that program. And under the programs of national significance authority within the Senior Corps, energy conservation and environmental stewardship were added as types of programs eligible for funding. 
   Obviously, infrastructure issues are found throughout the bill because we recognize that this is a priority in many locations. But establishing a new corps that will siphon away already scarce resources will only undermine the efforts of the amendment's sponsors to bring greater focus to these types of programs. 
   I understand this amendment authorizes $10 million for fiscal year 2009. Well, not within this specific act, but the Public Land Corps within the Department of the Interior already exists and is funded by the Federal Government at the amount of $2.5 million this year and it is authorized for $12 million. This program, the Public Land Corps, engages disadvantaged youth ages 16-24 in protecting public lands and the environment, including global warming and emissions reduction. 
   So my opposition is not to the focus of the effort, but I believe we are being duplicative and are going to waste hours on administrative costs in creating a new program rather than investing these dollars in existing programs that will better focus on energy conservation. 
   So I would encourage a ``no'' vote, and ask Members to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. PLATTS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to first take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude and deep respect for our troops and civilians serving in harm's way. I have had the privilege of visiting our troops in Iraq on four occasions and Afghanistan twice, and they and their families are truly the heroes in America. 
   I rise today in opposition to this resolution, a resolution that seeks to maintain the status quo, in essence, to stay the course, a scenario that everyone agrees is unacceptable. This resolution offers no alternative strategy. 
   As we consider the challenges in Iraq, we need to remember and learn from the lessons of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, we supported the people of Afghanistan in defeating the Soviets, helping throw the Soviets out of that country. In 1989, when that happened, what did we do? We walked away. We did not finish the job. We did not help the people of Afghanistan to stand up a secure and stable government. Instead, we walked away. Who filled the vacuum? The Taliban, and ultimately al Qaeda, a safe haven for them to plan attacks against America and its interests. 
   In 1989, I imagine that few Americans believed that what went on in the mountains of Afghanistan would impact the lives of Americans here at home. On September 11, 2001, in a tragic fashion we learned that that was the case, that what went on in Afghanistan mattered here at home. We cannot afford to make the same mistake now in Iraq, to allow Iraq to become a safe haven for al Qaeda and other enemies of our Nation and our citizens. 
   The Iraq Study Group offered a comprehensive approach to the challenges of Iraq. It included political, diplomatic, and military options. As part of the military proposal, it dismissed increasing our troop levels by 100,000 to 200,000 troops, saying it was not feasible and would lend to the argument of an occupation. 
   However, the Iraq Study Group did support more limited troop reinforcements. And I quote from the Iraq Study Group report: ``We could, however, support a short-term deployment or a surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the United States commander in Iraq determined that such steps would be effective.'' 
   The report goes on to dismiss the idea of an immediate withdrawal. Well, our commander in Iraq today, General Petraeus, an individual confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate, is on record supporting the need for these additional reinforcements. 
   Ultimately, the key to long-term success in Iraq is the Iraqi people themselves. They need to show the ability and the will to stand up and secure their emerging democracy. Having liberated Iraq from a regime of terror and torture, our role today is to assist the Iraqis in achieving a stable and secure nation. This reinforcement effort is part of that effort, along with regional diplomatic efforts and internal Iraqi political reconciliation efforts. We are now in the role of helping the Iraqis help themselves. We cannot forget the lessons of Afghanistan and walk away.
