<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS' 40TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I wish to take a moment to recognize the 40th anniversary of the Special Olympics and, in particular, Chicago's role in the wonderful program. As some of you may know, the first Special Olympics were held in my congressional district, the 7th Congressional District in Illinois on Chicago's Soldier Field on July 20, 1968. The idea for this event originated in 1967 when Anne Burke, a recreation teacher from the Chicago Park District, proposed holding a citywide track meet for people with disabilities, modeled after the Olympics. She was encouraged to hand in the proposal to Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the Kennedy Foundation; she did. It was at Chicago's Soldier Field that Eunice Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of the Special Olympics. One thousand athletes attended the first games from 26 States and Canada. The inaugural ceremony started with the quote, ``Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' These words came from the lips of the gladiators in ancient Rome and were wisely chosen by Kennedy Shriver to represent the goal of the Special Olympics. 
   Before the Special Olympics were started Eunice Shriver had already tried once to organize a camp that would help disabled children. This organization which started out with 35 boys was called Camp Shriver. It is amazing that something that started out with only 35 children has developed into the Special Olympics which now holds programs in more than 180 countries with more than 2.5 million athletes and counting. The Special Olympics is a program that allows people from all over the world, or most of it, to interact with one another. It is astonishing what can be achieved when someone has an idea. One idea can inspire people to do great things. 
   Congratulations to Special Olympics with its 40th anniversary. You have proven that great ideas give great outcomes. Thank you for making a difference and continue to inspire everyone.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (TRIBUTE TO SISTER LULA WALKER, FOUNDER OF TABITHA HOUSE SHELTER FOR BATTERED WOMEN AND CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of the most caring, most willing to share, most sensitive and most delightful ladies that I have ever known. Sister Lula Walker was a rock in her family, in her church, in her community, in her city, and in her country. She was a deeply religious lady, highly motivated, willing to sacrifice, and fiercely determined. She did not know how to retreat, and she did not know how to take ``no'' for an answer. 
   Raised in a Christian home, she met and married her husband, Reverend Willie Walker, a Christian man who is an ordained elder in the Church of God in Christ Church. Together Sister Walker, her husband Reverend Willie and their children have built a legacy of living and giving which will rarely be surpassed. 
   With little money and no public support, Sister Lula organized a ministry of providing for battered women and children. She named it Tabitha House, after the disciple Tabitha in Hebrew, or Dorcas in Greek. Tabitha was known for her good works, especially for helping widows and the poor. 
   Through her good works at Tabitha and in other ways, Sister Lula became the Mother Teresa of our community. Her work became so famous and well-known that she was invited to come to Washington D.C. and testify before Congress on the plight of women and children who are homeless and in need of shelter. 
   Sister Walker had several bouts of serious illness, but like Tabitha, or Dorcas, she was able to rise up and continue with her work. Finally, on Saturday, July 19th, 2008, Sister Lula could not rise anymore and graciously passed out of this life into another. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to extend to Reverend Willie Walker and the Walker family, the Tabitha House family and the Church of God in Christ church family our heartfelt condolences and the great joy that I have experienced as a result of knowing and working with the Mother Teresa of our community, the neighborhood where I live, Sister Lula Walker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, which is designed to level the playing field for those wishing to form and join labor unions. 
   Thomas Wolfe once said, ``To every man his chance, his golden opportunity to become whatever his talents, ambitions and hard work combine to make him.'' That is the premise of America. And I would imagine if he was alive today, he would just say, to every man and to every woman, their golden opportunities to become. 
   The ability to join like-minded people in pursuit of fairness, equity and increased opportunities should be the right of all people. This legislation affirms that right and helps to protect the greatest economy in the world, working class Americans who belong to unions. 
   I agree with those who say that every American has the right to organize. But those rights must be protected, promoted and made real. H.R. 800 does exactly that, I and strongly urge its passage.

Every kind of person that you can think of has some heritage from the Caribbean.

   And so Representative Fattah, I don't know if you will ever pass another piece of legislation as good as this one. I don't know how much longer you will stay in Congress, but I can tell you one thing, if you never pass another one, you did this one and it is one of the best, one of the most effective, one of the greatest that I have seen, and so I commend you for it.

And, Madam Speaker, I think it is a great day because there is a group of people sitting in my office right now who are GEAR UP representatives, and I told them that I was going to have to leave them to come here, but I commend them for all of the great work that they continue to do.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to extend congratulations to two of the citizens of my community, two of my constituents who have made invaluable contributions to the lives of people in the neighborhoods where they live, as well as people throughout America. 
   Madam Speaker, Tom and Lois Miller became and still are pillars of their community. They raised four daughters, have four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Ever since their marriage, they have been rocks of the Greater Zion Missionary Baptist Church. They are founding members of the 4500 West Congress Block Club in Chicago, and have been active in many other civic and social endeavors. For the past 10 years, they have lived in the village of West Chester, Illinois, where they have immersed themselves in community life. 
   Madam Speaker, 50 years is a long time and when you can spend those 50 years in a state of peace, happiness and productive engagement, you have been truly blessed, just as you have been able to bless others. I have been told that ``to those to whom much is given, much is expected in return.'' 
   The Millers have been fortunate to have a great family, great children, grandchildren, friends and relatives. They have given much to those who have known them, and have received much in return. 
   Mr. Miller has retired after having worked at Alcola Company for more than 30 years, a productive career. Mrs. Miller established her own business, a beauty shop, that has been in operation now for more than 47 years. And so I simply pause, take this opportunity to commend them for their tremendous civic and religious involvement, wish them well as they celebrate their 50 years of marriage, and trust that they will have many more productive, happy and beneficial years.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I rise to engage the subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, in a colloquy to express my concerns regarding the Comptroller General's implementation of the Human Capital Reform Act of 2004 and the resulting unionization effort at the Government Accountability Office. 
   For the past 18 months, the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, has been investigating certain personnel actions taken by the Comptroller General. 
   Our investigation culminated in a joint House and Senate hearing on May 22, where CRS's legal division and the General Counsel for the GAO's Personnel Appeals Board testified that, based on current statute, GAO did not have the authority to deny over 300 employees who met and, in some cases, exceeded expectations, their 2006 and 2007 annual across-the-board increase. 
   GAO says that it took this action based upon a compensation-based study conducted by Watson Wyatt. However, when the subcommittee's staff, working with experts in market-based pay, reviewed the documentation, they were unable to validate that the employees who did not receive their across-the-board increase were overpaid, as asserted by GAO. 
   In addition to meeting their performance expectations, these employees were among the most experienced, with over 25 years of service to GAO. 
   The workforce at GAO has been severely disrupted by these personnel actions. In reaction to them, a majority of GAO's 1,500 analysts filed a petition with the GAO's Personnel Appeals Board to be represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. 
   Unfortunately, GAO has responded by hiring the law firm Venable, LLC, to represent it before the PAB. It is uncommon for a Federal agency to use taxpayers' dollars to hire private sector counsel for such purposes. In addition, GAO is asserting that one-third of the petitioners are supervisors and, therefore, cannot unionize. 
   Furthermore, GAO has indicated that if its challenge is successful, and it can show that the alleged supervisors were involved in the solicitation of authorization cards for the remaining eligible employees, it will not commit to recognize and bargain with the employee group. 
   I yield to the chairwoman to ask what steps has the Appropriations Committee taken to address Member and employee concerns about the situation at the GAO.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mr. Tom and Mrs. Lois Miller on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. 
   Mr. Speaker, the institution of marriage is one of the most sacred and effective traditions in civilized society which organizes, holds together and perpetuates continuation of civilized humanity. And to many it is both a civil and religious act. And whereas Tom and Lois Miller have shared 50 years of holy matrimony, I am pleased to pause and wish them well. 
   Tom and Lois met in McCool, Mississippi, while teenagers and were married after coming to Chicago by Reverend Daniel A. Williams on January 14, 1957. Tom worked at CELO Steel, and later went to the R.C. Cola company, where he retired after a long, satisfying and productive career. 
   Lois pursued a career in cosmetology, became one of the best in her field, and subsequently owned her own business, the L & L Beauty Salon, which has been in existence for 47 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, Tom and Lois Miller became and still are pillars of their community. They've raised four daughters, have four grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Ever since their marriage they have been rocks of the Greater Zion Missionary Baptist Church, where they have both displayed tremendous leadership, with Tom Miller becoming chairman of the deacon board. 
   They were founding members of the 4,500 West Congress Block Club in Chicago and have been active in many other civic and social endeavors, and for the past 10 years have lived in Westchester, Illinois, where they have immersed themselves in community life. 
   Mr. Speaker, 50 years is a long time. And when you can spend those 50 years in a state of peace, happiness and productive engagement, you have been  truly blessed. And just as you have been blessed, you have also blessed others. I've been told that ``to those to whom much is given, much is expected in return.'' 
   The Millers have been fortunate to have a great family, great children, great grandchildren, friends and relatives. Their children, grandchildren, other relatives and friends have been fortunate to have the Millers in their lives. And I wish all of them a great day as they gather for a tremendous celebration on Sunday. 
   And so I close my comments, Mr. Speaker, with congratulations to Tom and Lois Miller, wish them well and trust that they will have many more years of happy and blissful marriage and that this relationship will continue until the end of time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 120, recognizing the African American spiritual as a national treasure. 
   Growing up in the rural South in the 1950s, we grew up on what was then called the Negro spiritual, and many of these songs, of course, had great meaning, especially the lyrics. I remember, ``Follow the Old Man'' that is ``Coming to Carry Me to Freedom'' if you ``Follow the Drinking Gourd.'' Well, gourds supposedly grew northward, and if you followed the direction of the gourd, you would get out of the slave South back during slavery and the abolitionist period, and you would be headed north. And so not only did these songs sound good, not only were they spiritually uplifting as one that I heard on this past Sunday at the Second Baptist Church in Maywood, Illinois, but they also were didactic; they were teaching and inspirational. 
   So I commend the gentlewoman from Connecticut for her introduction of this great resolution and urge its support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we honor and remember the life of Benny Parsons and his contribution to the racing community. Mr. Parsons was a legendary NASCAR driver and TV analyst. His thoughtful insights as an announcer earned him the nickname The Professor, and his achievements as a driver include a Winston Cup NASCAR championship. 
   Born in Wilkes County, North Carolina, he developed a penchant for cars and racing with his father. At the age of 18, he moved to Detroit where he drove taxis and worked at a service station. Soon thereafter he started his NASCAR career. In 1971, he won his first race, and in 1973 won the NASCAR championship. Mr. Parsons battled with drivers like Richard Petty and Carl Yarborough throughout his racing career that stretched over 20 years. 
   After Parsons retired from racing in 1988, he became a commentator and a recognized voice for NASCAR. His work helped NASCAR become one of the most widely watched sports in America and taught many newcomers to understand and enjoy racing. Earlier this year Mr. Parsons succumbed to complications from lung cancer. 
   So I urge my colleagues to rise in support of H. Res. 69. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a bitter pill to swallow, especially given the fact that I represent the Chicago Bears, who happen to be in my district, the stadium that they use. We were anticipating great thrills and great delights, and for a brief moment we did, in fact, have that. But then someone said to me that we came in like lions and went out like lambs. 
   I guess that is exactly what happened. This past Sunday, Tony Dungy and the Indianapolis Colts beat Lovie Smith and his Chicago Bears 29-17 in a wet Super Bowl XLI. 
   The slippery conditions made for several muffs and miscues throughout the game, including a Romo-like botched hold during the extra point after the Colts' first touchdown. 
   The Bears got off to a quick start with Devin Hester returning the opening kickoff for a TD, and Rex Grossman hitting Muhsin Muhammad with a 4-yard pass in the first quarter for another seven points. 
   After this the Bears' offense sort of fizzled, and the Colts took advantage with Peyton Manning leading several drives that ended in Adam Vinatieri's field goals and a TD pass to Reggie Wayne. Joseph Addai and Dominic Rhodes also both contributed some hard runs with a combined rushing total of 190 yards and a touchdown. On the other side of the ball, the Colts were the better defense, causing five turnovers. 
   As noted last week, this game made history with two African American coaches facing each other for the title, and Tony Dungy being the first black coach to win a Super Bowl. 
   Of course, I want to congratulate Coach Dungy on a job well done, and adding to the celebration of Black History Month. I also want to commend Peyton Manning for his leadership of the team. I want to thank Representative Carson's staff for their hard work, especially Kathleen Taylor, who did such a quick job of putting all of this together so that we did not have to delay. 
   And so with serious regret on the part of the Chicago Bears, I commend and congratulate the Indianapolis Colts and urge support for this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 985, and I do so for a number of reasons. We all know that there are individuals who would love to simply be forthcoming with information. All of us have been places, all of us have worked places, all of us have known things, and we have all wanted to operate free and uninhibited. But unless individuals have the absolute protection, in many instances, of knowing that whatever it is that they would reveal that when they come forth that nobody can use that against them, because they also have concerns of their own relative to being able to maintain the job that they have got to take care of the security needs of their family. 
   Whistleblower protection could have been used more effectively even as we debated the issue of Iraq, as we made decisions based upon intelligence that supposedly we had but intelligence that obviously we did not have. 
   Whistleblower protection becomes very effective in helping to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. Some of the hearings that I have sat in on where we have discussed how we made use of our contracting resources in Iraq, for example, makes one wonder if we were just giving away the valuable resources of the American people. 
   So this legislation not only protects the taxpayers' money, but it also protects our troops, our soldiers, those who are in danger oftentimes because accurate information has not been deployed. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of 985.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to have joined Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis in sponsoring the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007. 
   The Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007 strengthens current law to protect whistleblowers in Federal agencies. Since 1994, the Whistleblower Protection Act has been gutted by judicial activism. The legislation would grant whistleblowers the right to challenge reprisals in Federal district court and clarifies that ``any'' protected disclosure applies to all lawful communication of misconduct. It would extend whistleblower protection rights to whistleblowers in the intelligence community and would extend these rights to federally funded contractors. 
   Extending whistleblower protection to the intelligence community is a critical aspect of this legislation. Most national security whistleblowers are not protected from retaliation by law. The National Security Whistleblower Coalition reports that the median number of years of government service for national security whistleblowers is 22 years. These employees are experienced and dedicated and their careers should not be put at risk when they report waste, fraud, and abuse. Protecting national security whistleblowers from retaliation is in the best interest of our national security. 
   I do have concerns about one group of workers that do not have whistleblower protection--postal workers. The Postal Service is not, by law, subject to the Whistleblower Protection Act--WPA. The Service's Employee and Labor Relations Manual--ELM--contains provisions adopted by the service that replicate the more significant protections found in the WPA for victims of unlawful reprisal. The ELM provisions, however, only concern ``corrective actions''; they do not mandate discipline for managers who retaliate against whistleblowers. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, I will hold a hearing to examine the need to extend full whistleblower protections to postal employees. 
   Chairman Waxman, thank you for your advocacy in this area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 272, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. I also rise in honor of my forefathers and foremothers who were captured through raids and kidnappings, sold to Europeans and subjugated to four and a half centuries of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   The transatlantic slave trade is sometimes called ``Maafa,'' meaning ``holocaust'' or ``great disaster'' in Kiswahili by African and African American scholars because it resulted in a vast loss of life for African captives both in Africa and in America. It is believed that 50 percent of African deaths, 10 million, occurred in Africa as a result of wars between native tribes. 4.5 percent, around 900,000 deaths, occurred in large forts called factories. Around 2.5 million Africans died during voyages through the infamous Middle Passage, where they were packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time. 
   While estimates of the number of slaves brought to North America vary from a few hundred thousand to a few million, the slave population in the United States had grown to 4 million by the 1860s. From the latter 18th century, and possibly before that even, until the Civil War, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than the population of any nation in Europe and was nearly twice as rapid as that in Europe. In North America, the treatment of slaves was very harsh and inhumane. Whether laboring or walking about in public, slaves were regulated by legally authorized violence. On large plantations, slave overseers were authorized to whip and brutalize noncompliant slaves. Significantly, slave codes authorized, indemnified or even required the use of violence and were denounced by abolitionists for their brutality. 
   In the present phase of society, we must recognize the historical significance of the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade to the world. More broadly, respect the memories of those who gave their lives in the fight for freedom, and make sure that no generations yet to come will ever experience this kind of inhumane brutality. 
   And so I commend Representative Lee for introducing this resolution, commend Representative Payne for his tremendous leadership in human rights.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I am delighted that I managed to make it here. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and neighbor from the Fifth Congressional District of Illinois, Mr. Rahm Emanuel, for introducing this resolution. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 118, congratulating the City of Chicago for being chosen to represent the United States in the international competition to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and encouraging the IOC to select Chicago as the site of the games. 
   I can speak with some authority on Chicago's qualifications to host those games because I am privileged to represent most of the proposed sites: Soldier Field, the United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, Navy Pier, McCormick Place, Grant Park, Douglas Park, Monroe Harbor, and facilities at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois. 
   The Olympic Village will rise on land in the Seventh District. And although the site of the future olympic stadium and currently home to the DuSable Museum of African American History, Washington Park is not in my district, it is right adjacent to it. 
   So with all due modesty, this assemblage of sports facilities is certainly one of the finest in the world. Then you add to that our infrastructure, our world-class architecture, our cultural and historical treasures and our matchless lakefront, and you have yourself the makings of a spectacular set of games. 
   Now, mix in our sports fan base. The Seventh District is home to the Chicago Bears, the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago White Sox, and the Chicago Blackhawks. Mix in the fact that for the 2006 Chicago Marathon, starting and ending in the district, we had 40,000 runners and 1.2 million spectators. Mix in the fact that Chicago hosted the 2006 International Gay Games. Mix in the fact that Chicago was the first host to the Special Olympics in 1968, and you will understand that our toddlin' town is for sure a sports town. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Olympic Games are about fierce, all-out athletic competition. But they are also about the greater goals of the Olympic movement: Fairness, peace, education, and friendship. The people of Chicago have a long and proud history of leadership in these struggles, nationally and internationally. 
   Mr. Speaker, Chicago is ready, willing and able to make America the proud host of the 2016 games. So I join with the mayor of the city, the Governor of the State, all of the business and community leaders in urging passage not only of this resolution, but in urging the Olympic Committee to select Chicago as the site for 2016.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, as we celebrate charter schools I want to recognize the Youth Connection Charter School (YCCS) operating in my Congressional District. The Youth Connection Charter School (YCCS) has a unique mission and purpose. It has been said that education is the great equalizer--it is the key to success. 
   The mission of YCCS is to provide individuals who have dropped out of school an opportunity--to drop back in and receive a quality education. Since its creation in 1997, YCCS has graduated more than 5,700 students who had previously dropped out of traditional high schools. Just think, what would have happened to those students if YCCS was not available to them. They likely would have become another statistic. 
   Clearly, the data shows that students who drop out are more likely to be unemployed. In fact, the unemployment rate nationally for high school drop-outs was 29.8 percent in 200. (Dept. of Labor). We know that students who drop out are more likely to be candidates for prisons. A total of 75 percent of America's state prison inmates are high shool drop-outs, with only 59 percent of America's federal prison inmates completing high school (Harlow, 2003). We also know that high school drop-outs are more likely to be receiving public assistance and living in poverty. These negative consequences lead to the destruction of a community and country. Students who drop out are less likely to be married or see a doctor on a regular basis. The benefits of a high school education move society forward economically and socially. A person with a high school diploma is more likely to be employed, live longer, and become a productive part of society. 
   The impact of YCCS and its involvement as the only charter school in Illinois providing alternative educational services focused primarily on drop-outs can be seen throughout education. In 2005, YCCS placed in the upper third for school performance in reading by CPS in comparison to all of the other 76 high schools in the city of Chlcago. 
   Conversely, we know that a quality education opens the doors of opportunity and provides hope for a brighter future. An investment in the education of young people who have dropped out of school saves our city and state taxpayers' money. The Alliance for Excellent Education reports that a 1 percent increase in high school gradution rates would save approximately $1.4 billion in incarceration costs yearly. Additionally, a 1-year incease in average education levels would reduce arrest rates by 11 percent. 
   I am pleased to honor the outstanding work of the Youth Connection Charter School.  
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Interior Appropriations Bill; especially do I support the increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I know that we have great concern for National Security, Homeland Security, funding for military warlike activities, education, health, other social welfare issues, infrastructure improvements, job creation and all other aspects of life; however, it is not my feeling that these concerns out-weigh the need to keep art and culture high on our list of concerns. 
   Art is a connector, a bridge builder, a motivator, a stimulator, an activator and a way  for people, especially our children to have experience that otherwise they would never ever have the opportunity to have. 
   Art is, and should be a great part of every child's learning experience and it is our opportunity to make sure that is available.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join with my colleague in consideration of H.R. 1617, which names a postal facility in University City, Missouri, after Harriett F. Woods. 
   H.R. 1617, which was introduced by Representative Russ Carnahan on March 21, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has been cosponsored by 74 Members and has the entire support of the Missouri delegation. 
   Ms. Harriett F. Woods was elected from the 13th District of Missouri in St. Louis County to the Missouri State Senate in November of 1976. She was reelected for a second term in November of 1980. She was the first woman to win statewide offices in Missouri, becoming Lieutenant Governor in 1984. She ran for the U.S. Senate twice in the 1980s, and while both attempts failed, it inspired other women to run for and win political office. Ms. Woods was an activist who promoted women politicians. She served two terms as President of the National Women's Political Caucus and led the Clinton administration's Coalition for Women Appointments in 1993. 
   Before becoming an elected official, Ms. Woods was an independent film producer and served 10 years as the Public Affairs Director at KPLR-TV in St. Louis. At KPLR, she produced many noted documentaries, among them the award-winning film on child abuse, ``Broken Children,'' ``Don't Go to Jail in Missouri'' and ``Piedmont UFO.''

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1124, the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999, will reauthorize funding for the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant, the DCTAG program, which will help promote higher education for high school graduates in the District of Columbia. 
   DCTAG provides grants for District high school students to attend public colleges and universities nationwide at in-state tuition rates. Additionally, the bill provides smaller grants for District students to attend private institutions in the D.C. metropolitan area and to attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities nationwide. 
   The impact of this legislation on the community and in the lives of the students who receive the grants cannot be minimized. DCTAG reaches students and communities where there is no hope of being able to obtain a college education. This is particularly true for many of the students that participate in DCTAG. Fifty-eight percent of the students who participate in the program come from low-income households. 
   Furthermore, students that participate are attending educational institutions that are known to nurture students of color. Five of the top 10 schools these students attend are HBCUs: Hampton University, Morehouse College, Virginia Union University, St. Augustine's College, and Bennett College. 
   While students from all races participate in the program and attend over 270 institutions in 47 States, including nationally recognized public institutions like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Illinois, the University of California-Berkeley, and Ohio State University, this program serves a community that is lacking resources for students of color from low-income households. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ranking minority member, Representative Tom Davis, and, of course, the distinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for introducing and championing this legislation. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of H.R. 2025, which names a postal facility in Chicago, Illinois, after Willye B. White. 
   H.R. 2025, which was introduced by Representative Jesse L. Jackson, Jr., on April 25, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 18 Members, has the support of the entire Illinois congressional delegation. 
   Ms. Willye White was born December 31, 1939, in Money, Mississippi, and raised by her grandparents. At 16 she competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games and became the first woman representing the United States to win a medal in the long jump, earning silver behind Elizabeth Krzeszinska of Poland. Ms. White competed in every Olympics from 1956 through 1972, and only an injury kept her off the 1976 team. 
   She was America's best female long jumper for almost two decades, with a career best of 21 feet and 6 inches. She won nine consecutive United States outdoor championships, set seven American records and competed in more than 150 nations. Ms. White is the first and only track and field athlete to compete in five Olympics for the United States. 
   Ms. White moved to Chicago in 1960 and lived there for 46 years. She worked as a nurse and then as a public administrator. She mentored hundreds of young women living in Chicago's public housing projects through the Willye White Foundation. 
   The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, recognized her humanitarian efforts by awarding her the Pierre de Coubertin International Fair Play trophy, named after the founder of the modern Olympic Games. 
   Ms. White died on February 6, 2007, of pancreatic cancer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Jackson for introducing this legislation. 
   Ms. White happened to be someone that I have known practically all of my life. As a matter of fact, she did grow up and finish high school in Greenwood, Mississippi, where my grandfather lived, and we knew of her exploits. As a matter of fact, we were close to the same age so we were attending high school at the same time. Then, of course, she went on to Tennessee State, that famous institution with the Tigerbelles, and at the same time I was attending another HBCU university, and we would compete with Tennessee State. They always won. Occasionally, we may have an opportunity but not often. 
   Then I actually worked closely with Ms. White up until the time that she died. Every year, I would look forward to contributing to her foundation for the programs that she had, especially in the Robert Taylor and the Henry Horner homes, but especially Robert Taylor housing projects which is also a part of my congressional district. 
   As a matter of fact, she even ran for public office. Although she was not elected, she kept running and did, in fact, run. 
   I commend my colleague Representative Jackson again for seeking to honor this great lady by naming a post office in her honor. I would urge passage of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Staff Sergeant Lewis G. Watkins served in action during the Korean conflict. He heroically sacrificed his life in combat on October 7, 1952, in Korea. He was a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life beyond the call of duty while serving as a guide of a rifle platoon of Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. 
   Staff Sergeant Watkins' extraordinary heroism, inspiring leadership, and resolute spirit of self-sacrifice reflected the highest credit upon himself and enhances the finest traditions of the U.S. naval service. He gave his life for his country. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Barrett for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 223, which supports the goals of a National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. 
   H. Res. 223, which has 59 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative JOHN SHADEGG from Arizona on March 7, 2007. H. Res. 223 was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007 by a voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2005, there were 16,692 murders and nine negligent manslaughters reported in our Nation. This is obviously too many murders. And so I support the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims and recognize all organizations that provide services, such as support, guidance and counseling, to the loved ones and friends of murder victims. 
   It is important that this day is not just a remembrance of those who tragically lost their lives, but a call to action. While some of us have not experienced acts of violence, we share responsibility to people who have lost their loved ones to murder. We should always reflect the moral virtues of respect and caring and sharing with one another, regardless of one's race, creed and national origin. 
   Of course, we remember the recent incidents that have just occurred at the university in Virginia. I also remember in my own neighborhood, where just last week a young man was killed on a bus. He turned out to be an absolute hero because he actually put himself in front of another student who was about to be shot. And of course that community and that family still grieves. So I urge that we all remember murder victims and their families by getting involved in our homes, communities, schools and businesses to prevent violence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Shadegg from Arizona, for seeking to honor the memories of murder victims and recognize the impact on surviving family members. 
   I urge swift passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for providing what we never had in the last session, and that is ample opportunity to fully discuss Iraq, where we are and what we ought to be doing about it. 
   I have always been told that when you start with a faulty premise, you will inevitably reach a faulty conclusion. And the rationale given for entering the war was faulty. There were no weapons of mass destruction, no connection to 9/11. Therefore, we never should have invaded Iraq in the first place. 
   But then after the invasion, the occupation of Iraq has been tragically mismanaged. Civilian military leadership ignored the advice of senior commanders on requirements for preventing chaos in the aftermath of the invasion. As a result, our extended presence in Iraq continues to worsen the situation, not only in Iraq, but in the entire region. 
   Terrorist incidents continue to flare up around the world, from England to Spain, from Indonesia to Jordan. Chaos and intolerance in the form of civil war now has secured a deadly grip on Iraq. The policy of escalation has failed, and failed again, to loosen that horrendous grip. The Iraqi people want us to leave, and so do the American people, especially those in my congressional district, and especially those that I encounter at churches, schools, synagogues, town hall meetings and on the street. 
   Madam Speaker, democracy and self-government cannot be imposed on Iraq by any foreign power, including us, the United States of America. Our troops have done everything we have asked of them, even when we have failed to equip and protect them. The problem does not lie with our troops, but with the distorted world view of this administration and the military and diplomatic doctrine of preemptive war as a solution to global political problems. 
   We must do everything possible to protect our troops and we must do everything in our power to take care of them when they return home. 
   It is impossible, Madam Speaker, to build a coalition against terrorism by attempting to unilaterally impose these doctrines on the international community. We cannot undo the many mistakes which have been made in Iraq. And when our national interests have been so distorted, when we have so lost our direction, it is the historical, moral, and constitutional responsibility of this Congress to set us back on course and on the right track. 
   It is time to recognize that we are enmeshed in an unending, vicious circle of escalating violence, rather than a force for peace, and that is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 508, which would bring the force of law to end this war. 
   Today we have before us a nonbinding resolution, most likely insufficient to end the occupation. But it can help to move us in the right direction and set us on the right path. Therefore, I support this resolution, because it reflects the will and interests of the American people, and I trust that this administration will abandon demagogic calls for constantly changing notions of success and victory and awaken to the world of reality. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time, it is past time, to bring our troops home. I am told that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting different results. This resolution sets us on the right course, gives us the right direction. I urge its passage.

   As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4108, as amended, a bill to amend title 5, relating to Selective Service registration. 
   H.R. 4108 was introduced on November 7, 2007, by Representatives GEORGE MILLER and DARRELL ISSA. The legislation would provide for exemptions from determinations of ineligibility for Federal employment for individuals who have not registered with the Selective Service. Those who have received an honorable discharge from the armed services who have performed at least 10 years of Federal service would no longer be deemed ineligible. 
   Under current law, all males born after December 31, 1959, must register with the Selective Service by their 26th birthday in order to be eligible for employment in the Federal Government. An individual who has not registered with the Selective Service is not eligible for Federal employment unless he can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to register was neither knowing nor willful. 
   This means that the individual must prove to a high legal standard that he did not know he was required to register or thought he had registered. H.R. 4108 would exempt from this requirement individuals who were honorably discharged from the armed services or who have 10 years of service in the Federal Government. 
   H.R. 4108 was introduced on November 7, 2007, and referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The committee marked up the measure on November 8, 2007, and ordered that the bill be reported by voice vote.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 215, as amended, which supports the designation of ``National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week.'' 
   H. Con. Res. 215, which was introduced by Representative John R. ``Randy'' Kuhl, Jr. on September 19, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on November 8, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has been cosponsored by 84 Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad statistic that 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before reaching the hospital. Prompt CPR and use of an automated defibrillator, or AED, can more than double a victim's chance of surviving cardiac arrest. Seventy-five to 80 percent of all cardiac arrests occur within the home. Unfortunately, 60 percent of the public have never seen an automated external defibrillator, much less put it into use. 
   It is time we do all that we can to raise awareness of these much-needed emergency tools and urge training to combat heart disease at the community level.

   Mr. Speaker, S. 597, as amended, now mirrors the House version of the Breast Cancer Semipostal measure which was unanimously passed by this body on October 30, 2007. 
   The House version, H.R. 1236, which was sponsored by representative William Lacy Clay, reauthorizes the sale of the breast cancer stamp for an additional 4 years from 2007 to 2011. The bill  also follows up on the Government Accountability Office's recommendations that the relevant agencies report the use of monies received from the sale of the stamp, including a description of any significant advances on accomplishments that were funded by the sale. 
   As a member of the Oversight Committee Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, Representative Clay is to be commended for his diligence and patience for working with all parties and securing an acceptable compromise on the sale of the breast cancer stamp. 
   I note proudly that the United States Postal Service has sold over 785.6 million breast cancer research stamps from which $54.626 million has been transferred to the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense for breast cancer research and awareness. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the public for buying the breast cancer semipostal stamp and the numerous organizations for lending their strong support for its continuation. With your help, I am confident that we will find a cure. 
   I urge swift passage of this bill, and again commend the representative from Missouri, our colleague, Representative Clay, for his introduction.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (IMPROVING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. You know, as I think about the issue of health and all the problems that we face individually and collectively, I think of how unfortunate it is when individuals are illiterate because it cuts them off from the ability to communicate with the rest of the world; and how unfortunate it is when people live in substandard housing because they don't have the sanctuary or they don't have the feeling of knowing that at the end of the day they can come in out of the rain or out of the cold or come in from a society that may not be as comforting as they would like for it to be. 
   It's so terrible when children don't have access to good schools and decent education and can't be in a position to compete effectively with other members of society. And then to be unemployed, not have a job to go to, not be able to sustain oneself, not be able to know that you have the resources that you need. But then to be sick on top of all that means that your life is relegated, for all practical purposes, to a level of despair and uncertainty for which you can find or see no way out. The child who is sick at school and can't see a physician or go to a clinic. 
   There is no point to the teacher talking about, ``Johnny, study hard,'' because Johnny doesn't feel like studying. I mean, Johnny's stomach is hurting, or Johnny can't see the board. And so telling Johnny to study hard doesn't mean a great deal to Johnny. Or the guy who wakes up in the morning and turns on the radio and the blues singer is saying, ``get a job.'' ``Every morning about this time you bring my breakfast to the bed crying. Get a job.'' Well, that person doesn't feel like going out looking for a job because they're sick. They don't feel like it; they're despondent, they're in despair. And so they're not going to get a job. They're not even going to go out and look for a job because they don't feel like going to work. 
   And so health care, as far as I'm concerned, and for my money, is the most important aspect of life, because without a sense of well-being, one cannot  challenge or confront the rest of societal needs. 
   Our health is the foundation of everything that you can think of. I often believe that my mother died prematurely because she had to travel 100 miles to go to the hospital for her dialysis treatment because that was the closest hospital to where she lived where she could get the treatment. And so not having access to health care has limited, in so many different ways, the ability for people to just have hopes of the American Dream, to just believe that they can experience it. 
   Yeah, there are those who take the position that we could never have universal health care; I mean, they say, ``never, ever.'' But, you know, I remember when people said that you could never put poor people into managed care. I remember when people said that HMOs would not survive, that they would never, ever make it. I remember when people said that you really couldn't have the proliferation of clinics. I worked in a community health center, and I remember when those were getting started. They were part of the ``Great Society'' programs, part of the legislation that came out of the marches and demonstrations led by Dr. Martin Luther King that came after John Kennedy had been elected President, assassinated, and then Lyndon Baines Johnson became President. And Democrats--I mean, they were Democrats--embarked upon a new program, something called the ``Great Society'' programs, just as years before a fellow named Franklin Delano Roosevelt kind of led the Nation towards social reform that brought us Social Security and some other protections that we didn't have. 
   Well, I think that right now is the best possible time for us to take another giant step, a quantum leap, if you will, and make sure that no single individual in our country, no matter who they are, where they come from, how wealthy they are, how poor they are, how without resources they are, no single individual should have to live in the United States of America without adequate protection for health care. 
   I mean, we are the wealthiest Nation on the face of the Earth. We are the most technologically advanced Nation. Yes, we are hurting in some ways. And of course we are hurting because we have not seen the distribution of the resources be as adequate as we need to see them. We have not seen as many people with access to the goodness and the greatness of this country. But when 41 percent of working age adults have a problem paying their medical bills or have a medical debt that they will never be able to pay, then something is wrong. 
   And we have not seen what we are capable of seeing. I was just thinking of some of the things that people have been telling us about their experiences. And I guess if you live in an environment that I live in and where I live, you individually know these people. It's not a matter of reading it in the newspaper or reading it in the magazine, you know the individuals personally who are having these kind of problems. For example, Jerome. 
   Jerome said to us, ``My wife was diagnosed with melanoma in September and died in November. I believe preventive health care and better diagnosis might have prolonged her life or provided a cure. She saw two dermatologists last year, and both failed to diagnose her condition. She went on to have moles and a cyst evaluated and removed. In addition to the failure to diagnose, the cost of insurance and deductibles exceeded $40,000. Prior hospital visits in the past 5 years for a stroke resulted in medical bills of approximately $100,000, which brought us to the verge of bankruptcy. 
   ``Fortuitously, I received an inheritance last year which enabled me to pay the current bills. However, since being downsized 5 years ago at age 56, I have been unable to obtain employment. And my wife was unable to work due to the stroke and subsequent illnesses. I am a relatively well-educated man and I'm willing to work; however, I do not feel our current economic system values my experience and education. I am a certified financial planner. I have worked over 30 years with approximately $150,000 accumulated in retirement savings, all of which has been used for medical expenses. Without my inheritance, I would have my home, worth about $250,000, as my only asset.'' 
   Julia writes, ``I've been fighting ovarian cancer for 19 years. I developed a secondary blood cancer last year and had to have a bone marrow transplant in January of 2007. Medicine is outrageously expensive. Luckily, I have mail order service that only costs $5 a prescription; otherwise, my medication would cost over $1,000 a month. 
   ``Our insurance premiums cost $965 a month. My COBRA, just for me, is $565 a month. My husband and two children, which my husband pays for, $400 a month. My deductible is low, $250, but my family's is over $1,000. I am dreading if I am unable to work before COBRA runs out. I don't know what I will do for insurance as I am a teacher and don't know if I can get Medicare. I can't go on my husband's insurance as he works for a small company. They will get dropped by the insurance company if I am added. This has happened twice before. 
   ``The medical system is broken. People shouldn't have to choose between health care and bankruptcy, which is the case for many who go through bone marrow transplants.'' 
   Well, Congressman Conyers, as long as there are people like these in America, as long as there are individuals for whom the American Dream continues to be a tremendous nightmare, as long as there are people who have, in many instances, lost hope and given up, as long as there are individuals who can't see their way out no matter how much they struggle, how long, how hard and how difficult the challenges, and as long as there are people like you, who are willing to fight for every American, as long as there are people like you, I am going to be willing to join you. 
   And so I'm pleased that I was able to be here this evening to share with you and with Americans all over the country that health care should, in fact, be a right and not a privilege, that we must have a system where everybody is in and nobody is out. 
   I thank you. And I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, this Sunday, history will be made in the National Football League when two African American head coaches battle for a Super Bowl championship. 
   Not only is this the first time a black head coach has vied for the title, but two have done so in the same season. Lovie Smith, of the Chicago Bears, and Tony Dungy, of the Indianapolis Colts, are hailed as two of the most humble in the league. 
   In an era where professional sports is crowded with big egos and loud mouths, these two quietly push their players to be better athletes and better individuals. 
   Like myself, Coach Smith grew up in a small town in the South. Coach Smith talks about how growing up in the small town of Big Sandy, Texas, taught him the values of hard work, self-determination, self-discipline and teamwork. These are American values taught in a small town. 
   One thing that I admire about Lovie Smith is that he approaches coaching as a professor, as a mentor. He does not yell or swear at his players. He teaches them and motivates them. He builds his players up, reflecting a strength of character to be commended and imitated.     
   Coach Smith started his coaching career studying under Tony Dungy in Tampa Bay, and the two developed a defense that relied on team speed and hard hitting. They also developed a close friendship that continues, even as opponents in the largest single sporting event in America. 
   Through their relationship, both have become brilliant defensive football minds and refined player managers. Their class and work ethic make them part of an elite group of coaches, and their contributions continue to have a great effect on league diversity in the coaching ranks. Their achievements stretch far beyond the football field, and their impact is felt throughout the entire African American, as well as the entire American, community. 
   I congratulate both of these coaches for their hard work and success. Of course I want them both to be successful on Sunday, but I must confess that I would rather that Lovie Smith be more successful than his mentor. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana. He is a distinguished Member of this body, and sometimes he is very prophetic, he can predict things. Of course I think today he is making an error. I certainly look forward to Tony Dungy and the Colts not giving up, but I've got a feeling that they might give out. 
   It is my pleasure right now to yield such time as she might consume to the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, the originator of this resolution and one who comes from a great sports town where basketball is the name of their game, Representative CAROLYN KILPATRICK from the State of Michigan.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, to close, we have heard all of the richly and rightly deserved accolades, and I really can't think of any person in the profession of athletics that I admire more than I do Tony Dungy. He is indeed just a gentleman's gentleman, a man of impeccable character, a man who inspires you. Even if you are rooting for the other team, you still can feel his depth coming through. And so I wish him well. I certainly hope that he will have some reserves to share with my good friend Representative Burton so he can help him pay off the debt. 
   But I also want to say that I represent lots of different things in the district that I have. I represent the Bulls, I represent the Bears, Oprah Winfrey, the mayor of the city of Chicago, and we take great pride in all that our community is. Lovie Smith has brought the level of character to the Illinois area, the Chicago community, unmatched. We wish him and the Bears well. And I am going to leave all of the room that I can have for everything that my friends Dan Burton and Julia Carson will bring. Go Bears.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (HONORING THE LIFE OF PERCY LAVON JULIAN -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding. 
   I know all of the folks out in the Bay Area of California are indeed pleased and proud to see you in the Chair. They are as proud as the people in the neighborhood where I live are of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian who lived a few blocks from where I currently live.     
   Born the son of a railroad clerk and a school teacher, the grandson of a slave, young Percy Julian, early in his life, got ahold of Donald Adams' poem, ``Seven Fold,'' and its charge to ``Go Farther On'' reigned in his spirit. 
   In academia, racial prejudice followed him like a shadow. He was class valedictorian in 1920 from DePauw University, but still discouraged from seeking admission into graduate school because of potential racial sentiment on the part of future coworkers. 
   He got straight A's at Harvard University, graduated in 1923. But even with his success, Julian was unable to get a teaching job at any major university because of the perception that white students would refuse to learn under a black instructor. 
   After he received a Ph.D. degree in organic chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1931, he took a position at DePauw, his alma mater, where he collaborated with Dr. Josef Pikl and successfully created a drug which was used as a treatment for glaucoma. Although internationally recognized for his achievement, however, the color of his skin prevented him from being appointed chair of DePauw's chemistry department. 
   He became the chief chemist and the director of research at the Glidden Company in Chicago, where he created a flame retardant that saved countless sailors of the United States Navy during World War II. 
   I might add that my brother worked at Glidden Durkee as a quality control director, because he somehow or another also became a chemist and followed in the footsteps of Dr. Julian. 
   He discovered that soy sterol could be used to manufacture male and female hormones, progesterone and testosterone. Yet his achievements were not properly appreciated. He created synthetic cortisone, and his products led directly to the development of chemical birth control and medicines to suppress the immune system, crucial in performing organ transplants. 
   He was named Chicagoan of the Year in 1950. He became the first black to move into the prestigious Oak Park community, but his house was firebombed twice simply because some folk didn't want a black neighbor. 
   He parlayed his genius into countless awards, has over 100 patents to his credit, became a millionaire in 1961, was asked to serve on numerous commissions and advisory boards, and yet his story is not taught nearly as much as it needs to be. 
   Racial obstacles can be pernicious, but if we persist, like Dr. Julian, to ``Go Farther On,'' then we all become proud. I am proud of the folks in the community where I live because there are Percy Julian artifacts and memorabilia, schools named after him, streets named after him. He is an icon in the Oak Park community. 
   I commend again my colleague from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for introducing this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 117, a bill that commemorates the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown settlement. 
   H. Con. Res. 117, which has 77 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Jo Ann Davis of Virginia on April 18, 2007. H. Con. Res. 117 was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   On May 14, 1607, Indians of the Powhatan tribe of Virginia saw three English sailing ships approaching their land. The 214 people on board of the Susan Constant, the Discovery, and the Godspeed had departed from London 5 months earlier. They would establish on the banks of the James River what would become America's first English settlement in the new world. 
   While disease, famine, and continuing attacks from neighboring Indians took a tremendous toll on the settlers, only 60 of the original settlers survived just 2 years after arriving in America, England sent another three ships that arrived with supplies and new settlers to help stabilize the colony. 
   Jamestown survived because the colonists worked together to cultivate the swamp-like land of the Virginia island and made it suitable for the growing of tobacco. By 1620 Jamestown had shipped almost 50,000 pounds of tobacco to England. Fifty years later Virginia and Maryland would ship 15 million pounds. Jamestown depended upon its agricultural products and trade to flourish as a new colony in America. 
   Last Friday, on May 4, Queen Elizabeth II visited a tourist village at Jamestown to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of America's first English settlement. The Queen's last visit to Jamestown was 50 years ago. Jamestown represented a government that reflected many of our Nation's democratic ideals and institutions, including the rule of law and free enterprise. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for seeking to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Jamestown and urge swift passage of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2080 repeals sections 452 and 495 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act and permits the District of Columbia Council to establish the District of Columbia public schools as a Cabinet-level agency. 
   Under H.R. 2080, the mayor and the council will be held accountable for the management of the District's public schools. Section 452 describes the role and responsibilities of the mayor and council with respect to the annual budget process for the District of Columbia public school system. Section 452 provides the mayor and the council authority to establish the maximum amount of funds which will be allocated to the District of Columbia's Board of Education, but they are not allowed to change how the funds are used for educational programs. 
   H.R. 2080 will eliminate section 452 and allow the mayor and council to determine the level of funding allocations that each program receives. The money for this budget is entirely local money. 
   Section 495 established the D.C. Board of Education. H.R. 2080 would repeal the powers of the board and gives the mayor and council authority over the District's public schools. Mayor Fenty has been seeking the authority to reform the D.C. public school system since earlier this year. 
   On January 5, 2007, the mayor submitted the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007, the act, to the D.C. council for their consideration. The act transfers management and oversight authority for D.C.'s public schools to the mayor. 
   It transfers all State education agency responsibilities from the Board of Education to the State education office; creates an Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission; establishes an Office of Ombudsman for public education; and a Public Education Facilities Management and Construction Authority.

   H. Res. 307 commends public servants for their outstanding contributions to this great Nation during Public Service Recognition Week, May 7 through May 13, 2007. This resolution salutes their unyielding dedication and spirit of public service. 
   On Tuesday, April 17, 2007, I introduced this legislation in conjunction with Senator Akaka, who introduced S. Res. 150 to honor and celebrate the commitment of the men and women who have dedicated their lives to serving the public. 
   Over 18 million individuals in cities, counties and States in America and abroad serve our government and the American people. They perform essential services that the Nation relies upon every day. Federal employees from agencies like the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and the Food and Drug Administration are committed to promoting health, advances in research, regulating industries, and ensuring the well-being and safety of our citizens. 
   The men and women serving in the Armed Forces of the United States as well as the skilled trade and craft employees who support their efforts contribute greatly to the security of our country and to the world. We cannot thank our public servants enough for the work that they do for their fellow citizens day in and day out. 
   Governments at all levels simply cannot function properly without good employees who are committed to public service. We should be reminded of their contributions, not just in May, but when we are setting their pay and benefits, and by ensuring that they have the resources they need to do their jobs. 
   Last Wednesday, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 150, the companion bill to H. Res. 307, and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I guess if I had not had to be here today, I would have been back in my community, where I live, at the Friendship Baptist Church, and I would have been there because today was the funeral for Mrs. Lucy Hall, who was the wife of the pastor of that church for the last 50 years. 
   The Hall family have made tremendous impact on not only the community where we live, but also on the city of Chicago and its surrounding communities. 
   Mrs. Hall was a retired educator. She and her husband raised their three children in our neighborhood. Two of their children are judges. One is an appellate court judge in the State of Illinois. The other is a supreme court judge in New York, and of course, their son is a noted psychologist who works in the State of New York. 
   But Mrs. Hall exemplified the essence of excellence. She was indeed a grand lady, full of dignity, full of charm, full of commitment, full of dedication and full of hard work. She and her husband are legends in our neighborhood. 
   They developed programs which originated at the Friendship Baptist Church to deal with health issues such as cancer. They provided mammogram screening and education. They had after-school reading and boy scouts and tutoring. 
   So I simply take to the floor this evening to extend my condolences to the Hall family, to Reverend Shelvin Jerome Hall, to Judge Shelvin Louise Hall, to Judge Hall of the Supreme Court in New York, to their brother and the Halls' son and all of the members of a great family in the community where I live and work. 
   We shall miss her, but we rejoice in the life that she lived.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of House Resolution 291, which honors our fallen law enforcement officers. 
   H. Res. 291, which has 72 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Ted Poe of Texas on March 29, 2007. H. Res. 291 was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   Historically, America has been blessed with citizens of courage and character who have dedicated their lives to keeping peace in our communities. Five years after the creation of the U.S. Marshals Service in 1789, U.S. Marshal Robert Forsyth was shot and killed in the line of duty. He was the first of more than 14,000 law enforcement personnel since that time to give his or her life to uphold the law. 
   Last year, 143 officers gave their lives in the line of duty. For these heroes, the safety of their fellow citizens was their purpose and passion. They made the ultimate sacrifice to fulfill their duty and service to humanity. 
   Each year, the President issues a proclamation naming May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Our Nation owes a lasting debt and gratitude to the men and women of law enforcement who risk their lives each day to protect and serve the citizens of this Nation. 
   Every American should honor peace officers, not only in words and ceremony but in their commitment to promote justice, fairness and peace in their homes, communities, schools and businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Poe for seeking to honor our fallen heroes, and I urge swift passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues as we pay tribute to Representative JULIA CARSON. 
   JULIA and I were elected at the same time and soon discovered that we knew many of the same people because a large number of individuals from the town where I grew up migrated to Indianapolis and became very much involved in the affairs of the city. 
   We also discovered that JULIA and my cousin were good friends because they were the longest serving African Americans elected in Indiana. They both had been trustees for a long time, JULIA in Indianapolis and Dozier Allen in Gary. 
   But JULIA and I worked together on something called responsible fatherhood legislation that we had been working with Senator EVAN BAYH from Indiana and Senator BARACK OBAMA from Illinois. We introduced that legislation and actually planned to give it a real push in 2008. If we are able to really move it, I would like to see us actually name it the JULIA CARSON Responsible Fatherhood Act.     
   And so it's been a pleasure working with JULIA. 
   She actually would drive. Well, she wouldn't always drive herself, but sometimes she would, from Indianapolis to Chicago. We had a hearing at the Federal Reserve Bank, and I get there downtown Chicago, there's JULIA in her van, coming to testify. And all of us knew that she'd been ill. All of us knew the difficulty that she had. And I said, JULIA, how did you get here? She said, Ain't nothing but a little sport. 
   And so JULIA, we're going to miss you. You were a brave soul, had a great heart. JULIA is a legend in Indianapolis. I mean, those of us who know her here, we know her in a sense. But in Indianapolis, she's an absolute legend.

   You know, the more I listen to this debate, the more convinced I am that we need H.R. 5811, the Electronic Message Preservation Act, and I'm convinced because even as we talk about energy, even as we talk about the solution to problems, and even as we talk about Blue Dogs and yellow dogs and big dogs, it seems to me that we ought to be able to know what the conversations are about in the White House. It seems to me that we ought to be able to look back historically and find out what was being discussed, what was being planned, what the deliberations were.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join with Representative Chet Edwards and his fellow colleagues from the State of Texas in considering H.R. 3721, which renames the postal facility in Lorena, Texas, after Marine Gunnery Sergeant John D. Fry. 
   As stated, the measure at hand was first introduced by Congressman Chet Edwards on October 2, 2007, and is cosponsored by all members of the Texas congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it was passed by voice vote on December 12, 2007. 
   H.R. 3721 would help to remember the life, service and legacy of Marine Gunnery Sergeant John D. Fry by renaming the Lorena Post Office on Lorena Road in his honor. Assigned to the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Fry was working to disarm an improvised explosive device in the Anbar Province of Iraq when he was killed at the young age of 28. 
   A graduate of Waco Christian Academy, Sergeant Fry will always be remembered by his family, friends, fellow marines, and, of course, by his country, for his bravery and unselfish service in Iraq.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand for the purpose to move H.R. 5479, which seeks to pay tribute to a Civil War veteran and hero, Mr. Alonzo Woodruff, by designating the North Kidd Street Post Office Building in Ionia, Michigan, after this forgotten soldier. 
   H.R. 5479's introduction came on February 25, 2008, introduced by Representative Vernon Ehlers of the great State of Michigan and is cosponsored by the State's entire congressional delegation. The measure was considered and approved by the Oversight and Government Reform committee on March 13, 2008, which brings us to this morning's discussion on the measure. 
   History reveals that Alonzo Woodruff was a Union soldier during our country's Civil War and received the Medal of Honor for his courageous acts of service at the 1864 Civil War Battle of Hatcher's Run in Virginia. 
   Mr. Woodruff's story of heroism and service provides an interesting glimpse into 19th century history. According to legend, Alonzo Woodruff was only 22 years old and recently married when the Michigan farmer joined the Union cause at the end of 1861. Two years later, Woodruff risked his life in hand-to-hand combat when he charged into Confederate lines to rescue a fellow soldier. 
   Mr. Speaker, in honor of Mr. Woodruff's heroism and dedication to preserving the United States, I would urge that we pass H.R. 5479 without reservation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to present for consideration H.R. 5528, which seeks to commemorate the life of Rocky Marciano, the undefeated boxer from Brockton, Massachusetts, by naming a United States Post Office in his honor. 
   Rocky Marciano's story serves as a testament to the American Dream and the endless possibilities that line every street in our great country. His accomplishments remind us of the fact that the United States of America is a place where a poor and disadvantaged young man growing up in the rough neighborhoods of Brockton, Massachusetts, can aspire and achieve greatness. 
   H.R. 5528 was introduced by Representative STEPHEN LYNCH of Massachusetts on March 4, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, by voice vote. The measure has the support of the nine members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and upon passage will pay tribute to a man who demonstrated the limitless potential that lies within each human being. The obstacles Rocky Marciano had to overcome in life, whether they were physical, financial, or spiritual, provide inspiration to us all. 
   Rocco Francis Marchegiano was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, on September 1, 1923. Weighing 12 pounds and sporting a robust frame, it was obvious, even as a newborn, that Rocky Marciano was not a pushover. Yet his luck was not as healthy as his physique. At 18 months Rocky contracted pneumonia and would have perished were it not for his remarkably strong constitution. Thus starting from a tender age, Rocky learned how to fight back to overcome daunting odds. 
   His first introduction to boxing came when he and some friends set up a stuffed mail sack in Marchegiano's backyard to serve as a boxing bag. Now, as chairman of the Federal Workforce, D.C., and Postal Service Subcommittee, I wouldn't normally approve of using mail sacks in such an abusive way. But in Rocky's case, I must say that his resourcefulness is quite admirable. 
   At age 20 Rocky was drafted into the U.S. Army to fight overseas in the European theater. After only 8 months, he was flown back to the States where he awaited transfer to the Pacific in Fort Lewis, Washington. While stationed at Fort Lewis, he volunteered to represent his unit in a ring of amateur fights and eventually won the boxing tournament in 1946. From that point onward, sports history would be forever changed and Rocky Marciano would begin his long career as world champion until he announced retirement in April of 1956. 
   On the eve of his 46th birthday in 1969, Marciano was aboard a small private plane that went down on its way to Des Moines, Iowa. In memory of Rocky Marciano and in honor of his accomplishment, I urge swift passage of H.R. 5528. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues from the State of California in the consideration of H.R. 4185, which names the postal facility in El Monte after Specialist Marisol Heredia, a distinguished and heroic American servicewoman. 
   H.R. 4185, which was introduced by Representative Solis of California on November 11, 2007, was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, by a voice vote. The measure has the support of the California delegation, and provides us with yet another opportunity to pay tribute to a member of our country's Armed Services. 
   Specialist Marisol Heredia was only 19 years old when, on September 7, 2007, she died at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio as a result of complications suffered from a noncombat-related injury she received on July 18 in Baghdad, Iraq. Specialist Heredia was assigned to the 15th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. 
   Described as a strong-willed and perceptive young woman, Specialist Heredia held the rank of Specialist 4, and had served for months in war-torn Iraq before being badly burned on July 18 while refilling a generator. Although this special young lady was only 19 years old when she lost her life, her service and faithful commitment to preserving the liberties and freedoms for which our Nation is built upon are sure to live on forever. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, let us remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice made by Specialist Marisol Heredia and pass this measure at hand. 
   I urge passage and reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5483, which renames a post office building in Oakton, Virginia, after one of our country's fallen soldiers: Private First Class David H. Sharrett II. 
   H.R. 5483 was introduced on February 25, 2008, by Congressman TOM DAVIS, our committee's ranking member, and has the support of the entire Virginia delegation, which is only fitting as the measure honors one of the State's native sons and heroes. H.R. 5483 was considered by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on March 13, 2008, where it was passed without objection by voice vote. 
   A longtime resident of the Northern Virginia community of Fairfax, Private First Class David H. Sharrett II was tragically killed on Wednesday, January 16, 2008, along with two other soldiers from his command, when they were attacked by grenade and small-arms fire during a combat operation in Balad, Iraq. 
   Known throughout the area as a star defensive end for the Oakton High School football team, Private Sharrett elected to enlist in the U.S. military in the summer of 2006 and was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. According to Private Sharrett's father, David's tour of duty in Iraq was scheduled to end in October of 2009 and he planned to return to Northern Virginia to earn a degree in education and possibly become a history teacher, which I must say is another noble and honorable profession. Although Private Sharrett's dream must now go unaccomplished, let the record show that his valiant service to our country and the world will undoubtedly live on for generations to come. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we join with Representative TOM DAVIS, our colleague from Virginia, in acknowledging the life and sacrifices of Private First Class David H. Sharrett II and pass H.R. 5483. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I stand to present H. Res. 1016, which was introduced by Representative Tom Feeney of Florida on March 4 of this year, and enjoys the cosponsorship of over 90 Members of Congress. The measure was considered by and voted out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on March 13, 2008, after having been amended. 
   William F. Buckley was born on November 24, 1925, in New York City, and even as a young child he displayed a remarkable level of intelligence and awareness. Along with English, Mr. Buckley was fluent in Spanish and French, and was an avid musician and outdoorsman. 
   After attending the National Autonomous University in Mexico in 1943, Buckley was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. During his tenure, he served as a member of Franklin Roosevelt's Honor Guard until the President passed away. After his military service, Buckley went on to attend Yale, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones Society, a master debater, and editor in chief of the Yale Daily News. He studied political science, history, and economics, graduating with honors in 1950. 
   In 1950, Buckley married Patricia Alden Austin Taylor, and as a major proponent of marriage, Mr. Buckley practiced what he preached, having been married himself for 57 years. In 1951, he was recruited by the CIA while publishing his first book, God and Man at Yale. He would later go on to write a volume of novels, over 50 more, featuring topics ranging from history to sailing. Most everyone knows him for his hosting of the PBS show, Firing Line, where he displayed a scholarly, light-hearted style. 
   In February of 2008, Bill Buckley was found dead at his home in Stamford, Connecticut. Let us remember him for his great oratory skills, his admirable journalism, and his overall commitment to social activism. Mr. Buckley is known for a number of views, ranging from drug legalization to opposition of the Iraq war, and whether you agreed or disagreed with him, you must recognize him for being a spirited man, well thought in his opinions, and loyal to his country. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H. Res. 687, a resolution amended in committee, which recognizes Rev. Ted Hesburgh for his contributions to the civil rights movement in America, his tireless work to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict, and for seeking the peaceful resolution of international conflict. 
   H. Res. 687, has 103 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative JOE DONNELLY on September 27, 2007. H. Res. 687, was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 4, as amended, by voice vote. 
   Madam Speaker, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh is president emeritus of the  University of Notre Dame. He retired from active service as the 15th president of the university in 1987. During his 35 years as an educator, he oversaw the growth of the university and the admission of women to the undergraduate program. Rev. Hesburgh's public service was recognized when he received the Congressional Gold Medal in July of 2000. The leadership of the Senate and the House of Representatives gathered in the rotunda of the Capitol as President William Clinton presented Rev. Hesburgh with the Congressional Gold Medal. Rev. Hesburgh has held 16 Presidential appointments pertaining to many social issues. 
   Living 90 miles from Notre Dame, it was as if Father Hesburgh was the pied piper for Notre Dame University. During his tenure in office, young people, especially from throughout the entire Midwest, clamored for a spot at Notre Dame. High school students, especially those at many of the top Catholic schools throughout the country, their greatest hope was to get an opportunity to go to Notre Dame. And so I am pleased to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to a man who is difficult to describe. Yes, he was an educator. Yes, he was a priest. Yes, he was Catholic; but he was so many things until there is no way that you can pigeonhole him. You can only say here is a great American who has contributed significantly to the development of the world order. And so I urge passage of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Fribley earned a degree from Indiana State University in recreation and sports management. He was working at a retirement home in Fort Myers, Florida, a job he loved, when the terrorist attacks occurred on September 11, 2001. Mr. Fribley joined the Marines. He wrote in a letter to his parents: ``Right now, I'm sure I'm where God wants me to be.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to commend Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Representative Tom Davis for their continued work and collaboration on the development of this legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1124, the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999. It will reauthorize funding for the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program which will help promote higher education for high school graduates in the District of Columbia. 
   DCTAG provides grants for District high school students to attend public colleges and universities nationwide at in-State tuition rates. The bill provides smaller grants for District students to attend private institutions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and to attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, nationwide. 
   The impact of this legislation on the community and in the lives of the students who receive the grant cannot be minimized. DCTAG reaches students and communities where there is little hope of being able to obtain a college education. This is particularly true for many of the students that participate in DCTAG; 58 percent of the students that participate in the program come from low-income households. Furthermore, students that participate in the program are attending educational institutions that are known to nurture students of color. Five of the top 10 private schools these students attend are Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Hampton University, Morehouse College, Virginia Union University, and St. Augustine's College and Bennett College. 
   While students from all races participate in the program and attend over 270,000 institutions in 47 States, including nationally recognized public institutions like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Illinois at both Chicago and Champaign-Urbana, the University of California Berkley, and the Ohio State University, this program serves a community that is lacking resources, especially for students of color from low-income households. 
   On March 22, 2007, the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia held a hearing on DCTAG. During the hearing, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, parents of DCTAG students, and former DCTAG scholars testified to the benefits of the program. DCTAG has helped thousands of D.C. residents achieve their dream of attending college. If not for DCTAG, many of these students would not be able to afford  the rising cost of a college education. The DCTAG program helps to turn dreams into realities. 
   Madam Speaker, again I want to commend ranking minority member, Representative Tom Davis, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for introducing this legislation. 
   I want to end by suggesting that, given the fact that there is only one public institution of higher learning in the District of Columbia, that many of these young people would never have the opportunity to attend traditional State colleges and universities were it not for the DCTAG program. I urge its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Football is an American pastime, and even people who don't know a great deal about the game oftentimes get caught up in what takes place, what goes on and what is happening. And so when one can rise to the top of the list in his profession, throw more passes than anybody else has ever thrown, thrill more audiences than perhaps anyone else thrilled, keep people coming and enjoying and interacting and being proud of not only the areas that they come from but proud of the contribution that one makes not only on the field but off the field, all of the charitable groups and organizations of which Brett and his family are a part of, gives us further reason to commend Representative STEVE KAGEN for his introduction of this legislation. 
   I certainly would urge its passage.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H.R. 3530, which names a postal facility in Inverness, Florida, after Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver. 
   H.R. 3530, which was introduced by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite on September 14, 2007, was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Florida congressional delegation. 
   Madam Speaker, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron A. Weaver was killed on January 8, 2004, while on board a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter when it crashed during a Medevac mission in Fallujah, Iraq. He was assigned to C Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
   Chief Warrant Officer Weaver's job in Iraq was to fly observation helicopters, monitor the enemy and send the information he gathered back to headquarters. He was on a Black Hawk helicopter en route to Baghdad for a checkup when the craft was shot down by enemy fire. Eight soldiers besides Chief Warrant Officer Weaver were killed. Chief Warrant Officer Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, but did not survive his tour in Iraq. He was a committed soldier and leader who served his country with honor and distinction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 588, a bill that recognizes Martha Coffin Wright on the 200th anniversary of her birth and her induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. H. Res. 588, which has 55 cosponsors, was introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) on July 31, 2007. H. Res. 588 was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 4, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   Madam Speaker, Martha Coffin Wright was the youngest of eight children, and her sister Lucretia Coffin Mott was the second oldest. The two sisters worked tireless hours as activists for women's rights. Mrs. Wright participated in many State and national women's rights conventions in various capacities, often serving as president. She was also active in the abolition movement. 
   With her sister, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Wright attended the founding meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia in 1833. Later, she presided over many anti-slavery meetings which were often disrupted by angry anti-abolitionist mobs. She used her home in Auburn, New York, as a station on the Underground Railroad to help runaway slaves gain their freedom. Mrs. Wright was a good friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for seeking to honor the life and accomplishments of Mrs. Wright and remind us all of what she and other people like her taught, a lesson that we remember even to this day, and that is the primary right that we actually have is the right to struggle. Those who would dare to struggle would dare to be victorious.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, realizing that I will not have an opportunity to call the Chicago Cubs champions this year, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 630, a bill that congratulates the Warner Robins Little League baseball team. H. Res. 630, which has 55 cosponsors, was introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) on September 4, 2007. H. Res. 630 was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 4, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   Madam Speaker, Georgia's Warner Robins Little League team beat Tokyo 3-2, to claim the world championship title on August 26, 2007. This is the second year in a row that a Georgia team has won the Little League Baseball World Series Championship game. 
   Dalton Carriker hit a dramatic home run in the bottom of the eighth inning to beat the Japanese baseball team for the championship. Carriker said, ``I felt like I was flying, like Peter Pan. I didn't know what I was doing.'' This was a stunning home run that gave the United States its third straight Little League Championship. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) for congratulating the Warner Robins Little League baseball team from Warner Robins, Georgia, on winning the 2007 Little League World Series. I know that oftentimes individuals wonder why these things are done and what relevance they are, but the reality is that as young people grow to function with each other and learn the value of teamwork and learn what it means to win not just a game of baseball, but what it means to win in the game of life, all of the things that it takes to be successful as a Little League baseball team, those same principles can be applied to everyday life. 
   When we congratulate these young people, we are also encouraging other young people. I would love to see a Little League baseball team on every square mile, in every neighborhood, in every block, so that as many young people as possible would get the opportunity to experience what the youngsters from Warner Robins, Georgia, have been able to experience. 
   Madam Speaker, again, I commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) for his introduction of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (THE TRUE GOAL OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described the end result of education as a person having the ability to think intensively and critically. He embraced the idea that intelligence plus character should be the true goal of our education system. This truly is the goal that we must strive and work towards. 
   Helping our children to think is crucial; however, the blocks to build to that point are difficult to create. It takes support, resources, confidence and opportunity, but most importantly, these pieces must be available for each individual no matter who or where they come from. 
   Today we find our public school systems throughout America in many places in disarray, underfunded, overpopulated, and, in many districts, underattended. As a Nation, we have moved forward, and then there are times when it looks as though we're doing the Watusi, that is, two steps forward, and two steps back. 
   I can remember a time when, in almost any community that you went, people realized and recognized that education was the absolute key to progress. 
   According to the Abecedarian study, the importance of early childhood education is critical. The report shows that children who receive a formal early childhood education overwhelmingly do better in school. 
   Unfortunately, 55 percent of children whose families are below the poverty line do not receive a formal early childhood education. An overwhelming number of these children, whose mothers are unemployed, do not have access to early childhood education. These numbers are astonishing, especially given what we already know. 
   We are engaged in competitiveness, not just in communities and neighborhoods or States, but from a global perspective, and unless children get an early beginning, they find themselves continuously behind and finding it difficult to catch up. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, one of the areas that I have a tremendous amount of concern about is the fact that African American males are graduating from high school at a rate of less than 50 percent. As a matter of fact, many of them drop out as early as third or fourth grade. 
   And it's my contention that they drop out because, for many of them, they have never seen a male figure with a book in his hand. They've never had a male teacher who looked like them. They've never seen a male at home with a book. And so they contend that education is a female or woman or girl kind of thing. 
   And we must find ways to get more male teachers in the classroom, more male teachers involved in Head Start. And we must get communities totally engaged and totally involved, so that as children grow up, they will know that education has been and will continue to be the great equalizer, and without it they don't have a chance. 
   So I thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the Congressional Black Caucus, our chairman, Representative Kilpatrick, for setting aside this time to address education issues, especially affecting African American communities.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of the Senate amendments.  
   I rise in support of the bailout proposal before us, and I do not voice my support without some trepidation. However, I feel that the state of our economy is such that we have no logical and prudent choice except to act and to do so now. 
   Like many people across America, I am not happy about using public money to benefit the robber barons on Wall Street. Therefore, I am pleased to see the high level of independent oversight contained in this package. I know that many people are saying that there is no real help for home owners, for people facing foreclosure, and for those who have already lost their homes and/or their life savings. Therefore, I am pleased to note that this package provides for loan modifications which state concretely that when: 
   1. The government owns the entire loan. 
   2. The Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies [FDIC, Federal Reserve, FHFA, GSE's] must: 
   A. coordinate efforts to gain ownership and control. 
   B. create a Government-wide plan to maximize loan modifications. 
   I. GOVERNMENT HAS A PARTIAL INTEREST 
   The Secretary must: 
   1. Work with services to modify loans under Hope for Homeowners programs now strengthened to: (a) Allow homeowners to refinance before reset, (b) provide flexibility on  loan-to value-ration, and (c) speed up waivers for second mortgage holders. 
   2. The Secretary must also fund support to services to ensure the ability to do loan modifications, i.e., loans to cover capital advances. 
   II. GOVERNMENT HAS NO OWNERSHIP INTEREST 
   1. Will offer loan guarantees to induce mortgage holders to make substantial loan modifications. 
   2. Applies to loans that may not be eligible for other Government refinancing programs. 
   III. TENANT PROTECTIONS 
   1. The Secretary where permissible shall permit bona-fide tenants current in their rent to remain in their homes. 
   2. The interagency plan for maximizing loan modifications must include protecting Federal, State, and local rental subsidies and ensuring that any loan must take into account the need for operating subsidies. 
   Madam Speaker, I know that there has been and continues to be a great deal of talk about sweeteners. Well I use Equal, and I am ecstatic to note that in this package, serious consideration is being given to the concept of mental health parity. 
   If there is a sweetener which would have influenced my position and my vote, this is it. No, this is not a perfect bill and I am sure that some people on Wall Street will benefit; but I do believe that more people on Main Street will feel safer and more secure that their investments are being protected, that their homes and insurance policies will be saved and their children's futures will be more secure. I vote ``yes.''

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I'm convinced that the most widespread and most impactful health issue and problem which we face today is in the area of mental health and mental illness. The numbers of individuals affected are so great until it is more than difficult to get a handle on them, and that is one of the reasons that I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad for their leadership in introducing this legislation and shepherding it to the floor. 
   When we consider the numbers of people who suffer from drug addiction, whose lives are filled with anxiety, depression, fear, and uncertainty, we can readily see that more attention must be paid to our mental health needs. When we see the numbers of people living in shelters, halfway houses, and in many instances under viaducts, abandoned cars, and in the streets, when we see the numbers of people who make up the criminally ill, who hurt, injure, maim and sometimes kill other people because they've never been able to shake their demons who disrupt and plague their lives because they've had no mental health attention or treatment, Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that this is an idea whose time has come. 
   I urge passage of this legislation.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5220, which renames the postal facility in Beaverton, Oregon after the legendary Major Arthur Chin. 
   The measure being considered was first introduced by Congressman DAVID WU of the State of Oregon on January 29, 2008, and is cosponsored by all members of the Oregon congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and on February 26, 2008, our committee approved the bill by voice vote. 
   H.R. 5220 allows us to pay homage to the service of Major Arthur Chin, whose tale of heroism and dedication should be known by every American. Born in the city of Portland, Oregon, which lies in the congressional district of my dear friend, Representative DAVID WU, on October 23, 1913, Arthur Chin is best known for his service as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Air Force which was the first and original group of American volunteer combat aviators to fight in World War II. 
   An American-born citizen of Chinese descent, Major Chin is deemed America's first World War II ace, and in appreciation for his valiant service he has been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. This is in addition to having received the Five Star Medal, Six Star Medal, the Awe-Inspiring Medal 3rd Grade, and the list goes on. 
   Major Chin's public service didn't cease with the end of the war. After being honorably discharged from the military in 1945, Major Chin returned to private life in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. It appears that Major Chin actually worked at the Beaverton Post Office before retiring in 1980. Major Chin passed away on September 3, 1997 in Portland, only a month before his October 4 Hall of Fame of the American Airpower Heritage Museum induction ceremony. 
   Mr. Speaker, given Major Chin's illustrious background, I agree that it is only befitting that we pass H.R. 5220 and name the U.S. postal facility on 185th Avenue in Beaverton, Oregon after this great American citizen.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my deepest sympathies to the victims and families who suffered the horrific shooting tragedy at Northern Illinois University. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have suffered through this great loss, especially the families, students, faculty and staff of the university. 
   Northern Illinois University is one of the largest schools in Illinois, providing higher education to more than 25,000 students. The effects of this tragedy can be felt all across the State, and have echoed throughout the Nation. 
   Parents send their children to school each day to learn about the world around them and to grow and develop into responsible adults. Parents that send their children off to college expect that they will be safe and will graduate with newfound knowledge and a bright future. 
   As we mourn with the Northern Illinois University community, this Congress must continue in its work to make all schools safe in order to prevent this kind of tragedy in the future. We must continue to work with our colleges and universities to develop ways to anticipate, identify and prevent these horrific and disturbing acts of violence. 
   Mr. Speaker, we stand to show our support to the family, students, faculty and staff of Northern Illinois University who continue on despite the tragic events surrounding them. I know that the healing process will take time, but I also hope that some day soon, all members of the Northern Illinois University community will feel the safety and security that all students should have. 
   Mr. Speaker, especially do I want to extend appreciation to the president of Northern Illinois University, to the faculty and staff, and especially one program, something called the Chance Program, which opens its doors to students from all over the State, provides the sanctuary of the opportunity to get the best possible education, and we hope that they can put this tragedy behind them as we continue to move forward.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1013, which expresses the sense of Congress that providing breakfast in school has a positive impact on classroom performance. 
   We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Indeed, good nutrition is a vital factor in a child's ability to grow and thrive. According to the Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition, hungry children have less energy for cognitive and social activities, thereby hampering their ability to learn. 
   The National School Breakfast Program was established as a pilot program by the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and made permanent in 1975. The program was created to ensure that all students start the school day with a nutritious breakfast and enter the classroom ready to learn. Over the last five decades, the National School Breakfast Program has continued to grow. It now operates in nearly 84,000 public and nonprofit schools and residential care institutions nationwide. In 2006, 9.7 million children participated in the National School Breakfast Program each day; 7.9 million of those students received free or reduced-price breakfasts. 
   Again, I want to commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Gwendolyn Moore, for introducing this resolution, join with all of those  who have expressed its merit, and urge passage.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 292, which acknowledges and seeks to honor the late Margaret Truman Daniel for her lifetime of achievements and accomplishments. H. Con. Res. 292 was introduced by Representative Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri on February 12, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, by voice vote. 
   This measure has the support of over 50 Members of Congress, and provides our body a collective opportunity to both recognize and pay tribute to one of America's remarkable and accomplished first daughters, the Honorable Margaret Truman Daniel. 
   Margaret Truman Daniel was born on February 17, 1924, in Independence, Missouri, to the parents of former President Harry S Truman and first lady Elizabeth ``Bess'' Virginia Wallace. In fact, she was the couple's only child. A public school student up until the time of her father's election to the U.S. Senate in 1934, Margaret Truman Daniel would later attend George Washington University, beginning in the fall of 1944, which was the same year her father was elected Vice President. 
   Ms. Truman Daniel graduated from George Washington University in 1946, receiving a bachelor of arts degree in history. It was her father, who had been President since April 12, 1945, that delivered the commencement address at Ms. Truman Daniel's graduation ceremony and presented her with her diploma. 
   Beyond her role as the daughter of an American President, Margaret Truman Daniel was a talented vocalist and skillful journalist in radio and print media throughout much of the 1950s. It was around this time that Ms. Truman Daniel would meet her husband, Clifton Daniel, with whom she would later raise four boys, Clifton, William, Harrison and Thomas. 
   The 1984 recipient of the Harry S Truman Public Service award, presented annually by the City of Independence to an outstanding American citizen, and an acclaimed author, Margaret Truman Daniel was able to touch the hearts and minds of so many people in our country before passing away on January 28 of this year. 
   I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that all of us agree and concur in the passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I always knew that Representative DAN BURTON was indeed a superstar. I just didn't get a chance to watch him play. Of course, ED TOWNS often talks about his days as a star athlete and basketball player. 
   But as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 286, which acknowledges sports legend Earl Lloyd for breaking the color barrier and becoming the first African American to play in the National Basketball Association League 58 years ago. 
   H. Con. Res. 286 was introduced by our colleague, Representative JIM MORAN of Virginia, on January 29, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, by voice vote. The measure has the support of over 85 Members of Congress and provides our body a chance to reflect on and remember another individual's inspiring story as part of our country's long history of racial integration. 
   Mr. Lloyd's participation in the 1950-51 professional basketball season marked the integration of the National Basketball Association, which has since then become one of the most diverse professional sporting leagues in the world. 
   A native of Alexandria, Virginia, Earl Lloyd has long been recognized as  one of the NBA's early defense greats. Earl Lloyd, also known as ``Big Cat,'' played college basketball at West Virginia State College before being selected in the ninth round of the 1950 NBA draft by the Washington Capitols. Under Lloyd's leadership, West Virginia State became the only undefeated college team in the United States during the 1947-48 season. 
   After his years with the Washington Capitols, Lloyd joined the Syracuse Nationals and became the first black player to win an NBA championship. Later, with the Detroit Pistons, he was the first African American to be named an assistant coach and the first to be named the bench coach. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us also note that although Lloyd was the first to play in an NBA game, there were actually three African Americans to enter the NBA in the 1950-51 season. During this season, Charles ``Chuck'' Cooper played with the Boston Celtics, and Nat ``Sweetwater'' Clifton became the first African American to play for the New York Knicks. 
   Even today, as we continue to see African Americans break barriers and become the first in an array of fields from athletics to business, Presidential campaigns to research and discovery, let us take an opportunity to look back on what occurred 58 years ago to make our Nation a more perfect Union. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H. Con. Res. 286, which expresses the sense of Congress that Earl Lloyd should be recognized and honored for breaking the color barrier and becoming the first African American to play in the National Basketball Association.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from the Buckeye State of Ohio in consideration of H.R. 5400, which renames the postal facility in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, in honor of Sergeant Michael M. Kashkoush. 
   H.R. 5400 comes to us with widespread support from the Ohio congressional delegation, yet the measure was first introduced by my colleague, Representative Steve LaTourette, back on February 12, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, where it was passed by the panel by voice vote. 
   H.R. 5400 calls for honoring Sergeant Kashkoush's service to our country by naming the post office in his hometown of Chagrin Falls after him. 
   Assigned to the 3rd Intelligence Battalion, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Okinawa, Japan, Sergeant Michael M. Kashkoush succumbed to his death on January 23, 2007, as a result of fatal wounds received while conducting combat operations in Iraq's Anbar province. 
   Born and raised in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, Sergeant Kashkoush was a graduate of Chagrin Falls High School, where he was instrumental in taking the school's football and wrestling teams to winning seasons before electing to enlist in the Marine Corps after graduation. Sergeant Kashkoush was only 24 years old when he died in the line of duty as a counterintelligence/human intelligence specialist attached to the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division. 
   Mr. Speaker, in honor of Sergeant Kashkoush's sacrifice and service to America, let us pass without reservation H.R. 5400.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, public radio, of course, is one of the things that all of us spend a great deal of time listening to. As a matter of fact, there are many of us, and many people in America, who feel that if they don't get the opportunity to listen, to know what has taken place, to recognize what is going on in our country, then they are seriously deprived. 
   Whereas the mission of public radio is to create a better informed public that is challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures; and whereas public radio is almost a mainstay in hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of Americans' homes. We wake up in the morning, many families go to bed at night, and public radio is the balance that they need to feel that the information they are receiving is not being commercialized, that it is information that is coming straight from wherever the purveyors have gotten it.     
   They are not necessarily trying to shape ideas in one direction or another, but to simply give information to people that they can use and take advantage of and make it a part of their everyday lives. 
   So, based upon those facts and based upon that information, it is certainly my pleasure to express support for this legislation. I want to commend the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Blumenauer, for introducing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration H. Res. 1219, which celebrates our Nation's flag and the goals of Flag Day, a day honoring the America's most enduring symbol. 
   H. Res. 1219's lead sponsor, Representative Robert Latta of Ohio, introduced the bill on May 21, 2008, and it was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote. This measure has the support and sponsorship of 62 Members of Congress and expresses our appreciation for and belief in the power of the red, white and blue. 
   The importance of the American flag as a symbol to our Nation is enormous. Our flag represents the service men and women who proudly wear it, the judges and legislators who serve in honor of it, and the millions of Americans who stand daily and pledge their allegiance to it. It is indeed representative of every American as a symbol of hope and freedom that resonates around the world. 
   Flag Day is celebrated every June 14, because it was on that day in 1777 that the Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act, giving our Nation an enduring and identifying emblem. The flag has changed since then, but the ideas it embodies have endured. From the images of the Americans planting the flag in the sands of Iwo Jima, to the flag that was pulled from the rubble of the New York World Trade Center after the attacks of 9/11, Old Glory has become an integral part of our national fabric. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge swift passage of H. Res. 1219, for it will provide due recognition of the importance of the American flag and demonstrate our support of the day which honors it.

   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 6150 which asks that we designate a postal facility in Cleveland after Mr. John Gallagher who served that city faithfully for over 30 years. H.R. 6150, which was introduced by Representative Dennis Kucinich on May 22, 2008, was reported favorably from the Oversight Committee on June 12 by voice vote. 
   The measure, which will name a post office after a truly humble and dedicated civil servant, has the support and sponsorship of the entire Ohio congressional delegation. 
   John Gallagher has been described as a man who served his country and the city of Cleveland with dignity for his entire life. At the age of 19, he joined the U.S. Army where he fought bravely in Europe during World War II. After his years of service, he returned to his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, where he would work for the city government for over 30 years, rising through the ranks to become Cleveland's Superintendent of Sidewalks. 
   Mr. Gallagher did not regard his commitment to the city of Cleveland as anything extraordinary, but that he was simply doing his job, that's all. Like many public sector workers in our country, Mr. Gallagher devoted his life to serving and working on behalf of his fellow citizens. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, let us extend a small token of our appreciation for the work of this outstanding gentleman by passing H.R. 6150 which will rename the postal facility on Lorain Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, as the John P. Gallagher Post Office Building.

   H. Res. 1029 was authored by Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and is cosponsored by 52 Members of Congress. The bill before us was first introduced on March 6, 2008 and was taken up by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on June 12, 2008 where the measure was amended and then passed by a voice vote. 
   A native of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, Juan ``Chi-Chi'' Rodriguez is recognized as one of the greatest golfers of our time, and he is the first Puerto Rican professional golfer to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. With over 37 professional golf wins, including 8 PGA tour wins and 22 Senior PGA tour wins, Mr. Rodriguez rose from sugarcane cutter to world-renowned professional golfer and youth advocate, which is a great indication of one who need not be so concerned about where one comes from but in recognizing where one will be going. 
   Mr. Rodriguez, obviously, went to the very top. Not only did he stand out as a professional golfer, but as a humanitarian and as an individual who gave back and gave to others, he will always be renowned and remembered.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the United States of America has more of its people in prison per capita than any other developed nation in the world, more than 2 million. The vast majority, 95 percent, of the men and women in our prisons will eventually return to the community. This means that every year more than 650,000 offenders are released from State and Federal prisons and return back to civilian life. 
   These men and women deserve a second chance. Their families, spouses, and children deserve a second chance. And their communities deserve a second chance. A second chance means an opportunity to turn a life around, a chance to break the grip of a drug habit; a chance to support a family, to pay taxes, to be self-sufficient. 
   Today, few of those who return to their communities are prepared for their release or receive any supportive service. When the prison door swings open, an ex-offender may receive a bus ticket and spending money for a day or two. Many leave prison to return to the same environment which saw them offend in the first place. But as they return, they often face additional barriers to reentry: serious physical and mental health problems, no place to stay, and lack of education or qualifications to hold a job. As a result, two out of three will be rearrested for new crimes within the first 3 years after their release. Youthful offenders are even more likely to reoffend. 
   One-third of all correction departments provide no services to released offenders, and most departments do not offer a transitional program, placing a heavy burden on families and communities. Considering the cost of incarceration, as much as $40,000 per year, and all the social and economic costs of crime to the community, it is just plain common sense to help ex-offenders successfully reenter our communities and reduce recidivism. 
   That is why I have sponsored the bipartisan Second Chance Act of 2007, H.R. 1593, along with Representatives Cannon, Conyers, Coble, Scott of Virginia, Smith of Texas, Jones of Ohio, Forbes, Schiff, Sensenbrenner, Chabot, Jackson-Lee of Texas, Cummings, Johnson of Georgia, Clarke, and 75 other Members of Congress. 
   A companion bill, S. 1060, has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Biden, Durbin, Specter, Brownback, Leahy, Obama, and 10 others. 
   The Second Chance Act will provide transitional assistance to assist ex-offenders in coping with the challenges of reentry. It will reduce recidivism. It will help reunite families and protect communities. It will enhance public safety and save taxpayer dollars. It is the humane thing to do. It is the responsible thing to do. And, of course, it is the right thing to do. 
   The Judiciary Committee held hearings on the bill last month and quickly voted to send the bill to the full House. I fully expect it to pass soon. The bill has the support of more than 200 criminal justice, service provider, faith-based, housing, governmental, disability, and civil rights organizations. President Bush has signaled his support of the legislation as well. 
   No single piece of legislation is going to solve the reentry crisis we are facing, but the Second Chance Act is a good start. I hope that with passage of this bill, we will begin a new era in criminal justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that any serious effort to facilitate the reentry of men and women with criminal records to civil society must be prepared to do two things. First, we must be prepared to help with drug treatment on demand for everyone who requests it. Second, we need to find work for ex-offenders. Programs don't supply jobs. After ex-offenders have undergone rehabilitation and received appropriate training, employers will have to open their hearts and put these men and women back into the workforce. They do not belong in prison. 
   Many of them don't need prison, but they do need a second chance. Congress can give them that. And we should

I would like to take some of my time to express my deepest appreciation for our Nation's veterans. It is with this that I strongly ask you to expand eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits for all of our veterans. Every day, we find more and more of our veterans returning home with severe physical and mental disabilities. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will act as a cornerstone necessity for providing the medical care, services and treatment that all of our country's finest deserve. 
   This Congress to must ensure that our injured soldiers, sailors, airmen and any other veterans who have returned home with a disability not only receive the basics in terms of medical attention, but also receive proper rehabilitation so that suitable employment in the future can become a viable option. The act of a person once again living independently is the highest goal that this legislation can achieve. Services that provide counseling, education, financial aid, and job assistance are the best tools for our veterans to use in order to get back on their feet and live a life of independence and dignity. Let us not revisit the fatal mistakes made after Vietnam. To quote my good friend and colleague, DICK DURBIN, ``We owe our disabled veterans more than speeches, parades and monuments.''

Res. 89) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as Dutch-American Friendship Day to celebrate the historic ties of the United States and the Netherlands. 
   The Clerk read as follows 
   H. Res. 89 
   Whereas, 225 years ago, on the 19th of April, 1782 in the City of the Hague, the Ambassadorial credentials of John Adams were officially recognized by Prince William V of Orange and the States-General, thus establishing formal diplomatic ties between the new government of the United States and the Republic of the Netherlands.
   Whereas the historical ties between the Dutch and American people go back nearly 200 years earlier to the period when the Pilgrims resided for almost 11 years in the Netherlands before sailing to the new world;
   Whereas the diplomatic ties between the governments of the United States and the Netherlands are the longest continuous ties between the United States and any country of the world;
   Whereas the Dutch contribution to the American melting pot has played such a significant role in the life of America as exemplified by Presidents Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt;
   Whereas the bonds of friendship linking the Dutch and American people continue to grow in strength and affection; and
   Whereas the heritage of this friendship between peoples serves as a laudable example for the kinds of relations that should link all the peoples of the earth and should be properly extolled: Now, therefore, be it

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, every year we and the Dutch-American community in the Netherlands celebrate the bilateral relations between the Netherlands and the United States. On April 19, 1782, John Adams, the second President of the United States, was received by the State's General in The Hague and recognized as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America. 
   Also, this was the day that Mr. Adams purchased a house at Fluwelen Burgwal 18 in The Hague, which became the first American embassy in the world. This day is known by many people as the Dutch-American Friendship Day that reminds us how the Dutch played a role in America's history and traditions. 
   Prior to 1782, America had always had a long-standing relationship with the Dutch going back as far as 1609 when Henry Hudson, an explorer hired by a Dutch-based United East India Company, traveled up a river that now bears his name and made a land claim for his employer in the area known as New York.     
   His exploration helped the Dutch to continue to be the foremost traders and merchant mariners in the world and expanded their influence in setting up a trading post on the southern end of Manhattan Island. In 1625, the Dutch used beads to purchase Manhattan from the Indians for 60 guilders, about $24, and renamed it New Amsterdam. 
   It became the center for trade and commerce that attracted the best and brightest people from different walks of life, culture, and creeds. New Amsterdam received an official charter and officially became a city in 1653, making it to the first city in North America where citizens freely elected their city council. This was one of the first acts to help establish a platform for democracy in the United States. 
   In 1776, the Dutch played a major role in financing the Revolutionary War, and it was repaid by the U.S. Government with stock certificates, an action that eventually led to the establishment of the New York Stock Exchange in 1791. Many prominent Americans from Dutch ancestry have made significant contributions to our country, like Presidents Martin van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. All were great Americans who dedicated their lives to help shape America to be the land of the free and home of the brave. 
   The Dutch contributions to America are part of our customs and traditions that have enriched our lives for over 200 years. So it is very easy to support H. Res. 89. I do so and urge all of my colleagues to give their support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, every February Americans celebrate African American Black History Month. This tribute dates back to 1926, and it is credited to a Harvard scholar, Dr. Carter G. Woodson. Dr. Woodson, the son of former slaves, dedicated his life to ensuring that black history was accurately documented and disseminated. 
   In an effort to bring national attention to the contributions of African Americans, Dr. Woodson organized the first annual Negro History Week in 1926. He selected the second week of February, during which Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass had celebrated their birthdays. 
   Later, Woodson's contributions helped emerge during the civil rights campaign of the 1950s and 1960s, where the black studies movement began to spawn African American history, theory courses, programs and departments on the Nation's college and university campuses. During the early 1970s, Negro History Week was renamed Black History Week; and in 1976, it officially became Black History Month, designating all of February for the recognition of African American history. 
   In 1926, during the time for the first organized tribute to black history, the sociopolitical landscape in this country for African Americans was demonstrably different than it is today. At that time, ``separate but equal,'' a doctrine that afforded African Americans second-class citizenship, was the law of the land, although it was an immoral one. 
   Through many historic efforts of many Americans of all races, legalized discrimination became a thing of the past. This body passed landmark legislation, most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This was just 43 and 42 years ago when President Lyndon Johnson signed these legislative measures into law, laws that prevented Jim Crow laws from subjugating and denying African Americans the right to vote in certain southern States, the imposition of poll taxes, the segregation of schools, housing, bus and train transportation, restrooms and other public accommodations.     
   Moreover, Black History Month is also promoting public awareness of the struggles and achievements of African Americans. We must continue to build  on the existence of the past and look forward to the future. 
   African Americans, over the years, have made great strides, but, yet, we still have a long way to go. For instance, in 2005, there were 37 million poor people in America. The poverty rate is about 24.9 percent for blacks, compared to 8.3 percent for whites. 
   The homeownership rate among white households is about 74.2 percent, compared to 47.1 percent for African Americans. This huge gap between white and black homeowners will continue to be a primary factor that will undermine the growth of African Americans and their family structure to obtain wealth, capital assets and better neighborhoods. 
   While 5 percent of the world's population lives in the United States, we have 25 percent of the world's prison population in United States jails and prisons. Nationally, the Bureau of Justice statistics reports that the United States incarcerates 2 million people. Whites are about 36 percent, compared to 46 percent for blacks in prison. 
   As some of us know, the majority of people in prison are attributed to drug convictions. The law is not equally applied when it comes to drug offenses involving crack and powder cocaine. Five grams of crack cocaine brings a mandatory sentence of 5 years, compared to 5 grams of powder cocaine, which has no sentencing requirements, and the possessor of powder may get probation. Of course, a disproportionate number of the individuals who use crack cocaine are African Americans. 
   These are just a few barriers that many African Americans confront every day. And so when we honor Black History Month, we are recognizing the struggles and achievements of African Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (COMMENDING THE GIRL SCOUTS ON THEIR 95TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was a brisk March morning when Juliette Gordon Low placed a historic phone call to her cousin in Savannah, Georgia. Juliette said, ``Come right over. I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and the world, and we're going to start it tonight.'' 
   That phone call proved to be a historic one. On the evening of March 12, 1912, Juliette Gordon Low gathered 18 girls to register the first troop of Girl Scouts in the United States of America. With one phone call a movement was born. 
   An organization founded upon the principles of strength, empowerment, responsibility, and community, the Girl Scouts have continued to change the lives of many girls for generations. While other organizations have struggled to deal with factors such as race and socioeconomic status, the Girl Scouts have always been looked at as an organization of inclusion, having desegregated councils as early as 1917.     
   The Girl Scouts also offer programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The Girl Scouts Beyond Bars programs helps daughters of incarcerated mothers to connect with their mothers and to have the mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. 
   Another program, Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not comment on one of my favorite Girl Scout traditions, which is the annual cookie sale. For many years, I was overjoyed when I would see the little girls selling cookies door to door. I personally like the shortbread cookies. 
   It is because of the long-standing history and commitment of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America that I commend them and ask my colleagues for their support in the passage of this commendation without delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, although I am voting to support this bailout plan, I am concerned that we do not have enough of an equity remedy for small institutions that held preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I was recently contacted by Standard Life Insurance Company of Indiana (``Standard Life'') regarding an unintended consequence of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac government bailout. Standard Life is a small life insurance company domiciled and headquartered in Indiana, with executive offices in Kentucky. They have approximately 100 employees (all in Indiana and Kentucky) and 30,000 policyholders. They sell traditional annuities for pre-retirement savings and retirement income purposes. Their average customer is approximately 65 years old and average size policy is approximately $50,000. 
   I understand that between late 2007 and early 2008, based on repeated representations by Treasury and Regulatory officials that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were adequately  capitalized and were safe and sound, Standard Life purchased $31 million of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac perpetual preferred stock. 
   On September 7, 2008, Secretary Paulson announced the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a part of which was the elimination of dividends on all preferred stock. The consequence of that action was to cause the securities to be rated near default, requiring Standard Life to carry them at a market value of 10 cents on the dollar for regulatory capital purposes, an immediate reduction of Standard Life's capital from $113 million to $85 million (or diminution of $28 million dollars, or 25 percent). 
   It is my understanding that this result has potentially dire consequences for Standard Life's survival, Kentucky and Indiana jobs and, most importantly, Standard Life's policyholders, if corrective action is not taken by September 30, 2008. Standard Life has been informed by the rating agency A.M. Best that its rating will be cut if the lost capital is not replaced by that time. The rating cut will be from a ``secure'' B++ to a likely ``unsecure'' B or lower. This will likely result in a cascade of negative events: 
   Shut down of sales; extended withdrawal activity (``run on bank''); and regulatory intervention, up to and including receivership and liquidation, which will result in delayed policyholder access to their funds and possible reduction of interest earned on their policies. 
   I believe this was an unintended consequence of the government moving quickly to stabilize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There are a number of ideas being discussed to help companies like Standard Life. It is my hope and desire that the government rescue plan include an equitable remedy for Standard Life and companies in a similar position. I trust that before we finalize this legislation and the President signs it, we will have adequately addressed this very serious issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS IN THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. First of all, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, for yielding time, and I also want to commend him for the tremendous leadership that he continues to play, even as a new Member of Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 474 and take this opportunity to congratulate all of my colleagues who hold the honor and privilege of fatherhood. It is widely understood and acknowledged that the benefits of an actively involved father in the lives of children not only helps but plays a vital role in the formation of successful youth and in the development of contributing members of society. It should come as no surprise that, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, fatherless children are at a dramatically greater risk of drug and alcohol abuse. We know that fatherless children are twice as likely to drop out of school. Just over 41 percent of fatherless families with children are poor, while only 7 percent of children headed by a married couple are considered poor. Furthermore, over two-thirds of mother-only families live twice below the poverty line. 
   Our work today and our work in Congress should not only focus on acknowledging fatherhood but it should focus on empowering fathers to have the capabilities and incentives to be more responsible for their children. Barriers to employment, such as a lack of high school or college degree, as well as criminal histories and substance abuse, all contribute to the lack of fathers in the household and the lack of a regular source of income and the ability to contribute to the family. It is not enough to fill this room with words. The only way to improve the ever-increasing number of families without fathers is through targeting the problems that fathers face by going to the source. One way of doing this is through support of the Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act. Removing employment barriers for noncustodial parents, which mostly tend to be fathers, would be of tremendous benefit. By funding grants to promote reasonable fatherhood, we are directly promoting the futures of innocent children while concurrently strengthening the family. 
   Social scientists have for years debated the role of the father in the family. It is consistently among the top interest of psychologists. Leading professionals indicate that fathers provide role models for their sons to learn how to be a man, whereas girls need fathers to learn how to relate to a man in significant ways. Fathers also tend to constrain and correct violent and antisocial behavior better than anyone else, as well as challenge and promote such characteristics as independence, assertiveness, and achievement. But this is not a new phenomenon. George Herbert, the famous medieval poet and orator, understood. He said that one father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. How true that word is today. 
   I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by remembering the fact that every year I give away scholarships, money that we go out and kind of find for kids to go to college. And on the form, there is an application that says, put down the name of your mother and father, what they do. I must confess that I have been most disheartened, because in some instances children have written on the application form, DNA, meaning that the name of the father does not apply. In some instances they have even written ``unknown.'' Or in other instances they have written ``irrelevant.'' Or ``does not matter.'' If we are to strengthen families, if we are to strengthen our society, then we must find a way to help so many of the individuals who have been out of the picture to cop back in and take on their responsible role of fatherhood. 
   I thank the gentleman again from Illinois for yielding time. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I also use this moment to say thank you to my own father who died 2 years ago, 92 years old. Much of the reason that I stand here today is because of him.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, it is my unique pleasure to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1734, which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 630 Northeast Killingsworth Avenue in Portland, Oregon as the Martin Luther King, Jr. Post Office. 
   The naming of a postal facility in Northwest America, hundreds of miles from Dr. King's civil rights battlefield in the Deep South, is a strong testimony to the far-reaching impact this pivotal figure had on our Nation as a whole.  
   H.R. 1734 was introduced by Representative EARL BLUMENAUER of Oregon on March 28, 2007, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on April 9, 2008, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, we're all well aware of the activism of Dr. Martin Luther King during his lifetime on this Earth. From his leadership in helping to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, to his riveting I Have a Dream speech, Dr. King reminded our country of its fundamental responsibility to safeguard the natural, God-given rights of all men so that we are free to pursue our goals and aspirations without the artificial walls of skin color, religious affiliation, sexuality or any other pointless barrier that separates us from our fellow human persons. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us join our colleagues from the great State of Oregon, and once again pay tribute to the life and work of the great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by renaming this postal facility at 630 Northeast Killingsworth Avenue in Portland, Oregon in honor of this great American hero. I strongly urge passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE DIVERSITY ASSURANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I introduced H.R. 3774, the Senior Executive Diversity Assurance Act, on October 9, 2007. The bill was considered by the Federal Workforce Subcommittee on April 15, 2008, and by the full Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 1, 2008, when it was approved with amendment by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want wanted to thank Senator Akaka for introducing a companion bill in the Senate, S. 2148, and for co-chairing an April 3, 2008, joint hearing where both the House and the Senate Federal Workforce Subcommittees examined the need for legislation to improve diversity at the highest levels of the Federal Government. 
   According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, the percentage of minorities and women at senior pay levels in the Federal Government, including the SES, is lower than in the civilian workforce and the Federal workforce as a whole. According to GAO, the number of African American men in the SES actually decreased between the years of 2000 and 2007. I believe that H.R. 3774 takes an important step towards improving the diversity of the Senior Executive Service. 
   This bill is a long time coming. Since 2003, I have requested Government Accountability Office reports and hearings on this issue. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce Postal Service in the District of Columbia, I held a hearing in May 2007 on diversity in the SES. Following that hearing, my staff and I met with a number of Federal employee organizations, including the African American Federal Executives Association, the National Association of Hispanic Federal Executives, the Asian American Government Executives Network, Federally Employed Women, Blacks in Government, and the Senior Executives Association. 
   We learned that the lack of diversity in the SES is not skewed to a shortage of women and minorities at the GS-15 and GS-14 levels, which are the development pools for the SES. According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2007, minorities made up 22.5 percent of the employees in the SES development pool. At the same time, minorities made up only 15.8 percent of the SES. Rather, we heard that there are concerns with the selection process, and there is a lack of oversight and accountability in promoting and hiring minorities in the SES. 
   The Senior Executive Service Diversity Assurance Act aims to address these concerns. H.R. 3774, as reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, reestablishes the Senior Executive Service Resource Office within the Office of Personnel Management and adds new requirements for the office such as requiring the collection of data on the mark-up of the selection panels that considered candidates for SES positions. OPM currently encourages agencies to make these panels diverse but collects no data on the panels.     
   The bill requires agencies to ensure diversity by including, to the extent practicable, minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities on executive resources boards and any other panels or subgroups used to select SES appointees. This bill provides that OPM and agencies should also give consideration to improving diversity in qualifications review boards, which are the panels set up by OPM to certify the leadership qualifications of potential SES appointees. The bill requires OPM to issue regulations and report to Congress on agency efforts to improve the diversity of executive resources boards and qualifications review boards. 
   Finally, under this bill, agencies will be required to submit diversity plans, modeled on the current requirement that agencies submit plans for the hiring and advancement of individuals with disabilities. Each agency must submit a plan to OPM describing what efforts the agency is making to enhance and maximize opportunities for the advancement and appointment of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities to the SES. These plans will have to be updated every 2 years for 10 years, and OPM will be required to submit a report to Congress summarizing and evaluating agency plans. I have also included a findings section that will help explain the purpose and intent of the legislation which is to address the concerns of the numbers of minorities in the SES. 
   Diversity will not be achieved in the SES on good intentions and failed policies. Now is the time to improve diversity in the SES, particularly since 90 percent of the current SES corps will retire over the next 10 years. Diversity of gender, ethnicity, age, and disabilities, as well as diversity of education, thinking, and experience are crucial if the Federal workforce is to mirror the communities we live in and serve. Paying close attention to diversity is the key to staying competitive in an increasingly global economy and recruiting the best and brightest workforce. It is my belief that all Americans want to work for organizations where they have the opportunity to use their skills, their knowledge to develop their careers. The Senior Executive Service Diversity Assurance Act will help provide that opportunity. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3774. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise to present for our consideration H.R. 5477, which names the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 120 South Del Mar Avenue in San Gabriel, California, as the ``Chi Mui Post Office Building.'' 
   Chi Mui is best known for his commitment to public service as the former mayor of the Southern California City of San Gabriel. H.R. 5477 was first introduced by Representative ADAM SCHIFF on February 21, 2008, and is supported by over 50 Members of Congress, many of whom hail from the State of California. The bill before us has been considered by the Oversight Committee and was approved by the panel on April 16, 2008, by voice vote. 
   Regarded as a role model to those interested in pursuing public service, Mayor Mui was able to rise from the most humble beginnings to become one of Southern California's most respected local leaders and social advocates. 
   A tireless fighter for immigrant rights and affordable housing, Chi Mui's accomplishments and contributions go beyond his service as mayor of San Gabriel of California, to include his work on improving opportunities for deserving youth and ensuring inclusion and integration of Southern California's Asian American population. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was only a few short weeks ago that we here in the House were celebrating both National Public Service Recognition Week and Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Mayor Chi Mui's life helped to highlight the significance of celebrating both of these commemorative celebrations. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this extraordinary American citizen by passing H.R. 5477.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (TELEWORK IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 4106 on November 7, 2007, to improve the efficiency of the Federal workforce by allowing more employees to telework. 
   Telework has a number of benefits for both agencies and employees. A happy workforce is a productive workforce, and giving employees the opportunity to telework can help boost productivity by cutting down on commuting time, reducing absenteeism, and allowing for greater organizational flexibility. 
   Improving telework can also help reduce pollution, traffic congestion, and the significant financial burdens that Federal employees face from high gas prices. 
   Unfortunately, telework is not being used to the fullest extent, and according to a report on telework released by the Office of Personnel Management in December 2007, only 6 percent of Federal employees participated in telework programs in 2006. 
   H.R. 4106 will improve telework in many key ways, while also allowing the government to maintain security of government information and to uphold performance standards. The bill defines telework and requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate agency telework programs. 
   The bill requires the head of each agency to establish a telework policy authorizing employees to telework. The bill sets a consistent standard by providing that an agency will only be considered to be in compliance with the bill's requirements if employees who are authorized the telework are allowed to do so at least 20 percent of the hours worked in every two workweeks. 
   Under H.R. 4106, each agency is required to either appoint a telework managing officer or designate their chief human capital officer or a career employee to carry out the responsibilities of a telework managing officer who will serve as the agency's primary point of contact on telework. 
   The bill also improves the ability of the government to respond to emergencies by requiring larger agencies to incorporate telework into their continuity of operations plans. 
   This bipartisan bill was amended and approved by the Oversight Committee by a voice vote on March 13, 2008. A number of changes were made during the committee's consideration of the bill to address suggestions raised by the ranking minority member of the committee, Representative Tom Davis, such as requiring that essential personnel be equipped to telework during a catastrophe. 
   We are considering the bill today with an amendment that makes further changes to the bill based on feedback from the Office of Personnel Management. For example, the amendment clarifies the definition of continuity of operations to cover a situation such as the 2006 flooding of the Internal Revenue Service headquarters building. The amendment also requires GSA and OPM to jointly find and operate a central telework Web site. 
   This bill will allow more Federal employees to telework but at the same time ensures that agencies have the necessary flexibility, guidance, and oversight. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of H.R. 4106. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 138, as amended, which expresses Congress's support of Men's Health Week, which is designed to raise awareness of men's health issues and the importance of preventative health care in order to improve the lifespan of American men. 
   H. Con. Res. 138, which was introduced by the gentleman from Maryland, Representative ELIJAH CUMMINGS, on May 1, 2007, was amended and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 15, 2008, before being passed by voice vote. The measure has the support and sponsorship of 59 Members of Congress, and expresses support for increased medical awareness that will  improve the health and well-being of American men. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all of the 10 leading causes of death among Americans, such as cancer and heart disease, affect our Nation's men at a higher rate than our women. On average, the male life expectancy in America is 6 years lower than the life expectancy of their female counterparts. A leading cause of this disparity is that men are 100 percent less likely to visit a doctor for screening and preventative medical checkups. This reluctance is tragic, as many life-threatening conditions are mitigated when found through early detection. 
   Congress recognized the need to encourage preventative medicine by increasing health awareness in American men when it established National Men's Health Week in 1994. Now, 14 years later, this commemorative week has helped to raise awareness and lower illness among American men. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this measure, as it will continue to encourage the men of our country to take a more active and preventative role in safeguarding their health, and, therefore, the health of America. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Minnesota has been and continues to be a leader in innovation in science and education. It is home of the Mayo Clinic, which is known for its cutting-edge medical work, and over 30 institutions of higher education, including the University of Minnesota, a world-class research university, which performed the first open heart surgery and the first bone marrow transplant in America. I should also mention that Minnesota is currently home to more than 35 Fortune 500 companies and is leading the Nation in the production and use of renewable energy.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration H. Res. 1114, which expresses the support of Congress for the environmental goals and ideals of Arbor Day and the work of the Arbor Day Foundation. 
   H. Res. 1114, which was introduced by my colleague, Representative Jeff Fortenberry, on April 16, 2008, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008 by voice vote. This measure has the support and sponsorship of 53 Members of Congress, and recognizes the importance of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation in preserving America's green spaces. 
   J. Sterling Morton, the father of Arbor Day, once observed that, ``The cultivation of trees is the cultivation of the good, the beautiful, and the ennobling in man.'' Established in 1872 as a tree planting holiday and celebration, Arbor Day has had a powerful and positive effect on America's landscape and ecosystem, and is now observed both nationally as well as in many foreign countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can't speak about National Arbor Day without mentioning the work of the National Arbor Day Foundation which was created with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. The Foundation has attracted almost 1 million members to become passionate about conservation and is worthy to be commemorated for their efforts to distribute 10 million plus trees annually for planting. And so I ask, Mr. Speaker, that we show our support of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation by agreeing to H. Res. 1114. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

 I think that I shall never see A poem so lovely as a tree. A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately sleeps with the rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CBC budget and feel extremely proud to do so. This budget raises revenue by rescinding the tax cuts for the top two income tax rates. It rescinds the capital gains and divided tax cuts, eliminates the phase out and repeal of PEP (personal exemption phase out) and PEASE, (which makes more wealthy income subject to taxation). It eliminates corporate tax incentives for offshoring jobs, closes corporate tax loopholes, abusive tax shelters and methods of tax avoidance and closes the tax gap. The CBC budget is balanced in FY12 and in fact creates a surplus of $141 billion dollars. 
   The CBC Budget provides adequate resources to deal with the shortage of nurses in this country by providing training resources, it protects Hospital Graduate Medical Education and increases funding for the National Family Caregivers Support Services Program by $8 million dollars. The CBC budget shifts some of the resource allocation from the military industrial complex, to domestic spending to deal more appropriately and realistically with domestic needs. It is a rational, logical common-sense budget which prioritizes peace and economic development rather than war and military action.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mrs. Tauscher). All time for debate on the amendment has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Kilpatrick). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 6842, the National Capital Security and Safety Act. 
   The bill before us this evening has been crafted with great care and with utmost concern for the safety and well-being of our Nation's capital--its residents, businesses, visitors, and the Federal Government. 
   I would like to recognize and thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) as well as Committee Chairman HENRY WAXMAN for their leadership in bringing today's bill to the floor and for not turning a blind eye to the concept of home rule and self-governance by attempting to rewrite the District's new gun laws since the Supreme Court's decision in the Heller case. 
   The measure has been considered and debated thoroughly by the oversight committee and was approved by a vote of 21-1, which demonstrates the bill's bipartisan support. 
   As chairman of the subcommittee with oversight authority over the District of Columbia, I am well aware of the long history behind the District's gun regulatory efforts as well as the city's continual efforts to protect its citizens against violence and crime. As chairman, I'm also well aware of the effect that the presence of the Federal Government places on the security concerns of the District. 
   H.R. 6842 seeks to highlight this issue by urging the District's city council to take into consideration such issues as homeland security, military functionality, threats of terrorism, and foreign dignitary protection as they continue to amend their laws to be in compliance with the Supreme Court's Heller decision. 
   The measure being considered today serves as a commonsense and practical approach to ensuring the requisite protection of our Nation's capital, while at the same time supporting the District in its efforts to reform its own gun laws versus rewriting the laws for them.     
   That is the job that the District's elected officials are tasked with, not Congress, and I am happy to see that this legislation recognizes that, especially since according to information from the District City Council, efforts are already underway to address several outstanding second amendment issues from the Supreme Court's Heller decision and expressed by Members of Congress in other pieces of legislation. The Council is revisiting the definition of ``machine guns'' and ``semiautomatics'' and making current gun storage requirements advisory versus mandatory. 
   In light of the city's efforts today, today's bill, H.R. 6842, represents both the least and the most we should be doing at this moment and at this level. The bill upon enactment gives the District 6 months to finalize its laws governing the possession and use of firearms as necessary to comply with the decision of the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. 
   As the city continues to perform its work to produce a permanent gun law reform package, I am sure that at some point in the future Congress, under its legislative review authority, will have the chance to revisit this issue under regular and proper protocol. But until then, let us continue promoting the importance of self-government and home rule for the District of Columbia and the importance of safety and security in our Nation's capital by supporting H.R. 6842. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Mr. Chairman, we've been debating tonight a gun issue. But it also is a home rule issue, an issue that simply says that the people of the District of Columbia should have the opportunity to make a decision about themselves. We're also debating a homeland security issue, a crime prevention issue, a safety issue. It's a foreign dignitary protection issue. But it's also a commonsense issue. 
   Common sense tells us that the more weapons you put on the street, the more likely you are to have disaster. And so H.R. 6842 represents and protects all of what we have discussed relative to the ability of the people of the District of Columbia to make their own decision.     
   I urge that we vote in favor of the Waxman-Norton bill and reject the Childers substitute. 
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from Mississippi. The amendment, which is largely taken from the base bill H.R. 6691, goes way beyond the ruling that's been handed down by the Supreme Court in the Heller case and, ironically, would lead to less security and safety and greater risk in the Nation's capital. 
   Moreover, in light of the ruling in the Heller case, the gentleman's amendment touches on more than just the issue of gun ownership in the home for purposes of self-defense. 
   The amendment would allow the unfettered transport of guns and/or firearms and the possession of guns in businesses, and as written, the amendment only says businesses and nothing about businesses in which property is owned. 
   And what is even more disturbing about the amendment is that it strips the District of Columbia from issuing or enacting any rule, law, or regulation dealing with homeownership. Nowhere in the case was such an order or action addressed or even mentioned in the Heller Supreme Court decision as written by Justice Scalia. In fact, it is my understanding that the decision clearly stated that a range of gun regulations  are presumptively lawful. However, the gentleman's amendment fails to take that part of the Court's ruling into consideration. 
   When the Court overturned the District's long-standing gun laws, in order not to infringe upon the second amendment rights of District residents, it set in motion a process that would require the District Government to rewrite the laws and not the United States Congress or the House of Representatives. This would be the case in Tupelo, Mississippi. Therefore, the elected officials of the District of Columbia should have an opportunity to develop permanent legislation to bring the city into compliance with the Heller ruling. 
   If I may, Mr. Chairman, let me point out just what the amendment before us does. For starters, it would eliminate any form of gun registration which would prevent the city's police department from knowing who owns what type of gun or firearm. 
   Secondly, the language is written so broadly that it would permit individuals to carry assault rifles openly in public and on D.C. streets. 
   Lastly, I'd also like to point out that the amendment creates a gun show loophole that will allow D.C. residents to avoid background checks when purchasing weapons from private individuals and at gun shows without background checks. 
   While Members from both sides of the aisle agree on the importance of preserving individual rights, we must also recognize that we live in perilous times, and with lone-wolf terrorists and copycat shootings on the rise, flat out ignoring the homeland security interests of the District of Columbia and the Federal Government is downright reckless and risky. 
   But yet, this is exactly what this amendment has the potential to do, if adopted. As stated earlier, the District has already begun to revamp its laws, and in the coming months, we will have an opportunity to review the newly adopted gun ownership laws under our already well-established congressional review authority. 
   I ask my colleagues to recognize and respect this fact and to join me in opposing this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Much of the discussion is about crime and crime prevention and protection. We sound as though people are invading people's homes and are murdering them and are attacking them. Much of the murder that I read about and that I hear about is really from drive-by shootings. It's really by individuals with semiautomatics who are engaged in turf battles over drugs, who are killing each other. They're not by people who are necessarily invading homes. They're by people who have access to these high-powered guns, people who are killing each other on the streets.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to certainly acknowledge the not only newness of the gentleman from Mississippi, but also his demeanor, his debate and his introduction of legislation. It occurred to me though if we were in West Point, Mississippi, or if we were in Fort Wayne, Indiana, or if we were in Western Pennsylvania telling the people in those communities what we thought they ought to be doing or the way in which we felt they had to be in compliance with the Supreme Court as they were wrestling with those decisions themselves, they probably would say that we were unwelcome. 
   I think that the people of the District of Columbia would say that this amendment is unwelcome, that it further takes away their right to self-governance. Here they are, they don't have a representative in Congress with a vote. Now we are saying that your City Council and your representatives on the City Council can't decide the way in which you would be in compliance with the highest court in our land. 
   Let me just mention that a previous speaker said that the District passed a law prohibiting District residents from bringing in weapons from across State lines. That was incorrect. In fact, Congress passed this law, not the District of Columbia. But this amendment would remove this restriction. 
   So I think Members should understand that this is the first step in the NRA's plan to repeal Federal gun control laws, not just in the District of Columbia. But I think it is a matter of using the District of Columbia to work one's will for other parts of the country and to work a national will using the people of the District of Columbia. 
   I think the protections that are needed and the compliance that is needed can be found in the Waxman-Norton bill, and that this amendment, the Childers amendment, unfortunately strips that bill of its impact. For that reason, I would urge that we reject the Childers amendment vote for the Norton-Waxman bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Heller, in a manner that protects the security interests of the Federal government and the people who work in, reside in, or visit the District of Columbia and does not undermine the efforts of law enforcement, homeland security, and military officials to protect the Nation's capital from crime and terrorism, had come to no resolution thereon.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the truth is that from 2001 to 2007, Republicans controlled all levels of power here in Washington. It was their opportunity to put the conservative economic ideas that they have been talking about for decades into law, and they did it. 
   Today we see the effect of these policies. Middle-class families are being squeezed by wages that have actually fallen by $300 since President Bush took office, 3.4 million more Americans are unemployed, 5.7 million more Americans are living in poverty. 
   Foreclosure rates have hit a record high with 2.5 million families expected to lose their homes this year. The dollar remains weak because President Bush continues to borrow record amounts of money from other countries. 
   This is the economy Washington Republicans created with policies towards the needs of the wealthiest few over those of hard-working, middle-class Americans. Now Senator McCain vows to continue those same economic policies if he wins the Presidency. 
   That does not sound like change to me.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding. 
   I've listened rather intently all afternoon to the gentleman from Texas and his amendments. I've tried to find some logic. I've tried to find some validity. I've tried to find some argument. And, you know, for the sake of me, I have not been able to find any. 
   You can talk to any educators in America, and they will talk about the great need that exists for science teachers. You can talk to any medical schools, anybody really interested in health care, and they will talk about the need for scientists. You can talk to researchers. You can talk to people who try and keep us competitive with other nations, and they will talk about the great need that exists. You can talk to school districts who are importing science teachers from other countries because we don't have an adequate supply here in the United States of America. 
   Then I hear the gentleman say, let's not fund these institutions. Let's not give the Roosevelt University, named for one of our great Presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which provides opportunities for young people who would never, ever get the chance to go to college, to learn science. 
   Well, I can tell you that I still have not been able to find the logic of the gentleman's argument, other than to say let's not have earmarks. I'm sure that Jarvis Christian could use whatever resources that it could get, and of course it would have them if its Representative had requested and tried to get what they need. 
   So I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment, urge that it be voted down, down, down, as far down as it can get, and that we provide the opportunity for young people in America to fulfill the dream of a college education, a chance to earn a living, raise their families, make America the Nation that it has not been.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the $700,000 from the Department of Energy--Science account for biology laboratory equipment for Roosevelt University in Chicago, IL. Roosevelt University seeks equipment assistance for its biology laboratory which supports student and faculty work in cell and molecular biology. These subjects are integral to majors in the sciences, pre-health career programs, and science education. This request would equip 2 laboratories, creating 48 state-of-the-art workstations and provide equipment for institutions advancing science and science education. The total cost of the project is  $6,000,000. Roosevelt University has partnered with the State of Illinois and local university funds are available for this project. This laboratory also supports the summer career pathways biotechnology program with Chicago Public Schools.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by expressing condolences to all of those who were directly affected by the gun violence that has just taken the lives of so many young people with so much promise. Again, I think it is an indication of a tremendous need to better regulate the acquisition and ownership of guns in our country, and I join with all of those who call for increased regulation. 
   Mr. Speaker, America's radios, televisions, newspapers, and Internet sites  have been consumed for the past several days over remarks by radio personality Don Imus. 
   Two weeks ago Imus referred to the women of the Rutgers University women's basketball team in language which can only be described as racist, sexist, and viciously offensive. Faced with an uproar of disgust and protest in response to those remarks, Imus apologized on one hand and on the other denied any racism and insisted that his words carried no malice. 
   Imus has a history of similar remarks and demands for him to be fired escalated by the hour and day. Under pressure from the public and advertisers, MSNBC agreed to drop the Imus show, and then, of course, CBS came to the same decision. I commend them for coming to the realization that this kind of rhetoric has no place on the public airways. I hope this outcome will be viewed as a victory for free speech and corporate responsibility. 
   I consider myself an apostle of the first amendment. Free speech is fundamental to our very notions of what and who we are as a people and as a Nation. Nevertheless, I believe that the outcry and protest over the Imus remarks and the demands for his dismissal are not only justified, but are totally consistent with the first amendment. 
   Nothing has eaten away at the soul of America, nothing has divided our Nation, and nothing has more persistently infected our democracy than the monstrous evil of racism. 
   Racism dehumanized and continues to dehumanize African Americans and others. Racism continues to ravage the lives of Black America from health to housing and from income to imprisonment. It has taken almost 150 years of struggle and sacrifice, but we no longer accept the racist practices and we no longer excuse racist speech. 
   No one is demanding that the government muzzle Mr. Imus. However, it is logical and just that large, extremely profitable media companies whose existence and whose profits are based on freedom of speech, would want to ensure that they are not profiting from the abuse of African American women, from the poisoning of relations between Americans, or from discrimination or oppression of any sector of our society. 
   Last week it was an outcry against Mr. Imus for his remarks. Today and tomorrow it must be against the rappers, hip-hop artists, and comedians who use vile language as a part of their public acts. 
   My mother used to take washing powder or soap and wash out our mouths if we were to use language that was unacceptable to her. Now, I know that we can't do this with some of our entertainers, but we certainly can sanitize and let them know that we are not appreciative of their language. 
   I join with those who commend the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, for her leadership. And I also commend Reverend Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al Sharpton for the tremendous roles that they played in raising this issue.

College basketball fans and players were treated to an exciting national championship game, with victory coming to the Jayhawks after an amazing effort which pushed the game into overtime. 
   I want to extend congratulations to Head Coach Bill Self, Athletic Director Lew Perkins, University of Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemingway, and Kansas' student athletes on an excellent season. While securing their first national title in 20 years, the Jayhawks also won the Big 12 Conference championship title. The Jayhawks also set a school record for all-time season wins with a 37-3 record. 
   I also wish to extend congratulations to the University of Memphis Tigers and their student athletes for a great season. The Tigers' loss in the finals was only their second loss of the season. Memphis also won Conference USA with a perfect 16-0 record. 
   Winning the 2008 national championship has brought national attention and acclaim to the University of Kansas' outstanding basketball program. I know that the fans of this university will remember this very special moment for many years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I want to again join with all of the residents of Kansas and also indicate that they have a tremendous recruitment program because Mario Chalmers, the young fellow that people have been talking about as the outstanding player, grew up in my neighborhood, in my community, went to Crane High School. It just happened that I talked to the principal of that school this morning about something else, and I didn't know that I would get an opportunity to congratulate them on the floor this afternoon.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS HIGHLIGHTED THROUGH NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the designation of April 27 to May 3, 2008, as National Volunteer Week, and to laud the efforts of volunteers who serve without reward to support America's communities. 
   National Volunteer Week is an opportunity to engage individuals throughout the Nation in a common goal of service to better our Nation. This year's theme, Volunteer to Change the World, hopes to inspire all people to connect with their community and truly make a difference through working together to effect positive change. In addition to many volunteer opportunities, the week will recognize deserving volunteers with the President's Volunteer Service Award and other significant signs of thanks. 
   Next week, volunteers across the Nation will work on a wide variety of projects. Activities range from community arts projects, school renovations, park rehabilitation, and many more equally engaging projects. With a large force of volunteers working together, National Volunteer Week will demonstrate the power of volunteerism and highlight the strength of compassion. The large number of volunteers will continue to inspire the Nation to mobilize for positive change and help people discover their ability to make a difference. 
   Volunteering has far reaching positive impacts on the community as a whole, and even on individual volunteers themselves. Research has shown that communities with high levels of social capital have a higher quality of life. Communities with strong volunteer networks, therefore, are healthy and dynamic places to live and work. Additionally, data shows that individuals who volunteer live longer than those who do not. Individuals and communities reap numerous constructive benefits from volunteering and can be the center of positive social change. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, once again I express my support for National Volunteer Week, and recognize all the hard work that volunteers put in on a daily basis. I encourage more people to become volunteers and recognize the fact that, by working together, we can more effectively meet the challenges our Nation face. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1149, commemorating April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month. 
   According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, tens of thousands of Americans nationwide are afflicted with this disease. However, currently, there is no cure, no definitive identification of exactly what causes sarcoidosis, no known measures to prevent it, and many people who have sarcoidosis do not exhibit any symptoms. So one might ask the question, what is sarcoidosis? 
   Sarcoidosis is characterized by the inflammation associated with the production of tiny lumps of cells in various organs of our bodies called granulomas because they look like grains of sugar or sand. These grain-like cells grow and clump together in an organ, affecting how the organ works.     
   The increase of these growths can inflame vital organs like the lung, brain, skin, eyes and nervous system, causing seizures, blindness, disfiguring lesions, heart failure and sometimes even death. 
   Sarcoidosis is overrepresented among African Americans compared to other races and ethnic groups, and afflicts African Americans more severely than other races in this country. 
   By documenting the prevalence of sarcoidosis among fluorescent light bulb workers in the 1940s and among U.S. Navy deck grinders, and recognizing that sarcoidosis disproportionately affects factory workers and was the first diagnosis for an overwhelming majority of rescue workers in New York after the September 11, 2001, attacks, researchers at the American Lung Association have uncovered a link between certain types of occupations and this disease. 
   More careful monitoring of a sarcoidosis diagnosis can dramatically improve public health, including the health of civilian and military workers. It is my hope that by passing this legislation, we will promote more careful examination and investigation of sarcoidosis diagnosis, and lead to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of workers, as well as reduce costs. 
   By supporting House Resolution 1149 designating April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month, we as the House of Representatives of these United States of America will demonstrate our acknowledgment of and commitment to the importance of raising awareness for the purpose of uncovering the causes of sarcoidosis disease, environmental and otherwise, and the promotion of strategies to support and protect our thriving workforce. I urge passage of this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Representative Johnson from Texas for introducing this resolution, and I am pleased to join with her and with Representative Platts in supporting its passage. I rise in support of the mission and goals of Workers Memorial Day.     
   Workers Memorial Day allows us to honor and remember the many workers who have been injured or even killed in the workplace. Unfortunately, while the United States loses about 5,500 workers each year, more than 2 million people die worldwide from workplace-related accidents and disease. 
   According to the National Safety Council and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job fatality rate has been cut by 78 percent since 1970. While direct comparisons of injury data for 2006 and years prior to 2003 are not possible due to a change in classification systems, in general, declines in workplace fatalities and injuries have been much greater in those industries where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has targeted its standards and enforcement activities. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which encourages OSHA industries, employers and employees, to support activities that increase awareness of the importance of preventing illness, injury and death in the workplace. 
   I would also like to thank all those who took the time on Monday to remember those Americans who were injured, or those who have lost their lives due to a workplace accident. 
   And so, again, Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Johnson from Texas for introducing this timely and important resolution. 
   I also thank Mr. Platts, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for his support. But I also thank him for the opportunity to work with him this afternoon. It's been a pleasure, as it always is. He is one of the most pleasant Members of this House, and it's always a pleasure to interact and work with him. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Representative Loebsack from Iowa, and the entire Iowa delegation, as well as all of the Members of the House in congratulating the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team for their victory in the 2008 NCAA Division I national wrestling championship.  
   On March 22, college wrestling fans were treated to an exceptional wrestling match as the top-ranked University of Iowa won its 21st national team title and crowned two individual national champions, Mark Perry and Brent Metcalf. Three of the Hawkeyes' seven All-Americans competed in the finals in St. Louis for a combined team score of 117.5 points. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to coach Tom Brands, who returned to his alma mater and led the team to a perfect 8-0 conference record in his second season as head coach. Impressive feats such as these are why Coach Brands was named Coach of the Year by both the Big Ten Conference and the National Wrestling Coaches Association. 
   Congratulations also are in order for senior Mark Perry, who overcame a knee injury to win his second national title. He is only the 14th University of Iowa wrestler to earn two national titles. Additionally, Perry rounded out his final year with his fourth All-American honor. 
   The other individual national title winner was sophomore Brent Metcalf. Metcalf ended the season on an impressive 23-match winning streak and earned many accolades, including the Dan Hodge Trophy, Big Ten Wrestler of the Year, and Outstanding Wrestler at both the NCAA and Big Ten championships. 
   The University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling program began in 1911 and has produced a rich history of champions. With 32 Big Ten conference championships and 21 NCAA Division I national championships, the Hawkeyes wrestling team is a premier program. The extraordinary achievement of this season is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many wrestlers, coaches, students, alumni, families, and fans that have helped to make the University of Iowa a wrestling powerhouse. 
   Winning the national championship, finishing the season with a 21-1 overall dual record, and winning the Big Ten conference championship for the 32nd time has brought national acclaim to the University of Iowa. I know the fans of the university will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to the 2009 season. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate the University of Iowa for their tremendous success.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important contributions that teachers make to our Nation. Next week is National Teacher Appreciation Week. The National PTA created Teacher Appreciation Week in 1984 to show gratitude to the many teachers in the United States. It is a chance for us to thank those individuals who have contributed greatly to society in ways that cannot be measured. It is a chance for us to recognize the selflessness and dedication of teachers and to show our respect for the teaching profession. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know that good teachers make a tremendous difference to our Nation's youth. During the last decade, a body of evidence has grown to support the notion that teacher quality is the single most important factor outside of the home in affecting student achievement. Teachers serve as excellent role models and instill a love for knowledge and lifelong learning in our students. 
   We know that teaching is an important profession that deserves our support and respect. Teachers have the important job of helping to shape tomorrow's leaders. Those in the teaching profession work tirelessly for little reward, and good teachers constantly reflect on their lessons and modify instruction to reach the diverse needs of the students in their classrooms. Quality teachers hone their skills and are experts not only in the subject matter, but also in connecting with young people and making learning come alive. 
   Unfortunately, research has also shown us the negative impacts of teacher shortages. It is important and imperative that schools and communities support teachers. National Teacher Appreciation Week is an opportunity for all of us to pursue and recognize the selfless dedication of our educators. It is also an opportunity for us to recognize the importance of education and make absolutely certain that every child in America has the greatest opportunity to achieve this commodity that we call education. So we have to search our budgets, stretch our imagination and find the resources that are necessary to attract the best and the brightest individuals into the teaching profession. 
   Yes, there is no greater profession in our country than that of teaching. I call teachers the salt of the Earth, the pillars of the universe, those individuals who give of themselves each and every day so that others will have the opportunity to connect with this vast reservoir of knowledge that we have to be spread around. 
   I am indeed pleased, Mr. Speaker, to join with all of those who urge passage of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in closing I want to thank Representative Platts and Representative Poe for their comments relative to this resolution, and certainly join with them in expressing again tremendous appreciation for all of those in the teaching profession. 
   As I listened to them, I couldn't help but be reminded of important teachers during my life. I began school in a one-room school, as a matter of fact, in your home State of Arkansas, where one woman, Ms. Beadie King, taught eight grades plus the little primer and the big primer all by herself. But then I was fortunate because, later on, she was the high school English teacher. And there are individuals who would suggest that I sometimes use poems and poetry and pithy words in expression, and practically all of that really came from Ms. Beadie King. She was unbelievable. As a matter of fact, she walked at least seven, eight miles to school every day to teach. 
   There are a lot of teachers who give that kind of dedication today. They don't necessarily walk 7, 8 miles, but they go into their pockets and buy materials; they purchase clothing for their students when they don't have the appropriate things to wear; they purchase lunch for students; buy materials for their classes. They give the very best of everything that it is that they have. 
   I don't think that we can ever express--I use the opportunity to express appreciation to my wife who taught for more than 30 years, members of my family, my sister who just retired as a principal, my sister-in-law who just retired. And so there are many teachers that all of us stand on their shoulders. Like you, Representative Platts, I know that had not it been for those individuals that I came into contact with growing up, there is no way that I would be standing here this evening expressing myself as a Member of the greatest body that exists in the world, the United States House of Representatives. 
   Again, I thank all of the teachers in America and urge passage of this resolution.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank and commend Representative Woolsey for her introduction of this legislation. I also want to thank the 200 women who attended a town hall meeting which I held in my district on Sunday in recognition of Women's History Month. I want to thank Reverend Helen Cooper, Pastor of the Westside Center of Truth Church for being the host. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 1021, as amended, which is designed to provide recognition and support for National Women's History Month, which just ended yesterday with the conclusion of the month of March. 
   H. Res. 1021 was first introduced by Representative LYNN WOOLSEY of California on March 3, 2008, and has the support and cosponsorship of 80-plus Members of Congress, both men and women from both sides of the aisle. The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote after being amended for technical purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I guess it's only accurate to say that history, whether American or International, would not have been written as it is without the role of women. But all too often the vast significance of women throughout history goes unnoticed and under appreciated, which is why organizers in Sonoma County, California, established back in 1978 a public celebration of women's history, calling it Women's History Week. In 1987, Congress expanded the celebration to a month, and March was declared Women's History Month. 
   Since the 1970s, we in America have seen notable growth in the study and expansion of women's history. In fact, today almost every college offers women's history courses and most major graduate programs offer doctoral degrees in this important field. 
   Even today, we continue to witness history makers. From our very own Speaker of the House, to top Presidential contenders, business women, scientists and athletes, women are clearly making key contributions to our communities, our country, and our world. As we celebrate female artists and their contributions to our cultural heritage as this year's theme of National Women's History Month, let us as a body once again elevate and support the goals, ideas and history of Women's History Month and pass the measure at hand.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentlewoman from the Sunshine State of Florida, in consideration of H.R. 5168, which names the postal facility in Brooksville, Florida, after a fallen hero, Army Specialist Cody Grater. 
   Introduced on January 29, 2008, H.R. 5168 is offered by Congresswoman  Ginny Brown-Waite, Representative of Florida's Fifth Congressional District, and is cosponsored by the State's entire congressional delegation. Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite's measure, H.R. 5168, was reported from the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, by voice vote. 
   This morning's postal naming bill honoring Specialist Grater brings to life the tragic yet heroic story of another American soldier who gave his life in service to this great country of ours. 
   A native of Spring Hill, Florida, Specialist Cody Grater was tragically killed on July 29, 2007, when his guard position was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade near Baghdad in Iraq. Specialist Grater was only 20 years old when he lost his life in the line of duty as a member of the 407th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
   The son of Anita Lewis and Larry Decker, Cody Grater joined the Army in April of 2006, and for his service, although short-lived, he has been awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. It is reported that during his burial service at Florida National Cemetery in Bushnell, Florida, the streets were lined for miles with well-wishers and people waving flags, saluting and crying in tribute to a true American hero. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us also join that host of well-wishers, loved ones and friends of Specialist Cody Grater and pass H.R. 5168, designating the Cortez Boulevard Post Office Building in Brooksville, Florida, in his honor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 310, which seeks to honor the life of Harriet Tubman and acknowledge the many sacrifices she made on behalf of freedom and the inalienable rights of all men and women. 
   She was a steadfast warrior for the values which we cherish today: freedom, justice, and equality for all. Without her, these values would not have been enjoyed by the dozens of African Americans that she rescued from slavery, in addition to many more that she helped by her unwavering commitment to emancipation.     
   H. Con. Res. 310 was introduced by Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland on March 5, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, by voice vote. 
   The measure has the support of over 60 Members of Congress and provides our body a collective opportunity to recognize and pay tribute to a woman who dedicated her life to ensuring equality and freedom, which stand at the foundation of our country, were afforded to all of its citizens, including those enslaved in the South. 
   Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in 1820 to Harriet ``Rit'' Green and Ben Ross, a slave couple from Dorchester County, Maryland. From an early age, it was evident that Harriet Tubman was willing to put her life on the line to assist African Americans in escaping that peculiar institution we know as slavery. At 12 years old, she suffered a traumatic blow to the head from her overseer when she refused to help restrain a slave who was escaping. Due to the head injury she sustained, Harriet was plagued for the rest of her life with violent seizures and spells of unconsciousness. 
   Yet despite these ailments, Harriet Tubman continued to press on. In 1849 Harriet Tubman managed to escape from the plantation she worked on, located in the eastern part of Maryland. On her first trip up north, Tubman made great use out of the Underground Railroad and crossed over 90 miles to reach her final destination of Pennsylvania. Because of the dangers that lined every step of her journey, she had to travel at night, using the North Star for guidance. When she reached Philadelphia, she recalled that it felt like she was in heaven. Yet the memory of her family still in bondage caused Harriet to leave ``heaven'' and voluntarily return to the land of her enslavement. After the decision to save her family, she spent the majority of her life bringing individuals out of slavery by way of the Underground Railroad. In fact, Tubman became known as Moses because of her relentless efforts to aid more and more African American slaves out of captivity. 
   For 11 years Harriet Tubman risked her life to free over 70 slaves and their families. She also served as a Union spy during the Civil War and assisted abolitionist John Brown in recruiting men for the raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859. In the post-war era, Tubman devoted her efforts towards the women's suffrage movement up until her death in 1913. In a letter to honor her memory, Frederick Douglass wrote: ``Excepting John Brown, of sacred memory, I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than she has.'' 
   Madam Speaker, let us honor this true patriot for the courage and tenacity that she has shown in the face of great danger and great adversity. Harriet Tubman deserves our utmost respect and gratitude for her unconquerable valor, her harrowing dedication, and her unshakable faith all in the name of freedom. Therefore, I urge swift passage of H. Con. Res. 310. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleague, Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON from our Nation's Capital, the District of Columbia, in consideration of H.R. 5551, which will provide for a much-needed increase in the compensation paid to attorneys assigned to represent indigent clients in the D.C. court system. 
   Congresswoman Norton and I introduced this measure on March 6, 2008. On March 11, 2008, the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia held a hearing to examine aspects of the legislation, and on March 13, 2008, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform considered and passed the bill out of committee by voice vote. 
   H.R. 5551 calls for an increase in the hourly pay rate from $65 to $80 for Criminal Adjusters Act, CJA attorneys, representing indigent defendants in the D.C. courts. The measure would also increase the caps on the total compensation paid to these attorneys per case type to be equal to the total compensation paid to attorneys representing similar clients in Federal Court.     
   The increased compensation rate for CJA attorneys practicing in D.C. courts would only apply to cases that proceeded or initiated on or after the date of enactment of the Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, a core element of our unique democracy is the right and requirement that every citizen, regardless of income or socioeconomic class, be afforded adequate counsel or representation when confronting judicial proceedings. In fact, one of the most important decisions in this area of law was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1942, when it held that the Sixth Amendment required the government afford indigent defendants with competent counsel. The measure we have before us further reiterates this fundamental concept by helping to ensure that the D.C. court system is in a competitive position to attract the best and brightest lawyers to represent the indigent. And so, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5551. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Representative Scott from Georgia for yielding time, and I also want to commend the sponsor of this legislation  and recognize his tremendous leadership in the struggle for human rights since his teen years when he was a mere lad. We heard him mention the age of 15, and that's about the time that he became actively engaged and involved in the struggle for human rights. 
   This legislation highlights the Voting Rights Act of 1964, which even though all people in our country supposedly had the right to vote prior to that time, it provided the kind of protections that were necessary to make sure that those rights were not taken away, that those rights were not denied. 
   I also want to commend Representative Lewis for his creative way of helping to raise money for the United Negro College Fund. I've been getting phone calls from my brother all week, and I know why he's calling me, because every year he and a friend of his, Jackis Casson, put on an event to raise money for the United Negro College Fund. And so he's been calling to solicit me to buy my tickets, and so the more money that we can generate through this legislation, the less money I might have to give.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 1005, as amended, which expresses support for greater recognition of the goals and ideals of Borderline Personality Awareness Month. 
   H. Res. 1005 was introduced by Representative TOM DAVIS of Virginia, a longstanding member and leader on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on February 27, 2008, and has the support and cosponsorship of over 50 Members of Congress. The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote at that time after being amended for technical purposes. 
   Madam Speaker, while many people may not be aware of borderline personality disorder, it is a mental illness that is more common than bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and has been found to affect a little over 2 percent of adults, particularly young women. 
   BPD, as it is commonly referred to as, is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior. The instability caused by this illness often leads to disruptions in one's family and work life, long-term planning, and ultimately a person's sense of self-identity. 
   Each and every one of us has a personality; however, for those individuals who suffer from personality traits that are inflexible, maladaptive, or psychologically disruptive, more research and awareness on borderline personality disorder is an absolute must. And that is why I rise in support of H. Res. 1005. Passage of this measure will help to raise the profile and the general public's understanding of borderline personality disorder and the corresponding BPD month of awareness. 
   I commend Representative Davis from Virginia for introducing this legislation and urge its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (PRESERVING EXISTING JUDGESHIPS ON THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 550, which reserves existing judgeships on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia by increasing the cap on the number of judges that can serve on the court. Senate Bill 550 would increase the number of associate judges permitted to serve on the D.C. Superior Court from 58 to 61. 
   In accordance with the terms of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Act of 1997, Congress now wields legislative and funding authority over the District of Columbia court system. Under the terms of this arrangement, section 11-903 of the District of Columbia Official Code established an overall limit of 58 on the number of judges that may be seated on the Superior Court. The current limit of 58 is in addition to a chief judge. 
   However, in 2001, Congress passed the D.C. Family Court Act, and included in the Act a new provision that allowed the previously established limit on the number of judges to be exceeded only to appoint additional family court judges. As a result of this provision, the current number of associate superior court judges, combined with the 15 judges now seated on the D.C. Family Court, the cap of 58 has now been exceeded. This means that judgeship vacancies in the superior court cannot be filled unless additional retirements occur, which has led to delays in judicial proceedings, increased costs from prolonged litigation, and case backlogs. S. 550 would address these issues by increasing the number of associate judges from 58 to 61.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from Georgia, in the consideration of H.R. 3936, which names a postal facility in Cleveland, Georgia, after a fallen hero, Sergeant Jason Harkins. 
   Introduced on October 23, 2007, H.R. 3936 is sponsored by Congressman Nathan Deal, the Representative from Georgia's Ninth Congressional District and cosponsored by the entire Georgia delegation. Mr. Deal's measure, H.R. 3936, was reported from the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by voice vote. 
   This morning's postal-naming bill honoring Sergeant Jason Harkins brings to light the special story of a staunch soldier who, along with five of his comrades from the Army's 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division out of Fort Lewis, Washington, were tragically killed while serving our country nobly in the Baqubah region of Iraq. Sadly, none of the six soldiers killed in one of the deadliest attacks on the Fort Lewis unit lived to see his 30th birthday. Yet, as soldiers, Sergeant Jason Harkins and his fellow servicemen, all of whom had entered active duty service within only the past 6 years, bravely placed their lives on the front line in allegiance and service to this great country of ours. 
   At the heart of this story is the subject of H.R. 3936, Sergeant Jason R. Harkins. Sergeant Harkins was only 25 years old and serving his second tour of duty in Iraq when he succumbed to wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device that detonated near his vehicle during combat operations. 
   A native of the northern Georgia town of Clarksville, Sergeant Harkins attended and graduated from the State's public school system before enlisting in the Army Reserve in 1999 and later volunteering for active duty service in December of 2002. 
   Described as a true God-fearing country boy, Sergeant Harkins proudly served over 3 years in the U.S. Army Reserves and is a recipient of the Bronze Star of Valor and the Purple Heart. 
   In addition to these honors, Mr. Speaker, let us also pay tribute to the life of Sergeant Harkins and pass H.R. 3936 and designate the Helen Highway Post Office Building in Cleveland, Georgia, in his honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3803, which names a postal facility in Goldsboro, North Carolina, after John Henry Wooten, Sr. 
   H.R. 3803, which was introduced by Representative G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina on October 10, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12, 2007, by a voice vote.     
   This measure has the support of the entire North Carolina congressional delegation. A native of Goldsboro, North Carolina, John Henry Wooten, Sr. was a graduate of the city's Dillard High School where he would later serve as the last principal of the school before it closed after integration. Mr. Wooten's postsecondary educational pursuits took him to North Carolina A&T State University where he earned both his undergraduate and graduate degrees. 
   Beyond his educational accomplishments, Mr. Wooten also was a World War II veteran having served as surgical technician in the Pacific theater for the 2nd Infantry, 10th Army Division. A loyal servant to his community, Mr. Wooten held seats on the Board of Trustees of North Carolina A&T University, Wayne County Board of County Commissioners, and on President Lyndon B. Johnson's White House Commission for Education. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the years in which Mr. Wooten gave unselfishly of himself for the betterment of his community and our country, I wholeheartedly agree that he is worthy of the admiration and recognition of having the postal facility on Cashwell Drive in Goldsboro, North Carolina, named in his honor. Therefore, I would urge swift passage of this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join Representative John Yarmuth and his fellow colleagues from the Bluegrass State of Kentucky in considering H.R. 4454, which renames the postal facility at 3050 Hunsinger Lane in Louisville, Kentucky, as the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office Building. 
   As stated in the measure at hand, it was first introduced by Congressman John Yarmuth on December 11, 2007, and is cosponsored by all members of the Kentucky congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it was considered and passed by voice vote on January 29, 2008. 
   H.R. 4454 is intended to remember the lives, service, and legacy of dozens of military men and women from the Louisville, Kentucky, area, who died in service during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. By renaming this particular Louisville, Kentucky, post office, H.R. 4454 would set into motion the creation of a living tribute to the sacrifices made by so many of Kentucky's sons and daughters who gave their lives abroad in order to ensure our protection here in the homeland, an honor befitting the thousands of military men and women, past and present, from every State of the Union, that have unselfishly given themselves in service and battle for America. 
   H.R. 4454 will help to memorialize for generations to come the memory of Louisville, Kentucky's fallen loved ones. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we too pay tribute to the sacrifices made by these great American heroes and sheroes and pass H.R. 4454.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this investment in America. In spite of what we have heard from the other side about a spending plan, what we are really looking at is an investment in education, for those individuals who, without it, would never have an opportunity to experience a college education. 
   I have heard some things that I thought were unimaginable this afternoon. Eighty percent of the students in my district who attend the University of Illinois rely upon financial aid. 
   This legislation provides money for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are falling apart, many of them, at the seams, Hispanic-serving institutions. Individuals who would never, ever get an opportunity to go to college and experience higher education will do so as a result of this legislation, this investment in America. I thank the chairman for a great bill, and I urge its passage.  
   First let me express my sincere appreciation to Chairman Miller, and Subcommittee Chairman Hinojosa for their efforts in introducing this landmark legislation to Congress. In my tenure as a Congressional representative for the citizens of the 7th District of Illinois, this is one of, if not the most critical national policy initiative for which I have been able to advocate. Why? Because in my district for example, approximately 80 percent of the students attending the University of Illinois rely on financial aid programs to support their education, and this bill provides the single largest increase in college aid to students across the country since the GI Bill. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act increases the maximum Pell Grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next 5 years, and I am pleased that an amendment which I cosponsored added $900,000,000 to the pool; invests in Upward Bound, a proven effective program that empowers students with the resources they need to help them succeed as they pursue higher education; and invests substantial appropriations in historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled, Native and predominately black institutions and American and Asian American Pacific institutions. 
   Detractors will try to paint this as another spending boondoggle by the Democrats, but this bill benefits students and families at no new cost to taxpayers by cutting excess subsidies the Federal government pays to lenders in the student loan industry. 
   Some may ask why we didn't just focus on Pell Grants, but the fact remains that families who don't qualify for Pell Grants still need assistance paying for college costs, and that approximately 50 percent of students who do qualify for Pell Grants borrow money to pay for college costs. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 is the national policy initiative which demonstrates that America recognizes its responsibility to provide an educational environment that inspires and supports the pursuit of academic excellence.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (CELEBRATING THE 500TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST USE OF THE NAME ``AMERICA'' -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 500th anniversary of the first use of the name America, to describe areas in the Western Hemisphere. These areas are named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian Explorer on a quest to find new lands. He is one of many from that era who craved the exploration of new worlds and ideas. Although Vespucci's intention was to conquer land for Italy, he ultimately helped to create a place that today is one of the most diverse places on earth. Vespucci took a bold step, defying previous thinking that the land we live on was part of India. 
   Today we recognize the anniversary of Amerigo's discovery as a reminder of how important it is to challenge preconceived notions, and how critical it is that we keep exploring new ideas and sciences. 
   We are a people who live and breathe discovery. Our history holds many examples of our desire to explore. This country has gone to the Moon and intertwined computers into our everyday lives. We have created vaccines to help eradicate polio and other life threatening diseases. We use our ambition to explore, and as a means to be competitive in the world we live in. 
   Today we must continue to honor our historical drive for exploration. Unlike Vespucci's quest which was to only benefit a small subset of people, today we must give anyone the opportunity to be involved with the exploration and to partake in the benefits of our successes. Only about 6 percent of practicing physicians are Latino, African American and Native American today, and according to an analysis by the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology, the percentage of African Americans receiving bachelor's degrees in engineering is only 4.7 percent of all engineering graduates. Minorities and women are often left out of these fields. There is no reason for these discriminations. We should push all young people to discover science and mathematics and to understand there are jobs that interact with those fields. We especially need to push minorities and women who have not gotten those opportunities to achieve in those fields. 
   We have made progress since the last election in helping every young person to become involved with math and science. The house recently passed The 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007, which establishes, revises, and extends specified science, mathematics, education, engineering, technology, research, and training programs, however; we need to keep improving math and science education for young people. We should increase computer interaction in poverty stricken areas and increase young minority student's interactions with math and science at a younger age. 
   In the celebration of America and Amerigo Vespucci, let us pledge to continue our quest for exploration and discovery. Let us continue to take bold steps as he once did to move in a direction where we can use new technology and discoveries to improve the lives of millions not just those in positions of power, but for even the most underprivileged in our society. 
   Mrs,. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 287 which honors the 500th Anniversary of the name ``America.'' 
   The story of the origin of our country's name is one of great discovery and dedication that embodies our national spirit. 
   On April 25, 1507 cartographer Martin Waldseemu 4ller of the research group Gymnasium Vosagense in Saint-Die, France changed the way Europeans perceived the world by first depicting the Western Hemisphere in his 1507 World Map. He labeled the land ``America,'' marking the first official use of the word. The only remaining copy of this map is housed next door in the Library of Congress. 
   Waldseemu 4ller named the land after Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci. Although explorers like Christopher Columbus already discovered what we now know to be the Western Hemisphere, Vespucci was the first to realize that it was not India but an entirely new continent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the name ``America.'' Truly encompassing the American spirit, this name was derived from those challenging the status quo to improve our world and persevering in the face of doubt. Today we are not only honoring the name America but all Americans who have the great privilege of sharing this name and all it embodies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding, and although I'm from Illinois, it's via Arkansas, and so I'm pleased to be here this evening to join with my colleagues to recognize the tremendous accomplishments achieved and, even more importantly, the tremendous legacy created by the University of Central Arkansas. Founded as a Normal School in 1907, it has since fervently and continuously striven towards greatness. 
   The University of Central Arkansas is a place where knowledge is not just about completing assignments or attending classes but, rather, a place where knowledge comes to light. With a tradition of exceptional administration, faculty and students, Central Arkansas manages to simultaneously create the nurturing environment for its over 10,000 students, all the while challenging them to achieve and maintain excellence. 
   The University of Central Arkansas enrolls students from every county in Arkansas, from 35 States and from 55 foreign countries. With a current enrollment that exceeds 12,000 students, the University of Central Arkansas has conferred over 52,000 degrees in its 100 years. 
   My colleague from Arkansas, Representative Snyder, mentioned many of the accomplished individuals who have attended and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas, and the one that I happen to know best is Scotty Pippin, who grew up 12 miles from where I grew up, and where, at the time that I was growing up, there wasn't a high school for Scotty Pippin in his small town of Hamburg, Arkansas. But Scotty was able to go to the University of Central Arkansas, distinguish himself as an outstanding athlete, and then, like many others, made their way from the Arkansas delta, and places similar to it, to Chicago, where he helped to make the Chicago Bulls a namesake, not only throughout America but throughout the world. 
   The thing about Central Arkansas that many people don't know is that it has a strong program of recruiting and helping to nurture minority students and to try and make absolutely certain that they achieve and excel. And so it is for this reason that I'm pleased to commend my colleague, Representative Snyder, for introducing this resolution, commend the University of Central Arkansas, and like Vic, I would hope that they have another 100 years of great achievement and accomplishment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to address the House. 
   I want to, first of all, thank Speaker Pelosi for granting to the Congressional Black Caucus this time on this evening. 
   I also want to thank our chairperson, Representative Carolyn Kilpatrick, for deciding that each Monday members of the Congressional Black Caucus will come to the floor with a message to address issues, issues that affect not only African Americans, but issues which are pertinent to the quality of life in these United States of America. 
   This evening we have chosen to take a look at something called Second Chance, and that is we've chosen to take a look at how do we help successfully reintegrate the more than 650,000 people who come home from jail and prison each year back into a normal setting so that they can become contributing members of society, so that  they can become assets and not liabilities, and so that they can be the productive citizens that they have the potential of being. 
   We all know that it's common knowledge that people being released from prison and jail have complex needs, and that's why Second Chance is so important. Three out of four have a substance abuse problem, but only 10 percent in State prisons and 3 percent in local jails receive formal treatment prior to release. Fifty-five percent have children under 18, and about 2 percent of all United States minors either have or have had a parent in prison. Two out of three lack a high school diploma. And 40 percent have neither a diploma nor GED, and only about one out of three gets vocational training at any point during their incarceration. 
   Nearly half of those in jail earned less than $600 a month just prior to incarceration, and more than one of three jail inmates reported some physical or mental disability. About one out of five prisoners is released from prison without any real supervision or without any kind of help. 
   And so when we look at this enormous problem, it is essential that we provide all of the assistance. We know, for example, that those individuals who come out of prison and receive no help, within a 3-year period of time, 67 percent of them would have done what we call reoffend. About 53 percent of them will be back reincarcerated after having used up thousands of dollars of public resources just to get them back in jail or back in prison, not to mention the enormous cost of maintaining them during their stay.     
   That is why we believe that it makes far more sense to help these individuals return. 
   You know, it is not easy to get people to come over on a Monday night at 10:30. But one Member of the Congressional Black Caucus has come this evening. Not only has he come this evening, but he comes often. He comes often in terms of the kind of representation that he has provided in this House during his entire tenure, but also the kind of representation that he has provided throughout America trying to make sure that people experience equality, equal opportunity, a sense of justice, and a sense of hope. So I am very pleased that Representative Bobby Scott has joined me. 
   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to him to further discuss this issue.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. And definitely Representative Chris Cohen was very helpful and was a chief Republican sponsor of the legislation. 
   Let me also indicate that I agree with what you just said about America having more of its people in prison than any other developed nation in the world. But the vast majority, 95 percent of those individuals, will eventually return to the community. That is, they will return to the communities from whence they came. That means that every year about 650,000 are released. These men and women deserve a second chance. Their families, spouses and children deserve a second chance, and their communities indeed deserve a second chance. ``Second chance'' really means an opportunity to turn a life around, a chance to break the grip of a drug habit, a chance to support a family, to pay taxes, to be self-sufficient. 
   Today, few of those who return to their communities are prepared for their release or receive any supportive services. When the prison door swings open, an ex-offender may receive a bus ticket and spending money for a day or two. Many leave prison to return to the same environment which saw them offend in the first place. But, as they return, they often face additional barriers to reentry: Serious physical and mental health problems, as you just indicated; no place to stay; a lack of education or qualifications to hold a job. 
   As a result, two out of three will be re-arrested for new crimes within the first 3 years of their release. Youthful offenders are even more likely to re-offend. One-third of all correction departments provide no services to released offenders, and most departments do not offer a transitional program, placing a heavy burden on families and communities. 
   Considering the cost of incarceration, as much as $40,000 per year, and all the social and economic costs of crime to the community, it is just plain common sense to act to help these individuals reenter, become useful and reduce the level of recidivism. 
   When we think about it, the Second Chance Act will provide transitional assistance to assist ex-offenders in coping with the challenges of reentry. It will help reunite families and protect communities. It will enhance public safety and save taxpayer dollars. It is the humane thing to do, it is the responsible thing to do, and it is indeed the right thing to do. 
   The bill has the support of more than 200 criminal justice, service provider, faith-based, housing, governmental, disability and civil rights organizations, and President Bush has signaled his support for the legislation as well. 
   No single piece of legislation is going to solve the reentry crisis we are facing, but the Second Chance Act is a good start. I believe that with its passage, then we put the spotlight not just on the problem, but on the opportunities for solutions. 
   I am convinced, however, that any serious effort to facilitate the reentry of men and women with criminal records to civil society must be prepared to do two things: First we must be prepared to help with drug treatment on demand for everyone who requests it; secondly, we must find work for ex-offenders. Programs won't supply jobs. And after ex-offenders have undergone rehabilitation and receive appropriate training, employers will have to open their hearts and put these men and women back into the workforce, or they will surely and certainly end up back in prison. 
   I hope that everyone watching does in fact agree. I hope that everyone listening does in fact agree. And I certainly hope that all of the Members of this body and all of the Members in the other body will agree. Because when we help a person successfully reenter, we are not really just helping them, we are helping ourselves. I would much rather help an individual get rid of a drug problem than have to watch behind me when I walk down the street, or have to wonder whether or not I am going to be under attack because some person is in need of a $15 fix.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (HONORING MUHAMMAD ALI ON HIS 65TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe we are going to have any additional speakers so I am going to yield myself such time as I might consume and close for our side. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 65th birthday of Muhammad Ali. Ali's charisma, confidence and skills not only transformed boxing but the entire sporting world.     
   His unmistakable one-liners and his quick left jab enamored the public to the point that Ali said, ``I wish people would love everybody else the way they love me. It would be a better world.'' 
   Born on January 17, 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, he started to train at the age of 12 and earned Amateur Athletic Union and Golden Gloves titles as an amateur. Then known by his birth name, Cassius Clay, Jr., he became an Olympic gold medalist and was renowned for his strong right hand and his dancing feet. He went on to fight professionally and revived boxing at an age when it was plagued by mob control. 
   The three-time heavyweight champion was part of many legendary fights, including opponents Sonny Liston, George Frazier, and George Foreman. Ali used an unorthodox style on which he relied on quickness to dodge punches and to fool challengers rather than holding his hands high to defend his face. Ali's mix of poetic movement and powerful blows in the ring carried over to the comments he made outside. His knack for creating rhymes on the fly and his powerful paradoxes quoted to reporters made him a magnet for the media. He once said, ``My way of joking is to tell the truth. That is the funniest joke in the world.'' Ali made no qualms about what he did or how good he was. He was backed up in his claims and holds wins over seven fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees. 
   In the early 1980s, Ali was diagnosed with pugilistic Parkinson's disease, which forced him into retirement. After his retirement and despite his ailment, Ali has been committed to many philanthropic efforts to reduce poverty and hunger, to promote adoption, and to encourage cultural awareness. Ali was named Sportsman of the Century in 1999 by Sports Illustrated and is considered to be a modern legend by many. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Ali was indeed the greatest, but he did leave Louisville and eventually moved to Chicago, which is the greatest city, and so I was fortunate as an individual to get to know him and to get to know him well. As a matter of fact, you could always count on Ali to be present at community events, banquets, it didn't matter, local schools, playgrounds where kids were. 
   He was a real ambassador for the Nation of Islam and was very involved in his religious beliefs. A great man of integrity. As a matter of fact, people would often meet at his home for community meetings and gatherings and people would just stop by. He lived in what we call the Hyde Park community. And so he was indeed the greatest. He had no difficulty sharing himself with others. 
   So I commend Representative Carson for introducing this legislation and urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding and I also want to commend him for introducing this legislation, H.R. 1429, the Head Start for School Readiness Act. 
   I applaud the leaders in both Chambers for crafting such a strong bill that builds on the accomplishments of Head Start and promotes the success of young children. It is clear from this product that you and your staffs have toiled long and hard to strengthen the quality of the Head Start program, and I say to you, well done. 
   Foremost, let me thank you for maintaining the role of parents in governing Head Start. For more than 40 years, one of the most unique and important aspects of the Head Start program has been its emphasis on parental involvement. I worked actively with Mr. Souder and Mr. Payne, along with 88 other Members of the House, to advocate for maintaining this hallmark of equal responsibility for parents in governing Head Start. 
   I am also pleased that the bill strikes a balance between the House and Senate versions on the issue of program eligibility. In high cost-of-living areas such as Chicago, low-income families can lose access to this critical child development program not due to lack of need but because we fail to adequately consider the cost of living when calculating the poverty level. The conference report grants local programs flexibility in opening the eligibility while also requiring them to demonstrate the need. 
   I am especially grateful that the final report includes so many issues near and dear to me, such as recruiting minority male teachers, emphasizing children's social and emotional well-being, recognition of the expanding role of grandparents and kinship caregivers in children's lives, incorporating the best practices from the field of home visitation into the Early Head Start program, and increasing funds for salaries and education for Head Start teachers. 
   Finally, in addition, I am very pleased that this bipartisan bill preserves the anti-discrimination history of Head Start advocated so ardently by the Head Start and religious communities. Federal funds are not meant to support discrimination of any type, and I applaud the Members on both sides for maintaining this fundamental commitment to justice and fairness. 
   This bill expands access, improves teacher quality, expands accountability, and strengthens school readiness. I am proud to be a member of the Education Committee and proud to serve in a Congress that will pass this bill into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY AND PUBLIC HOLIDAY FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that I got an opportunity to listen to the statement from the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), who just made what I would consider to be one of the most common sense, passionate and eloquent statements about where America ought to be and what its position should be vis-a-vis the rest of the world. And so I want to thank you so much, Mr. Kucinich, for having had the opportunity to just hear the statement that you have just made. 
   Mr. Speaker, like many others, I spent much of the weekend talking about the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King and what he meant to America. And earlier today, we had a resolution, bill on the floor, celebrating the birthday and public holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   One of the young staffers in Government Reform and Oversight had written a statement that I was supposed to have read at that time because I was supposed to have managed that bill, but I was not here. But I was so impressed by the statement that this young person had written that I decided that I would come and share it with the rest of America anyway. 
   And so he wrote, Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Nation celebrated the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the impact he made on our society. His nonviolent struggle for freedom, dignity and equality of all races broke down longstanding barriers which denied equal opportunity to all Americans. Although we still have a long march ahead toward Dr. King's dream of peace and impartiality, his work inspired many to work for a world that respects and celebrates diversity. 
   Born January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King stood out as a student and entered into the Christian ministry. There he responded to racial prejudices and injustices that surrounded him when Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus. Dr. King was elected to the Montgomery Improvement Association and led the bus boycott that ensued. Later, King would organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which provided him a platform to become a more influential leader in the civil rights movement. 
   He continued to advocate civil disobedience, despite the fact that fire hoses and attack dogs were turned on him and fellow protesters in Birmingham. He spearheaded the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. The March on Washington brought more than 200,000 people to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and demanded the elimination of racial segregation in public schools, protection for demonstrators against police brutality and self-government for the District of Columbia. This march also included Dr. King's now famous, ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which became a profound turning point in the American conscience. 
   In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and continued to lead the civil rights movement. His interests broadened from civil rights to include criticism of the Vietnam war and the plight of the impoverished.     
   His plan for another march to Washington meant for underprivileged Americans was cut short when he was shot and killed on April 4, 1968. As we commemorate his life and work, we should apply the lessons he demonstrated in the context of current world events. His nonviolent approach to constructive change and his firm stance of fairness are leadership qualities that Washington and the world must remember and emulate. 
   As we face issues of national importance day in and out in this Chamber, we must bear in mind the example that Dr. King set in the hope that one day, as he said, the leaders of the world will sit down at the conference table and realize that unless mankind puts an end to war, war would put an end to all of us. 
   I think that is exactly what Mr. Kucinich was saying a moment ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you again for the opportunity to have addressed the House this evening, and I thank my young colleague for having written such an eloquent statement.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for yielding me this time. I also want to commend the chairman of oversight, the Honorable Henry Waxman, and the ranking member, Tom Davis, for their leadership on this tremendous legislation. But I also want to add accolades for the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia who has put her heart, mind and soul into this legislation; and without her leadership, we obviously would not be here this afternoon. 
   I have heard many people talk from both sides. I have heard individuals say that the Constitution denies the opportunity, and I am thinking of the Constitution as a living document. I don't want to keep the Constitution where it might have been. Representative Al Green made the most eloquent statement a few moments ago when he suggested there are always individuals on different sides of the Constitution. You can be on the right side, or you can be on the wrong side. You can be on the old side, or you can be on the new side; and the side that we are on this afternoon is the side that gives the residents of the District of Columbia the opportunity to help make more perfect this Union that we are a part of. 
   I stand firmly in support of this legislation. Again, I commend my colleagues on Oversight and Government Reform and urge all of the Members to vote in favor of giving the District of Columbia residents the right to vote.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1433, the ``District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007.'' I want to extend a thank you to Representatives TOM DAVIS and HENRY WAXMAN, and especially to Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON for their hard work and dedication in introducing and moving this legislation forward to provide the District of Columbia the right to vote with full representation in the House of Representatives. 
   The legislation before us today will give voting representation to over 500,000 District's residents and increase the size of the House from 435 to 437 voting members. The right to vote is the most basic act of citizenship. Voting representation for District residents who pay Federal taxes, defend our country during war, and contribute to the economic viability of other states, should not be disfranchised because they chose to live in the District of Columbia. 
   The Constitution, ratified in 1789, provided for the creation and government of a permanent home for the national government. Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, called for the creation of a Federal district to serve as the permanent seat of the national government and granted Congress the power, ``to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of government of the United States.......'' The Constitution grants Congress plenary power to govern the District of Columbia's affairs. This includes granting voting representation in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia. 
   On March 13, 2007, H.R. 1433 was passed by a decisive vote of 24 yeas to 5 nays in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and reflects bipartisan support for this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, Congress is attempting to correct a longstanding inequity for residents in the Nation's Capital--taxation without representation. We in this body must up hold the Constitution by not denying a large mass of people their fundamental right to voting representation. Congress has the power to correct the wrongs of the past for District residents and it lies in our power to grant the people of DC the right to voting representation. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is a triumphant day for the employees of the Government Accountability Office, known as GAO. When enacted, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008 will allow GAO to regain its footing as an agency that not only touts that its employees are the best and the brightest but treats them as if they are the best and the brightest. 
   On April 2, after a 2-year investigation and several subcommittee hearings, I introduced H.R. 5683, which would restore the 2006 and 2007 annual across-the-board increase to GAO employees who met expectations but did not receive the adjustment. 
   The legislation would also set a floor guarantee that would preserve GAO's performance-based compensation system, while ensuring that GAO employees receive an annual increase in their permanent pay, provided they meet expectations, that is at least equal to the congressionally approved across-the-board increase. The floor guarantee will be comprised of the annual adjustment to the GAO pay schedule, plus the permanent merit pay increase received by an employee under GAO's merit pay system. 
   Other provisions in the bill include creating a statutory Inspector General for GAO, providing GAO with enhanced recruiting tools, and eliminating the statutorily imposed GS-15 pay cap to allow the Comptroller General the authority to pay employees up to the rate for Executive Level III. 
   At a hearing the subcommittee held on March 23, 2008, on this legislation and GAO's personnel reforms, the subcommittee learned from the Ivy Planning Group, a consulting firm hired by GAO to conduct an African American Performance Assessment Study at GAO, that there are significant differences between the ratings for African American analysts and Caucasian analysts. Therefore, the personnel reform at GAO had a significant negative impact on African American staffers. 
   Furthermore, a survey that was administered to GAO employees at my request found that 81 percent of respondents thought morale in general at GAO is worse or much worse than before the reforms, and a majority of the respondents felt that not having an across-the-  board increase for all staff is very or somewhat unreasonable. While the subcommittee recognizes that more work needs to be done at GAO, H.R. 5683 would help improve the morale and remedy the inequities that resulted from the denial of the 2006 and 2007 across-the-board pay adjustments. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 5683 as amended, makes some technical changes to the bill as reported by the committee. Unfortunately, it also deletes a provision included at the request of Ranking Member TOM DAVIS due to concerns about the cost as reported by the Congressional Budget Office. The provision would have allowed GAO to include bonuses when calculating an employee's annuity, a position I support in principle and which we will hopefully be able to address as this bill moves forward in the legislative process. 
   The bill, as amended, also deletes provisions which would have given GAO the ability to administer oaths, and guaranteed GAO's access to certain Medicare and FDA information. In addition, it modifies a provision which would allow GAO to recover the costs of financial statement audits it conducts for other agencies. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join the Government Accountability Office and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   We also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to express appreciation to staffs on both sides of the aisle who worked extremely hard on this legislation and helped us shape it to the point where we think it is going to do an effective job for the employees of the Government Accountability Office. 
   Especially do I want to thank my staff director in the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce and not only do we want to thank her, but we know that she's going to be leaving us for a little bit. And at the end of the week, she is going to spend a little bit of time at home and perhaps in the hospital, not very much, but delivering a new voter for the United States of America. And she tells me that in all likelihood it will be a Democrat, and so we congratulate her and her husband and wish them well, and thank her again for her tremendous work.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (FATHER'S DAY RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for yielding, and also for the tremendous addition that he has been to the United States House of Representatives, and how much I enjoy serving with him on the Education Committee. 
   I also want to commend the sponsors of this resolution because I don't think that there is any other day that perhaps should be more important than the concept of Father's Day. 
   We all recount and remember our own childhood, growing up. I remember my father always trying to encourage us to do things like go to bed early, get up early, study hard, work hard, go to church. My father had all these little pithy sayings that he used to say to us, and he'd say things like, ``Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.'' 
   Then I remember when my brothers and I got to be teenagers, and he would tell us that; and we'd say, Dad, we really thank you for your wisdom. Of course the fellows have a different saying now. They say, ``Early to bed, early to rise and the girls go out with the other guys.'' 
   Nevertheless, the things that he taught continued to be the things that I value. Self-sufficiency, always being able to look out not only for yourself, but for others. 
   Unfortunately, we have seen a tremendous rise in single-parent families, where we experience much too often the absence of fathers. And there are things that we know about the absence of fathers. We know that children who grow up without the presence of a father are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to experience teen pregnancy, more likely to experience juvenile delinquency, more likely to be incarcerated. 
   And so I simply want to take this moment to thank the Illinois Council on Responsible Fatherhood, and a group that I work with called Fathers Who Care. On Saturday of this past week, as we do every year before Father's Day, we had a full day of activity at the Malcolm X Community College for 400 men who came and talked about fatherhood. And we encouraged those who had been away from their children to know that they can have father relationships even if they aren't employed, that even if they've been incarcerated and away from their families, they can still come back; that nothing takes the place of the positive interaction between father and child. And not only just your individual child. 
   I had so many fathers growing up until I just can't name them all. I had father uncles, I had father cousins, I had father neighbors, I had friends of the family, all of whom practiced the art of fatherhood. And I don't believe that I would be standing here today as a Member of Congress had I not had the influence of those men in my life. 
   Again I commend the sponsors of this resolution, urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WATER AND SEWER AUTHORITY INDEPENDENCE PRESERVATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'd like to present for consideration H.R. 5778, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act, which clarifies the original intent of previously enacted legislation establishing an independent water and wastewater utility agency for the national capital region. 
   H.R. 5778 was originally introduced by Representatives CHRIS VAN HOLLEN and TOM DAVIS April 10, 2008, and was discharged from the Oversight Committee on June 6, 2008. As chair of the House Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, I convened a hearing to discuss the merits of this legislation before us on April 15, 2008, where we learned that the bill had the support of the various regional localities that are served by the authority. 
   The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as D.C. WASA, was created in 1996 through congressional and local government action which was intended to establish an independent regional utility agency that would be responsible for providing drinking water and wastewater treatment services to the District of Columbia and wholesale wastewater treatment services to certain Maryland and Virginia suburban jurisdictions. 
   Before the enactment of a series of WASA-related statutes, the agency experienced a grave financial and serious operational difficulties. However, I am happy to report that ever since the agency was restructured back in the late 1990s, WASA has made significant progress in carrying out its statutory mandate of providing retail drinking water distribution, wastewater collection, and wastewater treatment services to over 2 million Washington metropolitan regional customers, of which the Federal Government is included. 
   H.R. 5778 clarifies the original intent of the applicable statutes concerning WASA's Board's responsibilities, including the financial management, personnel, procurement, and all other operations of the authority. A recent amendment to the bill will help to ensure that the residents and employees of the applicable jurisdictions are eligible for employment with WASA under the same terms and conditions. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, as a regional partner, it is important that we continue to show our commitment to strengthening and assisting WASA in its efforts to upgrade and improve the agency's operations, equipment, and long-term functionality. H.R. 5778 is an important step in that direction. Therefore, I urge its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALASKA AS THE 49TH STATE -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 127 which recognizes the 50th anniversary of the State of Alaska, and highlights its contributions to America's economy and heritage. 
   H. Res. 127 was introduced by our colleague, Congressman DON YOUNG of Alaska, on February 5, 2007. On April 16, 2008, H. Res. 127 was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee by voice vote. This measure has the support and cosponsorship of over 50 Members of Congress, including all of the delegation from the State of Alaska. 
   On October 18, 1867, the Alaskan peninsula was purchased from Russia and, in 1912, after major development during the Gold Rush era, Alaska was granted territorial status. 
   Enshrined as the 49th State of the Union on January 3, 1959, Alaska is commonly referred to as the last frontier. And the word Alaska, which is derived from the indigenous Aleut language, means mainland or, literally, the object towards which the action of the sea is directed.  
   Today, Alaska's economy is strong, with the third highest gross state production out of any State of the Union. And since the issue of gas was such a major point last week for my colleagues, I should also mention that Alaska currently provides over 16 percent of the daily crude oil production in the United States. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for sponsoring this measure. And given the 50th anniversary of Alaska statehood, and the enormous contributions Alaska has given to our Nation, and to the world, I urge passage of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank both the gentleman from Alaska and the gentleman from Indiana not only for their support of the resolution to honor the State of Alaska, but I was also pleased to hear them talk about the tremendous gas crisis that we have in the country. I was pleased to note that the State of Illinois played a role in the purchase of Alaska. 
   In terms of Secretary of State Seward, after he did not get the Presidency, did in fact become Secretary of State and did in fact make sure that we purchased Alaska. And, of course, that's a lesson for all of us to know that you don't necessarily have to win the nomination for President in order to do significant things afterwards. There is certainly much work to be done. 
   But let me just mention that recently, Congress overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation to temporarily suspend the oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As a result, the President was forced to suspend shipments and sign the deal which he previously opposed. Continuing to fill the SPR would take 70,000 barrels of oil off the market each day even though the reserve is 97 percent full with enough to meet our national security needs. We passed the farm bill that contains in it biofuels, new methods of creating energy, new sources from which energy can come. 
   And so there is movement, and I'm confident. Yes, we did become the majority in both the House and the Senate in the last 2 years, and when we get the other office, I have no doubt in my mind that we're going to see great relief from the oil crisis. 
   I urge passage of this resolution. 
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (NATIONAL SAFETY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1225, designating June as National Safety Month. After years of decline, the numbers of unintentional injuries and deaths in the United States have risen to unacceptable new heights. Deaths from motor vehicle collisions, poisoning from unintentional overdoses, and falls remain the three leading causes of preventable death in the United States. For example, in 2005, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported that accidents, both motor vehicle and other types of accidents, were the leading cause of death for persons ages 1 to 44 in Illinois. According to the 2008 edition of the National Safety Council's Injury Facts publication, the annual cost of unintentional injuries to Americans and their employers now exceeds $650 billion. 
   To reduce the prevalence and severity of these injuries, Congress annually designates June as National Safety Month. By providing a public service campaign around the theme ``Make A Difference,'' the National Safety Council promotes public awareness by highlighting the most significant causes for unintentional injuries and deaths in the workplace, on the road, and in the home and community. Equally important, the public campaign also stresses what Americans can do to prevent much of the needless suffering and expense associated with these accidents. 
   Each week of the month-long observance will focus on a unique safety issue. During the first week of June, the campaign focused on Emergency Preparedness. As a country we can make a difference by knowing how to perform CPR and acquiring Automated External Defibrillator training, both of which, if applied within minutes of a cardiac arrest, double the chances of survival. This week the campaign highlights the perils of distracted driving. According to a recent report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, nearly 80 percent of crashes and 65 percent of near-crashes involved some form of driver inattention within three seconds before the event. Next week, the campaign spotlights the escalating co-relation between the rise in the consumption of prescription medication and rise in overdose fatalities. During the last week of June, the campaign centers on the importance of fall prevention, highlighting tips for preventing falls in the workplace, as well as fall prevention tips for aging adults. The campaign will conclude on Monday, June 30th, with tips for Independence Day and summer safety. Summer is a time of increased rates of preventable injuries and death. As a country, we can make a difference by becoming more aware about safe practices. We must recognize our responsibility to implement interventions that make our world a safer place to live. I urge you to join me in supporting H. Res. 1225, designating June as National Safety Month and focusing individuals' and business leaders' attention on injury risks and preventions.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (VOTING RIGHTS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I first of all want to thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for not only organizing this special order, but for her tremendous devotion over the years. 
   Many of us, long before we came to Washington, DC, long before we became Members of the House of Representatives, knew of the work of ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. As a matter of fact, I was talking to a gentleman the other day, ELEANOR, who suggested that he went to elementary school with you, and that you were the smartest person in the class, and that he was always intimidated when he came to class because he knew that you were there.     
   And I don't know whether you intended to intimidate him or not, but I do know that the passion, the intellect, the energy that you display is something for all of America to be proud of; and I know that the people in the District of Columbia are indeed proud of the representation that you have given them. 
   The issue that we deal with, I take the position, is one of the most fundamental of all rights, one of the most fundamental of all desires, and that is the desire that people have to be represented; the notion that their thoughts, ideas, hopes, and aspirations will get the same consideration as those of anybody else. So when we look at voting rights in this country historically, it has been a privilege that people have had to fight and struggle to get. 
   Initially, of course, the only people who could vote were landowners, who were white in America. Those were the only individuals who had the right to vote. Then we went through this long period of time, and ultimately a Civil War, where thousands of people actually lost their lives, and finally African Americans, who had been slaves, were granted at least the right, although in many instances denied the opportunity, to vote. Women, who had to wage their own war, their own struggles, ultimately won their right to vote. 
   Only after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did hundreds of thousands of citizens all over the country, especially African Americans and Latinos, actually have the right to vote. Yet now we still have thousands of people who are denied the right to vote because they live in States where if you have a felony conviction you can never, ever vote, unless you can obtain a waiver. So, yes, one can imagine how people in the District of Columbia have felt as we talk about expanding democracy, as we talk about guaranteeing democracy for people in Iraq, guaranteeing democracy there; and yet the people who live in our own District of Columbia have not been able to have that experience. 
   So, ELEANOR, I know that we are going to make sure this happens before this session of Congress ends as a tribute to you and a tribute to the long-standing work that you have done. One of my pleasures is to serve with you on the Committee on Government Reform and to listen and to learn and to be motivated, to be inspired, and to see the kind of wisdom that you express on a regular and ongoing basis. 
   So I thank you for the opportunity to join you, I thank you for organizing this Special Order, and we will be standing right here with you when enough ``yeas'' are said that the people in the District of Columbia will have their right to vote.  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to extend a thank you to Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton for this special order and her hard work and dedication to get the District of Columbia the right to vote with full representation. It is strange to me where our government by money and blood sought to assist Iraq to become a democratic state where each person will have one vote under their newly formed constitution to determine their nation's destiny. However, the residents in the District of Columbia for over 200 years have been denied by the United States government the right to vote with full representation. Moreover, DC presidents also are denied the right to full self-government--a fundamental right that should be possessed by all Americans. 
   In 1950 with just under a million, the District of Columbia had more residents than New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii, respectively. All of these states from the beginning had U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives representing their interests in Congress. Today, the District of Columbia has a duly elected Delegate that is not allowed to vote for legislative measures on the house floor. This is ``taxation without representation.'' 
   The government has a history of denying its citizens the right to vote. We have seen it before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Since its passage and signing into law by President Johnson it gave way to an enormous and positive impact to our Nation. The importance and necessity of the Voting Rights Act cannot be overemphasized. We have learned through experience what a difference the vote makes to us. 
   The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of citizenship. The right to vote should not be abridged by the United States or any State on account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of servitude. Fundamental fairness requires that all members of society who have reached voting age, including rehabilitated ex-felons, be given a right to the ballot in State and Federal elections. 
   The lack of a nationwide uniform standard regarding ex-felons and eligibility to vote has led to a crazy quilt of laws, where in some States ex-felons are barred from voting for life. Currently, it is estimated that 3.9 million United States citizens are disenfranchised, including over one million who have completed their sentences. State disenfranchisement laws have had an adverse affect on African Americans. Thirteen percent of African American men, or 1.4 million, are currently disenfranchised because of such laws. We need to expand the right to vote to all citizens. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the District of Columbia Fair and Equal Housing Voting Rights Act of 2007.

   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues from the great State of Missouri in the consideration of H.R. 4166, which names the postal facility in Lebanon, Missouri, after Steve W. Allee, a dedicated and long-serving United States postal worker. 
   H.R. 4166, which was introduced by Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri on November 13, 2007, was considered and reported from the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, by a voice vote. The measure has the support of the entire congressional delegation from Missouri and provides us with yet another opportunity to pay tribute to an American citizen whose life was taken while simply performing his professional duties of delivering the mail. 
   The story of Mr. Allee's tragic death begins on Monday, August 20, 2007, where, according to a Missouri State Highway Patrol report, at 2 p.m. in Laclede County, 10 miles east of Lebanon, Missouri, a 2003 Chevy Blazer driven by Steve Allee, 51, of Stoutland, Missouri, came upon a flooded roadway and was swept away as a result of flooding on the Missouri River.     
   Allee, who was on duty during the accident, was found 2 miles downstream and pronounced dead at the scene. 
   At the urging of Representative Skelton, passage of H.R. 4166 will allow Congress to make in order a small tribute to this big-hearted individual, a United States postal carrier himself. Mr. Allee had been delivering mail since 1989, when he succumbed to his death as a result of the Missouri River overrunning its banks last fall. 
   Let us also remember and express our gratitude for the life of this dedicated postal worker, who was tragically taken from us by a force of nature while performing his vocation of delivering the mail, by passing H.R. 4166. 
   I want to thank Representative IKE SKELTON for moving to honor this gentleman for the work that he not only did but for the life that he gave.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 537, as amended, which expresses the House's support for the designation and goals of National 9-1-1 Month. 
   H. Res. 537 was introduced by Representative ANNA ESHOO of the great State of California on July 11, 2007, and has the support and cosponsorship of nearly 60 Members of Congress. Upon introduction, the measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform where it was passed by the panel by voice vote after having been amended on February 26, 2008. 
   Madam Speaker, it is only fitting that we consider this resolution today, as it makes the important point of highlighting National 9-1-1 Month as a way of reminding everybody of the significance these three small numbers hold in times of emergency and distress. 
   Whether young or old, the number 9-1-1, which had its first debut back in 1968 when AT&T, under the encouragement of Congress, established the digits as the Nation's emergency telephone number, is known by most Americans as the number to ring when someone needs a fire, police, or ambulance response right away because of a threat to health, safety, or property. There are countless stories that I am sure we can all recall where children as young as 3 or 4 have remembered to pick up the phone and dial the numerical sequence of 9-1-1, thereby saving the lives of parents, grandparents, caretakers, and siblings. 
   Further, urging support for National 9-1-1 Month education would be futile if we failed to mention the commitment and diligence of the thousands of persons that serve on the other end of the 9-1-1 line. By simply doing their jobs, these 9-1-1 call takers are saving lives every hour of every day by dispatching emergency first responders and by providing verbal support and comfort in some of the most perilous moments of our lives. 
   As localities and communities across our great country consistently search for ways to make the 9-1-1 calling system more efficient, reliable and well-known, let us do our part in elevating the importance of the numbers 9-1-1 by passing the measure at hand, which expresses the support of the entire House of Representatives for the designation and goals of National 9-1-1 Month.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from the Empire State of New York in consideration of H.R. 3196, which renames a postal facility in Port Jervis, New York, in honor of E. Arthur Gray, former mayor and statesman from Orange County, New York. H.R. 3196 enjoys the support of the entire congressional delegation from New York, and was introduced by my colleague Representative John Hall back on July 26, 2007. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, and was passed by a voice vote. 
   H.R. 3196 calls for honoring E. Arthur Gray's service to his community, State, and therefore his country by designating the post office in his hometown of Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building. 
   E. Arthur Gray was Port Jervis's longest serving mayor, completing 5 1/2 terms from 1978 to 1988. After his tenure as mayor, in 1988 Gray became a New York State senator by ousting a 16-year incumbent. Gray represented New York's 39th District during his time in the New York legislature. 
   A native and lifelong resident of Port Jervis, Gray began his professional career as cofounder and director of Gray-Parker Funeral Home in Port Jervis, New York, before entering the realm of public service and politics. Well-known throughout Orange County, New York, for his stellar high school basketball days at Port Jervis High School and as a World War II veteran, Gray gave unselfishly of himself by serving as the chairman of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, a member of the Orange County Economic Development Agency and as chairman of the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council. 
   Madam Speaker, in honor of E. Arthur Gray's public service and compassionate spirit, let us pass without reservation H.R. 3196 and rename the postal facility on Sussex Street in Port Jervis, New York, after this great American citizen.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Well, thank you very much. 
   I just want to commend and to thank you, Representative Clarke, for the leadership that you've taken on this issue as well as on a number of others. When you were elected, those of us who knew of your history and who knew of your family's history in New York were all delighted to know that we were going to have a queen warrior join us in the House of Representatives, and that's exactly what you have demonstrated yourself to be. 
   With every phone call that I have gotten--and I represent a district where the people like to be engaged and where they like to be involved--one of my biggest bills is probably my phone bill. That's because our phones are constantly being used all the time, all the 
   time, all the time. 
   In practically every call that we have gotten, the people have said, ``Don't fall for the okey-doke.'' So, you know, you have to ask them ``What is the 'okey-doke'? What are you talking about? What are you asking us not to fall for?'' They'll say, ``Don't fall for any bailout plan that only bails out financial institutions, that only bails out financial investors, that only bails out sophisticated traders, that only bails out people who really know and who understand markets and who have got all of these sophisticated tools and all of this information. Make sure that John Smith gets bailed out. Make sure that Sally Jones gets bailed out. Make sure that Mary Jackson gets bailed out.'' 
   In essence, what they were saying is make sure that, as to any bailout plan,  it has built into it consumer interest for the little guy--for the person who has invested and who has created a life savings that is being wiped out without a minute's notice, for the individuals who've got retirement plans that they've meticulously tried to put together and from which they're hoping to have some little nest egg at the end of their work. Make sure that these individuals' interests are, in fact, protected; make sure that they are included, and make sure that there is enough oversight to protect them. 
   As a matter of fact, one guy called, and he just said, ``If you want to make sure that you do something, make sure that you regulate, regulate, regulate, regulate, regulate and that you have oversight, oversight, oversight, oversight and that you have enough independence and enough people involved in oversight who don't have the institutional interests nor the self-interests that will take them away from the public interest.'' 
   So it's the public interest that we're talking about protecting. I don't believe in having more oversight than you need to. I don't believe in regulating more than what is necessary, but I can tell you that I believe sincerely that deregulation has been part of the culprit. We know that people have come to us and have said, ``You're strangling our ability to grow and to make money.'' Well, how much money do you really want to make? When is enough, enough, enough? 
   Another person told me the other day that the history of the world, my sweet, is deciding who eats and who gets to eat. It seems to me that there is an opportunity with this crisis, that there is an opportunity to make sure that bailout plans and schemes will create jobs, that they will promote the redevelopment of many of our inner city and depressed rural communities throughout the country and that they will make sure that the money goes where it is actually needed. 
   So I am prepared to vote for that kind of a bailout plan. I am not prepared to vote for anything that does not represent the serious consideration of the public interest. I'm hoping that as we debate, discuss, develop, and align things this week that that's what we're going to come up with. 
   So I again want to commend you. I want to thank you. I want to appreciate your leadership, to appreciate the work that is being done. I can tell you that, when the dust settles and after all is said and done, the American people will judge us by what we do for America, not just by what we do for any category or for any group of interest entities but by what we do for America. 
   I thank you again, and it has really been a pleasure to stop by. I've got to go and do what just regular people do, you know. I've got to go and wash. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (RESPONSIBLE FATHERHOOD AND HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, there is broad agreement that fathers matter in the upbringing of children. Studies show that children raised in the absence of a father are more likely to live in poverty. Children whose fathers interact with them on a regular basis on such daily activities as helping with homework, enjoying recreational opportunities and sharing meals have higher self-esteem and are better learners. 
   Children raised in the absence of a father are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as early sexual activities, as well as drug and alcohol use. Statistics demonstrate that boys raised in fatherless homes are more likely to become violent. 
   No one argues that there is any one model of family structure, but the elimination of government barriers to healthy relationships and healthy marriages, the promotion of cooperative parenting skills, and the fostering of economic stability and the provision of incentives to noncustodial parents to fulfill financial and emotional support responsibilities are clearly in the best interest of millions of children. 
   What we have learned is that even effective fatherhood programs cannot by themselves address the growing crisis arising out of the trend toward a single-parent home. What is required is a national social infrastructure which supports effective fatherhood. Therefore, on Friday of this week, I, with Representative Artur Davis, Julia Carson, Bobby Rush and others shall introduce the Responsible Healthy Fatherhood Act. 
   The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 restores cuts in Federal child support and requires States to pass through 100 percent of collected child support payments. It prohibits unfair and unequal treatment of two-parent families receiving TANF. It provides grants to help reduce barriers to healthy family relationships and obstacles to sustainable employment. 
   The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 ensures equal funding for programs such as mediation and conflict resolution. It provides funding for partnership between domestic violence prevention organizations and fatherhood or marriage programs to train staff in domestic violence and domestic violence prevention. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is designed to promote healthy family living; and I encourage all of my colleagues to take a hard look at it and support it.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand for the consideration of H. Res. 994, as amended, which expresses support for the designation of a National Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. 
   H. Res. 994 was introduced by Representative Paul Broun of the fine State of Georgia on February 25, 2008, and has the support and cosponsorship of 57 Members of Congress. The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote at that time after being amended for technical purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, while many people may not be aware of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, which is an extremely rare disorder of the blood where the platelets lack glycoprotein, a key element for blood to clot, therefore significantly prolonging bleeding time. While on average there are only 200 cases of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia reported every year, the disease and finding a cure for it still requires our attention, resources and support. 
   March 1, 2008, marked the inaugural commemoration of the National  Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. The day was celebrated with events, receptions and our colleagues in the Senate Chamber passed an identical resolution honoring and recognizing the importance of National Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. 
   I think it is important that we in this body help to expand research awareness of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, which is why I rise in support of H. Res. 994. Passage of this measure will help to raise the profile and the general public's understanding of this illness and the corresponding National Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. I urge passage of the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,  I join Representative Poe and his fellow colleagues from the Lone Star State of Texas in considering H.R. 5517, which renames the postal facility at 7231 FM 1960 in Humble, Texas as the Texas Military Veterans Post Office. 
   As stated, the measure at hand was first introduced by Congressman Ted Poe on February 28, 2008 and is cosponsored by all members of the Texas congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it was considered and passed by voice vote on March 13, 2008. 
   H.R. 5517 is intended to remember the lives, service and legacy of hundreds of military men and women from the State of Texas who have served or loss their lives in service to our great country. By renaming this particular Humble, Texas post office, H.R. 5517 will set into motion the creation of a living tribute to the sacrifices made by so many of Texas' sons and daughters, who gave their lives in service and honor abroad in order to ensure our protection here at home, an honor befitting the thousands of military men and women past and present, from every State of the Union that have unselfishly given of themselves in service and in battle for America. 
   H.R. 5517 will help memorialize the memory of generations of Texas' servicemen and women for years to come by designating the 7231 FM 1960 Humble, Texas postal facility as the Texas Military Veterans Post Office.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is said that we should judge a society by how it cares for its young, its old, and those who have difficulty caring for themselves. We have done much in the United States to care for our young citizens, but justice calls on us to do much more. 
   We know that, from 2000 to 2006, poverty increased by 10.7 percent, leaving 12.8 million children living in poverty. We know that one in three black children and one in four Latino children lives in poverty. We know that almost 12 million children under the age of five participate in some type of regular child care weekly. And we know that research demonstrates that high quality, comprehensive educational care for infants and toddlers can eliminate the achievement gap that exists between middle class and lower-income children. 
   Together these facts highlight that Federal support for quality care in the earliest years via Head Start and CCDBG is critical to help young children from low-income families arrive at kindergarten ready to learn and obtain a strong foundation for success in life. Despite the importance of early childhood care and education, Federal funding for these programs continues to lose ground. With nearly flat funding over the last several years, Head Start is  serving fewer children than it did in 2002. Despite an increase in the percentage of children under six with only working parents, Federal funding for the Child Care Development Block Grant has been effectively frozen since 2001. 
   These cuts affect Chicago and Illinois in very real, negative ways. In Chicago, just under 41,000 families with children under 5 live under the poverty line, yet only 17,000 of these children are served by Chicago Head Start. In Illinois, CCDBG served an average of 82,200 children in 2006, which is 20,000 fewer than it did just five years ago. 
   As policymakers, we should invest in families and children by bringing funding for Head Start, Early Head Start and the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) at least up to the inflation-adjusted levels at which they were funded in 2002. History will judge us harshly if we withhold key resources that we know can provide essential supports for our youngest citizens. During this Week of the Child, I urge my colleagues to reverse this trend and invest in children.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, Chairman Kildee and Ranking Member Castle, as well as both the majority and minority staff for their hard work and for including so many issues near and dear to my heart in this bill. Some of those are recruiting minority male teachers; emphasizing children's social, emotional well-being; recognizing the expanding role of grandparents and kinship caregivers in children's lives; keep parent councils as equals to the governing boards; incorporating the best practices from the field of home visitation into the Early Head Start programs; and encouraging the development of on-line graduate training. All of these are key issues to me and to the people of Chicago. I know that you have toiled long and hard to integrate Member concerns, and you have my appreciation. 
   In addition, I am very pleased that this bipartisan bill preserves the anti-discrimination history of Head Start advocated so ardently by the Head Start and religious communities. Federal funds are not meant to support discrimination of any type, and I applaud the Members of both sides for maintaining this fundamental commitment to justice and fairness in this bill. 
   Finally, I must mention a concern from Chicago Head Start programs. I know that the Chairs and ranking members have worked hard to address the problems surrounding low-income families in high cost of living areas such as Chicago from losing access to this critical child development program. I ask that the issue of income eligibility continue to be discussed so that the children of working poor families can be included.

   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from my home State of Illinois in consideration of H.R. 6681, which renames the postal facility in New Lenox, Illinois, in honor of Jacob M. Lowell. 
   H.R. 6681 enjoys the support of the entire House congressional delegation from Illinois and was introduced by Representative JERRY WELLER back on July 30, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on September 10, 2008 and was passed by the panel by a voice vote. 
   H.R. 6681 calls for honoring Jacob M. Lowell's service to this country. Jacob M. Lowell of New Lenox, Illinois, was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Air Assault), 173rd Airborne Brigade, Camp Ederle, Italy, when he died on June 2 near Gowardesh, Afghanistan. He died of wounds suffered when his unit came into contact with enemy forces using a rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire. This heroic son of Illinois was just 22 years old when he passed away. 
   Army Specialist Lowell played football for Lincoln-Way Central High School in New Lenox, Illinois.     
   He graduated in 2003 and 2 years later enlisted in the Army. According to his family, Jacob joined the Army because he wanted to serve his country. 
   Madam Speaker, in honor of Jacob M. Lowell's service, I urge that we pass without reservation H.R. 6681 and rename the postal facility on Vine Street in New Lenox, Illinois, after this great American serviceman.

   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration and support H.R. 6229, which names a postal facility in North St. Paul, Minnesota, after Mayor William ``Bill'' Sandberg. H.R. 6229 was introduced by Representative BETTY MCCOLLUM on June 10, 2008, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, by voice vote. The measure has been cosponsored by the entire Minnesota House delegation and pays tribute to one of the State's most well known public officials. 
   William ``Bill'' Sandberg was a longtime resident of North St. Paul, Minnesota, who served his beloved city as  mayor for 30 years until his death on April 20, 2008.     
   First elected in 1978, Mayor Sandberg was reelected seven times. Known for his good sense of humor, Mayor Sandberg once joked that the reason he kept getting reelected was simply because no one else wanted the job. 
   As mayor, Mr. Sandberg earned a reputation for his ability to bring people together by his warm, personable style. During the controversial meeting of the North St. Paul City Council, Mayor Sandberg once remarked that ``we were friends before the meeting, and while we may not agree on this, we will be friends when we walk out.'' He exhibited this same unique ability in bringing people together when he successfully solved divisive issues, such as the reconstruction of Highway 36. 
   Before assuming the position of mayor, Bill Sandberg served in the United States Army during the 1950s. He then went on to a successful business career, joining his parents' funeral home business in St. Paul and White Bear Lake, Minnesota. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, given Mayor Sandberg's commitment to his community, his State and to our country, I urge swift passage of this bill.

Army Specialist Daniel Agami died on June 21, 2007, in Baghdad from injuries he suffered when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany. 
   While in college in 2005, he enlisted in the Army and was deployed to serve in Iraq the following year. Army Specialist Agami not only served as a combat soldier, but he was also a mentor for orphaned children in Iraq. Described as having a sunny personality, he was loved by the children he worked with and is certainly missed. 
   Daniel's parents were presented with his Purple Heart and Bronze Star at his funeral. Agami was also posthumously honored with the Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, today is a good day for the more than 4 1/2 million grandparents in this Nation who are raising over 6 million children. Today is a good day for the 80,000 grandparents in Illinois who are raising their young grandchildren, and the 36,500 who are living with kinship caregivers. These families have told Members of Congress for years that they needed more support and that the system wasn't working for many children, and especially for African American kids. 
   Today we can tell them that we heard you and we are doing something about it. I commend Chairman McDermott, Ranking Member Weller, as well as Senators Clinton, Snowe, Grassley, Baucus and Rockefeller for their commitment to reforming foster care. 
   I rise in strong, unwavering, and resolute support for H.R. 6893. This compromise between the House and Senate advances child welfare in many areas. In particular, it recognizes that guardianship is an important path to permanency for tens of thousands of children in foster care. 
   In August 2007, the GAO confirmed something that my congressional district and the foster care community has known for years--that African American children are overrepresented in the foster care system, and that subsidized guardianship is a key Federal policy that can help thousands of children into permanent, loving homes. 
   I thank Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller for including many of the provisions supporting kinship caregivers that I have championed for years. Specifically, the bill includes four core elements of my bill, H.R. 2188, the Kinship Caregiver Support Act, which I introduced with Representative Tim Johnson and which Senators Clinton and Snowe championed in the Senate. 
   It allows States to use Federal funds to support family caregivers raising relatives in the foster care systems.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. It provides funding to establish kinship navigator programs; it requires notification of relatives when a child enters foster care; it extends eligibility for independent living services and education training vouchers for youth who exit foster care after age 16; and it allows States to waive nonsafety-related elements of the licensing requirements that may not apply to families. 
   In addition, I am very happy that the bill ensures that families that currently receive subsidized guardianship under the current Federal waiver program will be eligible under the new program. This provision protects over 6,000 children in Illinois, as well as the thousands of children in other States who benefit from the waiver program. 
   So again, Madam Speaker, I want to commend Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller, and I also want to congratulate my colleague, Mr. Weller, as he prepares to leave Congress after a stellar career, and I thank Chairman McDermott for acknowledging the work of Stephanie Tubbs Jones.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in supporting the promotion of awareness about diabetes and all of its complications and commend Mr. Payne for his introduction of this resolution.  
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 211, a bill that supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day. 
   H. Con. Res. 211, which has 54 cosponsors, was introduced by Rep. Donald Payne on September 17, 2007. 
   H. Con. Res. 211 was reported from the Oversight Committee on November 8, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Hyperglycemia, which is known as raised blood sugar, over time can lead to serious damage to many parts of the body, especially the nerves and blood vessels. 
   In 1991, the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation established World Diabetes Day. World Diabetes Day is celebrated on November 14th. This day was designated to promote the awareness that every person with diabetes or the risk of acquiring diabetes should receive the best possible education, prevention and care available. 
   Currently, more than 240 million people in the world are living with diabetes. Some analysts believed this number will grow to 340 million within 20 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Payne for seeking to support the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day and urge the swift passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues as we come this evening to pay tribute to our colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. I am pleased to follow so many of my distinguished colleagues, because they have said so much until there isn't much to say. But the interesting thing is that with Stephanie Tubbs Jones, you never run out of things to say, because she was so much and meant so much to so many. 
   It is interesting that when you knew Stephanie, you knew her whole family. You just didn't know her, you knew her sister; you knew her father; you knew her mother; you knew Mervyn; you knew her husband, Mervyn the first; you knew Mervyn the second; you knew nieces and nephews; you knew friends; and you almost got to know the whole of Cleveland if you knew Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Stephanie, as many people have already indicated, had a great legal mind. Prior to coming to Congress, she served as both a prosecutor and a judge. And the interesting thing about prosecution is that you are generally trying to make sure that the law is upheld, and that once people commit infractions, that they pay a price. Of course, that is what prosecutors often do. 
   Well, Stephanie had another interest in the law, and she wanted to make sure that the law also had a sense of justice. And even though she was a prosecutor, brother Kendrick, even though she was a prosecutor, she was a champion for those who had committed crimes, who had been convicted of crimes, and was one of the staunchest supporters of something called the Second Chance Act.     
   That is a bill which simply says that once individuals have fallen, that they also need to be lifted up; that once they have had problems, they need to be reclaimed; and, once they had committed crimes for which they may have been punished, they also needed to be redeemed. And so it was very pleasant for me to work with STEPHANIE on the Second Chance legislation. 
   She befriended people from all walks of life. It didn't matter if they were Democrats or Republicans, or they had been prosecuted. 
   As a matter of fact, when I think of her, I often think of the poet Homer, who talked about the kind of house that he wanted to live in, and I think STEPHANIE was an embodiment of that kind of house. And when he said, 
   ``Let me live in my house by the side of the road, where the race of men go by. Men who are good, men who are bad, wise, foolish. But then, so am I. So why would I sit in the scorner's seat or hurl the cynic's ban? But let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man.'' 
   STEPHANIE was indeed a friend to mankind, to humankind. 
   I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Katrina made a devastating impact on Florida and the Gulf Coast states in the last days of August 2005, followed within weeks by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. These disasters will long be remembered for disrupting families, changing and ending lives, and forcing Americans to rethink about our preparedness and ability to respond effectively to disasters. Unfortunately, these hurricanes served as a catalyst for changes in federal policy and government management within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency management Agency (FEMA). 
   Most of those changes were included in Title VI of the DHS appropriations legislation for FY2007. It established new leadership positions and requirements within FEMA. Additionally, it brought new missions into FEMA and enhanced the agency's authority by directing the FEMA Administrator to undertake a broad range of activities before and after disasters. 
   Although, Congress has responded to the devastation of the Gulf Coast region by providing billions of dollars in assistance, more resources are needed to expedite the economic recovery in this region.

   I commend full Committee Chairman Miller, Subcommittee Chairman Hinojosa, Ranking Members McKeon and Keller for their leadership on this bill. I extend my deepest thanks to the chairman for his commitment to enhancing minority education and for his steadfast support on multiple issues that were especially important to me and to institutions serving the black community. 
   I would be remiss if I did not thank the Education and Labor staff, who so skillfully worked to establish the many wonderful programs that will improve higher education for so many. 
   There are multiple provisions of this bill that will benefit Chicago and other places throughout the country. I am especially pleased that the bill strengthens minority-serving institutions, especially HBCUs and Predominantly Black Institutions, or PBIs. I am very glad that the bill strengthens the TRIO programs that serve first-generation low-income students, and the prohibition on the Department of Education's Absolute Priority within the Upward Bound program. 
   At this time I would like to engage in a colloquy with Chairman Miller.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. I thank the chairman of the committee for his clarification and appreciate his and the conferees commitment to writing the statute to promote unity among the higher education community that serves mostly African American students. 
   It is an excellent bill. I urge its passage.  
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I support the passage of the conference report for H.R. 4137, which authorizes the Higher  Education Opportunity Act. This bill reauthorizes the higher education act for the first time in 10 years. I commend full-Committee Chairman GEORGE MILLER and sub-Committee Chairman RUB&#201;N HINOJOSA for their leadership on this bill. I extend my deepest thanks to the Chairman for his commitment to enhancing minority education and for his steadfast support on multiple issues that were especially important to me and to institutions serving the Black community. I would be remiss if I did not thank the Education and Labor staff who so skillfully advocated to establish so many wonderful programs that will improve higher education opportunities for so many. 
   There are multiple provisions of this bill that will benefit Chicago and Illinois. To begin, this bill greatly expands access to higher education for low-income and minority students. By increasing Pell grants to $8,000, extending the grants to year-round, and allowing part-time students to qualify for Pell grants, this bill will enable many more of my constituents to attend college. 
   I am especially pleased that the bill authorizes programs for both undergraduate and masters programs at Predominantly Black Institutions. PBIs represent a growing cadre of four-year and two-year institutions that serve as the access point for a growing number of urban and rural Black students whose family and financial situations limit their ability to gain access to college in many states. Many of these students come from low-income families and are also ``first generation'' college students, whose educational preparation for college and family finances present special challenges to educational success. PBIs are not eligible to receive funding under the HBCU capacity-building funds given that PBIs were not established prior to 1964. The undergraduate PBI program will provide federal support to strengthen the institutional capacity of schools to attract, retain, and graduate their students. Chicago has many PBIs that provide high quality education for many low-income, minority students, including: Chicago State University, Malcolm X College, Harold Washington College, Olive-Harvey College, Kennedy King College, East-West University, Robert Morris College, and South Suburban College. In addition, the new PBI masters program promotes the development of more Black masters-level professionals in the science and health fields by providing specific institutional support. For example, Chicago State University will qualify for valuable aid to strengthen its masters programs in the biological sciences and computer science as well as strengthen its first professional program in pharmaceutical science. Together, these new PBI programs will enhance the access for low-income African American students to higher education. 
   I also am pleased that the bill strengthens both HBCU undergraduate and graduate education. As a graduate of an HBCU, I am very familiar with the benefits these institutions provide to low-income students. The new masters program for HBCUs in Title VII fills a void in current law. Title III, Part B includes institutional support for undergraduate education at HBCUs, and Section 326 provides institutional support for doctoral and first professional programs at HBCUs. The new Section 723 completes this continuum by supporting HBCUs with masters 
   programs in the fields of science and health as well as clarifies the congressional intent that the existing Section 326 pertains to doctoral and first professional programs. 
   Further, the bill strengthens the TRIO programs, which are key supports for low-income, first-generation college students to prepare and succeed in higher education. Importantly, the bill institutes an appeals process when applicants have evidence of errors in the handling or scoring of the applications. A number of Chicago institutions unfortunately have had difficulties in the last few years with denial of applications for suspect reasons and due to glitches with the Grants.gov system. Having a procedure in place to allow due process for these applicants is an important element to ensuring a fair application process. Further, the bill prohibits the implementation of the absolute priority that the Department imposed on the Upward Bound program, forcing programs to dramatically alter the nature of the services provided. I am happy that any future evaluations of Upward Bound will exclude the cohorts of students chosen under this well-intentioned but ill-conceived priority. 
   Chicago also has many for-profit institutions of higher education that serve an important role in educating students. I am glad that the Conference Report provides additional flexibility for these institutions in terms of the 90/10 rule, including flexibility in the types of revenue that count toward the 10 percent, the Departmental response to violations of the rule, and exceeding loan limits as a result of the enactment of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. Further, I support the increased monitoring and reporting requirements of for-profit institutions as a means to provide transparency and safeguards for students. 
   I am happy that the bill emphasizes the need to support populations that are underrepresented in higher education. One such population about which I am particularly concerned is African American men. The under-representation of minority males, especially African American men, is a matter of public record that is reinforced by high drop-out rates in urban and rural school districts, and lower participation/enrollment rates of these groups in colleges and universities. The American Council on Education's Minorities in Higher Education Annual Reports have consistently documented these factors for almost two decades. For example, although the enrollment of black men in higher education increased between 2000 to 2001, less than 3 percent of black men received a combination of associate's, bachelor's, or master's degrees. Clearly, ensuring success of students in higher education necessitates examining and promoting the success of minority males. To this end, the Conference Report includes a study of minority male access to and success in higher education that will provide key data to lawmakers so that we can better tailor our policies to promote minority men in higher education. The bill also encourages the involvement of individuals--such as African American men--who are from populations underrepresented in higher education in the TRIO programs, in teacher residency programs, in teacher preparation courses at minority serving institutions, and in loan forgiveness programs. These provisions will help ensure that the higher education community better reflects the diversity of our Nation. 
   Another population about which I am particularly concerned is individuals in prison. After Congress barred prisoners from receiving Pell grants in 1994, provision of postsecondary correctional education dropped greatly. Multiple empirical studies demonstrate that postsecondary correctional education improves the atmosphere in prisons, increases successful 
   reentry, increases employment after release, and decreases criminal behavior. For example, studies show that such education helps improve communication among staff and inmates, develop positive peer role models, and reduce disciplinary infractions. Further, multiple studies show that postsecondary education saves taxpayers' money. In 2001, government analysts in Maryland calculated that such programs saved state taxpayers more than $24 million annually, more than two times what the state spent on such programs. Given that the average annual cost of incarceration is more than $22,000 per prisoner and that more than half of formerly-incarcerated people return to prison with 3 years, providing higher education within prisons promises to be a cost-effective investment of taxpayer dollars. 
   Currently, only approximately 5 percent of the total prison population is enrolled in postsecondary education. Current Federal postsecondary correctional grants target youth, resulting in a great need for such programs for adults. The Conference report expands higher education opportunities for older students by extending the qualifying age for such programs to 35 and by allowing up to 7 years to study while in prison. These provisions will allow greater flexibility to states to identify and serve individual inmates who are best able to benefit from postsecondary correctional education. In addition, the bill authorizes a study on the effectiveness of postsecondary correctional education. This study will greatly advance our understanding of what makes programs effective in educating individuals and reducing post release offending. 
   Further, I am pleased that the bill takes steps to ease the discrimination against low-income students with drug convictions. There are multiple problems with a one-size-fits-all penalty based on financial aid. It inappropriately uses the financial aid application process to apply a mandatory minimum sentence above and beyond what the judicial system has imposed for a restricted group of students. Also, given that the penalty applies only to students receiving Federal aid who must maintain a C average or higher, the current provision unfairly denies aid only to low-income, high-performing students. The Conference report makes it easier for students who lose aid to re-qualify for Federal aid after it is removed. The report also requires an important study of who is denied Federal aid so that lawmakers can better understand whether this policy penalizes particular categories of students compared to others. As the Committee on Education and Labor's Report indicated, the study will examine the demographic background of the students excluded from Federal aid by the drug prohibition as well as the nature of the offenses underlying the exclusion. The variables for study are clearly enumerated in the Committee Report.  
   In closing, there are many elements of this Conference report that will help many low-income students to access and succeed in higher education. I am proud to serve in the Congress that is making such a considerable investment in our students so that all youth--especially low-income, minority students--have access to quality postsecondary education.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Representative Rosa L. DeLauro (D-CT). H.R. 1338 amends the Equal Pay Act, one of the primary laws addressing pay discrimination. Since becoming law, loopholes and weak remedies have made the Equal Pay Act less effective in combating wage discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness Act, strengthens and improves the effectiveness of the Equal Pay Act.  
   There should be little doubt that such improvements are necessary. More than four decades after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, women still make only 77 cents for every dollar made by their male counterparts, a wage disparity that cannot be explained by differences in qualifications, education, skills, training, responsibility, or life choices. Rather, in many cases, the pay differential has resulted from unlawful sex discrimination. 
   The consequences of this discrimination are severe and predictable. The pay disparity forces single-mother households and families dependent on two wage earners to live on less than they rightfully deserve, while simultaneously reducing women's retirement earnings. In short, unfair pay disparities perpetuate women's economic dependence and deprive them of economic opportunity and equal protection of the laws. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act provides for compensatory and punitive damages only ``as appropriate,'' with no further limitation or arbitrary cap being necessary. The modest provisions for compensatory and punitive damages in the Paycheck Fairness Act bring remedies for victims of sex-based wage discrimination in line with those available for victims of wage discrimination based on race and national origin. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Miller, and Subcommittee Chairwoman Woolsey and Congresswoman DeLauro for championing this important wage discrimination legislation.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairman Waxman for yielding. 
   I have always been told that one of the basic responsibilities of management is to effectively manage and account for the resources of the corporation, of the country, of the business. And, of course, in this instance we are talking about the United States Government; and all of us are shareholders, are stakeholders. 
   And I must confess that when I look at the record of our chief management team, we have come up woefully short. We have seen raw examples of waste, fraud, and abuse: no paper trails, no real rationale for why a contract or contracts were let. 
   And I want to commend Chairman Waxman for effectively laying out a bill of particulars against these current practices. The hearings that were held on contracting accountability were so revealing. As a matter of fact, much of the information that we saw, we just couldn't believe in terms of contracts that were let and nobody could tell what had happened as a result of the contract, what was the work that was done, who did it. 
   This legislation will limit the length of noncompetitive contracts, minimize no-bid contracts, maximize fixed-price contracts, require public disclosure of justification of no-bid contracts, disclose contractor overcharges, and promote ethics in procurement which is so important. 
   Every dollar spent by this Government should get maximum return for the shareholders. We have not seen that in our contracting policies and practices. And I commend the chairman not only for the oversight but also for the corrective action which we are about to take today by passing this legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 257, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. 
   H. Res. 257, which has 77 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative TODD PLATTS on March 20, 2007. H. Res. 257 was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States. It develops when cancerous cells form in the tissues of one's pancreas. 
   Pancreatic cancer spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it is one of the leading causes of cancer death. The American Cancer Society estimated that 37,000 people will be diagnosed this year with pancreatic cancer in the United States, and about 33,000 of them will die. 
   I support the goals and ideals of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month in order to educate people about pancreatic cancer and the need for research funding, early detection methods, effective treatments, and preventative programs. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Platts, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.

   Mrs. Eleanor McGovern was the wife of former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. She was born on November 25, 1921, in Woonsocket, South Dakota. She was the first spouse to campaign for her husband, alone, to be President of the United States beginning in 1971. 
   People had such confidence in her ability to articulate various issues facing the country during the early 1970s. Mrs. McGovern made a solo appearance on NBC TV's program ``Meet the Press,'' answering policy questions without hesitation and in precise detail. Also she was the first, by a candidate's wife, to appear on this show in its 25-year history. 
   Crowds were often moved by her speeches and drew comparisons to the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. Some questioned whether she might do her husband more harm than good. 
   When asked if her campaigning was worth the risk to her husband's Presidential bid, she replied: ``I would be campaigning as strongly for him if he were not my husband. Maybe there is a risk involved, but since I have the freedom to speak, and my husband doesn't know what I'm saying when I go around the country, he does not tell me what to say. He takes that risk.'' 
   Mrs. Eleanor McGovern wrote a memorial about her personal life entitled ``Uphill: A Personal Story.'' She wrote: ``I still carry a trace of bitterness about poverty. It was not ennobling for my father and grandfather to scratch out a living on land rendered barren. The poor have few choices in life.'' Throughout her life, she learned to preserve and overcome life's challenges. 
   Mrs. McGovern died on January 25, 2007, at the age of 85.

   Mr. Owen Lovejoy, the son of a Congregational minister, was born on January 16, 1811, in Albion, Maine. He graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, in 1832 and studied law. 
   In 1836, Mr. Lovejoy was ordained as the pastor of the Congregational Church in Princeton, Illinois, a position which he held for 17 years. He was a strong opponent of slavery, and he used the pulpit to attack slavery and helped slaves gain their freedom from bondage. 
   In 1856, Mr. Lovejoy was elected to Congress with the help of fellow Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln. He served four terms in the United States House of Representatives and continued his work as an abolitionist. 
   Mr. Lovejoy worked with Members of Congress in both Chambers to weaken slavery and attempted to achieve a measure of equality for all people regardless of race. When critics within his own Republican Party expressed fears that the former slaves were not going to live in the North if they gained their freedom, Mr. Lovejoy replied, and I quote, ``Let them stay where they are and work under the stimulus of cash instead of the lash.'' 
   Mr. Lovejoy died on March 25, 1864, just 2 weeks before the introduction of the 13th amendment to the Constitution.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H.R. 2089, which names a postal facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, after the Louisiana armed services veterans. 
   H.R. 2089 which was introduced by Representative William Jefferson on May 1, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Louisiana congressional delegation. 
   Madam Speaker, the Louisiana armed services veterans were recognized for their significant contributions to our country early in the 19th and 20th centuries. During the War of 1812, Louisiana's veteran troops, which included French, Spanish, African, Anglo, Creole, and Native American people, under General Andrew Jackson, decisively defeated the British forces on January 8, 1815. This battle forced the British to recognize the United States' claim to Louisiana and helped establish America as a political and military power. 
   In the 20th century, the famous Louisiana maneuvers held at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in 1940 tested the mettle of future World War II Army Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Patton and the soldiers who served under their leadership. President Eisenhower referred to Louisianan Andrew Jackson Higgins as ``the man who won the war.'' In New Orleans, Higgins designed and built amphibious landing craft that made possible the invasions of enemy-held Pacific Islands and the coast of France D-Day invasion. 
   Rural southeast Louisiana was native soil for two Marine Corps commanders, General John Archer Lejeune and General Robert Barrow. The Nation's first black woman to earn her stars as a U.S. Army General, Sherian Grace Cadoria, grew up in Marksville, Louisiana. 
   The Louisiana veterans for centuries have served and defended our country with exemplary valor and honor. And so, Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative William Jefferson, for introducing this legislation and urge its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1277, I call up the bill (H.R. 5781) to provide that 8 of the 12 weeks of parental leave made available to a Federal employee shall be paid leave, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008, which was introduced by our colleague Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY on April 14, 2008. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia, I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this bill, along with 21 other Members of Congress. 
   H.R. 5781 takes an important step in improving the Federal Government's ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified workforce by providing paid parental leave to Federal and congressional employees for the birth, adoption or placement of a child for foster care, which is a benefit that is extended to most employees in the private sector as well as to government employees in other countries. 
   In considering H.R. 5781, the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia marked up the bill on April 15, 2008, and favorably recommended the measure to the Full Committee on Oversight and Government Reform after adopting an amendment offered by Committee Chairman HENRY WAXMAN that would permit only 4 weeks of paid parental leave instead of the 8 weeks included in the bill as introduced. The full committee then held a markup on H.R. 5781 on April 16, 2008, and ordered the bill to be reported to the floor, as amended, by a roll call vote of 21-10. 
   During the consideration of H.R. 5781, I had asked that language be included in the bill directing the Government Accountability Office to study the feasibility of providing a disability insurance benefit to Federal employees who had to take time off to care for a spouse, child or parent that has a serious health condition or for a Federal employee that has a serious health condition that renders him or her unable to perform their job functions. While the manager's amendment that we will be discussing later on removes this provision from the bill, I am happy to report that at my request GAO has agreed to perform a study that will analyze disability insurance benefits that are currently being offered by States, local governments and the private sector. 
   The bill being considered today will allow all Federal and congressional employees to receive 4 weeks of paid leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act for the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child. As many of my colleagues are aware, the current FMLA statute provides Federal workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child with an employee. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us does nothing more than permit Federal employees to receive paid leave for 4 out of the 12 weeks if the leave is connected to the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child, and to use accrued sick or annual leave, if available, for the remaining 8 weeks. Let us be clear: This bill currently being considered does not provide Federal workers any additional time nor expand beyond the 12 weeks given under the current law. 
   The bill before us has also been strengthened by granting the Director of the Office of Personnel Management the authority to increase paid parental leave from 4 weeks to 8 weeks after considering a thorough cost and benefit analysis. 
   Parental leave is a pertinent concern around the world, and, unfortunately, America is lagging behind in offering paid leave for parents. The governments of 168 countries offer guaranteed paid leave to their female employees in connection with childbirth. Ninety-eight of these countries offer 14 or more weeks paid leave. Currently the Federal Government as an employer guarantees no paid leave. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I again reiterate my support for H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself the rest of our time to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been a rather spirited discussion and debate, and I'm reminded of the fact that we often compare public employees with private employees. And I know that we have amongst us Members who like the idea of downsizing government, of privatizing operations, of outsourcing activities. I believe that our public employees can in fact be the best that we help and allow them to become. 
   I believe that we can recruit the best and the brightest. But I also believe that if you want production, then you have to make sure that you are treating your employees fairly. Let's be clear. Federal employees are only able to accumulate a maximum of 30 days of annual leave, not an adequate amount of time for purposes of providing care for a newborn or adopted child. 
   Early in their careers when they're earning only 13 to 20 days per year, accumulating even 30 days is nearly impossible. Yet the early years of one's career usually coincide with the time that they decide to have children. And so it's the young, new employees who have not accumulated a great deal of time, who, in many instances, are either giving birth or adopting children. 
   So if we're going to be able to recruit, we have to try and make sure that we can attract. 
   We also need to be family friendly. Not only do we need this bill, but in reality, we really need childcare centers in all of our agencies. We need daycare programs so that people who have to work can know that there is the adequacy of opportunity to care for their children. 
   So providing this legislation the opportunity to live, providing individuals who are bearing children or adopting children the time that they need to bond with a newborn or to bond with  an adopted child I think is not only a rational, sensible approach but I also want to extend commendations again to my colleague from New York, Representative CAROL MALONEY, who has led the fight on this issue for such a long time. And it is as a result of her tremendous efforts and the great work of our staffs that we are here this afternoon preparing to move another step towards making sure that we have the kind of workforce that our Federal Government needs. You can't lead where you don't go. And you can't teach what you don't know.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the manager's amendment being offered does not make any substantive legislative changes to the bill's underlying purpose, it does make in order several minor technical changes that are designed to streamline the bill's language so that the House-passed bill will mirror language currently being considered in the Senate. 
   Most of these changes involve drafting edits and modifications through the bill's layout and structure. All of these changes are technical in nature. However, they are important to ensuring the swift passage of the measure. 
   The manager's amendment also strikes section 5 of H.R. 5781. This section of the bill entitled ``Study'' originally directed the Government Accountability Office to study and submit to Congress a written report of the feasibility and desirability of offering an insurance benefit to Federal employees not to include parental leave that would provide wage replacement during periods related to a serious health condition.

   As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5506 which names the postal facility in Jersey City, New Jersey, after Bishop Ralph E. Brower. H.R. 5506, which was introduced by Representative ALBIO SIRES of New Jersey on February 27, 2008, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote. 
   This measure has the support of the entire New Jersey delegation and provides this body a chance to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of a distinguished and highly respected gentleman from the Garden State of New Jersey, the admirable Bishop Ralph E. Brower.     
   Unfortunately, Representative Sires is unable to join us on the floor today, but nonetheless, he asked that his statement of support be submitted for the Record. 
   Born into humble beginnings in North Carolina as the eldest of six children, Bishop Brower's educational aspirations led him to attend Laurinburg Institute and Kettle College of North Carolina. He received his master's degree from Kings College in Briarcliff Manor, New York, his master's in divinity from Florida State University, and his Ph.D. from Grambling State University. 
   Bishop Brower began to make his mark on New Jersey and the community of Jersey City in the early 1950s when he took the helm of St. Michael's Methodist Church. Over the years, he has overseen the growth of the congregation from six members to the thousands that now worship at St. Michael's. 
   Largely responsible for helping the church and its congregation blossom into a positive force for change in the community, Bishop Ralph E. Brower undoubtedly deserves the honor of having a United States postal facility named after him. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this measure by voting in favor of H.R. 5506. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey for introducing this resolution. I was thinking that in 1954, I was a pre-adolescent, just beginning to read, write and try and understand what was going on. And where I lived, I remember the first school bus that I rode on was actually made from a flatbed truck that Mr. Arthur Dooley had. And when the schools were consolidated, he put a cabin on it and some wooden benches, and that was my first ride on a school bus. 
   Then I remember the next year, we inherited a school bus from the white school. Then, I remember that all of the books that I read, all of the while that I was growing up, had someone else's name in the books when we got them, after they had been used by the other school system where I lived. 
   And so, when I think of Thurgood Marshall, not only do I think of the tremendous impact that he continues to have today, but I think of the impact that he had on the lives of individuals like myself, who lived in an environment that was obviously very separate and very unequal. 
   What he did will last as long as America lasts because he clearly showed that there could be an opportunity for people to experience some of what we call the goodness and the greatness of America. And for that reason, I come to commemorate him today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a moment to support H. Con. Res. 381, which celebrates the contributions and achievements of Thurgood Marshall on the 100th anniversary of his birth. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908, Thurgood Marshall was the grandson of a slave and at an early age his father, William Marshall, instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law. He attended undergraduate school at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. In 1930, he was accepted to Howard Law School; however, he also applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was Black. This event caused the direction of his professional life to focus on equal desegregated education. As an African-American man who lived through segregation and oppression he once said, ``Today's Constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments. Those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that I and other Blacks cherish.'' As an attorney and during his tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Marshall's opinions did much to advance the decency and fairness of our laws, making America a much stronger nation. 
   Thurgood Marshall's tireless work within the justice system to eradicate the legacy of slavery and destroy the racist segregation system of Jim Crow clearly demonstrated his dedication to the struggle for equal rights and justice in the United States. As chief legal counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, he championed one of the most important cases for equal rights, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, the landmark case that demolished the legal basis for segregation in America. He continued to push for equal rights as the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, succeeding in creating new protections under law for women, children, prisoners, and the homeless. By these accomplishments, Thurgood Marshall established a record for supporting the voiceless Americans and left a legacy that recognizes that discrimination includes factors beyond just race and gender. He built a structure of individual rights that has become the cornerstone of protections for all Americans. I commemorate the years he has served and the improvements he has made to this great Nation.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my enthusiastic congratulations and support for the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority during its National Boule Conference, celebrating 100 years of its organization and existence. The sorority, founded at Howard University on January 15, 1908, is the first Greek-lettered sorority established and incorporated by a group of nine African American college women. The AKA sorority broke barriers for African American women in areas where little power or authority existed due to a lack of opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century. 
   Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the sorority consists of college-educated women of African, Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic descent. The sorority serves through a membership of more than 200,000 women in over 900 chapters in the United States and several other countries. Since its inception, Alpha Kappa Alpha has helped to improve social and economic conditions through community service programs. Members have improved education through independent initiatives, contributed to community building by creating programs, and influenced Federal legislation by advocacy through the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights. 
   My wife, Vera, is a proud member of Tau Gamma Omega, the graduate chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Two of my sisters, Ceola and Floretta, are also AKAs. They often meet in our home. And I have always been very proud of the leadership and mentoring relationship my wife has established and continues to display with younger women who join. Tau Gamma Omega is a strong voice and positive presence in the community where they serve. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that there are 26,000 AKAs in the District of Columbia this week. And today I was very pleased to receive, along with my wife, State representative Connie Howard, and the immediate past president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the Honorable Bobby Steele and a large contingent of AKAs from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and the United States House of Representatives, I commend the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority on all their continuing endeavors to help the community. And I welcome the 26,000 attending members of the 2008 Centennial Boule to their founding place of Washington, D.C.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my former colleagues who have talked about foreclosures and predatory lending. 
   As a matter of fact, I also want to thank the committee that I established a few weeks ago, made up of about 50 people, including State Representative LuShawn Ford, who has agreed to chair. I come from the community that pretty much led the movement for community reinvestment in this country under the leadership of a woman named Gail Cincotta who was the head of the Organization for a Better Austin, and then Gail came to Washington and went ahead and founded the National Training and Action Committee which still exists to this day. 
   So I simply want to associate with those comments made by my colleagues. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I really also rise with a great level of sadness to pay tribute to a good son, a good husband, a good father, a good citizen and one of Chicago's finest of the men and women in blue, Police Sergeant Ralph Ford, Jr. 
   It has been my pleasure and that of my wife to know the Ford family for many years. I first knew Ralph's mother, Mrs. Jacqueline Ford, when she was a pioneer community activist serving on the board of the Martin Luther King, Jr, neighborhood health center. She and my wife Vera have attended Carey Tercentenary AME Church together, and I say forever. 
   I first knew Ralph well when he was a young Chicago police officer. I had begun to run for public office. He was a diligent and enthusiastic volunteer who was not afraid to be associated with our campaign, even though I was running as what we call an Independent against the existing political machine. 
   The fact that Ralph had attended the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff added another star to his crown because I had attended the same school when it had another name, Arkansas AM&N College, before it attained university status. 
   Being the excellent police officer that he was, Ralph made sergeant and outdistanced many of his peers. He was jovial, a great talker, had a great personality and a wonderful sense of humor. 
   Family meant everything to Ralph. He was totally devoted to his wife and children, and he had a great affinity for other members of his family, and of course, he and his mother Jackie had an absolute long-standing love affair.  
   Of course, Ralph passed away a few days ago. Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Ralph Ford, Jr, was an absolute credit to his law enforcement profession, the apple of his wife and family's eyes and a joy to humanity. He shall be sorely missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the public welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations, private entities and compassionate individuals that work tirelessly to support foster children. 
   Since May is National Foster Care Month, it is appropriate that today we salute the many individuals and organizations that provide foster care services to over 500,000 children currently in foster care nationwide. 
   National Foster Care Month originated in 1988 and has served to heighten awareness for the issue since that time. By increasing visibility of this important issue, organizations are better able to reach out to the community and recruit individuals to support children throughout the year. By connecting foster youth with caring adults we can ensure that children do not face life's challenges alone. 
   Child welfare issues are present in families of all races, ethnicities and cultures. However, children of color make up a disproportionate number of children in foster care. Without a stable home, these young people confront many challenges. Although some of these young people are able to overcome the challenges of abuse and neglect, others continue to deal with their effects long into adulthood. 
   Research finds that just 54 percent of foster care youth complete high school and 25 percent will face homelessness at some point in their lives. Additionally, research has shown that children in foster care are more likely than their peers to deal with poverty, unemployment, incarceration, poor health and other hardships. 
   We must do what we can to support these young Americans and help them cultivate the necessary skills to live successfully and independently. More than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year, and today we recognize the many individuals, families, neighborhoods, communities and organizations that work collectively together to ensure that all children can grow up with the support they need to be healthy and safe. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, once again I express my support for H. Res. 789 and recognize the hard work so many put in on a daily basis to help children in foster care reunite with their parents, be cared for by relatives or to be adopted by loving families. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H. Res. 1173, which recognizes the contributions of the national service program known as AmeriCorps. Since 1994, AmeriCorps has engaged over 500,000 citizens of all ages in national service programs, giving 705 million hours of service to our Nation and their fellow citizens. AmeriCorps, which is composed of AmeriCorps State and national programs, the National Civilian Community Corps, or NCCC, and the Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA programs, engages 75,000 people each year in intensive, results-driven service to help communities tackle the toughest problems of education, poverty, illiteracy and the relief and recovery efforts after disasters.     
   AmeriCorps participants improve the lives of millions of our most vulnerable citizens by implementing critical health services, building low-income housing, making neighborhoods safer, and protecting the environment. 
   AmeriCorps VISTA participants are America's poverty fighters, 6,000 strong, and fulfill their service term in low-income communities by creating businesses, expanding access to technology, recruiting literacy volunteers, strengthening anti-poverty groups, and creating sustainable programs that help people rise out of poverty. 
   AmeriCorps NCCC participants serve as first responder in times of national need and have responded to every nationally declared disaster since 1994: floods, fires, tornadoes, and storms, and helped communities prepare for the next emergency. In fact, 10,000-plus AmeriCorps members have served millions of Katrina survivors in the gulf and managed a quarter million other Katrina volunteers. 
   The impact of AmeriCorps goes beyond the community in which a participant serves; it impacts the AmeriCorps member who is doing the service. The alums of AmeriCorps programs are significantly more likely to go into public-service careers in government and the nonprofit sectors, especially minorities and people from low-income backgrounds. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this week is AmeriCorps Week. This is a week in which we as a Nation should thank those who have given of themselves and who served our Nation through AmeriCorps to improve the lives of our Nation's vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens and improve communities across the country. We salute AmeriCorps members and alums for giving of themselves to benefit others and their powerful impact on our Nation's communities and the lives of our citizens and thank all involved in making AmeriCorps a successful program. 
   I ask that my colleagues join me in full support of H. Res. 1173 and salute those current and former AmeriCorps members through passage of H. Res. 1173. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding time, but I also want to commend her for the tremendous leadership that she continues to provide on this critical issue of mental health, mental illness. I am pleased to join with her in support of H. Res. 1134, recognizing and acknowledging Mental Health Awareness Month during the month of May. 
   I agree with Representative Napolitano that mental health is one of the major health issues facing our society, and yet it does not get the kind of attention that it needs and deserves. 
   When we think of all of the individuals who will suffer from substance abuse, all of the individuals who find themselves perplexed and not quite knowing how to navigate the society in which we live, and when we consider the fact that we have not reached the point of providing parity consideration nor parity treatment for mental illness, it's appropriate that we recognize May as Mental Health Awareness Month.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for not only her leadership on this but her leadership on many issues that affect not only African Americans but people all over America. 
   Although we are talking about health disparities, let it be known that we don't believe that merely dealing with the disparities is going to get us where we need to be relative to health care in this country. I am firmly convinced that the only way that we will address adequately all of the health care needs that exist in this country is to have a national health plan where everybody is in and nobody is out; where everybody will have access to quality, comprehensive health care without regard to their ability to pay. 
   I have spent a great deal of my time over the last 2 or 3 years dealing with the particular needs of young African American males. And if we look at that population group, nearly four out of 10 young African American men lack health insurance. The percentage of uninsured African American men, while higher than that of whites, is lower than that of Hispanics, American Indians, and Native Hawaiians. Young men, regardless of race or ethnicity, are more likely to be uninsured than any other age group. 
   People without health insurance are more likely than those with health insurance to delay needed care, less likely to fill prescriptions, and more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage when they do finally seek care. They are also less likely to have a usual or regular source of care. 
   Young African American men die at the rate that is at least 1.5 times that of young white and Hispanic men and almost three times the rate of young Asian men. While the death rate drops for men ages 25 to 29 for most groups, it continues to rise among African Americans. The leading causes of death for all young men ages 15 to 29, regardless of race or ethnicity, are unintentional injuries such as car accident, firearm, or drowning, suicide and homicide. For young African American men, more deaths are caused by homicide than any other cause. 
   Additionally, HIV is the sixth leading cause of death for young African American and Hispanic men. Yet for other racial groups, HIV is not among the top 10 causes of death. 
   When I hear my colleagues talk about what we need to do and when Representative Clarke was here a few minutes ago talking about the need for gun control legislation that would make it more difficult to acquire and make use of handguns, that is so real. Not only are those tragedies taking place in New York, but I also take this  opportunity to commend Reverend Jessie Jackson and a coalition of individuals, including Reverend Gregory Livingston, who every Saturday morning have been picketing gun shops outside the City of Chicago. Fortunately, you cannot purchase a handgun in Chicago, but you can go right outside and purchase all that you want. 
   So I commend them for their efforts to make real the notion that change can occur, but it only comes as we are activated, motivated, stimulated, and involved. 
   So, again, Representative Jones, I thank you for your leadership. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to put a face on this problem that is plaguing African Americans all over America.

Carson. H.R. 2570, which was introduced by Representative Marilyn Musgrave on June 5, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2007, by a voice vote.

Following his military service, he attended the University of Nebraska and received his doctor of dental surgery degree in 1951. Dr. Carson started his dental practice in 1954. His practice thrived and continued until his retirement in 1994. 
   In 1991, the Colorado Dental Association gave him its Distinguished Service Award. Dr. Carson was a member of the Fort Carson City Council from 1975 until 1973. He held the city's top post, mayor, for 5 years, from 1968 to 1973.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I was leaving a friend of mine's home on Sunday morning, a young fellow was across the street on the other side and he flagged me down and said, ``Can I talk to you for a moment?'' And so I waited for him to come across the street, and he did. And I asked what I could do for him, and he says, ``Well, I am trying to find a job.'' And I inquired as to his educational background, what kind of things that he could do, and what kind of jobs that he had. And he says, ``Well, I had a job, but then my employer discovered that I also had a felony conviction and he didn't know that when I got hired.'' And, ``Of course,'' he says, ``I have lost my job, lost my house, lost my car, lost my wife, and I am in the process of losing my children.'' And as I listened to him on Sunday morning, it reinforced for me how important it is that we try and provide for individuals like this young man a second chance. 
   As a matter of fact, our country is the most imprisoned nation on the face of the Earth. More than 2 million people languish in our jails and prisons across the country. 
   More than 650,000 of them come home every year, and, like this young man, oftentimes find every avenue blocked that prevents them from leading normal lives. Of course, many of them do what we call recidivate, that is, if they don't get any help within 3 years, 67 percent of them will have done what we call re-offend; that is, committed another offense against society. More than 50 percent of them will be re-incarcerated, costing our taxpayers enormous sums of money. 
   And so I felt compelled to come to the floor and urge my colleagues to support the Second Chance Act, to urge the leadership to bring that legislation to the floor, so that this young man and thousands of others like him can, indeed, experience a second chance.

   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 87, a bill that supports the goals and ideas for a world day of remembrance for road crash victims. H. Con. Res. 87, which has 54 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Robert Wexler on March 8, 2007. H. Con. Res. 87 was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on June 12, 2007 by a voice vote. 
   The third Sunday in November is designated as a world day of remembrance for road crash victims. This resolution commemorates the 1.2 million people killed in road crashes globally, including 40,000 in the United States each year. 
   Road crashes are the second leading cause of death worldwide among young people from ages 5 to 29, and the third leading cause of death among people aged 30 to 44 years. Vehicle accidents every year have injured and disabled as many as 50 million people throughout the world. Road traffic injuries cost countries approximately $518 billion each year, which is between 1 and 5 percent of the gross domestic product of each nation. 
   I support this legislation to encourage the people of the United States and of the world to support and participate in programs and activities to commemorate a world day of remembrance for road crash victims with appropriate ceremonies, programs and other activities. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Robert Wexler, for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage of this bill.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, thrust by President Nixon's resignation into an office he had never sought, former President Gerald Ford occupied the White House for just 896 days. They were, however, 896 extraordinary days that President Ford used to guide the Nation through and out of the dark days of the Watergate scandal. 
   When Ford took office on August 9, 1974, he declared: ``I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.'' 
   Ford got his first exposure to national politics at Yale University, working as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's Republican campaign for President. 
   After World War II service with the Navy in the Pacific, he went back to practicing law in Grand Rapids and became active in Republican reform politics. The rest is history. 
   President Ford was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 as a Republican. Ford's reputation for integrity and openness made him popular and well regarded among his peers during his 25 years in Congress. 
   In 1965, he was elected minority leader. Mr. Ford was a devoted public servant who led his country with grace and bipartisanship during challenging times. The country is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication.

   Mr. Speaker, Gerald Ford, the Nation's 38th President, and the only person to serve both as President and Vice President, although elected to neither office, led the Nation out of the dark days of the Watergate scandal. When Ford took office on August 9, 1974, he declared: ``I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.'' 
   After playing football at the University of Michigan and serving on an aircraft carrier in the Navy during World War II, Ford was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 as a Republican. The district he represented included his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ford's reputation for integrity and openness made him popular and well regarded among his peers during his 25 years in Congress. 
   In 1965, he was elected minority leader. In October of 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned from office after pleading no contest to tax evasion. President Nixon, ensnared in the rising Watergate scandal, asked the well-respected Ford to leave Congress in order to replace Agnew, and he accepted. 
   In September 1974, Ford granted President Nixon a pardon, an act that is credited for calming American anxieties about the Watergate controversy. ``It was a tough decision,'' Ford told USA Today in an interview in 2000. ``We needed to get the matter off my desk so I could concentrate on the problems of 260 million Americans and not have to worry about the problems of one man.'' 
   Gerald Ford was a devoted public servant who led this country with grace and bipartisanship during challenging times. All of America is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the last week we have heard many discussions about the impact of President Gerald Ford. We have heard people talk about the fact that he was never elected to either the Presidency nor the Vice Presidency of the United States. But yet his impact has been felt in such a way, as I listened to Representative Ehlers from Michigan talk, that people still refer to the district as his district. 
   I hear individuals who are sports fans who remember his days as an athlete when he played football and the fact that whatever the assignments were, that he could pick up the assignment and do exceptionally well with it, and that oftentimes he didn't veer too far from the center. He didn't always veer so far to the left or he didn't always veer so far to the right, but he was one of these kind of straight-down-the-middle people who protected the interests of his colleagues, who protected the well-being of his mates, who protected the interests of those on the team. 
   I think he saw America as a team and, when he was given the ball, decided that his greatest challenge was to protect the interests of America. And that is what he did, even though he probably knew that it would cause some difficulty with his reelection. 
   Even though he knew that in all likelihood and all probability there were individuals who would be concerned enough that they may not give him the kind of support that he would need to be reelected, he did it anyway. He did it because he could put the interests of the country above those of any personal feelings or personal need that he had. I think that that is really what puts him down in history as one who excelled to the point of greatness, because he served the country and served the interests of the country extremely well. 
   Mr. Speaker, when students study politics, when young people are trying to understand what it is that they need to be and what they ought to become if they really want to be a great public servant, they should study the life of President Gerald Ford, and they should understand that being a public servant is to put the public interest first. That is what he did, that is what he is noted for, and that is why all of America continues to revere him, especially those of us who are old enough to remember that period, who are old enough to kind of recall the mood of the people and what was taking place and what was going on at that time. 
   No matter how historians write the script, you can never take away what President Gerald Ford did for America. That is why we salute him, and that is why we raise him up; that is why we lift him to the American people, and that is why this resolution is so important. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Oftentimes when we talk about civil rights and the era of civil rights, and we talk of the individuals who were pushing perhaps the most, sometimes the name of Gerald Ford does not get included in that discussion, and he is not included in that discussion because he didn't always loom as high as some others might have. He was not necessarily one of these individuals that you would just simply know about. Oftentimes he did what he did somewhat quietly but, nevertheless, did it and it had the impact that it was designed to have. 
   Such were his positions relative to civil rights issues, even prior to ever seeking or getting involved in public office. I was told a story of how, as he captained the football team, that there were some controversies relative to an African American member of the team who was not going to get an opportunity to play. Of course, President Ford, as football team captain at that time, a sort of president-in-waiting, learning what leadership really meant and what leadership was all about, just sort of took the position that if this gentleman was not going to be able to play, then neither would he. And of course the team was concerned, because if you have a star and the star is not playing, then of course it decreases your chance of winning. 
   Think of what America would be if all of us stood up all of the time for stars, or for the individuals who had the potential to be stars, to make sure that they got their rightful chance, their rightful opportunity, got their acceptance because of what they could contribute and because of what they brought to the table. I guess that really was the understanding that Gerald Ford had even at that moment, and all of America continues to be grateful to him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the memorial service of Ann Richards, the former mayor of Dallas, Texas, Ron Kirk, the mayor's lifelong friend said, ``Ann Richards was as fierce a warrior and advocate for justice as any public servant I've ever known. She embraced every person she met, no matter their station in life, with dignity, and love, and compassion.'' 
   The former Governor of Texas was a witty, flamboyant and outspoken homemaker who captured the hearts and minds of the people of Texas, as well as the Nation. She burst into national prominence as a keynote speaker to the 1988 Democratic National Convention when she uttered the famous line about the wealthy, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, and she said, ``Poor George, he can't help it; he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' The speech set the tone for her political future as the first woman elected to treasurer, a statewide office, in Texas in 50 years. 
   In 1990, Ann Richards won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against attorney general and former Congressman Jim Mattox and former Governor Mark White. Her Republican opponent was multimillionaire rancher Clayton Williams, Jr. The campaign between the two was brutal, but Richards prevailed in the election on November 6, 1990, by a margin of 49-47 percent. 
   As Governor, Ann Richards wanted a more inclusive Texas. She called it the ``New Texas,'' where she made nearly 3,000 appointments, 46 percent were female, 15 percent were African American, 20 percent were Hispanic and 2 percent were Asian Americans. Among Governor Richards' appointment of firsts are: the first African American to the University of Texas regent; the first crime victim to join the State criminal justice board; the first disabled person to serve on human services board; and the first teacher to lead the State board of education. During her tenure, she oversaw the fabled Texas Rangers pin stars on their first African American and female officers. 
   Richards implemented an economic revitalization program to address the Texas economy that was in a slump since the mid-1980s, compounded by a downturn in the U.S. economy. Her policy initiatives yielded a 2 percent growth in 1991 for the Texas economy, while the U.S. economy as a whole shrank. 
   Ann Richards reformed the Texas prison system by establishing a substance abuse program for inmates in prison and reduced the number of violent offenders released back into society. She was a supporter of proposals to reduce the sale of semiautomatic  firearms and cop killer bullets in the State.     
   She vetoed legislation that would allow people to carry concealed handguns and automatic weapons inside public establishments without the owner's permission. Some political analysts believe that this veto cost her her reelection bid for Governor in 1994. Richards lost her reelection bid to George W. Bush. After her unsuccessful bid for reelection, someone asked her, ``What would you have done differently if you knew you would be a one-term Governor?'' Richards grinned and said, ``Oh, I would probably have raised more hell.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

You know, speeches are things that you hear a lot of when you are involved in public activity and public office, and you don't always look for anything special when you see another one coming. I mean, sometimes, it is another speech. 
   But the amount of wit and charm that Ann Richards had and her ability to convey it in such a way that she could make a humorous point that was not always so humorous, but you still got the humor out of it, and whoever it was directed to and at didn't necessarily view it as being offensive, she had the ability to do that. 
   We have heard speaker after speaker talk about the fact that she appointed this large number of individuals to boards and commissions and made regents out of people and gave them positions that people just didn't sort of expect, because it had not been done before. 
   Then she took on a real tough question that some people feel caused her to lose an election, but she probably knew the risk that she was taking, because it had to do with the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, dealing with semiautomatic weapons that the normal average person wouldn't necessarily carry. 
   I mean, you wouldn't walk around, even if you wanted to go hunting, with a semiautomatic weapon to shoot rabbits or deer or whatever it is that you would shoot, although I have never believed in shooting that many things any way, unless they were shooting back. Therefore, I was never much of a hunter, because the animals didn't have anything to shoot back with. That was about the only way that I would see myself shooting at them. 
   But she knew the great political risk that she was taking, and not withstanding that risk, held to her guns, held to her position, did not waver, did not back up. That is what real leaders are made of. They don't take positions just to get elected or just to be in office. But they take them based upon principles upon which they believe, ideas and ideology that govern their lives. 
   That was the kind of woman that Ann Richards was, and that is why I think she was able to mean so much to so many people, not only in Texas; but she was a great advancement for the women's movement, for enticing more women to run for public office, and, of course, to be elected to public office, and to reach another level of equity, another level of having arrived at a point in history where a woman, a little girl growing up, can believe that she has the possibility of moving not only to Governor of the State of Texas, but to Speaker of the House of the United States House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to our distinguished Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I want to congratulate the University of Southern California for their victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl. 
   On New Year's Day, college football fans, student athletes and the Nation were treated to an exceptional college bowl game. And no matter what team you support, it is always a thrill to watch the Rose Bowl. 
   The University of Southern California made history by appearing in its fifth consecutive Bowl Championship Series game and defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 32-18. 
   I would like to extend my congratulations to the coaching staff, administration, and most of all to the student athletes and fans for winning the Rose Bowl. 
   I also want to extend my congratulations to the Michigan Wolverines and their student athletes for a great season. Winning the Rose Bowl has brought national acclaim to a university that already has a rich history as the oldest private research university in the West. USC also lays claim as the birthplace of important Internet technologies and has the only marching band in the United States of America that has earned a platinum record. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the University of Southern California for their success in winning the Rose Bowl, and also for their great educational tradition. I urge passage of this resolution.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate another college for their accomplishments. Mount Union College, located in Alliance, Ohio, is not only known as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the Midwest but also more recently for winning the NCAA Division III Football National Championship. 
   On December 16 of last year, the Mount Union College Purple Raiders captured their ninth NCAA Division III Football National Championship by defeating the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks. 
   We know that such accomplishments are achieved through a group effort. I applaud the Purple Raiders coaching staff; the administration; student athletes; and, of course, the fans for a championship season. 
   I also want to extend my congratulations to the Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks for a well-played game and a successful season. 
   The Purple Raiders, whose purple parrot mascot is well known in northeastern Ohio, have achieved some notable athletic accomplishments, including nine national championships in the past 14 years, along with two of the longest winning streaks in college football. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again I commend and congratulate Mount Union College  for their dedication and success, not only for their athletic prowess but also for their academic achievement and academic reputation.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1434, which names the postal facility in Springdale, Pennsylvania after Rachel Carson. 
   H.R. 1434, which was introduced by Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania on March 9, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on March 29, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 40 Members, has the support of the entire Pennsylvania, congressional delegation. 
   Starting in the mid-1940s, Ms. Carson became concerned about the use of newly invented pesticides, especially dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, better known as DDT. This turned into an amazing thesis she entitled ``Silent Spring.'' ``Silent Spring'' focused on the environment and the effect of pesticides on humans. This was known as Carson's greatest work. She worked to defend the claims in ``Silent Spring'' until her death. It is believed that Carson's ``Silent Spring'' was the catalyst for the United States taking a more in-depth look at the use of pesticides, as well as the founding of government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague for seeking to honor the memory, legacy, and contributions of Rachel Carson and urge swift passage of this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And there was a great deal of fear and consternation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, over 500,000 children in the United States are involved in some form of foster care. Placements in foster care have increased significantly over the past 10 years. In situations of abuse and neglect, children may be removed from their parents' home by a child welfare agency and placed in foster care. Some of the reasons for foster care placement include severe behavior problems in the child and/or a variety of parental problems such as abuse, abandonment, illness, including physical or emotional problems, incarceration, AIDS, alcohol, substance abuse, and death. 
   The resolution we are considering today honors foster parents. Foster parents are people who open their homes and their hearts to children in need of temporary care. The task is both rewarding and difficult. As a matter of fact, I have met individuals who have adopted children. I know one police officer who has adopted 13 children, a most unusual and unbelievable man, salt of the earth, pillar of the universe. 
   Foster parents take children for medical care and to school events. They may facilitate visitation between the child and the birth parents in the foster home or other approved locations. Foster parents face many challenges in caring for the physical and emotional needs of children. We need more foster parents to care and nurture our children who are unable to remain in their homes. Foster parents should be commended for their big hearts and commitment to provide stable homes for children. 
   This is an issue that is very personal to me in a very serious way. My congressional district has more grandparents taking care of children than any other district in the Nation, and it is followed closely by two additional congressional districts in the Chicago area. I want to commend the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. I also want to commend some of the social welfare agencies that deal seriously with foster parenting for children, agencies such as Sankofa an organization that was started out of a crisis situation and now does an outstanding job. Agencies like One Church One Child that attempts to get individuals to become foster parents to teenagers coming out of correctional facilities, which is not an easy task. 
   So I commend the gentlewoman from Kansas (Mrs. Boyda) for introducing H. Res. 179, and urge its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Who will save the world that is destined to die?'' 
   We are talking about saving the children, those unfortunate young people, many of whom their parents are incarcerated. There are more than 1.5 million children in America whose parents are in prison or in jail. They are in need of foster parenting. 
   So, again, not only do we urge passage, but I commend the gentlelady from Kansas, and urge listeners and watchers and viewers to see whether or not there is an opportunity for you to open your heart and your home and become a foster parent.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I join with my colleagues from all across America who have spent much of the evening extolling the virtues of our colleague Juanita Millender-McDonald. Much has been said, and yet there is much that can, in fact, be added. 
   As a matter of fact, when I first came to Congress, Juanita was one of the first persons that my wife and I met. So my wife immediately became a Juanita Millender-McDonald fan. And I said to her, Vera, it is all right for you to be a Juanita Millender-McDonald fan, but don't try to dress like her. We can't afford it. 
   Juanita was, in fact, a charming, delightful, snazzy lady, the essence of femininity, but as tough as a nail. As a matter of fact, I don't know if a week went by that I didn't receive some communique from her talking about some issue or explaining something that she had done or something that she had worked on. And as I listened to all of my colleagues talk about her many ``firsts,'' the first African American woman to serve on the Carson City Council, the first African American woman to render the national Democratic response to President Bush's weekly radio address, the first to be named Honorary Curator of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, and the first Democratic chair of the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues. Obviously, she was many firsts. And I guess maybe the  poet Homer had her in mind when he said that there are pioneer souls that go where highways never ran, but let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man. 
   And I guess he had Juanita in mind as he talked about why would I live in my house by the side of the road as the race of men go by. Men who are good, men who are bad, men who are wise, foolish, but then so am I. So why would I not simply be, as Juanita has been, one who understood the relationship between people, moving across aisles, moving across boundaries to accomplish and get things done. 
   So on behalf of my family and me and all of the residents of the Seventh Congressional District of Illinois, we extend our greatest condolences to her family and say that we too would hope to live in the house by the side of the road like Juanita Millender-McDonald and be a friend to mankind.

   Sergeant Marin was born in Momax, Mexico, and lived there with his mother while his father worked in California picking fruit and doing construction jobs to support seven children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Serrano for yielding to me. I appreciate the opportunity to work with the gentleman from New York on this issue. 
   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce Postal Service and District of Columbia, I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on issues within our subcommittee's jurisdiction. 
   In 1971, Congress made the Postal Service self-sustaining. However, Congress continued to subsidize the mailing cost of the blind, nonprofit organizations, local newspapers, and publishers of educational material. It did so by providing an appropriation to the Postal Service to cover the revenues it had given up or ``foregone'' by charging below cost rates to these groups. Appropriations for these subsidies increased as postage rates and the number of nonprofits grew, approaching $1 billion annually in the mid-1980s. 
   In the early 1990s, Congress did not appropriate enough to cover these costs and refused to let the Postal Service invoke its statutory right to raise rates to cover the shortfall. The Postal Service pleaded that providing social subsidies was not part of its mission, hindered its competitiveness, and was more regressive than taxation with its impact. 
   The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 eliminated appropriations to support reduced rates for nonprofits, which effectively transferred the costs to other mailers. The Act retained free postage only for the blind and for overseas absentee ballot materials. Appropriations for subsidizing that narrow purpose have been in the range of $60 million to $100 million each year. 
   The 1993 Act also provided for an annual payment of $29 million each year for 42 years to pay off the debt accumulated in the early 1990s. Congress has appropriated this amount every year from 1994 through 2006, even though the President's fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 budgets proposed to eliminate the payment. Failure to fund this authorized appropriation places the remaining debt of more than $800 million at risk of nonpayment which would significantly increase postal costs. In addition, not providing funds for these services over time will require the Postal Service to record these obligations as a bad debt and will unfairly transfer these costs to postage ratepayers whose costs have already increased due to the recent rate determinations by the Postal Rate Commission. 
   It is important to note that Congress entered into this arrangement and has covered the $29 million each year without fail since the 1993 Revenue Foregone Act was enacted. By reneging on our obligation, we place the fiscal well-being of the Postal Service at risk. We also send a signal that Congress will not stand behind free mail for the blind and overseas absentee balloting materials, something we should not be doing. 
   For the record, I note that in addition to our subcommittee letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting that the $29 million in revenue foregone reimbursement be restored, a number of postal stakeholders echoed the request: Postal labor unions and management, the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, and the postmaster general all want the revenue foregone payment honored. 
   I ask the chairman: Will the chairman support restoring this important funding when the bill goes to conference with the Senate?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the CBC FY09 alternative budget. I'm particularly excited today, because last night the Second Chance Act of 2007, a bipartisan piece of legislation, unanimously passed the Senate. I look forward to President Bush signing the legislation and the appropriation of money in DOJ to fund vital programs which the bill promotes. 
   Indeed, currently, the Administration FY09 budget proposes to: Merge 30 grant programs under State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance for a reduction in funding of $1.008 billion; collapse 14 Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) for a reduction in funding of $587.2 million; consolidate Weed and Seed programs for a reduction in funding of $32.1 million; collapse 7 juvenile justice grants into 1 grant program for a reduction in funding of $198.5 million; and lastly, merge current formula and discretionary grant programs into 1 program for a reduction in funding of $120 million, for an overall collapse of 70 DOJ programs into 5 programs and a reduction in funding totaling $1.5 billion. 
   These cuts come as America's prisons reach an alltime high and State incarceration costs are bursting at the seams. According to the latest study, between 1987 and 2007, States spent more than double on corrections (+127 percent) while higher education spending has been moderate (+21 percent). 
   It's with this in mind that I categorically support CBC's proposed budget, which includes $4 billion dollars to these vital DOJ programs. The CBC has made tough choices, established right priorities while exercising fiscal and moral responsibility to reduce recidivism and State incarceration costs.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, CPC, PC fiscal year 2009 alternative budget. In an attempt to meet head on the administration's proposed fiscal year 2009 upside-down budget priorities, the CPC budget calls for a more humanitarian approach addressing the current deficit and economic downturns. 
   Indeed, CPC's alternative budget: 
   Funds a second economic stimulus package designed to pump $118.9 billion into our declining economy and help the hardest hit low- and middle-income Americans; 
   Repeals the President's tax cuts for the top 1 percent of taxpayers; 
   Leaves no child behind by fully funding NCLB and IDEA while improving Teacher Corps and job training; 
   Provides Medicare for all with affordable, accessible quality health care for all Americans; 
   Renews the Social Contract and 21st Century Safety Net by substantially increasing funding for decent affordable housing, anti-  hunger programs, and more quality childcare; and foremost 
   Rebuilds America's communities that are being plagued by the aftermath of Katrina by substantially increasing funding for Community Development Block Grants, community policing, and priority cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks that threaten the drinking water of nearly half of all Americans. 
   Collectively, these provisions reflect a commitment to addressing socioeconomic woes affecting middle- to-lower class Americans across the country. I commend CPC for their pledge to cut the poverty rate in America in half during the next decade and for a progressive budget that appropriates funding to much needed programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, we come to the House floor to consider and pass what, in my opinion, is a vitally important piece of legislation designed to ensure the continual effectiveness of the U.S. Congress. H.R. 5683, the Government Accountability Act of 2008, will allow the Government Accountability Office to regain its footing as a premier government agency that both promotes its employees as the best and the brightest, as well as treats them as such. 
   On April 2, after a 2-year investigation and several subcommittee hearings, I introduced H.R. 5683, which would restore the 2006 and 2007 annual  across-the-board increase to GAO employees who met expectations but did not receive the adjustment. 
   In summary, the legislation sets a ``floor guarantee'' that would preserve GAO's performance-based compensation system, while ensuring that GAO employees receive an annual increase in their permanent pay, provided they meet expectations, that is at least equal to the congressionally approved across-the-board increase. The floor guarantee will be comprised of the annual adjustment to the GAO pay schedule plus the permanent merit pay increase received by an employee under GAO's merit pay system. 
   Other provisions in the bill include creating a statutory Inspector General for GAO, permitting the Comptroller General greater flexibility to administer oaths to witnesses when auditing and settling accounts, enabling the CG to expenditures for meals and other expenses in connection with recruitment, and eliminates the statutorily employed GS-15 pay cap to allow the Comptroller General the authority to pay employees up to the rate for Executive Level III. 
   After consideration by our colleagues in the Senate, H.R. 5683 returns to us in the House amended and, in some respects, strengthened by the inclusion of language requiring the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, or any other Federal agency that the GAO elects to audit, to reimburse the GAO for the cost of performing such audits during fiscal year 2007. The most recent iteration of the bill also makes sure that GAO would be reimbursed by an agency that asks to be audited and elects to pay for the audit. 
   While the bill represents a significant step forward, the subcommittee and many Members of the House still recognize that more work needs to be done at GAO. Nevertheless, H.R. 5683 will help improve the morale at GAO and remedy the inequities that resulted from the denial of the 2006 and 2007 across-the-board adjustments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will once again join GAO and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and support the passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from Missouri, in the consideration of H.R. 6169, which names a postal facility in Baldwin, Missouri, after a fallen hero, Specialist Peter J. Navarro. 
   Introduced on June 3, 2008, H.R. 6169 is sponsored by Congressman TODD AKIN, representative of Missouri's Second Congressional District, and co-sponsored by Missouri's entire congressional delegation and a total of eight Members of Congress. H.R. 6169 was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008 by a voice vote. 
   Upon graduating from Lafayette High School in Wildwood, Missouri, Specialist Peter J. Navarro was assigned to the Army's 2nd Battalion and served in that capacity as an outstanding member of his regiment. While conducting combat operations, an improvised explosion device was detonated near his Humvee, killing the 20-year-old. 
   His mother had asked him not to return to Iraq, but being the dedicated soldier that he was, Specialist Navarro returned because he believed in the mission. Described as a strong willed and caring young man, Specialist Peter J. Navarro served his country in Iraq with pride and distinction. In honor of this sacrifice, Mr. Speaker, let us also pay tribute to the life of Specialist Navarro and pass H.R. 6169 and designate the Manchester Road Post Office Building in Baldwin, Missouri, after this fine and outstanding American soldier. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration and support H.R. 6168, which names a postal facility in St. Charles, Missouri, after Lance Corporal Drew Weaver, a heroic marine and great American. 
   H.R. 6198 was introduced by a colleague, Representative Akin of Missouri, on June 3, 2008, and has been considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee. I should mention that the measure had the support of the entire congressional delegation from Missouri before the committee approved the bill by a voice vote on July 16, 2008. 
   Lance Corporal Drew Weaver was assigned to the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division I, Marine Expeditionary Force Twenty-Nine out of Palms, California, and was serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom during the time of his death. A true hero and American serviceman, Lance Corporal Weaver was well known not only for his service to his country, but also for his service to his local community of St. Charles, Missouri. 
   St. Charles, Missouri is proud of their hometown hero for the sacrifices he so nobly made, and those of us in the House of Representatives are as well. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, let us remember and pay tribute to the life and legacy of the courageous Lance Corporal Weaver and pass H.R. 6168 without objection.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I rise today to emphasize the need for standards and enforcement provisions that prevent and respond to allegations of child abuse and neglect at residential treatment facilities. These facilities include both public and private programs that serve teens with emotional, behavioral, and mental health problems; wilderness camps, boot camps, therapeutic boarding schools, and behavior modification facilities are all programs that serve this purpose. The Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act, H.R. 5876, would require accountability and transparency from these programs. I strongly support this bill, which would help protect these vulnerable teens entrusted to their care. 
   Residential programs are meant to provide help and support to teenagers. However, in October 2007, the Government Accountability Office found numerous allegations of abuse, some of which led to death, connected to these programs between 1990 and 2007. Accounts of physical and sexual abuse have been publicized, although with difficulty given that these programs are not accountable to a Federal agency or other entity. It is unacceptable for Government to facilitate this secrecy. Parents trust that residential facilities will keep their child safe and care for their children properly; however, it is often found that this is not the case. I am proud that we are taking steps to implement Federal guidelines for treatment and care for these vulnerable youth. 
   H.R. 5876 works to end this abuse by enforcing national standards that provide for the basic health and safety of children, along with disseminating information about programs that will help ensure compliance. The bill requires States to inform the Department of Health and Human Services of incidences of child abuse, neglect, and fatalities at covered programs; it also requires HHS to investigate any allegations and will be authorized to financially penalize programs for these offenses. A Web site will summarize information on programs and any problems they have had, including whether the problems occurred under the same management but different program names. In addition, there will be a toll-free hotline to report child abuse and neglect at covered programs. I encourage Congress to fully support H.R. 5876 and, in turn, support the teens that it has been created to protect. 
   Mr. MATHESON, Madam Chairman, during my 8 years representing Utah's Second District, I have always worked to protect children. The press reports of abuse, neglect, and tragic deaths in some residential therapy programs for youth are very concerning to me. Over the years, many treatment centers have been established across the Nation, including in my home State of Utah. As a result, Utah has worked hard to license and regulate residential treatment programs over the past several years and my State meets many of the standards set forth in the legislation before us. It is my understanding that some States have not developed stringent requirements and that leads to a patchwork of regulations where kids can fall through the cracks. 
   I'd like to thank Chairman Miller for working with me to include language in the manager's amendment requesting that HHS study  the outcomes of individuals in these types of programs through a longitudinal study. I feel this data is extremely useful to better understand the outcomes of individuals in these programs and the progress made towards the goals of the treatment programs to fully rehabilitate troubled youth and teens. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee for their leadership and efforts to establish a more standardized process for overseeing residential treatment centers for children. I believe a uniform set of standards makes sense, especially when it comes to meeting the needs of the most troubled children and their families. Those centers that service families well should not fear uniform standards because they will naturally comply. However, those who say the standards are burdensome fail to recognize that we all must perform at the highest possible standard to ensure the safety of all children. These measures seek to support good actors and encourage those who are not to become so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   First of all, I want to commend our leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, the gentlewoman from Detroit, Michigan, who engages us in such a way that we are able to do a number of different things as she provides opportunity for different individuals to display leadership. And so having Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones convene each Monday a Special Order, an hour, where the Congressional Black Caucus members come and discuss issues, I tell you it is a pleasure for me to be here with my Delta sister from Cleveland, Ohio, a distinguished jurist, having been a defense attorney, a judge, a prosecutor, legislator, who understands this issue from every angle, any way that you look at it. Individuals who are being defended, individuals who have gone into the system, having to pass judgment, in a sense, and having to bring charges. It is just a pleasure to be here and to commend you because you do this every week, every Monday night. I mean, I was struggling to get here because my plane had some difficulty, but I am so delighted that I made it. 
   And to have the opportunity to work with individuals like Representative Barbara Lee, listening to Barbara with all of the things that are going on in the Oakland community, the neighborhood, it almost makes you dizzy.     
   But the interesting thing about it is that you know that it's real because you get the opportunity to see it. I mean, just imagine that number of individuals that you all have helped clear their records so that they can get a job, so that they can go to work, so that they can have a chance. And to know that that's only one of the issues, because you're leading internationally in creating awareness about the AIDS pandemic, generating resources and money, bringing to the forefront health issues that people kind of forget about. 
   Barbara, it is just a pleasure and an honor to have the opportunity to serve in the same body with you at the same time and to be inspired and motivated by the work that you do and by the spirit that you have and the energy. I mean, Members of the caucus trying to keep up with you and Sheila Jackson-Lee, with your energy levels, I mean, it's almost impossible. You can't do it. And so, you know, you just do the best that you can and follow along and follow suit. Because it has been a combination of all this work that has raised this issue to the point where I'm holding in my hand 17 pages of paper that the Chicago Tribune did last week on this issue, beginning last Sunday with a front page story, and then following through Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And the first story was three pages. 
   You know, the Chicago Tribune is a big newspaper, and they highlighted the work of the North Lawndale Employment Network that has a project where they're teaching ex-offenders how to make honey and how to tend to bees. And they've actually developed a business. And these individuals are able now to actually go to work every day, earn a living. Some of them have already been able to max out of that program, go into other areas and get jobs, as people have seen what they do. And so, we are making progress. 
   But even so, the progress that we're making is awfully small compared to what is needed. And I thought it was just so important what you said about Booker Washington in terms of looking at where people have been and where they've come from. And so when we look at the history of this country and we recognize the travail, the difficulty that some population groups have had, that African Americans have experienced, and now we're trying to make sure that these individuals who have fallen off the path, who have succumbed in some ways to the difficulties of living in a tough environment, who are trying to find their way back, every day I come into contact with a story of somebody who is on the way up, on the way back, who found a way to get themselves a job. 
   I agree with all of my colleagues who have talked about this being National Bible Week. And I was thinking, as I listened, that we all get awards and we all get plaques and we all get things given to us. And the greatest thing that I have ever had given to me was something called the Gutenburg Award, which came from the Chicago Bible Society, which is a group of theologians and Bible scholars who analyze work. And on the basis of one's work and whether or not the work that they're doing is in keeping with the principles of the Bible, they give awards. 
   And so, when we talk about redemption and the need to redeem, there are more than 650,000 individuals who come out of jail and prison every year in the United States of America and they need to be redeemed. And so, if you want to be redeemed, you don't have to just go down by the Jordan Stream, you can go to some of the community programs that exist. You can help make sure that we provide resources so that those individuals who come home from jail and prison have some place to go, so that they have somebody to help them. Because if they get help, the chances of them recidivating are much less than if they don't. 
   The statistics show that 67 percent of the individuals who don't get help are more than likely going to do what we call ``re-offend'' within a 3-year period of time. More than 50 percent of them will be reincarcerated. But the recidivism rate goes down contingent upon the amount of help that they get. Some programs has it down as low as 18-20 percent. Well, that's just doing a great job. And I would hope that before the week is over, and we're expecting certainly before we adjourn, that the United States Congress is going to see the wisdom of reclaiming lives, of helping put people back on the employment rolls so that they can pay taxes. 
   You know, I would much rather help a person pay taxes. There is an old saying that if you give a man a fish, he can eat for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he can eat for a lifetime. And so, if we help the individuals learn how to re-enter and function, then they're going to help further develop our Nation. 
   So, I just thank you so much for your leadership and the great work that  you've done on this issue and how you tie in the Ways and Means functions with the needs of these individuals. And we talk about, you know, people can't get food stamps.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Well, there are so many barriers, when you sit and look at it, and you wonder, for example, the person who wants to go to college can't get a Pell Grant. And many of the individuals who are incarcerated are young individuals who got caught up maybe in a place where they were smoking cocaine or they may have gotten picked up and had some controlled substance on them. And now they're out of school, they can't get a Pell Grant. And fortunately, we're beginning to seriously look at that. And fortunately the Supreme Court is looking seriously at the sentencing disparities that have existed relative to the difference between the sentences that you get for a conviction of having crack cocaine versus powder cocaine. 
   And I think what we're really saying is that these issues have to be brought to the forefront, and that's why these Special Orders are so important. I've always been told that awareness brings about dissatisfaction, and that the more people learn about the way things are, the more dissatisfied they become. And then if you can take that dissatisfaction and organize it into some action, now you've got a chance for some movement. 
   And therefore, we want to thank all of those many groups who have been in support of the Second Chance Act, all of that coalition, The Working Group, individuals who work with criminal justice issues, individuals who work with drug courts, individuals who know that there is a better way and a different way, we just have to see that road. 
   And, you know, the Bible has just so many great experiences. You know, I remember the story of Paul, you know, Saul of Tarsus on his way to persecute the Christians, but something turned him around. He met something and somebody along the road. And from being a prosecutor, he became the greatest advocate for Christianity that we have known, other than Jesus the Christ himself. 
   And so, we hope that there are people who will change their opinions about what to do with individuals who have fallen off the path. And again, it's just a real pleasure to be here with you and to share this time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Let me do this before you do. I would like to have this document included in the Record, because I think they are such a great indication of how mass media is beginning to understand the issue and beginning to recognize it as a problem. And I would like to include in the Record this document from the Chicago Tribune.  
   The Beekeepers  
   The men opened the hive and bees swirled up into the sky like sparks from a fire. 
   Bees flew through the weedy yard and past the chain-link fence. They flew into the alley, where a woman braced herself against the hood of a police car. 
   Bees flew toward the gas station, where the calls of hustlers selling drugs sliced the air. And beyond where the men could see them, bees scattered into the vacant lots and back-yard gardens, parks and parking lots of Chicago's West Side, searching, as always, for nectar. 
   This sunny morning in September 2006 was warm, but a bite to the breeze signaled fall. A boy walked by, dressed in a white shirt and navy pants. School had opened today. It was time for a new start, time for what the people who work at the non-profit agency on this corner in East Garfield Park had decided to call Sweet Beginnings. 
   The three men standing at the hive were learning how to become beekeepers. None had any experience at this job or, for that matter, much significant work history at all. 
   Tony Smith, a pug of a man with a broad face, moved with the graceful, contained gestures of someone accustomed to negotiating small spaces. At 30, he had spent half his life in prison. 
   Hovering uneasily behind him was Shelby Gallion, a 22-year-old former drug dealer. In an oversized T-shirt and jeans that blurred the outlines of his body, his expression unreadable, Shelby looked a little out of focus, as if he might eventually drift out of sight. He lived in a halfway house, still on parole. 
   Gerald Whitehead, the oldest member of the trio at 49, had been released from jail just a week before, after being cleared of a heroin-possession charge, the most recent stumble in the struggle to turn his life around after decades of violence and addiction. Gerald seemed intimidating, with his heavy-lidded eyes and thrust-out chin, but when he smiled, his face cracked open wide and bright. 
   The three men and 17 hives in this yard were the makings of a small experiment, an attempt to address one of the most stubborn and destructive problems in Chicago and other cities around the country: what to do with the hundreds of thousands of people released each year from prison. 
   Over the last three decades, harsher penalties for drug crimes and stricter sentencing laws have helped fuel explosive growth in the nation's prison population and, inevitably, in the number of inmates returning to society. In Chicago alone, roughly 20,000 ex-offenders come home each year. 
   Most end up in neighborhoods like this one, where unemployment is high, opportunity scant and the temptation of drugs and crime rarely more than a corner away. They don't stay long. More than half the state's prisoners find themselves back behind bars within three years of their release. 
   Finding work can reduce someone's chances of returning to prison. Although getting a job with a criminal record is difficult, checking the conviction box on an application poses only one hurdle. Many former inmates face other problems, from poor education and little understanding of workplace rules to drug addiction or a lack of stable housing. And behaviors that help people thrive on the job--teamwork, communication--are often the opposite of those that ensure survival in prison. 
   For five years, the North Lawndale Employment Network, or NLEN, had helped ex-offenders find employment. With Sweet Beginnings, the agency decided to create its own jobs, in its own neighborhood, where people could learn how to work and build an employment history before they moved on. The idea attracted the attention of major philanthropies and companies, among them the MacArthur Foundation, Boeing Co. and Ben & Jerry's, each of which donated expertise or money to the effort. 
   Now, what may have once seemed like little more than a quirky venture--using former prisoners to produce honey in the ghetto--stood on the verge of transforming itself into a high-profile business. 
   Whether it would succeed depended in part upon the three men in the yard. The men measured success in starker terms. Failing, they feared, meant going back to the streets, going back to prison or getting killed. 
   During the coming year, through the bees' final foraging in fall, the threat of winter, promise of spring and richness of summer, the men and the enterprise of Sweet Beginnings would attempt nothing less than their own reinvention. 
   This morning's lesson was about survival. John Hansen, the beekeeper training the workers, showed them how to tilt the hives to get a sense of how much honey they contained. A heavy hive meant the bees had stored enough to make it through the winter. A lighter hive would need help. 
   The hives, with their unevenly stacked wooden boxes, called supers, looked like tipsy filing cabinets scattered among the clumps of goldenrod, Queen Anne's lace and clover. 
   The men moved among them, gently leaning each hive back and opening the lid to peer inside. 
   An elderly woman stopped at the fence. ``What ya'll got in there? Bees?'' she asked. 
   ``Yep,'' John answered, still bent over a hive. 
   ``Oh, Lord, think I better get back.'' 
   After a minute or two, Shelby disappeared inside the building. John continued to make his way around the yard, Gerald and Tony in tow. 
   ``Look at that,'' John cried out at Hive No. 2, lifting a frame thick with honey, each cell a stud of gold. At Hive No. 6, bees crowded the entrance, but the supers felt suspiciously light. 
   When they finished, John delivered his verdict. 
   ``I think,'' he said, ``we can bring them through the winter.''  ``To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,-- One clover, and a bee, And revery.''--Emily Dickinson  
   In this pocket of the West Side, the past may fade or burn or erode almost to dust, but it persists. It holds on. 
   Like the Star of David that adorns the front of the Independence Boulevard Seventh Day Adventist Church, a remnant from the time when Chicago's Jews lived and worshiped in the neighborhood. Or the cracked patches of concrete in the overgrown lot at 1550 S. Hamlin Ave., where Martin Luther King Jr. lived for a short time in a rundown apartment to protest the way Chicago's blacks were housed. 
   Or, in the conference room at the North Lawndale Employment Network, the blotch of greenish ink on Tony Smith's right forearm, visible as he took notes in a narrow,  slanting script. It had been a tattoo of a cobra until he removed what he could with lemon juice and a sewing needle. 
   The cobra is a symbol of the Mickey Cobras street gang, as is the ``MC'' inked on Tony's left shoulder. Police records say Tony belonged to this gang. He won't say much about that or anything else in his past. 
   What he will say is this: ``I was a naive, snotty-nosed street kid who didn't care about himself or other people.'' 
   His first arrest came at age 9, for disorderly conduct. By the time he turned 13 he had been convicted in an attempted murder and was, according to a police officer who knew him, one of the most violent and feared gang members in the Cabrini-Green public housing complex. He marked his 16th birthday awaiting trial for beating three men with a gun and torturing two of them with a heated ice-chopper. That crime earned Tony a 30-year prison sentence. 
   He emerged almost 15 years later, having never used a cell phone or filled out a job application. When he talked about what he wanted to see for the first time with his own eyes, he named--after Navy Pier and Millennium Park--a Jet Ski. 
   Across the conference table, Shelby idly twirled one of the braids near his ear. Shelby's past was his shoes. The butterscotch Timberland boots imprinted with tiny hexagons or the candy-bright Bathing Ape sneakers. New shoes, like his new watch and new cell phone, the leather ``Scarface'' cell phone case--all accessories of the lifestyle he said he wanted to leave behind. 
   He began selling drugs about the time he started high school, and by his senior year, the money and all it bought had easily trumped education. Then came two stints in prison and, during the second one, nights spent lying on his cot, wondering what would become of his two young daughters. 
   That was why he had come to Sweet Beginnings. But he still thought about the old life. It took him a week at the agency to earn what he could have made in a matter of hours on the street. 
   And Gerald, standing at the kitchen window, staring out at the hives? 
   Gerald's past was the hovel of a building across the alley, where he had snorted $10 bags of heroin. And his grandmother's house three blocks away, where he had stayed as a child and sexually assaulted a young woman as an adult. The bar around the corner where he once got shot on his birthday. His past was the man crossing the street he knew from Narcotics Anonymous and the cap-shadowed teenager who walked in the door of the North Lawndale Employment Network and addressed him as ``Brother Bone.'' 
   Gerald's past was everywhere. 
   His earliest memory was of being bitten by a dog. He bit the dog back. 
   Gerald wasn't sure whether he remembered this incident because it happened or remembered it because he was told it happened. It didn't matter. He became that story: the boy who would bite back. 
   He grew up with two older brothers and 10 younger sisters, a mother who worked as a live-in nurse and a father who was, as he put it, ``kind of missing in action.'' 
   Gerald struggled in school. He never learned how to read or write well. The other children made fun of him. By 6th grade, he had basically stopped going. 
   ``I started out making a career,'' he said. ``Whatever I could steal to make a hustle.'' 
   At the same time, he joined the Unknown Vice Lords. In the gang, he could force respect from all the people who had once belittled him. He moved up to become an ``elite,'' a top-ranking gang member and close associate of onetime Vice Lords kingpin Willie Lloyd. 
   From the age of 20, Gerald bounced in and out of prison, spending more time inside than out: armed robbery, home invasion, criminal sexual assault, burglary, aggravated battery, drug possession. 
   He was 43 before he decided he couldn't do the time anymore. He has his conversion story. One night in prison, he broke down. Was this all his life would ever be? Had God put him here for nothing more? He wanted to die. 
   Then, in his cell, he sensed the spirit of his late grandmother, who always gave him a meal when he was hungry and a bed when he was homeless, and he felt at peace. 
   He could try to change. 
   It proved difficult. He lost a job working in maintenance at a nursing home after a background check revealed his criminal record, he said. There was an arrest for domestic battery. He was using drugs too, crack and then heroin. He became a dope fiend, a hype. 
   That went on for years, until his mother persuaded him to check into a residential drug treatment program, where he stayed for five months. Not long after he got out, in the spring of 2006, he stopped by the fence at NLEN on his way to sell loose cigarettes at the gas station nearby. He knew the agency; the month before, he had gone through its four-week job-training program for ex-offenders. 
   A couple of men were setting up hives. Gerald asked if he could watch. Then he asked if he could help. He stepped into the yard and began handling the hives, as though, one of the men observed, he had been beekeeping all his life. 
   At first, Gerald worked for free. He did whatever needed to be done: fixing the lawn mower, pulling weeds, picking up the trash that blew in from the alley. It was somewhere to go every day. Soon, the agency began to pay him, $7.25 an hour. 
   Every day was a fight. Stay straight, go to work. Failing would be as easy as stumbling off the curb into the street. 
   ``It's a wrassle trying to do good,'' Gerald said one afternoon. ``You always got evil whispering in your ear.'' 
   He felt comfortable around the bees. He liked them. If you didn't know bees, he thought, they might scare you. But once you knew them, you came to respect them. 
   Gerald understood bees. 
   Finding sweetness 
   The building that housed the North Lawndale Employment Network, near the corner of West Flournoy Street and South Independence Boulevard, had once been a duplex and still felt like someone's home. 
   Walk in and you might find a worker bouncing a toddler on her knee while she interviewed the child's mother or an old woman grumbling about delays on the Pulaski bus. 
   Most days, the center hummed with people who came for one of the agency's job-training programs, a computer class or to get help writing a resume. Amid the bustle, the Sweet Beginnings employees set up beekeeping class at whatever table happened to be free and began to learn about bees. 
   They learned there are three types of honeybees: the worker bee, which is female; the drone, which is male; and the queen bee, which mates with the drones and lays the colony's eggs. 
   They learned that a worker bee lives for about six weeks. They learned that it takes the nectar from 5 million flowers to make 1 pint of honey. They learned that pollen mixed with nectar is called bee bread. 
   During these lessons, Tony took notes on a yellow legal pad. Gerald tilted his chair back or leaned forward, head propped on his arms, always restless. Shelby occasionally cleaned his nails with a public transit card. 
   Their teacher, John Hansen, was 76 and white and jangled the change in his pocket. He had begun keeping bees 31 years before, after he saw a sign someone had posted on a bulletin board at the suburban publishing company where he worked, offering to sell two hives. He went on to become president of the Illinois State Beekeepers Association, and in his retirement, he still kept bees, sold honey and ran a small business managing hives and removing bees from people's homes. 
   Of everything John taught the men about bees, they found nothing as interesting or amusing as what they learned about drones. 
   When drones hatch, the worker bees help them out of their brood cells while the worker bees must emerge on their own. Drones that mate with the queen on what is euphemistically called the ``nuptial flight'' die because the act rips their sexual organs from their bodies. When winter approaches, worker bees drive the drones from the hive, to certain death. 
   One morning, Tony walked in with his heavily underlined copy of ``Beekeeping in the Midwest,'' the book they were assigned to read. 
   ``It said male drones are like human males,'' Tony told John. ``They don't do no work. I kid you not, that's what they said.'' The book doesn't compare men and bees; that was Tony's analysis. 
   In the beginning, the men's hands-on instruction mostly involved learning how to care for the hives and prepare them for winter. While they worked, they used a smoker, a metal can with attached bellows, to blow smoke into the hives to distract the bees. The smoke causes the bees to act as though their hive is on fire, and they eat honey to fortify themselves to flee, ignoring intruders. 
   Honey bees usually sting only if they feel threatened. Tony had never been stung, so John plucked a bee from a hive and stung him with it to make sure he wasn't allergic to the venom. Gerald hardly seemed to notice stings or care beyond issuing the occasional epithet. Shelby seemed the most leery, often hanging back while the others worked. But when Tony asked if the bees scared him, Shelby denied it. 
   In the early fall, the men learned how to extract honey, to harvest it from the frames where bees build the combs. 
   Because the Sweet Beginnings hives didn't contain enough honey to spare, John brought in eight frames from his own apiary. The frames, stacked in the kitchen of the resource center, looked a little like wood-frame screens, except that, instead of wire grids, the panels held hundreds of hexagons filled with honey. 
   As the men crowded around a large metal tank, a lone bee banged against the kitchen window. 
   ``Do we have to actually do it?'' Tony asked. 
   ``Yeah, you guys are going to do it,'' John replied. 
   To extract honey, a beekeeper uses a knife to cut open the wax caps that seal the individual cells of honey in the frame. Then, the frames are placed in an extractor, which spins them to release the honey. The honey drips down the walls of the extractor and exits through a tap. 
   Slowly and delicately, Shelby slid the knife against the frame. Wax curled off in strips. A slight scent, sweet and floral, filled the kitchen. 
   ``Just swipe it,'' Tony advised. 
   ``Let it ride even and flat,'' Gerald said. 
   ``You're doing fine,'' John said. ``Just watch your fingers.'' 
   Tony and Gerald each took a turn. The knife, as it drew across the wax, made the  thick, wet smack of a cartoon kiss. Sunlight warmed the honey in the frames to the color of amber, glowing against the black shadow of the blade. 
   ``That honey look good, don't it?'' Tony asked. 
   As the extractor spun, the air began to smell sweeter and sweeter. Thin streams ran down the inside of the tank. Minutes passed. A nickel-sized dollop of honey pooled on the filter atop the white bucket under the tap. 
   ``There's the first drop,'' John said. 
   While the extractor whirred, the men went outside to check on the bees. Brenda Palms Barber, the exuberant black woman who served as the North Lawndale Employment Network's chief executive officer, joined them. 
   ``I want to see how the babies are doing,'' she called out, standing at the hives, perfectly at ease in her gray suit while the others wore jackets with netted hoods. 
   More than two years before, Brenda had come up with the idea for Sweet Beginnings when she decided that the employment network needed to do more than help people find jobs; it needed to create them. 
   She considered a landscaping business or delivery service but worried that customers might be reluctant to allow ex-offenders in their homes. A friend suggested a honey co-op. 
   Brenda knew nothing about honey, but the idea intrigued her. She liked it even better when she learned that some people consider urban honey more flavorful than its rural counterpart because the bees can gather nectar from more varied flowers within a shorter distance. Imagine creating sweetness out of the asphalt and hardship of the West Side. 
   The agency launched Sweet Beginnings in the spring of 2004 with a grant from the Illinois Department of Corrections. Two years later, after parting ways with the original group of beekeepers working with the agency, the program started over with fresh bees and a new idea. 
   The bees came from Wisconsin, picked up and delivered by NLEN's chief operating officer, who had to roll down the windows of his Jeep Cherokee on the way back because the 30,000 bees generated so much heat and noise. 
   The new idea came from a business plan created by volunteers at Boeing, the chairwoman of the board of Ben & Jerry's and others. It called for Sweet Beginnings to shift its focus from selling honey to selling honey-based products such as lotion and lip balm. They hoped the move would increase profits and, with the expansion into manufacturing, packaging and marketing, the job prospects of its workers. 
   When Brenda and the beekeepers returned to the kitchen, about 4 inches of honey stood in the 5-gallon bucket. 
   She passed out plastic spoons and everyone dipped in to taste. 
   ``Yum,'' she said. ``It's really, really good.'' 
   She continued to talk, in a stream of words as smooth and unbroken as the honey pouring into the bucket. She talked about biscuits and business competition and hosting a honey cook-off and social purpose and making lip balm. 
   When she was almost done, she said, ``That's some of the stuff we're thinking.'' Then she paused and said something else, slowly, as if the idea had just struck her. 
   ``Our demographic,'' she said, ``is the opposite of the people working on it.''  
   ``There is a Thief Amongst Us!'' the signs announced. 
   ``IS IT YOU!'' 
   One sign was posted above the sink in the kitchen of the resource center. Another was taped to the bathroom door. More hung on the walls next to inspirational quotes from Eleanor Roosevelt and Gail Sheehy. 
   The signs went up in late September, after someone stole the agency's digital camera from a cabinet in the downstairs conference room. It was only the second theft in the two years since NLEN had moved into the building, and it hurt. 
   The agency prided itself on being the kind of place where visitors wandered back to the kitchen to help themselves to coffee and bought candy for school fundraisers by dropping a dollar on a desktop. 
   No doors barred the offices; no cameras peered down from the ceilings. The clients who came here already felt as though the world treated them like criminals; the people who helped them didn't want to do the same. 
   That trust disappeared with the discovery of a dented cabinet door. 
   Brenda felt betrayed. She didn't like thieves. She could find a job for a murderer before she could find one for a thief. Stealing was a crime of opportunity, and every time a thief saw something to steal, he had to decide not to steal it. 
   If the signs shouted the crime, other conversations in the building occurred in whispers. 
   Who would know the camera was kept in the basement conference room, in the cabinet with the VCR? The beekeepers, who watched videos for their classes. And Gerald? Well, he had been an addict, and everyone knows that hypes steal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, listening to my colleague from New York, Representative Clarke, it reinforced for me how important it is to deal seriously with the whole question of subprime lending and how vast foreclosures are all across the Nation. 
   I, like others, have been working with the coalition in my community, and many of them have come up with excellent ideas about what to do. But rather than just massaging the problem, than coming up with solutions, one solution that was put on the table the other day that I liked was the idea that rather than foreclosing on individuals who cannot pay the mortgages, why not rent the property to them and let them continue to live in it paying rent? Who knows, the time may very well come when they can go back to paying the mortgage. 
   Their lives never would have been disrupted. Plus we're finding that foreclosed properties oftentimes end up being lose-lose situations; that is, it's a loss for the lender as well as a loss for the homeowner, because in many neighborhoods, once a foreclosure occurs and people move out, the houses are boarded up, and of course, vandals prey upon them, destroy everything that was in it. 
   And so I simply wanted to appreciate all of those individuals who are part of the coalition of community groups and organizations with whom I've been working. And I join with others across the Nation to say to our government that we must correct the subprime lending process. But we also must do something that will aid those individuals who find themselves in tough situations right now. 
   So I join with Representative Clarke.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6576, the Reducing Information Control Designations Act, limits the Federal Government's use of information control designations. 
   Investigations by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform have found that Federal agencies have increasingly placed restrictions on unclassified information by using information control designations such as ``sensitive but unclassified.'' These designations are dangerous because they impede information-sharing with State and local governments and the public. 
   There is no statutory authority for agency use of information control designations. Thus, these designations are not used consistently and are often overused and confusing. In May, the White House issued a memorandum to address this issue. That memo did not go far enough. While it addressed the number of designations, it did not try to limit their use. 
   This bill further seeks to limit the use of these designations to improve information-sharing within the government and with the public. 
   I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 6437, which names the postal facility in Odessa, Texas, after a fallen hero, Corporal Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson. 
   Our colleague, Representative MIKE CONAWAY of Texas's 11th Congressional District, introduced H.R. 6437 on July 8. The bill is cosponsored by the entire Texas congressional delegation. H.R. 6437 was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, by a voice vote. 
   Born in 1948 in Olney, Illinois, Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson moved to Odessa, Texas, with his family in 1950. After graduating from Odessa Senior High School in 1967, he enlisted with the United States Marine Corps Reserve. In 1968, Mr. Wilson joined the regular Marine Corps, where he went through recruit training and obtained the rank of Private First Class. After his training was completed, he was deployed to the Republic of Vietnam in July, 1968, and his assigned duty was a rifleman. 
   On March 3, 1969, while serving with M Company, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, Private First Class Wilson heroically and unhesitatingly threw himself onto an enemy grenade, absorbing the full force of the explosion and saving his fellow marines. It was for this conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty that Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on April 20, 1970. 
   Corporal Wilson was extraordinarily dedicated to this Nation, earning numerous other accolades, including the  Purple Heart with a Gold Star, the Marine Corps Combat Action Ribbon, and the Presidential Unit Citation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6073 would require the Office of Personnel Management to allow Federal employees to receive electronic pay stubs. Most Federal employees receive their pay electronically, which is faster and less costly than using paper checks. This bill helps extend that cost savings to the rest of the payroll process. 
   More than a decade ago, Congress passed a law requiring that almost all Federal employees be paid by electronic funds transfer, commonly known as direct deposit. Electronic funds transfer is more secure and costs less than printing and distributing paper checks. Employees also have access to their funds sooner, because they do not have to deposit or cash their checks. However, many Federal agencies still print and distribute paper pay stubs for their employees, limiting the gains in efficiency from using electronic funds transfer. 
   This bill will encourage agencies to handle their entire payroll process electronically. The Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget have no objections to this bill. It's a commonsense measure that will help make payroll faster and more efficient, and I want to commend and thank Representative Foxx for introducing it. I appreciate her work in helping us get this bill to the floor and all of her work on the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 264, the Congressional Lawmaking Authority Protection Act of 2007 and the National Correctional Officers and Employees Week. 
   Correctional officers are the largest part of the workforce in jails and prisons, and they enforce the regulations governing the operation of correctional institutions as both supervisors and counselors. 
   While they have no law enforcement responsibilities outside the institution where they work, each day they put themselves in harm's way, maintaining security and inmate accountability to prevent disturbances, assaults, and escapes. 
   By definition, working in a correctional institution can be stressful and hazardous. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of attacks on correctional officers in State and Federal prisons jumped by nearly one-third, from 10,731 to 14,165, at a time when the number of correctional officers increased by only 14 percent. Except for police officers, the number of workplace nonfatal violent incidents is higher per 1,000 employees for correctional officers than any other profession. From 1992 to 1996, there were nearly 218 incidents for every 1,000 correctional officers, for a total of 58,300.     
   Correctional officers' roles in our society are and continue to be critical. We must continue to recognize the sacrifices they and their families make on a daily basis to ensure the safety and well-being of the prison population. 
   Mr. Speaker, I spend a fair amount of time in and around correctional institutions. As a matter of fact, I serve as a member of the local school council at the Consuelo York Alternative High School in Chicago, which is located in the Cook County Jail. Therefore, whenever I'm there, when we have our regular meetings, I attend. 
   I also go to jails sometimes to put up bail for individuals that I know, Representative Scott, who have been arrested. Quite frequently, I speak at jails, correctional facilities and prisons. 
   And so I simply wanted to take this time to thank all of those individuals who not only work in these stressful situations, but the many men and women with whom I come into contact as they facilitate my entree, and as they assist whatever it is that I've been trying to do and that I try to do while I'm there. 
   So I simply say, thank you to all of those corrections officers with whom I come into contact on an annual basis, and urge passage of this resolution.

The squad leader was killed, and Staff Sergeant Young assumed command and repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to help his men. Despite orders to pull back, he remained behind to assist several of his men who were unable to withdraw. With critical injuries to his body, he continued to fight to cover the withdrawal of his troops. The enemy engulfed his position, and he was killed.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (HONORING THE LIFE, LEGACY AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LAMAR HUNT -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 53, which honors the life of Lamar Hunt and his outstanding contributions to the Kansas City Chiefs, the National Football League and the United States of America.     
   H. Res. 53, which has 52 cosponsors, was introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) on January 11, 2007. H. Res. 53 was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, as already has been indicated, America lost a great sportsman and businessman when the Kansas City Chiefs football team owner, Mr. Lamar Hunt, passed away on December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 74.  
   Mr. William Sullivan, the late Patriots football team owner, said, ``Before there was a player, coach or a general manager in the league, there was Lamar Hunt. Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity of the league. Without him, there would have been no American Football League.'' 
   In the 1950s, Mr. Hunt on several occasions approached the National Football League to buy a franchise for his hometown of Dallas, Texas, but he was repeatedly denied. Frustrated by this, he decided to organize a rival pro football circuit, the American Football League, in 1960. Mr. Hunt was the owner of the Dallas Texans, one of the eight original teams that formed the AFL. Mr. Hunt's Dallas Texans won the championship in 1962. Soon after, he moved the team to Kansas City in 1963. He renamed them the Kansas City Chiefs. The team won the AFL championship in 1966, and the Super Bowl IV title in 1969. 
   I want to commend my colleague Mr. Cleaver not only for introduction of this legislation, but his passionate indication of what the life of Lamar Hunt was, for his personal experiences and contributions not only to the game of football, but to the game of life. 
   Listening to Representative Cleaver it becomes clear that not only was Mr. Hunt a giant of a football man, but he was a giant of a humanitarian, a giant of a man who could take ideas and convey those in such a way that others would buy into them, while at the same time continuing to live out the thoughts that Kipling had: If you can talk with kings and queens and not lose the common touch; if all men count with you, but none too much; and if you can fill the unforgiving moment with 60 seconds' worth of distance run, yours will be the world and all that is in it. And what is more, you will be a man, my son. 
   Lamar Hunt was indeed a giant of a man. I urge passage of this legislation.

   H.R. 2077 was introduced by Representative Jean Schmidt on April 30, 2007, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   This measure, which has been cosponsored by 16 Members, has the support of the entire Ohio congressional delegation. 
   George Lewis began his career in public service with the Federal Government on February 1, 1946, when he enlisted in the United States Navy. After his discharge from the Navy, George returned from Adams County to work on the family cattle farm until September 1, 1950, when he was drafted by the Army and sent to Korea. He rose in the ranks quickly, earning the rank of tank sergeant. He was honorably discharged from the Army on June 12, 1952. 
   George was hired as the Blue Creek Postmaster on November 5, 1955, where he served ably until his retirement on September 27, 1992. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Jean Schmidt from Ohio, for introducing this legislation, and I urge its passage.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H.R. 1722, which names the postal facility in Boca Raton, Florida, after Leonard W. Herman. 
   H.R. 1722, which was introduced by Representative Robert Wexler on March 27, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 24 Members, has the support of the entire Florida congressional delegation. 
   Mr. Leonard Herman was a bombardier in the United States Army, and he flew numerous missions over Germany during World War II. He displayed heroic actions and earned high honors and several distinguished medals for his bravery. 
   Perhaps one of Mr. Herman's greatest achievements was his contribution in seeking to save the lives of thousands of ``survivors'' of German concentration camps who were dying because of the lack of adequate food, clothing and medical supplies. According to accounts by Professor Robert L. Hilliard, ``Leonard Herman took it upon himself to advise and seek help from many of our government leaders regarding the plight of the survivors. His efforts were instrumental in President Truman's learning about displaced persons' situations in the U.S.-occupied Germany. The President changed U.S. policy and issued orders to provide the assistance and materials needed by the Holocaust survivors. Lieutenant Herman played an important role in saving thousands of these lives.'' 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Robert Wexler from Florida, for introducing this legislation, and I urge swift passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Staff Sergeant Omer T., better known as ``O.T.,'' Hawkins, died on Thursday, October 14, 2004, in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb. He was assigned to the 44th Engineer Battalion based in Camp Howze, Korea. His Army colleagues have described him as ``a tremendous warrior coupled with compassion'' and said that ``his skill as a superb non-commissioned officer who could influence any soldier defined his life and the principles he defended.'' 
   Staff Sergeant Hawkins graduated from North Adams High School on a Friday in 1991, and that following Monday he enlisted in the Army. Miss Cherry Frederick, his sister, said, and I quote, ``The only thing that he ever wanted to do was go into the military.'' Family and friends will forever remember Staff Sergeant Hawkins' dedication and service to his country.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I enthusiastically rise today in support of H.R. 1343, The Health Centers Renewal Act of 2007. For over 40 years, community health centers have provided cost-effective, high-quality health care to poor and medically underserved people in the States, the District of Columbia, and the territories, including the working poor, the uninsured, and many high-risk and vulnerable populations. Community  Health Centers nationwide provide care to 1 of every 8 uninsured Americans, 1 of every 4 Americans in poverty, and 1 of every 9 rural Americans. 
   As a former president of the National Community Heath Centers organization, I am honored to advocate for the expansion of this tremendously vital segment of our comprehensive healthcare system. By incorporating both H.R. 5544--The Patients and Public Health Partnership Act of 2008 and H.R. 870, which amends the Public Health Service Act to provide liability protections for practitioners of health centers who provide health services in emergency areas into this legislation; H.R. 1343 is now expanded to increase both insured coverage and access to critical resources for these invaluable medical professionals. This legislation empowers community health practitioners to serve on a larger scale and make an even greater positive impact particularly at a time when our health care delivery systems across the board are overburdened. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1343.

   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to  join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 148, a bill that recognizes the significance of National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. 
   H. Res. 148, which has 53 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative BARBARA LEE of California on May 14, 2007. H. Con. Res. 148 was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   National Caribbean-American Heritage Month was established to recognize the historical relationship between people of the Caribbean and the United States of America. Caribbean Americans present a rich diversity of countries, cultures and colloquialisms which are dispersed throughout communities in the United States. Caribbean immigration to the United States reached its peak in the last 5 years, with approximately 6 percent of the more than 7 million immigrants coming from the Caribbean. 
   Since the founding of the United States, Caribbeans have had a significant role in shaping the conscience of America and are among our great leaders, entrepreneurs and entertainers, including such individuals as Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Colin Powell, James Weldon Johnson, Shirley Chisholm, Marion Jones, Juan Carlos Finlay, Oscar de la Renta, Malcolm X, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, the founder of Chicago, Marcus Garvey, and many others.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to commend my colleague, Representative Cohen, for introducing this resolution that talks about the impact of Stax Records. Although I am not from Memphis, but Memphis is essentially a part of the Delta, and I grew up in the Mississippi Delta, but in the State of Arkansas. So Memphis was always a part of where we were. 
   Then, of course, Chicago was the beneficiary of a great migration of African Americans who migrated from Mississippi, from Memphis, Memphis being the largest town in the area. Individuals would oftentimes leave their rural communities and first get to Memphis. Then after they got to Memphis and stayed for 2, 3 years, they would make their way to Saint Louis, or they would make their way to Chicago. 
   So we have a great affinity for the City of Memphis. It's almost like being home. 
   But also Stax knew where to find talent, and so they came to Chicago and found people like the Staple Singers, whose friends and associates took them out of the church and put them on a stage and a platform far beyond what they otherwise would have been able to do. 
   In addition to its music, Stax was also always seriously engaged and involved in what we called, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the Civil Rights Movement, relative to putting on concerts to benefit events, activities, raise money for marches, demonstrations. So they were more than just purveyors of music. They were purveyors of music, but they were also part of the liberation movement, part of what those of us who grew up during the 1960s and 1970s call ``the era of struggle.'' 
   So, again, I simply want to commend my colleague, and, of course, one of the Staple Singers, a young lady named Cynthia, used to actually work in the same organization that I worked in, and she was a member of the Staples family. The rest of the group, Pervis and Mavis and Pops, they were part of our community. 
   So I commend Stax. I also commend my colleague from Tennessee for taking the time to honor their tremendous contributions.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 142nd anniversary of Juneteenth Independence Day. On June 19, 1865, MG Gordon Granger and Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with the news of the Emancipation Proclamation and the end of the Civil War. News of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, did not reach the frontier areas of the United States, especially the Southwest, for almost 2 1/2 years. General Granger's General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, is recognized as the day that all slaves in the United States were finally freed. 
   Juneteenth has become recognized as a State, regional, and national event that honors the freeing of slaves in the United States. As Americans, we must never forget how precious freedom is. Juneteenth is the day that all Americans of all races, creeds and ethnic backgrounds can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the United States. Its historical significance should be regarded as a means of understanding the past and more effectively facing the challenges of the future. 
   As the sponsor of H. Con. Res. 155, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation and urge President Bush to issue a proclamation observing Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Unlike most kinds of debt, student loans of all types are currently nondischargeable in bankruptcy, except on a judicial finding of undue hardship. Under this amendment, government student loans, Federal and State, and loans made directly by nonprofit entities would remain nondischargeable. Other student loans made by for-profit banks and other lenders would continue to be nondischargeable for the first 5 years after they come due, but after that, they would be treated like other unsecured consumer loans in bankruptcy.     
   This amendment also closes the loophole that lenders were beginning to pursue just before the 2005 changes went into effect. Currently, loans that are funded in whole or in part by a nonprofit institution are nondischargeable. Lenders offering private student loans were setting up affiliations with nonprofit institutions in order to take advantage of this loophole, even though the nonprofit was not the source of funding. 
   The current law is unfair to students. Students who take out student loans are trying to better themselves and contribute to the advancement of our economy. Unlike Federal student loans, private loans lack basic consumer protections, such as limits on  interest rates, loan limits, and flexible payments; yet the bankruptcy law treats student loan borrowers who face financial tragedy in the same severe manner as people trying to escape child support payments, alimony, overdue taxes, and criminal fines. People should not be punished for trying to get an education.

   For many of these students who secure loans without the protection of bankruptcy, it's like receiving a life sentence with no appeal. That is to say, they get a loan that is supposed to help them get a college degree, an education so that they can pay the loan off. Unfortunately, many of them are stuck on $70,000, $80,000, $90,000, $100,000 that they're never able to pay. And so they struggle along for the rest of their lives trying to pay off a loan that was supposed to have secured for them a level of financial ability. 
   I would urge that we pass this amendment to give those hundreds and thousands of students throughout the country the simple protection of bankruptcy that is provided for individuals with any other consumer loan. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The Davis-Kirk amendment will strike the new sugar provisions which will drive up the price of domestic sugar, therefore making it more difficult to candy makers, food processors, and confectionery businesses to survive. This new bill raises the sugar price supports, restricts sugar imports, and instructs the Secretary to buy surplus sugar for use in making ethanol. 
   Since 1997, the sugar subsidies have cost the U.S. economy a loss of 70,000 jobs. The Davis-Kirk amendment will make sure that the sugar program does not cost any more jobs than what we have already lost. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I have here in my hand a circular from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that says this amendment, while not the administration's proposal, provides more flexibility to manage the program in a way that minimizes costs to the U.S. taxpayer than the committee's bill.  
   In addition, the 1 cent penalty on forfeitures will help discourage forfeitures of sugar placed under loan. This amendment also eliminates the increase in the sugar loan rate, helping to reduce cost for taxpayers. 
   Let's give our taxpayers a break. Support the Davis-Kirk amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF DISABILITY PRIDE DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1355, which designates July 26, 2008, as Disability Pride Day and recognizes that all people, including those living with disabilities, have the right, responsibility and ability to be active, contributing members of our society, and fully engaged as citizens. 
   Over 54 million Americans have one or more disabilities. That translates into approximately one in five Americans who have a disability. The number of individuals with disabilities continues to increase with advances in medicine and technology, as well as with our aging population. 
   People with disabilities represent the Nation's largest minority. There are many famous and influential Americans with disabilities. Our 32nd President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; actors Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox; scientist Albert Einstein; and disability rights activists such as Justin Dart and Chicago's own Marca Bristo, to name just a few. Disability Pride Day acknowledges the contributions of all Americans with disabilities. 
   To make this great nation's promise of equality and freedom a reality for people with disabilities, Congress has protected the civil rights of individuals with disabilities through landmark Federal legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   Eighteen years ago this week, on July 26, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, education, government services, public accommodations, telecommunications and transportation.  
   The ADA has fundamentally changed the landscape of this country, providing equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities and improving access to all aspects of life in our communities. 
   Despite these efforts, we still have a long way to go. According to a national survey in 2004, people with disabilities live in poverty at a rate three times the national average. Also, people with disabilities are twice as likely to struggle with inadequate transportation, and only 35 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities are employed full or part time. 
   In the face of these challenges, celebrating Disability Pride Day reminds us that disability is not an abnormal, flawed condition, but, rather, as stated in the Developmental Disabilities Act, that ``disability is a natural and normal part of the human experience.'' Human diversity should be embraced and encouraged, as it represents one of the core values of an empowered nation. 
   H. Res. 1355 promotes this belief in human diversity, acknowledging that all people, including those with disabilities, should be guaranteed the right to receive a quality education, to be productive members of our workforce, to raise families, to exert control and choice over their own lives, and to have equal opportunity to access and participate in all facets of life. 
   This resolution invites the Nation to join in celebrating the pride, the power and the potential of people with disabilities by celebrating Disability Pride Day, and it urges all public officials and the general public to honor Americans with disabilities by educating ourselves on ways to support and encourage understanding of persons with disabilities. 
   Finally, H. Res. 1355 commends the organizers of the City of Chicago's Fifth Annual Disability Pride Parade for their work on the disability pride activities planned for July 26, 2008, and their efforts to raise disability awareness. 
   I once again express my support for H. Res. 1355, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF KATHERINE DUNHAM -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of Katherine Dunham. 
   Born in Chicago in 1909, Katherine Dunham grew into a superbly talented dancer, choreographer, author and activist. She earned her bachelor's degree in social anthropology from the University of Chicago and went on to do extensive graduate field work in the Caribbean, eventually completing her master's degree in that discipline as well. 
   One of her most profound contributions was her work around the confluence of dance and anthropology. Miss Dunham believed that dance was an important vehicle for understanding another culture, and she is the author of many anthropological works and dance. 
   Through her visits to the Caribbean, she not only documented the African influence on the dances of the West Indies, but as an artist, she also began to develop a new type of African American dance based on rituals and other cultural events. 
   When Katherine returned from her travels and field work, she founded Les Ballet Negres, one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. Here she perfected the Dunham technique of dance, including new breathing and movement exercises. Some of Miss Dunham's methods are taught in dance schools today, and she was an influential figure for many years. Alvin Ailey, who we honored with a resolution last week, is one of a long list of contemporary choreographers that name Katherine Dunham as a role model. 
   For two decades, the Katherine Dunham Dance Company toured nearly 60 countries on six continents, performing from Broadway to the silver screen. Established in the 1940s, her company had to battle racial discrimination. The company refused to perform at segregated theaters, and Katherine used her status as a public figure to draw attention to inequity. 
   Her dedication did not stop there. In 1967, Miss Dunham moved to East St. Louis, Illinois and established the Performing Arts Training Center. In an attempt to counteract the poor and violent society many of the children of East St. Louis faced on a daily basis, Miss Dunham and her staff empowered their students by teaching them dance, woodcarving, photography, anthropology, and various foreign languages. Miss Dunham once described this outlet for self-expression and development by stating that ``everyone needs, if not a cultural hero, a culturally heroic society. There is nothing stronger in a man than the need to grow.'' 
   In 2006, at the age of 96, Miss Katherine Dunham passed away, but her legacy lives on. Her countless awards pay tribute to her artistry and dedication to social justice. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, once again, I honor Katherine Dunham and encourage my colleagues to pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it's amazing how we are always learning. I had always thought that Katherine Dunham was born in East St. Louis and that that might have been the reason that she moved her school and troupe to East St. Louis, a city that was seriously hurting because of the diversion of business and trade opportunities that ultimately went around the town as opposed to through the town. And I'm amazed to know that, no, she didn't have that kind of history with East St. Louis, but because of her tremendous desire to be relevant and to be helpful to those who could perhaps benefit the most from her talent and dedication, she moved to East St. Louis. And I'm very proud that we have on the floor this resolution honoring her life and legacy. I would urge its passage.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1296 which designates September as ``National Child Awareness Month.'' 
   As the resolution points out, September marks the start of the new school year, which is a time when we should all focus our attention on the academic, social and economic well-being of our Nation's children. 
   The children's charities and youth-serving organizations in our communities are important partners in this effort. In many instances, these organizations provide basic access to health care, social services, and other critical needs. They serve as mentors, friends and coaches, and sometimes the volunteers for these organizations are the only family a child may have. 
   Organizations such as the YMCA, the YWCA, the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Big Brothers Big Sisters, and the Children's Defense Fund, to name a few, have provided numerous volunteer hours and volunteers, educational assistance and after-school programming for children across the country, filling a critical gap in the afternoon hours when children are most at risk. 
   And so, not only do we want to promote awareness, but I want to thank all of these volunteers, all of these individuals who spend so much of their time, energy and effort working with children so that they provide to communities and families, as well as to the millions of other people who need the work that is done each and every day.     
   And so, Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for H. Res. 1296 and urge that my colleagues support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1286, which recognizes the contributions of African American artwork to the United States. African Americans use dance, music, visual arts, theater and variations of these art forms to express their cultural heritage and personal identity. The annual National Black Arts Festival based in Atlanta, Georgia, celebrates the artistic contributions of people of African descent to the rest of the world. 
   After a study in 1987 commissioned by the Fulton County Arts Council, the local agency unveiled a need to commemorate the artistic accomplishments of the African diaspora. In 1988, the first National Black Arts Festival took place in Atlanta, Georgia. 
   Today the festival lasts 10 days and includes major events like the Pan African Film Festival, which is the Nation's largest event dedicated to showing black films. It will also include a dance tribute to Judith Jamison, Oprah Winfrey's presentation of ``The Color Purple,'' creative conversations with Cornell West and Alice Walker and a jubilant musical evening with Gladys Knight. The festival is full of performances, speaker series, visual arts and a number of student and family programs. 
   NBAF has evolved into a year-round cultural institution dedicated to serving artists, audiences, teachers and students by providing opportunities for artistic and creative expression and sponsoring an educational and humanities program. Every year there is a summer institute, an African American history elementary quiz bowl, and a children's education village for the youth to learn about African American history. 
   Black artists have influenced history, education and culture, and African Americans continue to make instrumental contributions to all facets of art. Within their organization, NBAF organizes pieces of black art to educate and entertain fans of African American talent. NBAF helps educate the Nation about components of black culture by hosting such an extensive program in Atlanta. We therefore recognize the contribution of the organization as well as acknowledge the number of black artists affecting our Nation. 
   Once again I express my support for the National Black Arts Festival and urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 663, a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day.     
   H. Res. 663, which has 57 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative John Kline on September 19, 2007. H. Res. 663 was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on September 20, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1899, veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection were upset by the poor treatment they received following their return from America's first major overseas conflict. As a result, the American Veterans of Foreign Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines were established to advocate for the rights and benefits then denied to veterans of foreign conflicts. 
   In 1914, these veteran organizations, recognizing their common goals and the importance of unity, merged to form the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, of the United States. In the 108 years since the VFW's founding, members have proudly carried on the organization's mission of ensuring rights, remembering sacrifices, promoting patriotism, performing community services, and advocating for a strong national defense. The VFW has advocated for our Nation's veterans to include helping establish the present-day Department of Veterans Affairs, creating the Montgomery GI Bill of Rights, developing the national cemetery system, and assisting combat-wounded veterans in receiving compensation for their injuries for service to our Nation. I support the goals and ideas of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day, which honors our veterans' achievements and their service to our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative John Kline, for introducing this legislation, and I urge swift passage of this bill.

   H.R. 1389 was introduced by Representative John Sarbanes on March 7, 2007. This legislation was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 19, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, the War of 1812 was fought between the United States and Great Britain from June 1812 to the spring of 1815. During this time, a young lawyer by the name of Francis Scott Key witnessed the last assault by the British against Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He was so inspired by the fort's still standing with its huge flag flying in the breeze of victory that Mr. Key wrote a poem celebrating this battle and the flag. He composed the lines about our great flag, the Star-Spangled Banner, which later became our country's national anthem. 
   I support H.R. 1389, a bill that will establish the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to encourage, plan and execute programs commemorating the historic events that are associated with the War of 1812.     
   Mr. Speaker, I would commend Representative Sarbanes for introducing this legislation.

   I also take this opportunity to commend my elementary school teachers, especially Mrs. Beadie King, who taught in a one-room school, who was so good that she could teach about the Star-Spangled Banner and you could feel shivers kind of going up and down your back. I am so pleased that I can still at times feel those and recognize perhaps what Francis Scott Key may have been thinking and what he may have been feeling when he looked up and saw that the flag was still standing. 
   So I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) again for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.

   Mr. Speaker, in 2006 there were over 16 million hunters in the United States, of which only .0013 percent incurred an injury during the past hunting season. To ensure and raise awareness for hunter safety, there are 70,000 hunter education instructors teaching hunter safety, ethics and conservation to approximately 750,000 students successfully each year. 
   Hunter safety can be contributed to hunter education training and the role of responsible hunters in the field. This helps to lower the incidence of hunting accidents, improve hunter behavior and restore many species of wildlife abundance.

   Mr. Speaker, reports of missing persons have increased sixfold in the past 25 years, from roughly 150,000 people in 1980 to about 900,000 this year. The CourtTV's Crime Library estimates that 2,300 people are reported missing every day in America. 
   I support establishing a day to bring awareness to the issue of missing persons. We should all reflect to remember the victims, their families, and local law enforcement and community volunteers who help search for missing individuals. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, even as we speak, in my city in the area where I live, there is a young woman who has been missing now for several days, and it has created a tremendous outpouring of empathy and sympathy on the part of the people for her parents and other family members who are searching diligently, hoping and praying that she will be found safely.

H.R. 1520 was introduced by Representative Maurice Hinchey on March 14, 2007. This legislation was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 19, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, Henry Hudson was hired by the Dutch East India company to try to find the Northwest Passage. On this trip in a ship called the Half Moon, Mr. Hudson sailed to Nova Scotia and then sailed south. In 1609, he found what is now called the Hudson River. Also in 1609, a French explorer, Samuel de Champlain, was exploring Lake Champlain, as well as the shore of northern New York and Vermont. 
   These voyages were two of the most significant passages in the European exploration and discovery of America. They led to the establishment of a Dutch settlement of what is now the capital city of the State of New York. Also, it led to the establishment of French trading posts, military posts and settlements as far south as Lake George. These settlements had a great influence on our Nation's history, culture, law, and commerce. 
   In 1807, Robert Fulton navigated the Hudson River from the city of New York to Albany in a steamboat which successfully began the use of steam navigation on a commercial basis. It revolutionized waterborne commerce on the great rivers of the United States and fostered international relations through transoceanic travel and trade. 
   The Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Act of 2007 establishes two commissions that would ensure a national observance of the Henry Hudson, Robert Fulton, and Samuel de Champlain 2009 commemorations through cooperation with the assistance to the programs and activities of New York, Vermont, and the commemorative commissions formed by these States.

Historians believe that World War I and President Wilson's leadership radically altered the role of diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy, a policy that established a new path for America's role in promoting democracies throughout the world. His vision helped shape the powers and responsibilities of the executive branch in times of war. 
   H.R. 1664, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Authorization Act, will allow the National Archives to provide grants for the establishment of a Presidential library to provide educational services to honor the life of former President Woodrow Wilson.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Conyers for, not only his leadership on this issue, but so many issues involving civil rights down through the years and for bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, holding that the segregation in public schools was illegal. Three years later, nine black students entered Little Rock Central High: Carlotta Walls, Jefferson Thomas, Elizabeth Eckford, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Terrance Roberts, Gloria Ray, Minniejean Brown and Ernest Green. I feel a certain amount of kinship to these nine students because, at that very same time, I was a freshman in college, just 50 miles away at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. And so over the years, I had an opportunity to interact with several of them. 
   Of course, the most well known is Ernest Green, who became an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Labor and is now the managing director of Lehman Brothers investment firm. 
   Minniejean Brown, I spent a weekend with, down at Southern Illinois University, where she graduated just a few years ago when we were both there for some activity. 
   I did student teaching with Melba Pattillo's mother, Mrs. Pattillo, who was a teacher in North Little Rock, Arkansas when I did student teaching. 
   And so it's been a great move. It's hard to imagine that 50 years ago I was there, but I guess I was, JOHN. It's been a long time, but much has happened since then. 
   I simply want to congratulate Governor Beebe, the Mayor of Little Rock, all of the elected officials in Little Rock, for the tremendous display of commemoration and celebration that has taken place over these 3 days as they commemorate the tremendous movement. And I agree with Chairman Conyers in suggesting that not only has Little Rock, but the country has come a long way since 1957. We've made tremendous progress, even though there is much further to go.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 584, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Life Insurance Awareness Month. 
   H. Res. 584, which has 87 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Judy Biggert on July 30, 2007. H. Res. 584 was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, studies have found that when an unexpected death occurs, insufficient life insurance coverage can cause significant economic hardship for the loved ones left behind. The lack of sufficient coverage drives many family members of the deceased to work additional jobs, borrow money, prematurely withdraw money from savings and investment accounts, and in many cases to move to less desirable housing. It is estimated that 68 million Americans say they lack the life insurance coverage needed to ensure a secure financial future for their loved ones. 
   I support the goals and ideals of National Life Insurance Awareness Month because it will make people more aware of their insurance needs and motivate them to seek information about obtaining life insurance. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Judy Biggert, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I will close and just simply reemphasize the importance of this legislation. Again, I want to commend Representative Biggert and yourself, Mr. Speaker, for leading the way. 
   I think many people think of resolutions like this as a simple something that has taken place; but I am reminded that in the community where I live and work, oftentimes people will die and not have the wherewithal with which to bury themselves.     
   Our young people will be killed and their families take up a collection to get them buried. And so I think that this is a very important resolution. I commend both of you, once again, for its introduction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF GOLD STAR MOTHERS DAY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H. Res. 605, a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day. 
   H. Res. 605, which has 108 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative PETER ROSKAM on August 1, 2007. 
   H. Res. 605 was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007 by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, Gold Star Mothers Day is an organization for mothers who have lost a son or daughter in service to our country. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated the last Sunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day to recognize and commemorate the tremendous sacrifice these courageous mothers have endured on behalf of our Nation. This wonderful group of women have turned their personal tragedy into patriotism and public service. 
   Today, numerous chapters of Gold Star Mothers across our Nation offer important programs and services to improve the lives of veterans and their families. They assist veterans of the Armed Forces and their dependents in the presentation of claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   I support the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day. And I have the utmost respect for mothers and fathers that have sacrificed their sons and daughters for peace, freedom and the security of our Nation. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative PETER ROSKAM, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I will close by simply stating that I have a very active, passionate and involved chapter of Gold Star Mothers in my congressional district. And so on behalf of them, and all of the Gold Star Mothers and Fathers throughout the country, I would urge passage of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res 210, which pays homage to a tradition that both the Senate and House have honored for over two decades. 
   In 1983, Congress first recognized September as the month to nationally commemorate sickle cell disease awareness. And it is in that same vein today that I ask for support of H. Con. Res 210. 
   Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by affected red blood cells that mutate into the shape of a crescent or sickle, and as such are unable to pass through small blood vessels. The horrific outcomes of this condition include considerable pain in one's arms, chest, legs and abdomen, anemia, gallstone, strokes, as well as damaging tissue in the liver, spleen, kidney, and death. 
   This disease affects over 70,000 Americans and cripples over 1,000 newborn babies each year in the United States. By supporting H. Con. Res 210, we acknowledge the importance of raising awareness for advance in sickle cell disease research, prevention treatment and potential cure. 
   As the sponsor of H. Con. Res 210, I would urge all of my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill. 
   I would also just note, Mr. Speaker, that the devastation of this disease on those who are affected by it is, indeed, tremendous. I have had firsthand experience with it by virtue of having run a sickle cell community education project for the University of Illinois in Chicago and came in contact with many of the patients and their families; saw the pain and suffering firsthand. And so I would urge passage of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
