   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6604, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008, will strengthen oversight of the commodity and futures markets for energy and agriculture commodities. It toughens position limits on oil and other futures markets as a way to prevent potential price distortions caused by excessive speculative trading. It extends CFTC oversight to previously exempt over-the-counter markets and calls for new full-time CFTC staff to improve enforcement, prevent manipulation, and prosecute fraud. 
   I want to thank my friend and ranking member, Mr. Goodlatte of Virginia, for the work that he has done on this legislation, not only in committee, but in the many meetings that we have had. We have worked I think and done our work in the best bipartisan fashions, and I thank him for that. 
   I also want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina, the chairman of the General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee, Mr. Bob Etheridge of North Carolina, for taking the lead on CFTC oversight on our committee and for his work on this legislation. 
   If it is all right with the gentleman from Virginia, in light of the work Mr. Etheridge has done, I will yield to him to do his presentation now and then I will finish mine later. I want to recognize Mr. Etheridge for 3 minutes. He has been a real leader on our side on this issue.

   Section 8 requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to define a bona fide hedge exemption, and I trust the Commission will use all of its expertise to strike the appropriate balance allowing for price discovery and risk management.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Goodlatte and assure him that there is one more person over here that agrees with him, that we should do everything we can to exploit all of our domestic energy sources, whatever they might be. And I would agree with him on that. I would add one other thing. In addition to that, we ought to promote conservation because we can probably save more energy with that than anything else that we do. So I'm for all of that. But we have this issue and we are addressing this, and I hope we can keep the focus on that. But again, I want to thank him for his help, and all the members of my committee. 
   Our interest on the Agriculture Committee has been to make sure that we maintain these markets for our agriculture producers. This is where the commodity futures business started is in agriculture. We are much smaller markets now than energy and than financials. And we're concerned about what's going on with this additional money that's coming into the markets, in terms of the agriculture markets. 
   We are lacking convergence in some of our ag markets. We have a situation where the basis is $2 difference between the future price of what somebody can get at the elevator. So we have issues  here that we are very concerned about, and we have taken the steps that we think we have the information to be able to address. We're closing the London loophole. We're taking the look-alike contracts that are just a substitute for something that's on the regulated market and we're giving the CFTC some authority to put position limits on that part of the OTC market. 
   But in the areas where we don't have enough information--which is considerable in the OTC market--in terms of how much of this is pension funds, how much is index funds, how much is hedge funds? Are they long or are they short? What's going on within that market? We don't have that information. 
   So in this bill we are requiring the CFTC to come up with this information, bringing it back to us so that we can sort this out and figure out exactly what is going on with all this additional money that's coming into the marketplace. 
   We've also asked the regulated market, the CME, to look into why we don't have convergence of the wheat market, why we had a problem with cotton here a few months ago. 
   We are, we think, doing a responsible effort here to address a concern that's been raised by a lot of people, and we are looking forward to getting the rest of this information. We have a good bill, a responsible bill. I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courageous people of southeastern Minnesota who have banded together to rebuild their communities after the devastating floods this past August. 
   Minnesota has had a tough summer with the unanticipated bridge collapse in the Twin cities and now extensive flooding in numerous smaller communities. Minnesota is known for its strong spirited communities and for how people come together to help one another in times of crisis. There is much to be admired in the way Minnesotans reached out to help their fellow neighbors. 
   It reminds me of how truly devastating storms can be. In 1997 and 2001, my district saw some terrible flooding along the Red River and its tributaries. I remember how hard it was for people to rebuild their lives, to have to start all over again after losing everything. 
   Flood recovery is a long and hard road, but I know that southeastern Minnesota has the support of the Minnesota legislature, the Minnesota Congressional Delegation and others across the State who have pitched in to help rebuild. I also want to commend the Minnesota National Guard and local officials, and those everyday heroes amongst us who saved lives, led their communities and helped to provide relief for all who needed it. 
   My heart goes out to the families that have lost loved ones and to those who have suffered injury in that devastating flooding. I pray that the healing will be swift and that your communities will recover and rebuild, stronger than ever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am pleased today to rise in support of H.R. 6. Rural America is already leading the way towards reducing our dependence on foreign oil and generating electricity from renewable resources. 
   To encourage the growth of renewable energy production, the Agriculture Committee will be including an energy title in the farm bill that we will write this year; however, we currently have no baseline money to write that energy title. 
   The funds created in the energy reserve in H.R. 6 will help us establish farm bill policies that will move us closer to energy independence. 
   One of my top priorities for renewable energy in the farm bill will be funding for additional research and development on cellulosic ethanol, which I believe is the real key to achieving energy independence. 
   To begin the transition to cellulosic ethanol, we need to start growing cellulosic feedstocks so that we are ready to get the industry off the ground when the technology and infrastructure are in place to begin producing it. 
   To make this happen, we are going to propose a new farm bill program that will pay farmers and ranchers to begin growing cellulosic feedstocks, such as switch grass, sweet sorghum, miscanthus and other crops in actual, real-world settings. This will help us identify the best feedstocks that each region of the country can grow and supply to this new cellulosic ethanol industry. 
   While we are learning how to grow the feedstocks that will fuel the cellulosic ethanol industry, we must also help get the first generation of cellulosic ethanol plants up and running. We hoped that the Department of Energy would issue the loan guarantees to start that process, but the unfinished appropriation process left over from the last Congress, it appears, makes that unlikely. So I am going to work with the other committees of relevance to determine what we need to do to help these first cellulosic ethanol plants to be built and to be operational. 
   Although I am most interested in finding ways to encourage the move to cellulosic ethanol, we will also be looking for ways to make our current starch ethanol industry more efficient by supporting research on better use of by-products and better corn yields. 
   As we build on the success of the starch ethanol industry and as a value-added agriculture product, we need to continue to support one of our most important value-added industries in agriculture, our livestock industry. This industry has been one of the greatest value-added success stories in recent years, boosting income in our farming communities. We need to ensure that any renewable fuels policies that we pursue do not damage this important sector. 
   We must also continue to grow our domestic biodiesel industry, so the Agriculture Committee will continue the CCC Bioenergy program, a farm bill  program that can also provide incentives for the cellulosic ethanol production. 
   Beyond the renewable fuel production, there are other policies that the Agriculture Committee will support to help our Nation's farmers and ranchers both conserve and produce more energy. For example, in the 2002 farm bill, we included a program to help farmers and ranchers make their operations more energy efficient. That program, known as the Section 9006 Program, also helps agriculture producers install methane digesters or wind turbines on their land to produce renewable energy. 
   As we continue to consider the future of the energy production in the United States, we need to be sure that we can provide the technical expertise needed to plan and test all kinds of bio-based products, not just fuels, such as shirts made from corn fiber, which are produced in my district, and fast-food containers made from corn starch. 
   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Minnesota has been a leader in renewable energy, recognizing the growing needs for a growing industry. Many of our rural communities are coming alive with the excitement and the new investment that renewable energy has brought. I want to be sure that the rest of the country can benefit from this great experience that we have had in Minnesota. 
   Rural America stands ready to plant, grow and harvest the future of energy independence for our Nation. I encourage the support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I have been around agriculture all my life, and I have never seen the excitement that is generated by this opportunity, because not only are we going to have economic benefits; we are going to help get this country off oil dependence. 
   The internal combustion engine and diesel engine were invented to run on alcohol and peanut oil. They went to gasoline because it was cheaper and I guess more available. Well, times have changed and we are going back to the future, and this legislation is going to give us the opportunity and the resources to do that.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6604, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008, will strengthen oversight of the Commodity Futures Market for energy and agricultural commodities. This bill will be almost entirely identical to the version that we considered under suspension here on July 30, 2008. 
   There are two changes that are purely technical and corrected typographical errors, and there are two other changes that we made in the bill to make sure the provisions are entirely within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. 
   One strikes section 10(b) regarding the Inspector General of the CFTC. The other, section 13(b) is modified so the Commodity Futures Trading Commission does the reference study instead of the Comptroller General. 
   Mr. Speaker, on this bill we have gotten more information in the committee, and Mr. Etheridge had a hearing that he chaired last week. 
   I would at this time yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) who has been working with me tirelessly on this to talk about the process and explain the bill.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As I said when we first considered this bill in July, this is a great bipartisan effort that Mr. Goodlatte and I have worked on. This bill addresses the realization that the trading volume and the futures market for physical commodities has increased dramatically in recent years. This increase includes vast amounts of capital from parties that are not traditional futures market participants, and this has been my concern, these participants, such as the index funds, pension funds, and some hedge funds. 
   The presence of this additional capital has raised concerns in our committee that the resulting futures market prices may not accurately represent the forces of supply and demand, nor may they fundamentally support at the local selling points where those in the producing and selling of the commodities are doing business. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate is more than just the presence of speculators in the futures market. As I said on the floor in July, this lack of convergence--and this is one of the big problems that I am concerned about--the lack of convergence that we're getting in some of these agricultural markets where we have a $2.40 difference between the futures price and the actual cash price of wheat in some of our markets, these are the things that really concerns us on the committee. 
   So we have put forward transparency so that we know what's going on in these markets, and we're giving the authority for some position limits on these nontraditional investments that were created that really have nothing to do with the underlying commodity market. And in my opinion, the more I learn about this, I think this has some effect on why we're not getting convergence in those markets. 
   We believe this is a modest step that addresses the concerns that have been identified to the committee, and we're going to continue to work on this. We're going to continue to get information from the CFTC and other sources as to what is going on in these markets, and we will see how this progresses through this Congress. 
   But I can tell people if this is not resolved in this Congress, we will take this up in the next Congress to address these issues. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my time.

Like any bill, it's not perfect but it's, I think, a step in the right direction. We take very seriously our responsibility and the jurisdiction that we have in making sure that the CFTC is doing the proper oversight, the proper job, and that we're getting convergence of these markets so that they work for people that need them on a day-to-day basis. 
   This is almost the exact same bill that received 275 votes on a bipartisan basis on July 30. At one time we were up to 291 votes. At one time we had two-thirds, but it eroded away. I'm confident today that we will have the support to move this bill through the House, and hopefully our friends in the other body will move because I believe we have uncovered some things that need to be addressed in legislation, and we are doing that in this legislation. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to support the bill.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, first of all, we were delayed in getting something done with this bill back in July when, at one time, we had the votes to pass this under suspension, and then the votes eroded away. This is going to delay the process again. And beyond delay because it says ``promptly,'' it will have the effect of us not being able to move this bill in the House before we're out of here for the elections. 
   As chairman of the committee and somebody that's worked on this, I disagree with that. I think we need to move this, irrespective of whatever's going to happen in the other body or with the administration. I think this has the effect of killing the bill because we won't have the time to deal with this. 
   Lastly, I think the CFTC has the ability to do this under the legislation. Apparently Mr. Moran doesn't trust the CFTC. We have people over here that don't trust the CFTC, but I think they could deal with this. I don't think there's anything that precludes them from accomplishing this in the underlying legislation. 
   I would ask people to oppose the motion, and I would say that I believe this kills the bill for this session. 
   I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentlelady. 
   With all due respect to my good friend from Texas, I take a little bit of offense saying that the Agriculture Committee was not serious in what we were doing here. We take very seriously our responsibility in overseeing the CFTC, and this bill is, without a doubt, the most responsible bill that's been put together in this area in this Congress. 
   The reasons we're bringing it up is not because of the reasons that were iterated by Mr. Sessions, it's because we're doing our job. And maybe there's problems over in the Senate, but I can't control that. I just want to make sure that we don't have the same kind of problems happening on Wall Street in the CFTC that we see going on in these other areas where they have all of these crazy derivatives and everything else that they've dreamed up on Wall Street. 
   What they've done is they've created investment in the commodity market that, in my opinion, has no business being in there. This was something that was never intended. They're using the regulated market outside the position limits to offset that risk, which I think we've decided is wrong. And so we're fixing that. 
   This bill is supported by Mr. Goodlatte. We passed this out of the Ag Committee. There were no Republican amendments offered in the committee, and on the floor of the House we had 291 votes, we had a two-thirds vote until the leadership came up and started twisting arms and it went down to 275. 
   So what we're doing is our job, and I guess I take offense when somebody criticizes us for doing our job. 
   Now in the case of Mr. Conaway, I apologized to him personally last night. I think I made it clear in the committee. I had a personal situation last week. I wasn't here. This happened, the bill failed right before the August recess, nobody was around. I think he has a legitimate point.

   So if we can get this bill out of the House, if the Senate moves, we're going to have a conference committee. And I told Mr. Conaway last night that this is an issue that we can deal with at that time. 
   We have issues on our side that we have people upset about that we took out of the bill to make sure it was all within our jurisdiction that we're also going to have to deal with.

But this was always the intention to bring this back, and we don't have a lot of time. We can't wait until next week to bring this up. We're going to run out of time.

   I apologize. I was on a personal situation last week so I wasn't here. When I got back, we had a blowup on country of origin labeling and some other issues. 
   So I think if Mr. Conaway would--we had discussions last night, and I think we've got a way to move forward. But I'm not sure we're going to come to a resolution that's going to be agreeable to everybody. We may still have to have some kind of a, I don't know, process to try to work this out because there's people that think what Mr. Conaway is doing is opening up too big of a hole, if you will, in the hedge exemption. And so we've got to work through that.

   First of all, I want to rise to commend Chairman Dingell for the outstanding work that he did on this legislation. He, once again, produced a good bill that can be signed, as he always does. I also want to commend the Speaker, the rest of our leadership; the Speaker, especially, for her focus, or we wouldn't probably be here today. 
   As chairman of the Ag Committee, the most important part of this bill is the renewable fuel standard. I want to thank the chairman for putting a 9-billion-gallon standard in for next year on ethanol. We have gotten to the point of 7 billion gallons of production right now. The RFS is 5 billion. In order to keep this industry going, we need this 9-billion RFS next year. So this is going to get us back on track. 
   We have a 36-billion-gallon number in the overall bill. What this RFS does with the 9 billion for ethanol, and 500 million, up to a billion for biodiesel, it will set the stage for the next generation of ethanol, which is going to be cellulosic, and for new feedstocks for biodiesel. 
   So when you take this bill and put it together with what we have put in the farm bill, this is going to set the stage for us to be able to produce at least 30 percent of our fuel from agriculture down the road. We are not going to be the total solution to this problem, though we are going to be a big part of the solution, and we are excited about being involved in this process and making this happen. 
   So this is a historic day. This is going to be a tremendous boost for us in agriculture. We just want to thank the chairman and all the members that worked on this. It's a good piece of legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6377 directs the CFTC to utilize all of its authority, including its emergency powers, to immediately curb the role of excessive speculation, if any, in the energy and swaps futures market within its jurisdiction, and to eliminate any unlawful activity causing major market disturbances that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand of energy commodities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think I would be covering any new ground in this Chamber if I were to speak about high prices of gasoline. Everybody in this chamber understands that problem. But, Mr. Speaker, a growing number of people believe a flood of speculative money into the energies futures is driving the increase in prices. The weak dollar and increased worldwide demand has led to a greater number of well capitalized investors into the commodities futures market, including the crude oil market, as these investors seek greater returns than they traditionally found in cash and securities.     
   It is undeniable that this group of institutional investors has a greater presence in futures markets than ever before. 
   So what we are doing here is asking the CFTC to look into this and use the powers that they have to look at this situation and determine and give us a report which they have done in the past. We are asking them to take one more look and make sure that these additional moneys that are coming into the futures market are not having any undo effect on prices that people are concerned about. 
   The CFTC is the chief regulator of the commodities futures and options market. It is their responsibility to identify, pursue and prosecute fraud in this area. I believe they are doing a good job in that regard. Chairman Lukken and his staff have testified repeatedly before our committee and others that at this point they can see no evidence of speculation causing problems in these markets. But there are a lot of folks who are concerned this is going on, and so we are asking them to take one more look. 
   Under current law, U.S. traders can execute transactions in West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which is the benchmark oil contract on NYMEX, a CFTC-regulated exchange, and on London's ICE exchange that is regulated by the United Kingdom's FSA. The CFTC, however, has information on the positions of traders on the NYMEX that they don't have on the traders on ICE, and this is part of the issue that has caused us to be concerned because we don't have complete information on exactly what is going on in all of these markets. 
   Mr. Speaker, CFTC right now is taking steps to gain more information. They have gone into an agreement with the FSA to expand trader data, and that is all good and we welcome these steps, but we believe more should be done. CFTC should immediately take these steps to utilize their authority to make sure that, as I said before, there is not excessive speculation in these markets. 
   We on the Agriculture Committee are going to work with the CFTC to try to acquire more information, and we will thoroughly examine all of the bills in July that have been introduced in this area in a methodical way, we will listen to all sides, and we are going to try to move ahead with a consensus bill if we can come to a consensus about what, if anything, should be done to move on this situation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to, we hope, provide a reasonable and useful voice to come to the right conclusion and get the right answers about what is going on in the futures market and what is going on with oil prices in this country. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my good friend, Mr. Goodlatte, that I appreciate his support for this measure. And what we're trying to do in our committee is to develop a consensus as we move through this issue. And there are a lot of ideas, a lot of different opinions out there, a lot of bills that have been introduced. 
   This is a step that we can make today I think on a basis where we can come together and make sure that the CFTC is using the powers that they have to examine this market and make sure that the speculation, the extra money that's coming in is being done properly and is not affecting these markets in a way that is not appropriate. And I trust that they will do that job. 
   But moving forward, what we intend to do, as I said earlier, as soon as we come back here from the July recess, our committee will convene on Wednesday after we come back and we will examine all of the bills that have been introduced or are introduced in the meantime. And we will have a debate on all the different aspects and all the different positions. And what we will try to do on that committee is to sort through all of this and hopefully come to a consensus about what is the appropriate way for us to move ahead. 
   These are very complicated markets and issues, and I want to make sure that whatever we do is the appropriate response, and as somebody said earlier, we don't have unintended consequences because of the actions that we take here.  
   So I look forward to working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with my colleagues on this side of the aisle to find a consensus that can have bipartisan support like we achieved on the farm bill to move something ahead that makes sense for the American people and gets the right answer. 
   With that, I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the good people of Minnesota who have banded together to begin the healing process. When  that bridge fell on August 1st, every citizen of my state felt the grief and the pain together. It has certainly been a difficult month for everyone, but I am so proud of the first responders, of the volunteers, and of my colleagues here in the House. I'd like to give a special thanks to Chairman Oberstar, for acting so quickly. He has represented the State of Minnesota, and the House very well. I'd also like to say that Representative Ellison has done a remarkable job in representing his district during these trying times. 
   It is a shame that it sometimes takes the worst events to bring out the best in people, but I am so proud of the wonderful actions Minnesotans have taken to help the victims of the I-35W Bridge. I think the people involved in the recovery actions have truly demonstrated the incredible character of Minnesota's citizens. 
   Nothing can replace what was lost on August 1st. No amount of money will do that. Neither will a new bridge. But the strength of the community has shown through during this long road to healing. Thank you Representative Ellison, thank you to the members of the Minnesota Delegation and thank you to all my colleagues who have helped support the citizens of my State.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The conference committee is close to wrapping up work on the bill and we will have significant reform in the final package that comes out of the conference committee. I can assure people of that. Apparently the issue that is before us today is one small part of that whole package. Frankly, the discussion has not really focused that much on this part of the payment limit issue. It has been more on the AGI issue. 
   But just so folks understand what happened here, we in our bill that passed the House made the most significant reform in this area that has been made in a long time, and that is to get rid of the triple entity rule and to require direct attribution. If you had told people 2 years ago that you were going to accomplish that, they would have thought you were crazy. So we did that in our bill. We are going to do that in the conference report. 
   The reality of how this all works, with the limits, the internal limits that we have in the House-passed bill, $60,000 on direct payments, $65,000 on countercyclical, it keeps the direct payment level for folks that had a triple entity at the same amount that it is under the previous system. So I will agree that we did in certain cases keep the direct payment limits the same as what they were in the past before we eliminated triple entity. And there are other factors in here, like limitations on countercyclical payments and so forth. So there is a lot of disagreement about how this should be done and so forth. 
   There are a lot of statistics put out about who is getting what and what percentage they are of farmers. I would just like people to know that according to USDA, we have 2.1 million farmers in the country. But people would be surprised to find out what it takes to qualify as a farmer under USDA rules. It says that all you have to do is have $1,000 of income from farming. Well, it doesn't even say that. It just says you have to be able to have had $1,000 of income. So you don't even have to sell $1,000. If you could have sold $1,000, you would qualify as a farmer. 
   So all of these statistics are based off of 2.1 million farmers, when the reality is the true commercial farmers that produce 90 percent of the food in this country amount to 350,000. So you have a lot of folks in this system that really aren't farmers. You have got a lot of people that are hobby farmers, that farm on the weekend, and they are all being counted and they are all being used in these statistics that people like Mr. Flake and others use. 
   That is fine. But what we have tried to do in the Agriculture Committee is focus on the real farmers, the people that farm every day, that are commercial farmers that produce 85 to 90 percent of the food in this country, and to provide them a safety net where they can get a loan from the bank in the spring and they can survive the bad years and keep farming. And that is not an easy thing. It is a very risky business, and it costs a lot of money to be in this business on a commercial scale. 
   So we have, unfortunately in my opinion, and others will disagree with this, we got this system put on us in 1996 under a thing called Freedom to Farm, which I opposed as a member of the Agriculture Committee. The idea was we were going to have direct payments that were not tied to any production and that were based on past history because prices were good and the WTO wanted us to do this, and this was ideology run amuck. 
   I said at the time that this is not going to work, this is a bad idea, that these prices are going to go down and we are going to have to rescue farmers, and that is exactly what happened. 
   We spent $30 billion 2 years in a row to bail out farmers. That is more than the entire cost of these direct payments over 5 years. We spent that every year for 2 or 3 years to bail farmers out in 1998, 1999 and 2000. So we get to the 2002 bill and people figured out, well, we have to put the safety net back. And they kept the direct payments. So now we went back to the old system, but we kept the direct payments. 
   Well, if I had to do it, I would do it different. But that is the system we have, and that is the system that people want, especially in the South, because it is in their financial structure and it is how they organize everything. If I had my way, we would take those direct payments, we would raise the loan rates, we would raise the countercyclical target prices, we would have a stronger safety net. But the consensus is that we do some of each. So these direct payments serve as a base for farmers to go get a loan at the bank. 
   For those folks that are concerned about food prices going up, the folks that have been pushing payment limits, what the effect of that will be is to raise food prices. So if that is what you want to do, you know, that is probably not going to be real popular. But whenever you get the government mucking around and deciding how big a farm should be, which is what you are doing, you are going to make the farms more inefficient and you are going to drive up the cost of farming. That is what you are going to do. And it is going to increase the cost of goods to consumers. 
   So we have considered this. The committee had looked at it. We are looking at the limitation on direct payments, and there will be some changes in that area. But we have had this debate on the floor of the House. They have had it in the Senate. We appreciate Mr. Flake's input, but we think that what we are doing here now in the conference committee will be a better outcome that will provide a better situation for our farmers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to Mr. Neugebauer from Texas, a member of my committee.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the gentleman from Arkansas, I would just like folks to know that these prices that everybody talks about, if you are a real farmer out there and goes to your elevator, you cannot get a contract at these prices. And if you really want to do something here on this floor that will do some good, it would be to keep this Wall Street hedge fund money out of the commodity market, which has run these prices up and created a bubble. 
   People need to remember that these direct payments came about because of high prices, quote, back in 1996. We heard the same speeches. That is how we got these direct payments in the first place. And what happened? It collapsed. And I will tell you one thing that I know about farming, is that whenever you have good prices, farmers are very good at creating low prices, and they will do it again. And that is why we need a safety net. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas such time as he may consume.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I will just say very briefly that, as I said earlier, we get kind of off on tangents here on talking about small farmers and so forth. But the effect of a lot of these different proposals on reform, the effect of them are going to be to raise food prices for people in this country and around the world, and if that's what you want to do, you know, you can talk to your voters about that. 
   But 23 percent of the farms in this country have more than $50,000 of sales. But they do 90 percent of the business. They produce 90 percent of the food and they get 81 percent of the payments. So we already have changed things. 
   But the point is $50,000, I think my good friend from Arkansas will agree, in our part of the world is not a real farm. You can't make a living on $50,000 of gross income on a farm. It's just not realistic. 
   So when you get up to a realistic commercial size farm, they produce just about all the food in this country. Now there's some small farms that are developing that are doing pretty well, and I've been supporting that and we're supporting that for the first time in this farm bill; and that is people producing organic, people producing local foods, getting out of the commercial system. 
   So there is a place for small farmers in these niche markets, and they're growing, and that's a good thing. But you go to those niche markets and you're finding you're paying a lot more money for that type of food. And a lot of people want that and that's great. 
   If we get involved in this and screw up this system, the gentleman from Arkansas is correct, we're going to endanger the national security of this country. If we ever get in a position in this country with this food that we're at with oil, we've got significant problems. 
   And this isn't a perfect system. When it was established, I voted against it. If I had my way, as I said earlier, I would not do it this way. But this is the consensus of people in the business of agriculture, the system that we have, that works so they can get financing and they can stay in business. 
   And you hear about the WTO. One of the biggest objections to what I want to do, the direction I'd like to go with farm policy, is that we can't do that because the WTO would object. And we've got the World Bank out there getting these developing countries to adopt these free market ideas like some people have done in this country, and the effect of that has been to not help the people. It's made them more food insecure. 
   So we're never going to settle this debate. As my friend from Arkansas said, we've argued about this for how long. 
   We are going to produce a farm bill here pretty quick. It's going to have a lot of reform in it. It's going to have a lot of new initiatives that we haven't done before in organic, in energy. There's a lot of money in there for conservation. We're going to have $10 billion of new spending above the baseline. After we took a $58 billion hit in the commodity title, we added $10 billion not in the commodity title. We added it into nutrition. So we're adding $10 billion of spending, and 10.261 of that, more than we've added to the bill, is going to nutrition to help people to cope with these high food prices. 
   So we're doing, we think, the right things, putting in the right kind of initiatives in this farm bill. It's not going to satisfy everybody, but it's moving in what we think is the right direction for the country. 
   I would encourage my colleagues to oppose this motion to instruct and continue to support the work of the Agriculture Committee. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, this is, as I said earlier, the exact bill that was voted on and passed by the House and the Senate. The gentleman is wrong. The provision that he is referring to was in both the House bill and the Senate bill, and it was also an original idea from the White House that was in their original farm proposal. So this is not some new program that came about in the conference committee. It was in the bill that passed the House, it was in the bill that passed the Senate, and it was in the President's bill that they proposed. In fact, this was a reform that was suggested by the White House and the administration. 
   So you can make all kinds of outrageous assumptions and come up with outrageous charges, which has been done for some time on this bill. The idea that there is going to be anybody in this country that has $2.5 million of adjusted gross income and is going to be able to collect farm payments is complete lunacy. That is not true. And whatever people they have been able to get to score this to come up with these numbers, nobody can verify that. These are more charges that we have dealt with. 
   This bill was filed on May 13. It has been available for everybody to read since May 13. It is exactly the same bill that has been out there all of this time. The error that was made was made by the Enrolling Clerk, not by this committee, and it is unfortunate. What we are trying to do here is fix the situation. 
   I am not sure that we need to do what we are doing here. But to try to accommodate some concerns on the part of the minority and others that have raised issues, what we are doing here is re-passing the bill exactly the way that it passed the House and the Senate, the way that it should have gone to the President, so that we can move this bill out of the House, the Senate can deal with it, the President can veto it, we can override it, and in the provisions we will vitiate the work that has been done with the House and  Senate overriding the veto of the current bill. 
   It is a messy process. It is something we would just as soon not go through. But it is where we are at. We are trying to deal with fixing a clerical error that was caused by the Enrolling Clerk, and we think this is an appropriate way to do that. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of the House-passed bill, and in our bill we had a countercyclical revenue assurance program that was a national trigger, as I said earlier. 
   This is an idea that came about from the White House, and it is not something that is going to be given to people just automatically. This is reviewed as a reform and it was sold as a reform by the White House, and I was skeptical of it. 
   But you have to give up 20 percent of your direct payments in order to get into this program. You have to lower your loan rate 30 percent. And this works not only going up, it works going down. So people are taking a risk by getting involved in this program as well as opportunity on the other side. 
   So you can have your arguments about it, but this is something that we are trying out as an option. It is something we are going to see how it works between now and 2012. There are a lot of people, including the administration, that think that this is a better way to go than the current target priced countercyclical marketing loan situation that we have. We will see. I have been skeptical of it. But there are people in the Senate and other places that were thinking that this is a good reform. 
   Now this idea that was just put forward by the minority leader that somehow or another this $287 billion goes to farmers, we have editorial writers saying the same thing around this country. The reality is that what actually goes to farmers under this bill is less than 9 percent of the bill, the traditional crop supports. 73.5 percent of the 10-year bill goes to nutrition. And if you add in crop insurance and the new disaster program, which is paid for, for the first time, you are up to about 15 percent of the total bill going to farmers. 
   So this idea that $287 billion is going to farmers is not true. All of the new money in this bill is going to nutrition, going to conservation, going to fruits and vegetables, going to energy. The reality is that what is in this bill for farmers is less than it was in the old law. This bill is less than the total cost of the 2002 bill. This bill is less than what passed the House and the Senate. And this bill is exactly what we passed in the House, exactly what we passed in the Senate, and was sent to the President. What we are trying to do here today is fix this problem. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and let us get this farm bill finally resolved.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct the record. This bill has had a long and tortuous path, and now, unfortunately, is the victim of an unintended clerical error, and I just need to set the record straight about what happened here. 
   I notified Mr. Goodlatte, who I worked on this bill with on a bipartisan basis, as soon as I found him after I found out about this. We also talked to Mr. Blunt before the vote. So we had discussions on a bipartisan basis. 
   This error, apparently what happened here is that there was a procedure that used to be in place where people would initial each page after they had done the enrollment on the parchment, but that was eliminated apparently 10 years ago when the Republicans were in charge, for whatever reason. So a mistake was made on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House vetoed a bill that was missing this title. We sent a bill down there that was missing this title. So that was the reality of what happened. I notified everybody before the override immediately about what the situation was. So that is what happened. 
   Now, the way we came to the conclusion to move ahead with this was discussions with the Parliamentarian and others that this in fact was a bill that was vetoed that was passed in the identical form in both the House and the Senate. We had passed all 14 of those titles in the House that were vetoed. They passed them in the Senate in identical form. It was vetoed by the White House. 
   There is a case from 1892, Field v. Clark, that was the exact same similar situation. It is very clear that they do not look beyond the parchment when they look at this veto. So the decision to move ahead was made on a bipartisan basis between Mr. Goodlatte and me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. The idea at the time was that we would ask unanimous consent to move title III after the veto override so we could marry the bill back up. There was objection raised on that regard. So what we are doing now is a process to try to fix this. This is a clerical error. This is not anything that anybody has tried to cover up. I made this clear to everybody at the beginning of the process. 
   Looking at this the next day, I think we made the right decision, because clearly the Senate is going to override the veto and the 14 titles that are overridden will become the law of the land. This is backed up by Field v. Clark. 
   We have still got the issue to deal with on the trade title. We have a process set up to get that resolved. It is not a partisan issue. We are just trying to get this fixed. 
   So you can disagree with the decision we made, and if you have a problem with it, I will take the blame. But at the time, we talked to the Parliamentarian, we discussed it among ourselves, and we decided this is the way to proceed.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. It is not a constitutional quagmire. I don't know why people bring this up, because it was clear in this 1892 court case what the situation is. The thing is, we initially asked, if I could explain, if it was possible to re-enroll the bill and send it back to the President in the way that it should have been done in the first place. We were told that could not be done. 
   The problem that we have is not so much a problem in the House, but a problem in the Senate, that there is no way that you could get this bill redone without re-passing the bill.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Again, one of the reasons that we were moving was because the extension of the current law expires Friday and we were trying to make sure we got the work done so that we could finally get this bill passed into law, after all the time that we have been working on this.     
   If people think that I made the wrong decision here, I will take responsibility for it. But I talked to minority members. There were some on the other side that agreed with the process that we were setting forward. I apologize. 
   There is nobody that has spent more time working on this bill. I personally looked over everything that has been in this bill. I guess the one mistake I made was that I didn't personally read the enrolled copy of this bill and actually check each page of it before it was sent to the White House. I guess I should have done that. 
   A procedure was eliminated that used to be there under the Republicans. I think that procedure is now going to be reinstated after this experience. Really, this is just an error. And now we have to fix this. 
   So what we are doing with this rule is allowing us to pass the whole bill again, send it over to the Senate. We are also going to pass a bill that just has title III in it, send that to the Senate, so that we give the Senate all of the options that they need so that we can get this expedited and fixed as soon as possible. That is what we are trying to do here. 
   I apologize if some people's feelings were hurt, but we were doing the best we could.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Reclaiming my time. This was done correctly. The 14 titles that were overridden yesterday were passed in an identical manner between the House and the Senate. They were vetoed by the President in that manner. The bill, once the Senate overrides, will become law. This is clarified in Field v. Clark in 1892, a similar situation. This is information that we knew before we proceeded, and we believe we proceeded correctly under the circumstances. Had we had unanimous consent, we wouldn't be here today. We would have had this resolved by now.

Mr. Speaker, some of us that have big huge districts use our airplanes to fly around the district to get to meetings just like some people use their automobiles, and there is concern amongst the few of us that do this about a provision in here. So, Mr. Hastings, could you clarify for me that it is not the intent of section 207 of House Resolution 6 to prohibit a Member to use his or her own airplane; specifically, that is not intended to apply to the use of the Members' representational allowance to reimburse a Member for mileage on his or her own airplane?

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. (SHORT-TERM FARM BILL EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2745, a bill to extend current farm programs until April 18, 2008. Mr. Speaker, our farm policies ensure that all Americans have access to safe, secure and abundant food supply while providing a safety net for American farmers and ranchers. It also authorizes important nutrition programs for our country's neediest citizens, encourages vital conservation programs and supports the development of agriculturally based renewable energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of us on the Agriculture Committee would rather have a new farm bill signed into law rather than be here today asking for an extension. 
   After hearing about the popularity of the 2002 farm bill from farmers and ranchers nationwide in a series of field hearings our committee held in 2006, we set out last year to build on a strong farm safety net while making new investments in rural America and for our Nation's neediest citizens who depend on Federal food programs for a square meal. 
   The new farm bill that this House passed last July makes those investments in nutrition, fruits and vegetable production and farm-based renewable energy. It reforms our farm programs and reinforces the strong farm safety net. It includes an agreement between industry and consumer groups on mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat. All that progress will be lost if we do not get this bill finished and signed into law. 
   Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, we are taking steps toward a bipartisan, bicameral bill that Members can support. And I believe we have made enough progress in that endeavor to support a 1-month extension. 
   So, in closing, I would like to thank my friend and the ranking member, Mr. Goodlatte from Virginia, for his work over the last few months and for standing alongside me in working with the Senate and the administration in order to get this farm bill to a conclusion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2745, a bill to extend current farm programs until April 18, 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, our farm policies ensure that all Americans have access to a safe, secure and abundant food supply while providing a safety net for America's farmers and ranchers. Farm bills also authorize important nutrition programs for our country's neediest citizens, encourage vital conservation programs, and increasingly support the development of agriculturally based renewable energy, which will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of us on the Agriculture Committee would rather have a new Farm Bill signed into law rather than to be here today to ask for an extension. When the House Agriculture Committee kicked off the Farm Bill process in 2006 with Farm Bill field hearings all across America, we hoped a new Farm Bill for American agriculture would have been signed into law by now. Even though the farmers and ranchers we heard from in those hearings were strongly supportive of the farm safety net of the 2002 law, we knew passing a new Farm Bill would not be easy in this kind of budget environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Farm Bill has been a victim of its own success. The 2002 law saved taxpayers billions but resulted in a 60 percent cut in budget authority for traditional farm programs when budget baselines were released a year ago. 
   Nevertheless, the Agriculture Committee wrote a Farm Bill from the ground up; a new Farm Bill that makes historic investments in fruit and vegetable production, conservation, nutrition, and renewable energy while reinforcing the strong safety net for America's  farmers. The House-passed bill institutes mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat. And despite what is said by editorial boards in big cities, this Farm Bill contains significant reforms that just a few years ago many people thought would be impossible to pass. We have eliminated the three-entity rule. We have implemented direct attribution of payments for transparency. And thanks to a hard cap on eligibility, millionaires will no longer be receiving farm payments. 
   The Senate passed their Farm Bill in late December, and staffs have been working hard ever since the New Year to work out many of the policy issues we will face once an overall funding level is reached. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are taking gradual steps to reaching a bipartisan, bicameral bill that everyone can support, and I believe we have made enough progress to support a 1-month extension. 
   Many people would like to see different things with this Farm Bill, but the truth is, Mr. Speaker, that all of the advances we have made in fruit and vegetable production, nutrition, conservation, reforming farm programs, and encouraging farm-based renewable energy will go out the window if we do not get this bill done and signed into law. The forward progress we have made over the last few weeks lead me to believe that we can get this done. Our farmers and ranchers expect us to finish a new farm bill for a new age of agriculture. 
   In closing, I would like to thank my friend and Ranking Member Mr. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia for his work over the last few months and for standing alongside me in working with the Senate and the Administration in order to get this Farm Bill to a conclusion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, by nearly all measures, the situation in Iraq is a mess. And yet what seems crystal clear to most Minnesoteans the President says that we still have a realistic chance to achieve his vision for a free and democratic Iraq and that all is needed is a short-term addition of 21,000 American combat troops. Does nobody seriously think that this is true, that success is only 21,000 more soldiers away? 
   Mr. Speaker, I am against the President's plan. I have given this President the benefit of the doubt on more than one occasion. But his plan to send in more troops does not pass the test of common sense. If a short-term surge was going to deliver victory and democracy in Iraq, we would have already done it. 
   This idea would have made more sense at the beginning of this war. And more troops at the start were what many experts counseled. I was serving on the Select Intelligence Committee when the President, senior Pentagon officials, and senior intelligence officials told us that Iraq was a threat to our national security. At the time, we had a great deal of confusing and occasionally conflicting information. 
   We questioned them about this, and their response was that the information that they had required us to act and that they had a plan for the aftermath. I gave them the benefit of the doubt then, and I believed them. 
   But as time passed and events unfolded, we all learned that, at best, we had received unreliable information and, at worst, we had been misled.     
   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus now on the soldiers in the Minnesota National Guard and talk about what the President's plan is going to mean for them.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1374. H.R. 1374, introduced by Representatives Allen Boyd of Florida and Ander Crenshaw of Florida, would amend the Florida National Forest Land Management Act of 2003 and permit a land conveyance in Leon County. This bill would allow the United States Forest Service to sell a 114-acre parcel in the Apalachicola National Forest known as the ``Flea Market Tract.'' The parcel is surrounded by commercial development, including a major highway to the north, a power line easement to the south, and private land primarily developed to the east and west. 
   The configuration and development makes adequate land management difficult and the tract unsuitable as managed forest land. H.R. 1374 specifies that the proceeds of the sale of the tract be used for the purpose of acquiring private lands within the Apalachicola National Forest. 
   H.R. 1374 is supported by the United States Forest Service, the City of Tallahassee, and Leon County, as well as by local businesses, church and civic groups. It is a project that is worthy of congressional support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 15. 
   H.J. Res 15, a resolution introduced by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, recognizes the success and importance of the live-cut Christmas tree industry in the United States. 
   It is an appropriate time of the year for Congress to consider this resolution, as I think that most of us here today have memories of decorating a Christmas tree during the holiday season. The live-cut Christmas tree industry ensures that this tradition continues every year for families across the Nation. 
   Likewise, there are private forest landowners all across America for whom Christmas trees are an important source of income. Over 35 million live-cut Christmas trees are produced this year, and they are growing in all 50 States. Christmas tree growers are responsible land stewards who provide wildlife habitat, give us cleaner air, protect watersheds, and improve the environment. 
   The economic strength and cultural contribution of this industry makes this resolution worthy of congressional support. 
   I encourage the support of the resolution. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 3454. This bill, sponsored by Mr. Boucher from Virginia, would convey property in the George Washington National Forest to the Central Advent Christian Church of Alleghany County, Virginia. The parcel will consist of no more than 8 acres, and included in this parcel will be a cemetery encompassing approximately 6 acres. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3454 requires that the church accept the property at the time of the conveyance in an ``as is'' condition. The exact acreage and legal description of the properly to be conveyed will be determined in a survey of USDA's approval. USDA will also set additional terms and conditions in connection with the conveyance of the property. 
   The United States Forest Service has acknowledged that this particular tract of forest land is difficult to manage. Owning a cemetery tract is inconsistent with the Forest Service mission, which is why they have attempted to sell this property several times without success. I understand the Central Advent Christian Church has already been doing basic maintenance on the cemetery grounds. Conveying this land to the church would enable them to make more significant repairs to the property. This effort deserves congressional support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 25, and urge its adoption by the House. H. Con. Res. 25 embodies the vision of farmers and ranchers who have been leaders in renewable energy and land conservation activities, and recognizes that forestry and agriculture will play a leading role in our country's transitions to energy independence. The 25x'25 Resolution sets a national energy independence goal that by the year 2025, 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United States should come from homegrown, renewable sources. 
   This resolution has received strong bipartisan support, was passed out of the House Agriculture Committee under my good friend, Mr. Goodlatte's leadership last year, and again in May under the new Congress. The 25x'25 Resolution has been carefully crafted to set national renewable energy production targets, while allowing farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and industry the flexibility needed to reach these important goals. 
   Madam Speaker, the new face of energy security and rural development is in the form of a biofuels plant, a gasifier, a windmill, a methane digester or any other technology that will reduce dependence on foreign energy sources. In times of high energy prices, I can think of no one better to supply the United States with a renewable source of energy than the same American farmers and ranchers who have provided the United States and the world with an abundance of safe food and fiber. 
   Expanding the production and the use of renewable energy is an important priority, not just for agriculture, but for the entire country in our pursuit of energy independence. The 25x'25 Coalition has grown over the past several years, and now includes endorsements from more than 590 business, conservation, agriculture and forestry organizations. As renewable energy use continues to expand, new innovations, including the promising growth of cellulosic ethanol, will not only provide for our energy needs; they will also produce environmental and conservation benefits. 
   I think the future of energy production from agriculture and forestry is the most exciting thing that has happened in rural America in my lifetime. The 25x'25 Resolution states our commitment to support the development of renewable energy sources. I believe we can not only meet but exceed the goal of 25 percent by the year 2025. 
   But every journey starts with a first step, and this resolution is a very important first step that we can take in achieving this energy independence. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support and again urge the support of the House for the passage of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I ask my colleagues to listen up here because this has been a very difficult bill and there has been numerous problems that have developed every day for the last year-and-a-half. I guess it's appropriate that there would be a problem that would be developing today as well. 
   When the enrolling clerk enrolled the bill to send to the White House, somehow or another they inadvertently, or however it happened, did not include the trade title, title III of the bill, in the official documents that went to the White House. So the President vetoed the bill minus the trade title, title III. 
   The trade title includes the food aid programs, including McGovern-Dole; it includes the market promotion; the export credit program; the market access program, and it also includes the soft wood lumber certification program. 
   So we are moving ahead to override the veto that the President has done. But we have this issue that one of the titles is missing from the bill. We have a process after we get through the override to try to deal with that issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President's veto message said that when the commodity prices are high, it's irresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops and subsidize additional crops and so forth. We made some adjustments in some of the price supports to try to rebalance the system from what it has been in the past. These were modest, and I think it's questionable that you would use this as one of the items in the veto override. 
   As I have worked through this process, I spent more time than anybody else talking to the White House, trying to avoid the situation we are in today, where the President has vetoed this bill. I don't know that anybody else has spent more time trying to work with the White House. The problem has been that they keep changing the objections to the bill, and 2 or 3 weeks ago, when we tried to engage the White House to be able to work with them in a negotiating fashion to take into consideration some of their concerns, their position was that, well, they had these demands but they really weren't in a position or willing to negotiate with us. 
   So we have come to this day where the White House has vetoed this bill,  which I regret. But we have a good bill that I think all of us should be proud of. It maintains a safety net for farmers, by and large, in the way it was done in the 2002 bill. We did make some changes; reductions in crop insurance and some other areas. We included a new disaster program that is paid for, that would be an unusual situation because generally the disaster ad hocs that we have done have not been paid for. So we think we have made some improvements in area. 
   We responded to the concern of people around the country of food costs and the way food prices have gone up by taking all of the new money, the whole $10 billion of new money that was put into the bill over and above the baseline and we have put that into nutrition programs. $10.364 billion in this bill was put into nutrition programs. That includes modernizing and indexing food stamps; $1.25 billion for food shelves and food banks that are basically bare right now; and also a new fruit and vegetable snack program for folks in low-income schools so that our kids can have healthy snacks and have an alternative to some of the things that they are now snacking on. We also made some changes, as I said, in the commodity area so that we could improve substantially conservation. We have added a specialty crop title to this bill, and we have also added an energy title to this bill. 
   So we have responded to what we heard when we traveled the country under the leadership of then-Chairman GOODLATTE. We have responded to all of the areas. We think we have a bill that is responsible, that is paid for without tax increases, that puts the priorities where they need to be in this country. 
   I would ask my colleagues to follow up on the good vote that we had last Wednesday on the bill when it was on the floor and give us the majority today to override the President's veto. 
   With that, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, a lot of people make a lot of claims about this bill. Editorial writers, most of them get the information wrong. But as has been mentioned here before, 15 percent of the bill goes to farmers; 9 percent of that goes to traditional commodity type programs; the balance of it to crop insurance and the new disaster program; 73 1/2 percent of this bill goes to nutrition programs, while 7 percent goes to conservation. 
   So you can talk all you want about the bull's-eye on the back of the farmers, but people need to understand that the European Union now is having discussion to get rid of their direct payments and increase their commodity price supports similar to what we have here in the United States. And there are people in this country that would like to do this as well. This ideology that's been pushed by the World Bank, the IMF, all of these other world organizations, is part of the reason we're in trouble in this country and in the world. 
   We have, not just us but countries all over the world, have sold food below the cost of our production. Some of our opponents want us to keep doing this. I understand if you're a livestock farmer you want to keep buying cheap corn. But we've addicted these folks in these developing countries to cheap food prices. Now that we're getting prices that are more realistic, all of a sudden it's a problem because they didn't develop their own agriculture. They got hooked on exports from the United States and from other countries. 
   What we're doing in this bill is recognizing all of the different aspects of this country, not just farm country, not just farmers, but people in the city, people in the suburbs, people that like to hunt and fish, people that are concerned about the environment, people that are concerned about getting nutritious food into our schools and having more fresh fruit and vegetables available for people around the country, and people that want to get independent from foreign oil. All of these things are covered in this bill. 
   Are they done to the magnitude that I would like in some areas? No. I would say everybody here would probably agree that they would like to have something a little bit stronger in one area or the other or maybe a little weaker in one area or the other. 
   But this is a compromise, a bipartisan compromise that I am proud of the way that we've been able to put together. Mr. Goodlatte and I sat in that room for many days with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We operated on an equal basis, as Mr. Goodlatte pointed out. There was give and take. This was a true bipartisan effort. We came up with a true bipartisan bill that we should be proud of that is good for America, that spends less than the last farm bill, that, as Mr. Goodlatte says, spends less than both bills that passed the House and the Senate. I can't remember a time around here when we've done something like that. 
   So I encourage my colleagues to take a good look at this bill to understand that this is something that's good for the country. I urge my colleagues to override the veto of the President.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's been a long road to get to this point, and I want to start off by thanking Mr. Goodlatte, the ranking member of the committee, again for his great work; my subcommittee chairmen, who started this process off; the ranking members on the Republican side; my friends on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel especially, Mr. Pomeroy, for their hard work to get to this point; the Speaker for backing us up and helping us keep on track here to get to a final consideration; and for all of my colleagues in the House for being patient and working with us and giving us your input. 
   We have come to a point where I believe we have a good bill that should be supported by all Members of this Congress from both urban, suburban and rural areas. 
   I have here a chart that shows how the current farm bill spending is going to be allocated on a 10-year basis, which is what we have to go by. 
   Nutrition in this new Food, Conservation, and Energy Act is 74 percent of the spending over the next 10 years in this food bill, commodities are 16 percent. Back in 2002, these numbers were 65 and 35 or something. Conservation is 7 percent; and energy and the specialty crops, the other items, are 3 percent. 
   This shows on another chart how we got to those numbers. We had a $58 billion reduction in our baseline. What happened, before we started because the prices were up and the amount of money going out to farmers was down, so we started off $58 billion in the hole. We were provided $10 billion from our friends in the Ways and Means Committee of additional spending over the baseline, and this is how that spending was allocated out. 
   Nutrition was more than the $10 billion of new money that was put in the bill, $10.3 billion; conservation, an additional $4 billion; specialty crops, $2.3 billion; and in the commodity title, we actually had a reduction. In addition to the $58 billion that we reduced, we had another $3.6 billion that we took out of the commodity title to help put money into these other areas. 
   Having done that, we still have an adequate safety net for farmers. It's very much like the current law that we have been operating under. We have made some minor changes, and we have brought the AGI limits down from $2.5 million to $500,000 on non-farm income, $750,000 on farm income. So we've made some reform, not as much as some people would like, but more than others would like. We got both sides a little bit upset so I think we're doing something pretty close to what we should. 
   And to show you how the allocation is based on what the 2002 bill was and what the current bill is, this shows in yellow the 2002 bill and in the kind of purple color the current bill. In nutrition, you can see there's a substantial increase. Conservation, the commodity title is down, and energy is up a little bit. 
   So we have I think a balanced bill that maintains a safety net. It includes a new disaster program that is paid for. This bill is paid for. The $10 billion comes out of a custom user fee extension which is not a tax increase, which has allowed us to have a bipartisan bill. 
   We've put a bill together here that I think addresses what people are concerned about in this country. It has a loan guarantee program for cellulosic ethanol.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I yield myself an additional 1 minute. 
   It has a bioenergy reserve program to allow us to learn how to grow switch grass and how to harvest it and store it and move it; woody biomass so we can get cellulosic ethanol going. 
   We have for the first time significant money in for fruits and vegetables, which are 50 percent of the agriculture in the United States. 
   We have country-of-origin labeling. It's going to be mandatory on fruits and vegetables and meats starting September 30. We have interstate meat shipment, another issue that's been hanging on for 20 years. 
   We've solved a lot of problems in this bill. We have a bill I think that covers all the interests in the country, and we have a bill that we should all be proud to vote for in this House. 
   Again, I want to thank all my colleagues for their hard work and look forward to having a strong vote on this and encourage you all to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the Congressman from New York for his remarks and his work on this issue. 
   These are, indeed, some serious concerns about the implementation of the New York CREP and its impact on the gentleman's muck farmers. It is my understanding that USDA and the State of New York have taken steps to ensure that any new enrollments will not have such negative impacts. 
   The conference report under consideration directs the Secretary to work with the producers in New York's muck soil areas to use existing programs to help implement farm bill conservation programs on acres still under production. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the Congressman from New York on this issue in the future. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to my good friend, the gentleman from New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, without whose tremendous work we wouldn't be here today. So, Mr. Rangel, we very much appreciate, on the Agriculture Committee, your effort, and you, Mr. Pomeroy, as well, to help us get this bill to the final end.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to echo Mr. Goodlatte's comments. I have a list of all of the staff members, majority and minority, that I would like entered into the Record to honor their work. You think we've been through a process here. It's nothing compared to what the staff has done, and so they deserve our thanks. And they're going to, hopefully, get a little bit of rest now once we get this over with. 
   To follow on Mr. Goodlatte's comments, there's a lot of reform in this bill that I would call real reform, as opposed to ginned-up reform that's been done by different folks. We have made huge changes in the conservation programs that are going to make those programs work a lot better in the future, work for more different parts of the country. 
   We have a new revenue-based countercyclical program that we're going to try out on an optional basis for the next 5 years that may be the new future direction of the farm bill, depending on how it works out. So we've got a lot of reforms in this bill that never get talked about because all anybody wants to focus on is AGI. 
   Well, I don't have any problem putting an AGI limit on nonfarmers, because, frankly, I don't think they should be in farming in the first place. We've got enough capital in agriculture. We don't need folks from outside of agriculture coming in and being involved. That's my personal opinion. 
   But, you know, we've got a $500,000 limit. We'd have gone lower, but that's as far as we could get. 
   We put a limit on farmers, on farm income for the first time, in spite of the fact that this is the only part of business people in this country that are getting benefits from the Federal Government that are requiring an AGI, that I know of. I don't know why farmers get singled out and nobody else does, why we don't have an AGI on oil companies and whoever else is getting benefits from the Federal Government. That continues to mystify me. 
   But I just have to clarify, you know, people keep manipulating these statistics. We've fixed some of that in this bill as well, which I would call reform. But as to what Mr. Goodlatte said earlier, we have a $500,000 hard cap on nonfarm income. So I suppose that if you earn $500,000 as a doctor or something, your wife earned $500,000 as a doctor, and then you had a farm and you earned $750,000 as a farmer, and your wife had a real farm and earned $750,000 you could get to $2.5 million. But I think you need to understand that, in order for you to qualify for that, you're going to have a real genuine farm, and it has to be your income, certified by a CPA or a lawyer, and if it's not, if they do it wrong they're going to go to jail and you are, too. 
   So I think the likelihood of anybody getting to this $2.5 million limit is almost nonexistent. That is a bogus argument that's being put out there, being ginned up by people that want to keep this fight going on. 
   So if you want to put a $200,000 cap on everybody that gets money from the Federal Government on AGI, then we'll be right there with you. But I don't think that's going to happen. 
   Just like we tried to put AGI limits on conservation. We had a revolt. Some of these conservation groups that have been pushing these payment limits, as soon as we said we're going to have the same limit on them as farmers, we had a revolt. 
   This is a good bill. It's got a lot of reform. I thank everybody. We'll appreciate a good vote to get this over with.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I haven't seen the entire list that's being talked about here, but a couple of the things that have been mentioned are not earmarks, and I don't know why the gentleman continues to characterize them as such. 
   First of all, this is not an earmark, it does not define Plum Creek. What it says is that these bonds can be used for any habitat conservation plans that protect native fish or any forest land covered by these habitat conservation plans. 
   We know of at least seven habitat conservation plans that would qualify under this provision. So, therefore, it's not an earmark. The Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan in King County, Washington, the Plum Creek Timber plan, which is also in Washington, the Washington Department of Natural Resources Forest Practices Habitat Conservation Plan in Washington, the West Fork Timber plan in Washington, the Plum Creek Native Fish Habitat Conservation Plan in Montana and Idaho, Green Diamond and Pacific Lumber, both in California. 
   So this is not an earmark, because any of these would qualify. There are probably more that we don't know about. Now, this was in the Senate bill, so I don't know what you are talking about airdropped. 
   A couple of the others that I heard you mention were also in the Senate bill, and there is another one that you characterize as an earmark, which is not an earmark, and that's the salmon recovery disaster plan which was a plan that was actually first passed in the 2006 Congress by the Republican majority, was implemented in 2006. Fifty million dollars at that time was put out to the people that were in the commercial fishing industry, primarily off the coast of California. 
   At that time there was a partial shutdown of the salmon season. Now, this year, we have a complete shutdown of the salmon season all along the coast from California to Oregon to Washington State. So it's much broader, and it not only shut down the commercial fishing, it shut down the recreational fishing in those areas. 
   What we are doing is replenishing this disaster fund with money that is exactly similar to what was done, what was in the statute and it was actually disbursed in 2006, because the disaster is much bigger this year than it was in 2006 because we had a partial shutdown. Now we have an entire shutdown of three States. 
   So this is clearly not an earmark, this is in the disaster title of the farm bill that goes along with the other disaster provisions that are in the farm bill. You know, I don't know, I guess because apparently some people think that being against earmarks is popular and, whatever, they try to make this into an issue. 
   But a number of the provisions that were raised by the gentleman are clearly not earmarks. The House bill that passed out of here had no earmarks. 
   We had to deal with the other body, and we took some provisions from the other body, because that's how a conference works. You know, there is a lot worse stuff that was in that bill that we took out. I just want to clear the record that a number of things being talked about here are not earmarks, and I would encourage my colleagues not to support this point of order.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. The House bill didn't have a paid-for disaster provision in it, the Senate bill did. And so when we molded these together, we put these disaster provisions in, and we paid for them, the first time that we actually paid for a disaster with pay-as-you-go money, and we included the California disaster in the process and paid for it. 
   This is not a new program. As I said, it is not an earmark, and it was brought in because we were dealing with a disaster. This is clearly a disaster. Any place that you have a complete shutdown of a commercial fishery, they are going to be in asking for help from the Federal Government. That is appropriate. This was brought in, the permanent disaster program from the Senate, and funded when we molded them together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman, and I wasn't going to prolong this, but just like I had to take issue with saying earmarks were there that aren't there, I take very much issue with your saying we are waiving PAYGO. We are not waiving PAYGO. We are not waiving PAYGO in this bill. We are meeting PAYGO requirements based on the 2007 baseline which is what we started the bill under. This is what the rules are in the Senate. 
   Let me explain my point first, and then I will be happy to yield. 
   So the Senate has a rule that says under whatever baseline you start off with, that you continue under that baseline with the bill until a new budget resolution is passed by both the House and the Senate. For whatever reason, the House has a different rule when we adopted that, and it says once you file the Budget Committee report in the House, not when it is passed, if a new baseline comes along, you are supposed to use that. But clearly, we cannot write a bill of this magnitude and this scope having two different baselines. We can't have one baseline in the Senate and another baseline in the House. That is number one. 
   Number two, the common practice around this place has always been to follow this rule, that we always use the baseline that we started off with. That is what we have done for years. So all we are doing is complying with what the Senate rule is because we have to do that and it makes sense. We are not trying to waive anything. We are not trying to get around anything. This bill, it meets PAYGO requirements and it meets it under the 2007 baseline which is what we started the bill under. And we are not waiving PAYGO.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bill. This has been a long, drawn-out process. It has been a long time since last July when we first passed this bill out of the House. 
   I want to first of all commend my ranking member and good friend and colleague, Mr. Goodlatte, for the tremendous work that he did on behalf of this bill and his caucus. As was said earlier, this bill is a much better bill because of the involvement of Mr. Goodlatte and the great work that he did. I very much thank him for sticking with us here to the end. 
   We obviously would have preferred to have been here earlier, but this was a difficult bill to work out because of all the competing interests, and the fact that we started off with $58 billion less in baseline than we had back in the 2002 bill. 
   In order to make all the accommodations for the different folks that were interested in improvements in this bill, we had to find additional resources outside of the Agriculture Committee, which caused additional problems. We had to deal with a much different bill in the Senate, where you had a lot of powerful committee chairmen that brought issues into the bill that were not in the House bill. 
   We have worked through all of that, and we have produced a product here that I think it isn't perfect, but satisfies, in most cases, the different interests in this bill. We maintain a safety net for farmers along the lines of what we have had in the past. 
   I, personally, would like the safety net to be stronger than it is, but it's what can be accomplished at this point. We have $10 billion of new spending above the baseline in this bill, and that $10 billion is--I guess money is fungible, but the increase in this bill for nutrition is $10.3 billion. You could say that we have improved the nutrition funding to the amount of new money that's put in the bill. This is money going into the food shelves, food  banks that right now are empty and very much needed. There is a new fresh food and vegetable snack program for kids in low-income schools, and there is improvement in food stamps. 
   We have a good bill that has a lot of other components. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and support the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5813, a bill to temporarily extend the current farm programs until April 25, 2008. 
   Madam Speaker, since the House conferees were appointed last week, the conference committee has been meeting to try to work out the remaining unresolved issues between the House and Senate version of the farm bill. I'm pleased to report that on the core farm bill issues we have reached agreement, and there are only a few Member-level issues that must be resolved. 
   I want to take this moment right now to thank Chairman Rangel, who has devoted a great deal of his time and his staff's time to helping us to come to resolution with the Senate about how to fund the additional $10 billion of new spending for farm bill priorities. Without his leadership and that of Speaker Pelosi and the leaders on the Republican side, we would not be so close to finalizing this bill. 
   The farm bill maintains and strengthens the safety net that helps farmers and ranchers stay productive and competitive. It also includes important new investments including $9.5 billion for nutrition programs that are even more important today as food prices continue to climb. It contains $4 billion for conservation programs that will help protect our land, even as crop reduction soars; $1.2 billion for renewable energy programs that will help us address the rising cost of gasoline and help us get independent of foreign oil; and $1.3 billion for new initiatives and programs to support fruit and vegetable producers, including new programs to help socially disadvantaged and beginning farmers and ranchers. 
   All these important investments will be lost if we don't have time to finish this conference. This short extension will allow us to finish our work and bring back to the House a conference report that meets the needs of all of American agriculture and the consumers. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to report that I've been in conversations with Chairman Rangel and others that have been involved in the effort to identify the offsets, and can report that they have made significant progress, that we have been able to, apparently, convince the Senate to jettison the extraneous items, and so now we're talking about $10 billion instead of $12.5 billion, which is a major accomplishment and victory, and we are getting very close to being able to resolve the differences in the offsets because, where we've been at is the House has put out one set of offsets and the Senate has put out another, and we're trying to reconcile that. 
   I also, last night, had discussions with the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Goodlatte and others, asking that the Secretary and the White House be brought into this negotiation to help us finish up. And from what I can tell, there appears to be an effort to get that engaged. So I think we're very close to having this offset issue resolved, hopefully, in a way that will have the bipartisan support in this body, as well as in the other body, and also hopefully have the support, at the end of the day, of the White House. 
   And that is what Mr. Goodlatte and I have been struggling to accomplish since last July. We've made a lot of progress. We're not there yet, but we feel we've made huge progress in the last few days, enough to warrant another 1-week extension of the farm bill so that we can finish up our work. 
   I want to commend Congressman Goodlatte for his outstanding leadership in this effort, his outstanding leadership when he was chairman of the committee last session, and getting this farm bill process started. And I can tell you that, without a doubt, that we would not be at this point without him being willing to work with us and help us make some tough decisions to get to where we are. So I just appreciate very much he and his staff and the leadership that they've shown because, over in the House, what we're trying to do here is not only have a bill that we can be proud of, but also have a bill we can pass. And I think we're heading in that direction. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I thank Mr. Goodlatte for his kind words. I would just make one final comment, that we are extending this bill for 1 week at this point because we feel that's sufficient time to come to resolution. 
   I do want to warn people that we fully expect to have these things wrapped up by the 25th in terms of having the policy differences in the Ag Committee and the funding differences resolved. But everybody needs to understand that after that, we're going to need an additional extension probably of 2 weeks in order, this is a very complex, huge bill. It's going to take us time to pull together to enroll to get passed through the House and the Senate and get to the President in time for him to read it before he signs it. So people can expect that we're going to have to have another couple of weeks after next Friday, provided we get everything resolved, which I expect we will. 
   Again I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), all the other people that have worked with us, and encourage my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte). 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm not going to take a lot of time because I think people have heard enough about this issue, and we apologize. I guess we have to be in this position, but what we're doing here today is overriding the veto hopefully for the final time on the farm bill because of the enrolling error that was made on the initial override or veto that happened a few weeks ago. 
   At the time, we made a decision to move ahead. Even though the wrong bill was vetoed, we moved ahead to override that veto, which we prevailed on the floor here by a substantial margin. I think in retrospect that was a good idea because 14 titles of the farm bill have been law since then. 
   We had a meeting this morning with the Secretary to talk about implementation. So the work has been going on within the department to get ready for implementation. We have gained a couple or 3 weeks in that process. Just a couple of days ago, the administration Secretary put out the loan rates and target prices for this crop year. So that process is moving along. 
   What this bill does, the 14 titles are now law. The trade title was left out. What this bill does is reenact the entire 15 titles as they were passed by the original conference report and does it all as one complete whole. And in the bill, what it does, it vitiates the 14 titles that have been law for the last 3 weeks I guess, or so. 
   It cleans up the technical problem that we had created by the enrolling office and puts into law what was intended by the conference committee. 
   This is a good bill. It has wide support in the Congress, as we have seen by the number of votes that we've had here on the floor. It is not perfect, but it does address all of the issues that have been brought to the Agriculture Committee by the various different groups that have been interested in this piece of legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to override the veto. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I would just take one additional small amount of time to thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Goodlatte, for the work that he did with me on this bill. As he said, this has been a bipartisan effort; had it not been, we wouldn't be here today. So I very much want to thank him and the other Members on his side of the aisle as well as the Members on our side of the aisle for all their hard work through this process. 
   And also, I want to mention our staff, both my staff and the minority staff. The amount of time that they put into this bill has been extraordinary, the patience that they showed, having to sit in meetings and not make much progress for a lot of time is what you really want to see in public service.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Chairman, today we have a bill before us that is known as the farm bill, but this bill is much more than about farms. It is about the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and, increasingly, the fuel that we will use. 
   The farm bill assures that we will have a safe, strong food supply now and for years to come. It funds nutrition programs and ensures that working families have enough to eat. It provides conservation programs to protect the environment. It funds rural development programs in support of our rural communities nationwide. You can see that this farm bill is certainly about more than just farms. 
   In addition to these important priorities, this farm bill also provides the safety net that allows our Nation's farmers and ranchers to continue to provide the food, fiber, and fuel that meet the needs of Americans and people around the world. 
   America is still the world's breadbasket, and that is something we should be proud of. Over the past year, my colleagues and I have traveled across the country from New York to Alabama, to my neck of the woods in Minnesota, and all the way to California. We heard from folks who are out there every day working the land, producing a diverse range of agriculture products. 
   The farm bill is a product of agreements that we have reached by consulting everyone interested in this process. In addition to hearings across the country, we have worked with nutrition advocates, conservation and environmental organizations, renewable energy groups, and representatives from all parts of the fruit and vegetable industry, in addition to the farm groups traditionally involved in the farm bill. 
   At the end of that process, we now have more than 100 organizations representing conservation, nutrition, rural development, renewable energy, labor and farm groups that have signed on in support of this bill. I think that this unprecedented support is a direct result of our efforts to be inclusive in this farm bill process. 
   There are very few issues that the National Farmers Union and the American Farm Bureau Federation can agree on, but at the end of the day, they both support this bill. 
   The members of these groups who support our farm bill are the real experts on farm policy because it is a reality that they live each day of their lives. They are the ones on the land planting the crops, managing the livestock and taking the risk inherent in the industry of farming. They are the ones who represent the people using the farm bill's nutrition programs. They are the ones working to implement good conservation practices in the communities across this country. If they support our bill, then I know that we're doing the right thing. 
   This farm bill also includes significant reforms. Of course, some people think we went too far. Others think we didn't go far enough. But everybody seems to agree that they never thought that we could get an agreement that went as far as it has. That is what this farm bill is about. We got the different groups into the room and produced an agreement that everyone feels like they've been part of the process, even if they didn't get exactly what they wanted. 
   This bill does make significant changes, including a hard cap on subsidies for the first time ever. We've taken the $2.5 million adjusted gross income cap down to $500,000. And we have put a hard cap on of $1 million so that anybody over $1 million of adjusted gross income will not receive farm payments after this bill passes. 
   We have also cut the soft cap that I mentioned on adjusted gross income to $500,000. We also, in this bill, required direct attribution for the first time of farm program payments so that people won't be able to get around the payment limits by receiving payments through different business entities. These are not insignificant by any means, and these changes will affect thousands of farmers nationwide. 
   In the area of conservation, too, we have made significant changes as well as new investments. One thing we've done, we have included the same kind of payment limits on conservation programs that we have had for farm programs. That way, there's more money available to more farmers to participate in these popular programs. 
   The bill also includes $3.8 billion in new spending for conservation programs over the next 5 years. These programs help farmers protect the environment with programs that reduce erosion, enhance water supply, improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat, and reduce damage caused by floods and other natural disasters. 
   This farm bill provides new resources to protect and preserve the Chesapeake Bay and other high-priority areas, and it encourages private land owners to provide public access for hunting, fishing and other recreational activities. 
   In the area of renewable energy, this farm bill invests in programs that will help encourage the development of cellulosic ethanol in this country. In my opinion, this represents the future for American agriculture. Once we can establish the first facilities that can make ethanol from agricultural waste and other biomass products, we will take a huge step in a new direction for agriculture and for rural America.  
   Many of the best feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol will also provide benefits for wildlife and for the environment. Renewable fuels have brought new investment and new jobs for rural America, and this is one of the most exciting things that's happened in my life and in American agriculture. 
   We have also proposed increases in the farm bill's nutrition title. This has been a source of some controversy this week, but not because people disagree with the idea that we should be increasing these benefits which have been stagnant for many years and making sure that benefits keep pace with inflation, 
   Instead, the controversy has involved the proposal that the Ways and Means Committee has proposed to offset the cost of these changes. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize that there is a difference between closing a loophole in current tax law and increasing taxes. This proposal won't raise taxes, but it will hold some foreign companies who should be paying taxes accountable for what they owe. 
   The Agriculture Committee agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that these changes in the nutrition program were important to help working Americans access these nutrition programs, and we have found a reasonable, fiscally responsible way to do this. 
   Another area where this farm bill makes great strides is in funding for programs that strengthen the fruit and vegetable industry. We have worked with this industry and have included $1.5 billion in new mandatory money for them in this farm bill. That's the first time that we've done this. 
   The Specialty Crop Alliance, United Fresh, and many other fruit and vegetable groups strongly support this bill as passed by the Agriculture Committee. 
   We also worked with several caucuses in crafting this bill, including the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Native American Caucus. With the Congressional Black Caucus, we have worked to address important issues, including a program in the manager's amendment that will help black farmers who did not get their day in court due to inadequate notice and an arbitrary deadline established after the Pigford case was settled. This provision will allow farmers who filed their claims after the national deadline to have their cases heard. 
   We have also included other provisions to make USDA programs more accessible to minority, socially disadvantaged and beginning farmers and ranchers. This includes provisions to expand access to land, credit, conservation and rural development programs. 
   One of the most important compromises reached in this farm bill was an agreement to finally, after a long delay, implement mandatory country of origin labeling. We put both sides in the room; we told them to come out with a compromise, and they delivered. As a result, with this farm bill, consumers in this country will finally be able to tell where their fruit and vegetables and meat products in their grocery stores are coming from, and we think it's about time. 
   We accomplished all of this under an open process where everyone was included. All members of our committee were engaged in this process, and I'm proud to say that some of our newest freshman Members, including colleagues that have been there for years, really brought a lot of constructive ideas and a spirit of bipartisan cooperation to the table and helped us come up with a bill that we are all very proud of. 
   There is something in this bill for everybody to like. There's probably something in this bill for everybody not to like. But it's a step in the right direction and has broad support, as I said, from many organizations. And I encourage my colleagues to support this farm bill which supports all of us with food, fiber and fuel. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would say to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) we have enjoyed working with you and your Members, but I don't agree with you. I don't believe there is a tax increase in this bill. I have looked at it. I am a CPA, and I think you can say it either way, but I don't believe it is a tax increase. 
   The $60 billion did come out of baseline not because anybody cut it, but because the program worked the way it is supposed to. Prices are up and spending went down. We are missing the money, but it wasn't because anybody cut it. 
   We have a good bill, and I encourage all Members to support it.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Chairman, I recognize myself for 1 minute. 
   This so-called reform bill, we just got the CBO score. First of all, it changes the payment limits based on the 2002 bill. So, the effect of this bill is to have no limitation on payments at all, number one. 
   We are writing a 10-year baseline, not a 5-year bill. This bill cuts conservation 37 1/2 percent below our baseline over 10 years. It actually takes less out of crop insurance by 13.5 percent compared to our bill over 10 years. And this is what happens when people aren't on the Agriculture Committee and get involved in this very complex area. If this is a reform bill, if this is freedom to farm, we would have a heck of a mess in farm country. 
   So we just got this score. We wish we could have got this out earlier. We got it about 2 hours ago, and I just want people to know what this bill actually does. It does not do what some people have been saying.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the good people of Minnesota who have banded together to begin the healing process. When that bridge fell, every citizen of my State felt the grief and the pain together. It has certainly been a difficult couple of days for everyone, but I am so proud of the first responders, of the volunteers, and of my colleagues here in the House. I'd like to give a special thanks to Chairman Oberstar, for acting so quickly. He has represented Minnesota, and the House, very well. I'd also like to say that Representative Ellison has done a remarkable job in representing his district during these last 48 hours. 
   It is a shame that it sometimes takes the worst events to bring out the best in people, but I am so proud of the wonderful actions Minnesotans have taken to help the victims of  the I35W bridge. I think the people involved in the recovery actions have truly demonstrated the incredible character of Minnesota's citizens. 
   Nothing can replace what was lost on Wednesday. No amount of money will do that. Neither will a new bridge. But this bill is a strong step on the road to healing. Thank you Chairman Oberstar, thank you to the members of the Minnesota Delegation and thank you to all my colleagues who have helped support the citizens of my State.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I want to thank the gentlelady and Mr. Obey and others for working to put together this bill. 
   The Agriculture Committee is very interested, obviously, in the disaster provisions in this bill. It's something that we've been working on for a long time and we've been trying to get accomplished the last couple of years. 
   In my particular district, we had our agriculture disaster back in May of 2005, and the guys are still having a tough time keeping their head above water. We've been waiting a long time for this. 
   As has been said by other people, this is something that affects just about every part of the country. And it is a true emergency because this is something that is beyond the control of producers, and it is something that we ought to, as a government, be responding to. We do it for homeowners and businesses, when we have a hurricane or a flood or a tornado or some kind of event like that, with FEMA. We have a process where we take care of this. A lot of times we put emergency money into that to take care of the disaster, and it is only fit and proper that we do the same kind of thing for folks in agriculture. 
   We, on the committee, have been working with the ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee and the full committee on this language. I just want people to know that this is the tightest language that has ever been written on a disaster bill. It has really been focused in on the folks that had the problem.     
   One of the most important things, for the first time, and this has not been something that has been able to be accomplished in the past, we are going to require that people have crop insurance in order for them to be able to be paid under this disaster bill. That is a big reform, and it gets us a long ways in the right direction. What we are hoping to do this year in the farm bill is put in a provision so that we can have this covered in the regular order as part of our regular farm program.

   If I could engage in a conversation with the gentleman, as he knows, I think that some of the elements of this are something that we should do. It's just, as I said, we're not there yet. 
   In addition, as you know, I have an interest in looking at this issue of NRCS doing administrative work within their agency. We've been talking about that as well. I still believe that it would be better if we transferred that function over to FSA like they're doing now at CRP. 
   So if the gentleman would agree, I am very much interested in working with him on this issue. I think we can get something accomplished over the next period of time until we end up in conference with the Senate. So if the gentleman would be willing to withdraw, I will make the commitment that we will work on this in a serious way, because I think we can get something done here.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his outstanding leadership on this issue now and in the past. This is something that I support. 
   A recent report by the U.S. International Trade Commission shows the United States was a main supplier of ag products to Cuba last year, accounting for 30 percent of the island's imports. This report indicates that number could increase to 50 percent if the United States would only end some of its decades-long restrictions on trade between the two nations. This report shows that lifting the trade and travel restrictions against Cuba can have a real effect on the U.S. farm economy. 
   Unfortunately, since 2000, American farmers and other ag exporters have been allowed to sell goods to Cuba only on a cash-only basis. So with elimination of all such travel and trade restrictions, U.S. exports to Cuba could almost double from the 2006 level. The largest gains would be fresh fruits, vegetables, milk powder, processed foods, and certain meats. 
   This amendment is long overdue and would take care of those factors and finally allow our ag producers to benefit from Cuban trade.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Boehner is a good friend of mine, and I am reluctant to oppose this amendment but I must. 
   This provision was part of the administration's farm bill proposal. The benefit of daily posted county prices is that farmers have the greatest amount of flexibility in responding to market price changes, which have become, as indicated by Mr. Boehner, increasingly volatile, and the farmers have very little power in this marketplace. This is something that I think we clearly should retain for them so that they've got some ability to deal with what happens in the marketplace. 
   Moving to a monthly posted county price may save money, but as I said, it hampers, weakens the effectiveness of the marketing loan program as a safety net feature, which is one of the primary things we're trying to do in this farm bill. 
   According to a letter from the National Grain and Feed Association, this proposal would be highly disruptive to the efficient operation of the cash grain marketplace. 
   The entire General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected this approach when it defeated an amendment containing the administration's proposal that had this feature in it. 
   This amendment, this idea has no support in the agricultural community; and, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

Mr. Chairman, I think what people need to  understand, the farmer that sold the day before Katrina got his money out of the marketplace, and what the LDP did is protect those farmers that sold later to get the same price that farmer got right before Katrina. So that's exactly what this is supposed to do. 
   Farmers don't have any power in this marketplace to speak of. If you want to give all the power to the big guys, go to this system. It's not what we want to do in the Ag Committee.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Manzullo and I are good friends, and I allowed him to modify his amendment, but I have to very strongly oppose this amendment. 
   We've added several billion dollars to the conservation baseline in this bill, and even with that, we still have big backlogs in these programs. It's going to go a long ways to correcting that, but one of the ways that we're going to make this money go further is by applying the same payment limitations to these conservation programs that we're applying to title I. 
   And the question to me is the same. If the argument is that we have large farms that shouldn't be entitled to title I payments, then why is it all right for large folks to be entitled to title II payments? 
   What this will do, the changes that we've made are going to make this go further. It's going, I would say, to allow smaller producers a better opportunity to have access to these limited programs. 
   And so I guess I would just say what is good for the goose is good for the gander, that we're applying these same limitations all across the programs. I understand that some of the larger folks aren't going to like this; but, you know, this is what we need. 
   So I hear arguments against this because somehow or another conservation is different, but with the payment limitations, the effect of that is to actually weaken the title I safety net for producers.     
   So, it is just not right to have a different standard for these conservation programs. I ask my colleagues to stick with the committee's position. I strongly oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, we reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I understand what you are saying, but the reality is, if the argument is that wealthy farmers should somehow be limited to title I payments, then from my perspective, if you got enough money to build a great big huge factory farm or if you got enough money to go out and buy 5 million acres, I don't know why the government needs to help if you've got that much money to do that. 
   What we're doing here is we're seeing that this is spread across everybody. What it will do is it will make this available to a lot more people. It will make it available to smaller farmers. Frankly, if you have big operations, I think you can pick up this cost and make it part of the cost of doing business. 
   I understand what you are saying, but I just disagree, given the amount of money we have.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I want to thank the gentleman from Vermont for bringing up this very important issue. As you know, that version of the farm bill that the House Agriculture Committee reported contains a request for the study of Federal Milk Marketing Orders. 
   As we began the farm bill process last year, we traveled around the country listening to producers, processors and other members of the dairy industry. What we heard was that the Federal Milk Marketing Order system was in need of reform, and we have taken steps to address that. 
   The committee bill establishes a system to review this system and report its findings to Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture. The committee hopes and expects that this study will provide information necessary to develop the changes that modernize and rationalize milk marketing regulations in this country. 
   The committee recognizes the concern that this commission could lead to delay within the Department regarding ongoing efforts to reform the improvement of the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. We do not wish this to be the case and have directed the Secretary to address that concern in the committee substitute. 
   So, if the gentleman is willing to withdraw his amendment, I would extend an offer to work with him in conference to make sure that his concerns on energy and feed costs are incorporated into the commission study.

   The quote that my good friend read is an accurate quote; at the time, that's what I thought. But I just want to make clear that in my opinion what we're doing here is not a tax increase. And frankly, what we ought to be doing is investigating why we have all these people on the payroll at the State Department and at the Treasury going out and negotiating deals so we can have foreign corporations come to the United States and avoid paying taxes. And all we're doing is trying to stop that. So I don't see this as a tax increase.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I am now pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez), the esteemed Chair of the House Small Business Committee. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, Chairman Peterson and I agreed that I would not offer an amendment based on our mutual support for the amendment's purpose. I want to thank Chairman Peterson for his leadership on H.R. 2419, and I would like to enter into a short colloquy with Chairman Peterson. 
   This farm bill is critical for our economy, good nutrition, our small businesses, and it does a lot for underserved populations too. Low-income and minority communities suffer disproportionately from the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. 
   In many neighborhoods of New York and across the country where farmers markets are scarce, corner stores are the only place residents shop for their weekly groceries. Unfortunately, due to the limitation of space and many obstacles, many of these stores cannot offer fresh produce and other healthy foods. 
   Farmers markets and other non-conventional fruit retail sites are essential and play a large role in bringing our communities nutritious food. But without simple and critical technologies, farmers markets are unable to serve low-income consumers. That is why I strongly support expanding wireless electronic benefit transfers. These EBT debit machines allow food stamp consumers to use their resources for fresher, healthier foods. Wireless EBTs are especially crucial for low-income consumers to use.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I recognize the gentlewoman's leadership. I think we can solve this problem with a letter to USDA. So if the gentlewoman will work with me, we will do that. I think we can get this resolved. I support you on this. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for doing that. That is important not only to provide fresh fruit and produce, but also to fight obesity and other diseases in our country.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. 
   The motion was agreed to. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Serrano) having assumed the chair, Mr. Berry, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2419) to provide for the continuation of agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I have to oppose the gentleman's amendment. Not that I don't support the Grassland Reserve Program, but the provisions of the commodity title were worked out by the committee very carefully in an effort to balance all of the various commodities' needs in that process. We don't think that it is fair to single out one commodity for changes even though it is for a worthwhile purpose. Cotton has already seen major changes with the bill's termination of the storage payments and also major reforms in payment limitations. 
   Additionally, the bill provides 1,340,000 acres to be enrolled in GRP, a substantial increase. I know that the gentleman from Colorado has been a leader in the coalition that has been advocating this program, and I appreciate his efforts and leadership in this area. Unfortunately, targeting any single commodity, in this case, cotton, for further reductions in their safety net is unwarranted and unfair. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer).

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I think that the other gentlemen have eloquently stated the case, and I want to reiterate that this is not a fair process to single out one commodity. 
   I want to take the balance of my time to recognize the tremendous efforts of the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry) in working with us on this farm bill. And also, if he were here, he would be speaking out very strongly on this amendment as well. We oppose this amendment and encourage our colleagues to support us in that regard. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, we had a debate similar to this not too long ago, and I'll say it again, that while we've added several billion dollars to the conservation baseline, we still have backlogs in most of those programs. 
   And the question to me is the same: if large farms shouldn't be eligible for title I payments, why should they be eligible for title II payments? If these operations are diversified enough to have problems with farm income exemption, same question, do they really need Federal payments? 
   So I'd like to hear the arguments against because, to me, a strong title I is necessary to even carry out our conservation programs. If the farmers don't have a strong safety net, that work on conservation is going to be the first thing that's sacrificed. So with limited Federal funds for conservation, we need to make priorities, and providing funds for larger producers and folks with lots of off-the-farm income is a tough choice; but it's a choice we have to make. 
   I'd just like to say that one of the most important reforms that people have pointed to in this bill is that we have finally put a hard cap on adjusted gross income, and this has caused a lot of pain for a lot of people. So it just is not right to have a hard cap on the commodity title and not have a hard cap on conservation. 
   So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for that statement. I want to alert the Members of the body that this motion to recommit has the word ``promptly'' in it. What that means is if this goes back to the committee, this kills this bill. It kills the reform that we have done in this bill. It kills the additional nutrition that has been put into this bill, the energy, all the other hard work of this committee. 
   Now, I am a CPA, and I used to do taxes for a living. I agree with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee: this is not a tax increase. This is doing what is right for this country. 
   What we ought to be looking into is why we are having the taxpayers of this country fund people in the Treasury Department and fund people in the State Department to go out and make treaties with other countries so we can have foreign corporations come to this country and avoid taxes. 
   That is what this is about. If you have a straight-up deal between the United States and Germany, this does not affect you. It only affects you if you set up a corporation in another country that doesn't have a tax rate and go through that process. 
   Mr. Speaker, you can call this whatever you want. But the truth of the matter is that if you send the bill back to the Agriculture Committee, we do not have the offsets in the Agriculture Committee to do what is in this bill. So you are, in effect, killing this bill. I just want everybody to understand that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. (TREATMENT OF FARMS WITH LIMITED BASE ACRES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6849, which will prevent the U.S. Department of Agriculture from denying farm program benefits to farmers who have several small plots of land that are eligible for commodity program payments. 
   H.R. 6849 is a bipartisan bill that was introduced by my House Agriculture Committee colleagues, Representatives BOB ETHERIDGE and JERRY MORAN, the Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee. An amended version of the bill passed the Committee by voice vote last week. 
   On June 30 of this year, about a month after Congress overrode the President's veto on the Farm Bill, the US Department of Agriculture published a notice stating their intent to ``not approve requests for farm combination reconstitutions of farms having base acres of 10 acres or less.'' 
   The Department's notice is a substantial change from what was in place prior to the 2008 Farm Bill and runs contrary to what was intended by House and Senate conferees who wrote the provision. The manager's report states that small base acreages could be aggregated to allow for farm program eligibility if the sum of the acres is over 10. 
   The USDA's decision to eliminate such a large number of base acres could affect hundreds of thousands of producers all across this country. 
   Their selective interpretation of the Farm Bill is doing no favors for America's farmers and ranchers, who are rightly concerned that the Department is ignoring the Congress's clearly stated intent. 
   Madam Speaker, in recognition of the difficulties in paying for this fix over a ten year period, the Committee amended the bill to temporarily solve this problem by suspending the 10 base acre provision for two years. This temporary, less expensive solution is fully offset in order to meet Congressional Paygo requirements. 
   With passage of this bill today, Madam Speaker, it is my hope that we can make clear to farm country that the Farm Bill will be implemented as Congress intended. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6849.
