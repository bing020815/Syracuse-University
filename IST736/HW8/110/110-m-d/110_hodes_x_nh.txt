<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (MICHELLE'S LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise today in support of this bill, Michelle's Law, which honors the memory and life and struggle of Michelle Morse. Michelle's mother, AnnMarie,  and her brother, Michael, are with us today to remember and honor her. 
   Michelle Morse was a college student in Plymouth, New Hampshire. She was like other students. She went to class and hung out with her friends. She was a happy and gifted student preparing to be a school teacher like her mom. She picked her major, childhood studies, because she wanted to dedicate her life to help children. But Michelle Morse and her family were forced to make a choice that students should never have to make: a choice between her health and her health insurance. 
   You see, while in college, Michelle was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer. She had her health insurance through her mother but could only keep her health insurance if she remained a full-time student. Since she was undergoing rigorous chemotherapy treatments, her doctors urged her to take time off from school to focus on her treatment. Michelle was faced with a daunting choice: to keep her health insurance and maintain her full-time student status, or follow her doctors' orders and face colossal health bills for her and her family. 
   Michelle chose to stay in school and keep her health insurance. She continued her chemotherapy treatments and maintained a grade point average above 3.5 which, by anyone's standards, is inspiring and shows just what a strong person Michelle was. Unfortunately, despite her valiant fight against cancer, she succumbed to the weight of the cancer and the rigors of being a full-time student and passed away after she graduated. 
   But this story isn't just about Michelle. It's about Michelle's family who fought with Michelle and continue to fight for Michelle to this day. 
   Michelle's family, led by her mother, AnnMarie, made it their mission to ensure that this choice doesn't have to be made by any other family. AnnMarie Morse began a relentless campaign to change the law in New Hampshire so that students could have a medical leave of absence from college without losing their coverage under their parents' health insurance. 
   When the law was changed in New Hampshire after her tireless efforts and leadership, AnnMarie Morse wanted to make sure that students across the country would have the same protections. 
   So she brought her campaign to Capitol Hill and began her efforts to lobby. She lobbied me, she lobbied other Members of Congress, she lobbied everybody. And let me tell you, there is nothing stopping this mother's love. She called everybody she could and anyone she could in her campaign to protect other people's children from being faced with the same terrible choice she and her daughter had to make. 
   I'm honored to know AnnMarie and the Morse family and to have introduced this legislation aptly named Michelle's Law, a law fueled by a family's love and a special young woman's memory. 
   Michelle's Law would change current health insurance law to allow college students a year of medical leave of absence. Michelle's Law has worked in New Hampshire and can now work for students and families across this great Nation. This commonsense legislation has been embraced by Democrats and Republicans and by groups across the board from the insurance industry to patient advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which has been a leader in advocating for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in strong support of the underlying bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, whose provisions, in the main, have been debated, reviewed, talked about and considered in this House for a year. 
   This legislation, while not perfect, and no legislation is, represents a historic opportunity to move our country toward a secure future. The bill marks a turning point in the Nation's history and answers the call for change that the American people sounded in 2006. 
   The harsh partisan rhetoric from the other side, Mr. Speaker, is a product of the same obsolete thinking which produced our existing energy policy, which has kept this country funneling petrodollars to countries that fund terrorism. 
   The people of my home State of New Hampshire are pressed by soaring gas prices; they're facing a cold winter. But they understand that energy independence, our economy and our national security are inseparable. 
   With this bill we take a firm stand for real security, for healthy families, for a thriving economy, and for a sustainable future for our planet. I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and for the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank my distinguished colleague from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not shocked but disappointed to hear the callous and cynical suggestions from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that Democrats are responsible for the inflation in gas prices that so many Americans are suffering from today, that somehow, in the past 2 years, it is the Democratic energy policy that has caused the inflation in the price of oil and gas. Let us remember that we have two oilmen in the White House and $4 a gallon gas today. Let us remember that we have an energy policy that was made in secret by the Vice President, by the oil companies, for the oil companies and of the oil companies and, today, we are reaping the benefits of that secret energy policy on which we have been stonewalled time and time again. 
   We have 68 million acres of land available on and offshore, on which the oil companies could drill. We have the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska on which the oil companies can drill. Eighty-one percent of all known oil reserves are available to drill on right now. The estimates are that there is a 14-year supply just waiting for Big Oil to put metal to the ground, put metal to the ground and drill. 
   That's why I rise in support of this bill. All the oil companies have to do is to start drilling on available land, and they could help increase supply and help consumers. Calls from the White House and their allies on the other side of the aisle who somehow claim that we should open ANWR and offshore areas to drilling, which in 20 to 30 years might start producing, are cynical attempts to deflect us from the real challenges that Americans face today and that we face as a Nation in going forward to a new energy policy. 
   It's estimated that the average American would spend about $57,800 before the first drop of oil could be produced from ANWR. So what's the point to deflect us from the pain that Americans are feeling now to try to point fingers and to set us aside from changing our energy policy? 
   What part of ``drill now'' don't the oil companies understand? What part of ``drill now'' don't my colleagues understand? No one is stopping the oil companies from drilling. It's time to drill now, help the American people with gas prices, heating oil costs. 
   This bill says ``drill now.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to be here today with other Members of the class of 2006, the caucus of the new Democratic Members of the House of Representatives, the majority makers, to talk today about the Employee Free Choice Act which we passed in this Chamber just a short time ago. 
   I want to congratulate my colleagues on supporting H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, because it is an act that helps set a new direction for our country. If we can see final passage of H.R. 800, it will have a profound impact on working people in our country. 
   I would like to start with an example of why the protection H.R. 800 offers is so desperately needed. Last week I was home for a work week in my district in New Hampshire and I had the opportunity to meet one of my constituents, Emily, a nurse from Concord, New Hampshire. She was interested in improving working conditions at the nursing home where she worked and where she had worked for a long time. 
   So on January 12 of this year, she reached out to a local union to talk about organizing the employees, the other nurses, who were working in her nursing home. Seventeen days later, despite an impeccable history of service and excellent reviews, never had a bad review, no problems with her personnel file, she was fired for what the home called ``insubordination.'' 
   Now, Emily works long hours in an industry that desperately needs qualified people like her. There is a nursing shortage. She loves her job and she cares about her patients and cares about the people she attends to, and the folks that she is working with are also my constituents. They are people who care about the rights of the people who are taking care of them and working with them.     
   Emily deserves to have an advocate for safe and healthy working conditions, and she deserves to have a voice in her workplace. It is people like Emily who need the Employee Free Choice Act. It would make what happened to her illegal, as it should be. It would also penalize employers who intimidate and harass workers who want to join together to negotiate their contracts. 
   It is important to note that there are thousands of responsible employers in our country who are already complying with the Act on a voluntary basis, and that is a good thing. When a majority of their employees sign up to join a union, they recognize it. They do not discriminate against those who are interested in joining together to exercise what ought to be the rights of every worker in this country to collectively bargain. 
   This law that we have passed, that we are hoping to see final passage of, simply brings the rest of America's employers into line with the many who already acknowledge that their employees deserve a voice in their workplace. This is a bill that honors the integrity of work and promotes effective dialogue, dialogue between employers and the employees who are working with them. 
   Now, opponents of this bill, many of the people on the other side of this aisle, point to record corporate profits and soaring executive payouts as proof that we do not need the Employee Free Choice Act. Well, they are right about one thing. The rich in this country sure are getting richer, and in fact, while executive pay has rocketed to 350 times what the average worker makes in a company, real wages for working people have remained stagnant. 
   I have got a chart here today, and it is a wonderful thing because, as you know, this is one of the first sessions that we have had as the new Members in the Democratic majority, the new majority makers, doing what the 30-something Working Group has done so often on the floor over the past few years, educating the American people and our colleagues and each other about what is going on. They have pioneered the use of these kinds of charts, and I just want to point out what this chart shows. 
   This chart shows the value of CEO pay and average worker production pay  from 1990 to 2005. That is over a period of 15 years, and what it really shows is what would have happened to the pay of workers if their pay had kept up with what has happened to the pay of CEOs in America. You can see down here, right down to my far right where we start, we start together at the zero point, and this top line shows what would have happened to worker pay and where it would be now if it had risen at the same rate as CEO pay has risen. 
   The bottom line shows what the actual worker pay, what has happened to actual worker pay. It has risen in this bottom red line very, very little. If it had kept pace with the CEO pay at this point, instead of an average actual worker pay, as shown here, of $28,315, and I want you to think about what it means to raise a family on $28,315 and pay for the kinds of things we have got to pay for today in this country in terms of gas, transportation, health care, schools, food and everything else. 
   The average worker pay would be at $108,138. Clearly, this gap is something that we all ought to be concerned about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman. That is a remarkable story. I am glad you kept your boots. I am glad your boots got you here to be with us to share those stories. 
   And what you are talking about gets me thinking about the history and how we got here. Think about how those in my generation; I am 55, on my way to 56. I am one of those baby boomers who was born at the beginning of the 1950s, grew up through the 1950s and 1960s. And think about what it meant in this country for hard-working families to have organized labor on their side. Think about the factories, the manufacturing, what it meant to us as kids to have ``Made in the U.S.A.'' And what the contribution organized labor and the growing rights of working families meant to this country. 
   This country and its great prosperity that some are enjoying today was built on the back of an organized labor movement throughout the 20th century. And in my particular State in New Hampshire, some people say that the organized labor movement isn't as large as it is in other places. But it is certainly vibrant. 
   But it is not just the organized labor movement we are here to talk about, because really, the Employee Free Choice Act is about all working families. It is about all who are in the middle class or want to get into the middle class that are so important to this country, because today, the squeeze on the middle class is real. Working people in this country have endured blow after blow, including astronomical health care costs. They are up 50 percent a year from the year 2000 to the year 2007. They have been going up at astronomical double digit rates. Think about fuel costs from the year 2000 to today, going up in double digit rates. Ever increasing tuitions. College tuition at public colleges is up 40 percent over the past 5 years. We have seen spikes in housing prices, inflation is on the march. And now, in the first years of this administration, there was terrible job loss as we saw this flight of jobs away from our shores and going offshore. Now, some of the jobs have come back. But what we have seen is the great jobs have been replaced by people taking part-time jobs, by more people working longer hours, more people working harder, more two-income families. That means more caretakers out of the house, leaving more kids to fend for themselves. 
   So working families and workers are working harder, they are working longer, and they are sometimes working many, many multiple jobs. 
   So when we hear the statistics about the rise in productivity, it is true, American workers and working families have contributed to a great rise in corporate productivity. And this chart talks about U.S. productivity and wages and the change from the year 2000. It is a pretty simple chart. And what it shows is, very simply, median income right down there, the lower line of median income has actually declined over this period of time. Median income in real wages has actually declined the productivity of American workers and the contribution to the profits that have gone to the very top at the wage scale. That top 2 percent  who have really enjoyed a terrific time over the past 6 years has gone up, and it has been fueled by more people working harder and harder, more people working longer hours, more people working double jobs with fewer benefits and a greater squeeze. 
   So the Employee Free Choice Act is really a matter of fundamental fairness. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about leveling the playing field so that our workers who are dealing with their employers have a chance to talk in an organized way, have a voice, have some fundamental fairness when it comes to bargaining for the kinds of wages that they need to make a living, to send kids to school, to put the food on the table, to get from their jobs to do the things that we know are important to building a prosperous economy. 
   At this point I will throw it over to JOHN YARMUTH.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. What we are talking about is fundamental American values. We are talking about values of equal opportunity and fairness and what lifts us all up together. 
   One of the common misconceptions that is sometimes advanced when people have opposed the Employee Free Choice Act, or they stand in opposition to organized labor or the rights of working class families for fairness, is that somehow it is damaging to business if the employees in a business place come together and are allowed to express themselves and advocate for their cause that there is great fear out there, but there is really no good reason for that kind of fear. 
   Let me tell you another story that comes to mind. On the same trip back home last week, I had occasion to meet another group of workers. They were cameramen at the local statewide television station. The local statewide television station is a wonderful station. 
   I have enjoyed being on the station. I know the folks on it; they are good people. They do a great job of reporting. They are a part of an organization that owns a number of stations. They are a good-sized business. 
   When a couple of years ago these cameramen decided that they wanted to have a voice together, join together to be able to talk about some reasonable suggestions and thoughts and fairness so that they could have a voice to talk to the management of the station, which had been purchased, and they wanted to come together to talk, they were surprised to find that management, probably out of fear of what it meant, was using tactics that some might call intimidation, but I might tend to see more as fear based on wanting to protect something that they didn't know about. 
   One of the things I say to people sometimes is that people prefer the misery of the known to the mystery of the unknown. When you haven't had an organization come together for employees to talk with management, sometimes that can provoke the kind of fear of what that means. 
   So what happened was over the course of a couple of years, the management in this organization would take camera people aside by ones and by twos, and they would say things like if you come together to form this union, this company is going to be in real trouble. We are going to lose money. If we lose money, we are going to have to lay people off. If we have to lay people off, it might very well start with you. 
   They did this over a period of time by ones and by twos and delayed the process, and delayed the process and delayed the process. I have to tell you, when it finally came to pass that these folks got together and were able to get their union, without the benefits of the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it much easier, which would have made it fairer, which would have made it smarter for them to get together by simply having a majority of them get together to sign the cards and form the union and have the union recognized, they didn't have that process at the time. So they were delayed when they did come together and get their union and sit down and talk with management. 
   You would be surprised, I think, but I wasn't, to say that the company didn't suffer. Their profits aren't down. They are treating each other fairly. They are having a great dialogue together. But this company is doing just fine. In fact, since that time, unions have been formed, they have had productive discussions. Really what it is, it is about the respect. It is the respect for the dignity of working people. 
   If we cannot give working people in this country the dignity and respect that they deserve in the workplace, then what kind of country are we. That is why the Employee Free Choice Act that we passed today, on a bipartisan basis, I might add, with some of our colleagues who had the courage to join us from the other side of the aisle, that is why when we passed the Employee Free Choice Act in this House. We are expressing something about the new direction that we are going to take this country, one in which working families are accorded the dignity and respect that we know as Americans they deserve. 
   I give it back to Brother BRALEY.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. You know, 69 percent of Americans are supportive of what we did here today. I think the secret ballot issue is an important one. I just want to highlight it because it is myth number 1 on this chart which I have up here that the Employee Free Choice Act somehow abolishes the National Labor Relations Board secret ballot election process. 
   What this really does, what we are doing today, and what we have done, is it gives employees a choice between using the NLRB election process or the majority sign-up process. Under current law, employees can use the majority sign-up, but the employer can veto that majority employee choice and force the employees through the broken, undemocratic NLRB election process, which is open to employer delay, intimidation, and coercion. 
   It is the kind of thing I was talking about when I talked about those constituents of mine from New Hampshire who had to form a union and had to deal with their organization. Under this act, under H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, employees can still petition for an election. But if a majority signed cards saying they want a union now, they get a union, and the employer must respect that choice. 
   So somehow this myth out there that what we have passed is somehow undemocratic could not be further from the truth. It opens up choice, it makes the process easier, it reduces the kind of temptation to intimidate and harass or coerce that we have seen, and it promotes better dialogue and more fairness in the workplace. 
   I now hand it over to the Congressman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).

   Mr. HODES. In closing, I just want to take 1 minute to thank my colleagues, Mr. Braley, Mr. Yarmuth, Mr. Ellison, Ms. Sutton, who was here earlier. I want to thank you all for coming to the floor of the United States House of Representatives to work on this bill and to stand together today to talk about the importance of this bill to the American people. 
   And I just want to close by pointing out that the issues of economic and social justice that we are dealing with, and we are now dealing with a Democratic majority, are not partisan issues. We were joined in passing a rise in the minimum wage by our colleagues across the aisle. We were joined today by our colleagues across the aisle. 
   The American people sent us here to work in a bipartisan fashion, and we have worked in a bipartisan fashion, and will continue to because these aren't issues of left or right. These are American issues. And when we respect the dignity of working families and help the middle class in this country, everybody is helped from the top to the bottom. 
   So I congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who aren't here right now, but I want to congratulate them for coming today and working with us to pass this. 
   And I urge everybody who may be listening and may be watching today to voice their concern to the Senate. Reach out to the administration, and let them know your thoughts, that this is an American issue that respects fundamental values of dignity and respect for working people, and that working together, we can lift the middle class, we can help this country continue prosperity and distribute fairness in a way that helps us all. 
   I thank you all for being here today.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   This amendment will honor a fallen hero from New Hampshire who was beloved by the Nation. Christa McAuliffe was a teacher from Concord, New Hampshire, who achieved national fame for being the first educator selected to go into space. To those who knew her at home and loved her, she was a social studies teacher who touched the lives of hundreds of New Hampshire's children. 
   When she was selected by NASA to join the 1986 Challenger Crew, she touched a chord with all of the American people. They saw her dedication to teaching and learning. She believed in helping our children succeed. She often said, I touch the future. I teach. 
   Even though her life was cut tragically short when the Challenger exploded, her message about shaping our Nation's future through education and exploration is the reason we are here today to consider this important measure. 
   This amendment will provide three scholarships for women to pursue degrees in science and other fields related to NASA's mission. Christa always dreamed of going into space, and today we can create the opportunity for more women to fulfill their dream of one day being able to journey into space and pursue careers in science, mathematics, and other science-related fields. 
   These scholarships honor Christa McAuliffe, they honor her dream and are a fitting tribute to her great sacrifice. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge passage of this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when Democrats took control of Congress earlier this year, we vowed to restore accountability here in Washington. Unfortunately, President Bush is stubbornly resistant to any changes in the status quo. 
   Case in point: Earlier this year we passed the Accountability in Contracting Act which cleans up government contracting abuses and no-bid contracts that companies like Halliburton and KBR have made infamous. The bill overwhelmingly passed here in the House, and yet the Bush administration says it currently opposes the bill. 
   We've all heard about the $100 million compensation packages that executives walk away with at the same time their company is laying off their employees. So we in Congress passed a corporate accountability bill that enhances the accountability of corporate management shareholders by allowing a nonbinding vote by shareholders on executive compensation plans. But the administration opposes this legislation in its current form. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite opposition from the President and his party, Democrats will continue to serve as a catalyst for change to care about ordinary, hardworking Americans and bring real accountability here in Washington.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, while many of us are standing up for tax cuts for working middle class families, there are some on the other side who want to continue to provide tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and even to big oil companies earning record profits. For the last 7 years, we've watched these record giveaways to the wealthiest people and corporations turn our budget surpluses into record deficits. 
   The administration's fiscal mess is so bad that President Bush has borrowed more money from foreign countries than all 42 of his predecessors combined leaving our children in debt to unfriendly foreign leaders. American taxpayers are paying Iraq's bill while we have serious needs at home. 
   Yesterday, in my home State, New Hampshire, gas prices hit record highs, and nearly 4,300 New Hampshire families may lose their homes to foreclosure. It's time to help middle class families caught in the economic squeeze. 
   Now, I'm committed to changing the way Washington does business by giving tax relief to the people who truly need it. We can't fix our economy with the same policies that led to the economic slide.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (CELEBRATING THE 120-YEAR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND STATE VETERANS HOMES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important partnership between State Veterans Homes and the Federal Government during its 120th anniversary. 
   State Veterans Homes are important long-term care providers for veterans. State Homes  provide quality health care for elderly and disabled veterans across the country. 
   State Veterans Homes are one of the largest long-term care providers in the United States. There are 135 State Veterans Homes throughout the United States with more than 30,000 total beds. In a typical year, State Veterans Homes will furnish nearly 7 million days of nursing home care and about 1.5 million days of domiciliary care. These numbers continue to grow in order to meet the needs of our Nation's veterans. 
   State Veterans Homes began after the Civil War, when a large number of indigent and disabled veterans were no longer able to earn their own livelihood and needed care. 2008 marks the 120th anniversary of the State and Federal partnership in providing quality care for veterans in the State Veterans Homes. 
   The State Veterans Homes try to ensure that each and every eligible U.S. veteran receives the benefits, services, long term health care and respect which they have earned by their service and sacrifice. 
   I had the honor of visiting with veterans at the State Veterans Home in Tilton, New Hampshire. Under the dedicated leadership of Commandant Barry Conway, New Hampshire veterans have a place to receive top quality long term care in a community of fellow veterans. 
   The Veterans Home in Tilton has provided Concord native Dave Clark with top-quality health care. Dave is a disabled veteran with a can-do attitude, wheeling around the Veterans Home in his electric wheelchair, with a State of New Hampshire veteran's license plate that says ``GROOVY.'' 
   Dave was born on September 28, 1945 in Concord, NH. He lived with his parents, his sister, and his three brothers for the first six years of his life, until his parents separated. Dave's sister was adopted, but he and his brothers spent the next 3 1/2 years at an orphanage in Manchester. Dave was in and out of foster homes, dreaming of becoming an astronaut or attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
   Dave changed his course when he was called up to serve his country in the U.S. Army. Dave honorably and bravely served, spending 2 years in the States before deploying to Vietnam. 
   In Vietnam, Dave's vehicle was hit by enemy fire and the troops he was carrying were killed. Dave joined a small group of Marines in a firefight, and he was hit. Four of the Marines carried him to an aid station--and Dave credits these courageous Marines for saving his life. Dave was badly injured, and then spent the next 2 years in hospitals in Seattle, WA, Washington, DC, Fort Dix, NJ, and Manchester, NH. 
   Dave recovered, and restarted his life in New Hampshire. Dave met and married his wife Doris, with whom he lived in Penacook, New Hampshire until Doris's death. Dave worked at Franklin Regional Hospital as a crew leader in the Environmental Services Department, continuing to serve his State and his country with honor. 
   His new life was interrupted in March of this year when he had another stroke, leaving him paralyzed on his left side. Dave could only move his neck and his head. Dave thought he was finished after the last stroke. Dave was overwhelmed with terrible memories of the orphanage and frustrated that once again he was losing his independence. 
   But when Ellen Douville from the New Hampshire Veterans Home Admissions Office came to visit, Dave realized the Veterans Home could give him the support he needed. The Tilton Veterans Home's staff and residents helped Dave regain mobility in his left arm and taught Dave to control a wheelchair with his chin. After 7 months, Dave was kicking a beach ball around in ``Move It or Lose It,'' an exercise program for residents. 
   Dave is active in the Writing Group and art classes and is vice-president of the Resident Council at the Tilton Veterans Home. He has a girlfriend, Mary Tucker, who works for another healthcare organization, and this week the Veterans Home van took him to Applebee's, where he and Mary had a lunch date. 
   Dave says that coming to the Tilton Veterans Home has been the best thing for him. But, Dave continues to be determined to get back the full use of his left side again. After he regains the use of his left side, he plans leaving the Tilton Veterans Home and marrying his girlfriend Mary in the Veterans Home gazebo down by the pond--where everyone from the State Home will be invited. 
   This resolution honors the contribution of veterans like Dave to his country, and recognizes the leaders and staff of the Veterans Homes, like Barry Conway and Ellen Douville, who spend each and every day with patience, friendship, and care for veterans like Dave. 
   I am proud to honor the contributions of the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces and recognize that we as a Nation have a duty to serve those who have served our country faithfully. 
   And I am proud to honor veterans like Dave and the hard working community of the Tilton Veterans Home, and State Veterans Homes across the Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (SPENDING FOR CHIP VERSUS SPENDING IN IRAQ--IT'S ALL A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, last week the rubber stamp Republicans in this House once again held true to their name by voting to stand with the President and reject health care coverage for 10 million American children. The spending priorities of the President's Republican allies in the House are simply out of line with the priorities of the American people. In fact, the 86 percent of Americans who support this bipartisan CHIP reauthorization might be interested to know that for the cost of just 37 days in Iraq, we could provide health care coverage to 10 million children. Yet the President's irresponsible, open-ended commitment to the occupation in Iraq continues, while the number of American children without access to health care keeps climbing. 
   Madam Speaker, yesterday the President asked Congress to borrow another $196 billion to continue his failed blank-check, no-plan policy in Iraq. But he and his Republican friends in  this body apparently feel that spending $35 billion on a highly successful program that provides health care to uninsured children is excessive. 
   It's time for Republicans to stop blindly following the President and start helping American families.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE COMPLETING 100-HOUR AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here in the House of Representatives. It is an honor and privilege to rise to represent my State of New Hampshire, and also as a new Member of the Democratic majority to celebrate the 100-hours agenda that has recently been completed. 
   I note with interest that the gentleman from Iowa suggests that somehow the new Democratic Members have not had great input into the agenda for America that the 100 hours was meant to advance and did advance, and somehow the suggestion might be that we haven't participated fully with our leadership in the Congress in determining the new course and a new direction for this country. 
   I would correct that gentleman because the new Democratic majority and the new Members that are here have had great input with the leadership because the American people have sent us here with a mandate for change. As we campaigned this fall all across this country, nothing was clearer from the American people than they wanted change. They wanted change in the way government did its business. They wanted change in the direction of this country, and we are now privileged and honored to be part of history and be here on the floor of the people's House to help make that change happen. Today, in some sense, we come to celebrate the 100-hours agenda. 
   My colleagues across the aisle have made much over the past 2 weeks about  hours and minutes. The gentleman from Iowa produced a chart that counted hours and counted minutes and they have counted seconds. 
   But the American people, Mr. Speaker, have counted years. They have been waiting for years for a new direction for this country. They have said to us in clear and unequivocal terms that they wanted honest leadership and open government. We heard time and time again about a culture of corruption, concern from the American people that the House of Representatives and the Members in this House seemed more concerned about themselves than representing the people of this country. 
   And so in the American agenda that the Democrats advanced and has been advanced, we pledged honest leadership and open government. We pledged to restore government as good as the people of this country deserve starting with real ethics reform. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, one of the first things that happened here in the 110th Congress was through the rules process we advanced significant ethics reform to restore honest and transparent leadership in the House of Representatives. 
   The American people spoke clearly to us about their concerns about what was going on not only across the sea in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are concerned about real security for America. They are concerned that although the 2001 attacks had been the subject of a bipartisan commission, the 9/11 Commission, to determine what needed to be done to make our homeland safe, to keep the people of this country safe from attacks here, that this Congress somehow had stalled in making those promises, in keeping those promises and making the homeland safe. 
   So in H.R. 1 as part of the 100-hours agenda, we voted to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to protect Americans at home and lead the world by telling the truth to our troops, our citizens and our allies. We believe in a strong national defense. And we believe in being tough and smart. But we realized that homeland security must be a priority, and so we voted to implement homeland security. 
   We were concerned about economic prosperity and educational excellence. We wanted to create jobs that stay in America and restore opportunity for everyone, and that means all Americans, Americans earning all kinds of incomes. I can't tell you, Mr. Speaker, how many times as I walked my district door to door and met people in coffee shops and factories and schools and libraries, everywhere I went the subject of the minimum wage came up time and time again because the good people of this country recognized that the minimum wage was an important factor for millions of Americans. Single moms raising families were trying to do it on a minimum wage that hadn't been raised in 10 years. 
   I always find it interesting when my colleagues from across the aisle complain about raising the minimum wage, and yet so many voted with us, they voted themselves increases in their salaries for 10 years before raising the minimum wage. We accomplished that in H.R. 2. 
   We were able to introduce important medical research with stem cell research, to expand stem cell research in a careful and appropriate way, in the way that the American people wanted. 
   We started to help reform Medicare part D in H.R. 4. 
   We helped our students go to college in this country by cutting the rate of student loans in half, and we started a move towards energy independence by rolling back tax breaks for big oil companies. 
   In the last Congress, that Congress voted to cut taxes, give tax breaks to huge oil and gas companies while they saw record prices at the pump, and at the same time cut $12 billion in aid for our college students when we need to send people to college. So we passed H.R. 6, which started to pave the way for energy independence. 
   Having advanced that agenda, at this time I will yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson).

   Mr. Speaker, last year the Federal Government only spend $2 billion, one week in Iraq, on all of its research into alternative and renewable energy forms. By setting up the kind of reserve we have now, rolling back the subsidies for Big Oil and putting it into a reserve for Federal research and research into alternative energy, just think about how we are going to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of this country for new jobs and economic prosperity on into the century. 
   It is now my pleasure to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut.

It is important that we bring art and culture down to the floor of the Congress and make sure that the people of America know that we are connected not only to the past but to the  future. I also note that the 100 hours agenda as it turned out was subject to full debate here on the floor of the House.     
   Now our colleagues across the aisle, from time to time, raised complaints about procedures. They claimed they were cut out. But they were all here and had the opportunity to debate the 100 hours agenda. And, in fact, when it came to votes on the 100 hours agenda, Mr. Speaker, we averaged 67 Republican votes for what we passed in terms of the 100-hour agenda. We averaged 67 votes from our colleagues across the aisle. So while they may have raised their voices about the procedure, we were fulfilling promises to the American people. We knew it was important. They joined us. And so I think we all should be proud of the fact that the 100 hour agenda really was an American agenda. It is an American agenda. It is a down payment on what we are going to do to keep on moving this country forward. And I am proud and glad that our colleagues from across the aisle had the wisdom, the courage, and just the plain smarts to join us on what the American people know is right for America as we move forward in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, last week, Republican leaders sent a letter to the White House vowing to support the President's plans to veto essential legislation to protect our homeland, put thousands of new agents on America's borders, and invest in our country's priorities. 
   This sudden and newfound interest in fiscal responsibility is nothing more than hypocritical rhetoric. It does not match their actions or their record. Under Republican leadership, earmarks and deficit spending exploded. 
   For 6 years, Republicans and President Bush set the standard for fiscal mismanagement and turned record surpluses, created in the last years of the Clinton administration, into record deficits. And the President has refused to change course, once again proposing a budget for the upcoming year that does not find balance within the next 5 years. 
   Unlike the President's budget, the final Democratic budget blueprint brings us out of the red in the next 5 years, while also investing in critical homeland security initiatives. Instead of threatening to veto this essential legislation that the President claims is his top priority, President Bush should work with the Congress and sign this important legislation into law.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in strong support of the underlying bill, H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, my State, New Hampshire, is a State known for its pragmatism. The energy crisis that this country faces is no mystery to my constituents. They see our independence on foreign energy sources, they see our climate changing, and they see the tax breaks for Big Oil while their own resources are stretched thin. They have  seen roller-coaster high prices at the pumps, giveaways to Big Oil, and those same Big Oil companies reporting record profits. 
   This should not be a Democratic or Republican issue because it is a common sense issue. And the bill we will consider today is a commonsense and much needed start to solving the problem. H.R. 6 would repeal the billions of dollars in subsidies given to Big Oil in the ill-conceived 2005 energy bill and reinvest those funds in clean renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   The bill would require oil companies to pay their fair share in royalties, and would close glaring loopholes in the Tax Code. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill would create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in this country, to jump-start our investment in renewable and alternative energy resources, and to promote conservation and the development of critical new technology. 
   Energy independence is an issue of national security, it is an issue of jobs, and it is an environmental imperative. No issue is more important to our future or our children's future. Mr. Speaker, I am exceedingly proud of this new majority's 100-hour agenda, but I am perhaps most proud and most ardently supportive of H.R. 6. 
   It is time to invest in a new energy policy, and I encourage my colleagues to support this rule and support H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (NEW HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS FIGHTS FOR THE RIGHTS OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when Democrats gained the majority in this House last November, we pledged to fight to make America better for all Americans, not just the privileged few. This Congress has already passed legislation increasing the minimum wage and making college more affordable to middle-class families. 
   This week, in a bipartisan fashion, we will continue our work on behalf of middle-class families by bringing legislation to the floor that would restore workers' rights to form unions and to collectively bargain for better salaries and better benefits. 
   At a time when corporate executives are routinely negotiating lavish pay and retirement benefits for themselves, workers have little leverage to negotiate for a better life. This has been particularly concerning over the last 6 years when wages have remained stagnant while everyday costs like housing, transportation, education and health care have increased dramatically. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act says that if the majority of workers at a workplace sign cards saying they want a union, they get a union. The act protects the rights of employers, too. The legislation shares bipartisan support and is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Let's pass it this week.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding. I rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act. This legislation represents an historic opportunity to move our country towards a secure future. The bill marks a turning point in this Nation's history and moves us towards energy independence. 
   Energy security is something that my constituents in New Hampshire take very seriously. And although this legislation is not perfect, because it doesn't go far enough, we need a renewable portfolio standard that is a national standard. Industry recognizes that. The voters and the markets are ahead of the politicians on this. This bill is the start of a 21st-century energy policy for America. 
   With this bill, Mr. Speaker, we take a firm stand for real security, for healthy families, for a thriving economy in a competitive global market, and for a sustainable future for our planet. 
   Energy policy is the key to our national security. Our real security requires energy independence. We require new green jobs and an aggressive program to deal with global warming. We need this bill to start to protect our country and strengthen our economy. I ask all of my colleagues to cast their vote with America's future in mind.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, I rise in support today of my carpool promotion amendment. 
   First, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Transportation Committee and the ranking member for introducing this important bill to encourage the use of public transportation in this country. 
   Public transportation obviously needs to be part of a forward thinking 21st century energy strategy. However, in my home State of New Hampshire, many of my constituents live in rural areas where they don't have access to public transit, and many in my district have to commute by car 20 or 30 miles or more just to get to work. 
   Today, in intraday trading, oil hit a record of $140 a barrel, and gas prices are over $4 a gallon for regular gas in New Hampshire. The people I represent are struggling. Many drive more than an hour to work. And we have seen carpooling begin to increase in New Hampshire. 
   With an extremely limited public transportation network, except for city bus service in the cities of Manchester and Concord, often the only option for alternative transportation is carpooling, and the opportunities are often limited for that. 
   Since the average local commuter is spending more than $2,000 a year in gas just to drive to work, if a driver shares his car with just one other occupant and those carpoolers share the cost of gas, obviously they cut their costs for gas in half. 
   Now, New Hampshire Department of Transportation has introduced a great program called Ride Share. They work with the New Hampshire Regional Planning Commissions and employers to encourage ride sharing, and they have implemented a Statewide ride sharing program. The program is dedicated to finding an alternative way for commuters to travel to and from work. 
   These days, our highways and byways are increasingly gridlocked; and many of those cars stuck in gridlock, and all you have to do is go outside this building to see the kind of gridlock that Washington is famous for, and many of the cars that are sitting there are single occupant vehicles. Driving alone is not only expensive, but it also contributes to increased traffic congestion and air pollution. 
   To help commuters cut costs and to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, New Hampshire Ride Share uses geographical computer matching to provide commuters with information and assistance about ride sharing and alternatives to the single occupancy vehicle, which can include carpools, van pools, buses and trains. Right now, two other States, Missouri and Michigan, have introduced similar programs. 
   The amendment that I have propose will help provide additional funding for programs like Ride Share across the country. We have seen in one month a tripling of interest in participation in ride sharing in some parts of New Hampshire, and we need to see more. 
   With the record high gas prices, rising food prices, the mortgage crisis, and the credit crunch, families across our Nation are feeling the economic squeeze. Commuters across our Nation are suffering under the strain of record gas prices, and they have to sacrifice more of their paycheck just to earn one. 
   This amendment provides a real-time way to help commuters save money, reduce air pollution, and increase efficiency. It is a win-win all around. I urge my colleagues to adopt this important amendment to help commuters across our Nation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. Clay, for his leadership along with Mr. Waxman on this bill. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5811, the Electronic Message Preservation Act. My colleague from Virginia has said that the Archivist suggests that the requirement for certification under this bill is unprecedented. Well, this bill is filed, in part, as a response to White House practices that have been unprecedented and show clearly the need for this legislation. The documents, which include e-mails, correspondence, memos produced by an administration belong not to the President but to the people of the United States. 
   This bill will help ensure that these records are preserved properly for our future generations, and more importantly, this bill will help lift the veil of secrecy that has fallen over our government under this administration. 
   Every day the President and his staff generate thousands of documents on the issues confronting our Nation. These documents contain important insights into the way that our government is making decisions that affect our lives. Why are those decisions being made? Who benefits? Who gets to influence our government leaders? 
   We have serious concerns about the way the White House is preserving these documents, or not preserving them, and whether the true purpose of not preserving them is to hide the dealings from the American people. Through the investigations by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we have learned that the White House lost hundreds of days of e-mail records between the years 2003 and 2005. Additionally, it appears that senior officials in the White House have been found to be skirting the historical record laws by using an e-mail system provided by the Republican National Committee for most of their e-mail correspondence. 
   For example, Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff, is said to have used the RNC system for 95 percent of his e-mail correspondence to which the American people will never have access. Under the Presidential Records Act, the President has the sole authority to manage his records during his time in office. The General Accountability Office found that this administration did not keep records as it was required to. 
   So the question becomes: What were they trying to hide? It is no surprise that the administration that leaked Valerie Plame's covert identity and organized propaganda to promote a war in Iraq is evading record-keeping practices to hide information from the American people. This is arguably partisan politics at its worse, and the only remedy is more accountability and more sunshine. The Electronic Message Preservation Act will help to make sure that these important records are kept and help shine light on what our government is doing and why. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter for the Record a letter supporting this legislation that brings accountability back to the White House. The letter was signed by a number of groups that advocate for an open, transparent government, including the Government Accountability Project and openthegovernment.org. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration has been one of the most secretive and least transparent and most closed in American history. We still don't know what was said in closed-door meetings with Big Oil executives to set our energy policy, and today, we suffer from record-high gas prices. The secrecy in the White House has prevented officials in the White House from being held accountable to the American people. 
   The Electronic Message Preservation Act will reform White House record keeping and allow the American people to have confidence that future administrations will not be able to hide the truth from the people of this country or from history.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, we have entered the fifth year of the war in Iraq, and thousands of soldiers have returned home wounded and in need of serious medical care. The situation at Walter Reed made it clear that changes must be made to ensure that our wounded troops receive timely comprehensive care that extends through the length of their condition. 
   To provide these crucial services, more is needed for defense health care than the President requested. The status quo is simply not acceptable for our troops who are injured while serving our country. We owe them our real support. 
   The emergency supplemental proposed by this Democratic Congress nearly doubles the amount of funding requested by the President for military health care. These additional funds will enhance medical services for active duty forces, mobilized personnel and their families, including: post-traumatic stress disorder counseling, traumatic brain injury care and burn treatment. 
   The funds will also help prevent health care fee increases for troops and address the problems found at Walter Reed. 
   Madam Speaker, passage of this bill supports our troops and will ensure that they receive the quality care they deserve.

   After 6 years of signing any bill that came to his desk and disregarding the impact legislation would have on our Nation's fiscal well-being, President Bush is now trying to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. 
   Who, exactly, is the President trying to fool? He turned a $5.6 trillion surplus that he inherited from President Clinton into a $3 trillion deficit. That's a reversal of fortune of $8 trillion. 
   When Democrats took control of Congress, we vowed to restore fiscal sanity, and we began by restoring sensible pay-as-you-go rules. Every bill that we have brought to this floor has complied with these rules, but the President continues to imply that he is more fiscally responsible than this new Congress.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, the people of Gorham, New Hampshire are hurting. Over 160 workers will lose their jobs at the Fraser Paper Mill next month. Decades ago, the paper industry was thriving throughout Coos and Grafton Counties in New Hampshire. But with new trade policies that ship our jobs oversees, these jobs are disappearing faster, and towns across northern New Hampshire are hurting. 
   In February, Fraser Paper announced that it will lay off 167 jobs from their facility in Gorham. The news broke just months after the Wausau Paper Mill closed its doors in Groveton and left 303 workers without jobs, and nearly 2 years after Fraser Paper shut down its Berlin site, which resulted in the loss of 250 jobs in the region. I will visit Coos County this Friday to meet with workers in Gorham, Groveton, and Berlin to hear their stories. 
   I am working to take action to stand up for these working families and their communities. We have already helped with the bipartisan economic stimulus plan that puts more money in the hands of working families, and boosts our economy, but the people of Gorham and the surrounding communities and workers in America need additional help. 
   I plan on submitting legislation to keep mills and business and jobs like these in New Hampshire. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and stand with our working men and women.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, just last month, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel. 
   Last year, I was privileged to take my first trip to the Promised Land. Israel is the birthright for Jews around the world. As our stanchest ally, Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, but to Jews, it is much more. It is the homeland, the true community that my own Jewish ancestors dreamed of when hounded by anti-Semitism, repression and violence. 
   To truly honor Israel on this 60th anniversary, we must seek a true, lasting peace from committed partners to provide for Israel's long-term survival, security and prosperity. For Jews in America, we owe it to our ancestors to protect the Jewish homeland that they toiled for centuries to achieve. We owe to it our grandparents and to our great grandparents who never saw the Promised Land. We owe it to our children and to our grandchildren, who must always know a world with a Jewish homeland. We owe them peace in our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3920 and in opposition to the Republican substitute. Last Tuesday, 303 workers in Groveton, New Hampshire, a small paper mill town, heard over the radio and by newspaper the devastating news that Wausau Paper was closing the mill at the end of the year. On Friday, I sent a letter to Labor Secretary Chao asking for expedited help under the existing TAA, and on Monday I traveled to Groveton and met with a number of the affected workers. It is difficult to describe how devastating this closure is to the town of Groveton, to the families of the workers and to the region. Many of the proud workers of that mill are third and fourth generation. They have got no other skills. This is the life they know. 
   As I explained on Monday to the workers what kind of help is available in the current TAA, the thought that was going through my mind was that this was not enough. We need to do more. These folks, their family, this community need more and deserve more help from the Federal Government. The ripple effects of this closure are huge. It goes out into the community, to other businesses and vendors. That is why the H.R. 3920 provisions to redevelop communities hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs through the designation of manufacturing redevelopment zones is so important.  
   We've got more workers who need help. They face harder times and higher costs, especially for health care. We need to expand the TAA. Now is not the time to go backwards. The Republican substitute is no substitute. It takes us backwards. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Republican proposal and support H.R. 3920.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'm very glad to be here on this Halloween night. I'd like to think this is a treat for us, a treat for those who are listening to us or watching on television and in the country, although lots of folks are probably out with their kids trick-or-treating tonight. 
   But it is an absolute honor to be here with the Members of the class of 2006, and many of us are wearing article I buttons. And the importance of those buttons is to raise the awareness in Congress and around the country about the importance of the checks and balances in our system of government. 
   We spoke last week about some of these issues, and I was flooded with calls not just from my constituents but from people around the country thanking us for talking about the checks and balances in our system and explaining in as clear a way as we could the importance of our system of government and why the Founding Fathers put Congress first. 
   Many people think that Congress is three coequal branches of government. Many people think that the President and the House of Representatives and the Senate somehow are coequal when actually the Congress, in article I of our Constitution, as the people's House, as the voice of the people, is given preeminence. 
   It is the Congress that makes the laws, not the President. The President doesn't make the law. He's got to follow the law that Congress makes. It is the Congress that raises the money to run government, to fill the programs, and Congress that spends the money we raise. It is Congress that has the power  to assess taxes, levy taxes. It is Congress that has the power to declare war and only Congress that has the power to declare war. 
   And these days, as we contemplate very difficult issues of war and peace in the Middle East, our involvement in Iraq and around the world, those powers, the war powers of Congress, versus the powers asserted by this President have come into sharp focus and occasional sharp contrast. I believe that we're going to see in the days ahead those kinds of debates in this people's House as we discuss who has the power to take this country into armed conflict, who has the power to declare war or not, are we at war. These are questions that are going to be heard. 
   There's a very interesting example of the clash between the assertion of Presidential power, which we've seen here, and the real power that Congress has. Right now, as many of my colleagues know, the House Judiciary Committee, as well as the Senate Judiciary Committee, is investigating. These committees are investigating whether there was something amiss in the way the United States Attorney's Office was run, whether there was political interference with United States attorneys. And Congress, the Judiciary Committee, has issued subpoenas. 
   Subpoenas are the method by which a body that has the power to make witnesses come issues a subpoena that says to a witness, you've got to come and testify under oath. And Congress has issued subpoenas to two members of the White House, who previously were in the White House, Karl Rove and Harriet Miers. They have refused to come to testify before Congress, and a question arises. 
   Congress can hold them in contempt and then ask the Justice Department to enforce that contempt, and right now we're looking at a new Attorney General possibly for this country. He was asked, this Attorney General who was nominated by the President, he was asked whether or not if Congress holds these witnesses in contempt for not answering the subpoenas, would his Justice Department refer the matter to grand jury for criminal prosecution as Federal law requires. Mr. Mukasey, the nominee for the Attorney General, suggested that his answer would be no. 
   Now, this is not the law. That is not the proper balance for Congress and the President. He made, in addition, a startling claim. He claimed, this is the possible Attorney General of the United States, that the President of the United States could defy the law as it's written in Congress if he believed that it was his responsibility to defend the country. That is a huge exception to the rule that Congress' laws are supreme and it is Congress that makes the law and the President is to follow them. 
   So this issue, what is Congress' power, what are the powers given to us by article I and how we assert them, and the clash between congressional power and Presidential power is alive today. It's going on right now, and it's of vital importance to the future of this country as we decide whether we are a Nation of laws or a Nation of men.

   Mr. HODES. Thank you, Mr. Klein. 
   What we are talking about here really is the moral compass of our Nation. We have a stark choice before us. There is a huge difference between what the President values and what the American people value. 
   To the President and his allies, $190 billion for a failed war is a necessity, but $35 billion to give our kids access to doctors is some kind of extravagance. And that really talks about the values that are at play here. Are we going to value and speak up for the people of this country, or are we going to let the President assert values that we in this country don't agree with because we value kids? 
   Now, there is a President, a former President who really said it best because we here in Congress are no longer simply going to enable this President to take power which should not be his. We are going to reassert, in these conversations and in our conduct, the power that rightfully belongs to the Congress and to the people. Because as Abraham Lincoln said, when we were engaged in the midst of a great civil war that was to determine the fate of this country, he talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people. 
   That's why we are here tonight. That is why we were sent to Congress. To reassert that this government is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. And while we are on this watch, it shall not perish, and we are going to stand up to this President and we are going to have some checks and balances in the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (PRESIDENT REFUSES TO CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ DESPITE INCREASING VIOLENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, last week the President's new war czar told the Congress that the troop escalation plan is failing and that the American people should expect sectarian violence in Iraq to continue. 
   Finally someone in the administration is making sense of the situation on the ground in Iraq, but honesty does not make up for the fact that President Bush continues to stubbornly oppose any change in war policy. 
   In the wake of the deadliest 2-month period in the war, 231 U.S. service men and women were killed in April and May. The facts on the ground show an increasingly grim picture. 
   In fact, a recent internal military assessment shows that the U.S. military's plan to secure Baghdad against a rising insurgency is falling far short of its goal. To date, according to the document, only one-third of the Baghdad  neighborhoods are under the control of American and Iraqi security forces. The administration's goal was to have the entire city under control by next month. Clearly, that is no longer possible. 
   Despite the continued stubbornness of this President, the Democratic Congress will continue to demand that we move this war in a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Yarmuth, let me start by saying how proud I am to stand with my colleagues, other new Members of the class of 2006, to talk about an initiative which you began, the article I initiative, to talk about reasserting the constitutional balance of power in Washington. 
   For me, in coming to Congress as a new Member of this House from New Hampshire, it was absolutely fundamental to what I talked about in my campaign that the people of New Hampshire sent me to Congress to restore accountability, integrity, and oversight to government. They sent me here because what I said to them and what we now see is that Congress was a broken branch. Congress had not been exercising its oversight and accountability functions. And when Congress does not exercise its important power, its important right, its important obligation to the people to exercise oversight and accountability over the executive branch and other branches of government, things get unbalanced. It was that sense of checks and balances that our Founding Fathers put into the Constitution, and they put it in there for a reason. 
   They won a Revolutionary War against an empire, the British empire, with an imperial ruler at the top, the King of England. We wanted to make sure that we had a different form of government; that we had a form of government where the people were the top dog in the fight; that the ruler would never become imperial. That is why we have a President, we have a Congress which is divided between the House and the Senate. 
   In article I, section 1, our founders were very clear. They said, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' What I saw and many of us saw when we ran was a President who was abusing presidential power in an unprecedented way. This wasn't a matter of parties. It was this President abusing power in an unprecedented way, and it could have happened whatever party that President was in, but this is what we saw, and we ran. 
   The article I initiative, which you began, which we have joined, and which we are spreading, seeks to heighten the public consciousness of the importance of checks and balances in our system. As newly elected Democratic Members of Congress, we feel with particular importance the obligation we have to reassert the power that the Founding Fathers wisely gave to Congress. When we came, we took an oath of office to protect and defend and uphold the Constitution. Article I is the first article, and it is the first article for a reason. And we are well on our way as we have begun to exercise oversight throughout Congress with hundreds of hearings held in this 110th Congress on many issues and especially the war in Iraq and what has happened with this President and this administration. In the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we have held oversight hearings about administration interference with the work of GSA, the folks who deal with Federal buildings, turning it into an arm of politics; administration interference with science at NASA; administration incompetence with FEMA, delivering formaldehyde-filled trailers to the victims of Katrina; incompetence and mismanagement by the State Department, failing to exercise oversight over contractors in Iraq, the Blackwater scandal that is beginning to emerge now. We have been holding the hearings that constitute the function of Congress not just to make the law but to exercise the oversight that keeps things in checks and balances. 
   I am delighted to be with you tonight. We are going to talk about numbers of ways in which we are reasserting Congress' power and taking steps to bring the people back to the People's House and serve the interests of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Thank you. As I have listened to the colloquy we have had here on the floor today in this Chamber where such important issues of war and peace, spending, raising revenue are debated on a daily basis now and thinking about the beginnings of the country, and you have asked about the questions coming up about appropriations, and we have had passed numerous appropriations bills. I think we have passed 12 here in the House of Representatives. The Senate has not yet acted on all of them, because, of course, once we pass the appropriations bills, and they must originate under the Constitution here in the House of Representatives, they go to the Senate. The Senate has to pass them. They come back and forth and they go up to the President. Of course the President has now threatened a veto on the spending necessary to run the Federal Government, to run the program for health and human services, to educate our kids, to heal the sick, all the programs that we have in the Federal Government, he has threatened to veto. And then if he vetoes a bill as we saw with the SCHIP bill, it will come back here where Congress will have the power to vote to override that veto and put it into law despite what the President says. All those powers and all the debates arise out of what my colleague from Florida noted was a living, breathing document. This great democracy of ours comes down to the words and the spirit that are embodied in the Constitution of the United States 
   Many Americans around the country really have lost sight of the humble beginnings of the country and the need for the powers in article I.     
   We were a ragtag country, mostly woodsmen and woodswomen that were fighting against this imperial monarchy. We won a revolution and were then immediately faced with terrible challenges. We had no Navy. We had no commerce. Our Army was weak because we had just been through a revolution. We didn't have much money. We had no trade. We had few ambassadors. We had very few friends. It was the Constitution that had to lay out all the powers that would serve as the basis for what is now a $1 trillion a year appropriation in terms of what the Federal Government raises and spends, or borrows and spends in past Congresses. 
   The challenges we faced coming in here, we are faced with fiscal irresponsibility, in which Congress was borrowing and spending. In fact, the war in Iraq is a perfect example. That war, which is now suggested will cost $2.4 trillion when all is said and done and all is added up, has been done with borrowing. It has been done by putting it on the backs of our children and our grandchildren. Fiscal irresponsibility. Just waste of taxpayer money, which we were sent here to deal with. 
   The Constitution lays out clearly that it is Congress's duty to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, words these days that don't mean very much. They are fancy, old-fashioned words. We have got to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare. We are allowed in Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States because it was very important at the very beginning of the Nation that this government be given the power to deal commercially and get the money it needed in a responsible way to run the affairs of the country. But it was up to Congress to appropriate the money to run the programs, provide for the common defense and general welfare. 
   Today, we are faced with a tough situation and it will probably take us all through the fall as we deal with the President, who has threatened to veto the responsible measures that we, in Congress, coming together as voices of the people, have decided are necessary to run this country. It is up to Congress, really, to say what those programs should be because that is the power the Constitution gives us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I heard with great interest the quotes from Madison, the quotes in the book. There is another quote from Madison that really talks about why Congress is the place that provides for the welfare and defense of the country. Madison wrote in Federalist Papers No. 52, and the words, it's a little old-fashioned, but folks will get it, ``As it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people, so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration,'' the Congress, ``should have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people''. In other words, it was clear from the founding of this Nation that this body, this hall, this place where we stand before there was C-SPAN, before there was television, this place is the place of the people. 
   The 435 people who gather here, each representing 650,000 or so people of the United States, are the folks who, in what I have described to my constituents as the hurly-burly of democracy, come together to decide how things should be governed, what kind of money do we need, and how are we going to spend it. 
   So that is what we are going to be seeing this fall play out. We don't know how it will end, where it is going to go. The Senate will have a role, certainly the President has a role. But so far it appears that with this President, the role now, unlike the past 6 years of the 109th, 108th, 107th, which, with all due respect for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, were Republican-dominated Congresses where the veto word was never mentioned, all of the sudden the President has now decided that it is time to veto almost everything that is coming out of Congress. He vetoed SCHIP, a bill to ensure 10 million of our neediest children for health care. Vetoed. We are going to send it back. Threatened vetoes for our appropriations bills to run the Federal Government. He is going to send them back. 
   This is a new light, apparently, that has dawned on this President, that suddenly a Democratic Congress sending him legislation is all of a sudden going to be subject to vetoes. With this initiative, we are here to reassert the importance, the power, the responsibility of this Congress to act for the people who sent us here.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I can't help but think about the importance of the power of the purse. James Madison said, ``The House of Representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government.'' 
   The power over the purse is our weapon to use, and I am hoping that this Congress will no longer be the President's enabler when it comes to his misguided policy in Iraq. Earlier this week, he asked for an additional $46 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing the total request this year to almost $200 billion. By the time we are done, we are going to be at $2.4 trillion in Iraq. That is enough to provide college educations for every student who wants to go to a 4-year college for free at a private college or university. We could provide health care for every American for a year for the money we are spending. 
   It is going to be up to Congress to make tough decisions on whether or not we are going to use the power of the purse to take charge of this President's misguided policy. 
   So I am in contact and intimate sympathy with my constituents in New Hampshire who have said to me loud and clear, ``Do something to stop this President's policies in Iraq.''

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, President Bush has called for more money, more patience, and a renewed commitment of U.S. troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future. The American people should not be fooled. This is nothing more than another stay-the-course strategy that puts us on a path for 10 years of war in Iraq. 
   Under the Bush plan, about 5,700 troops, or about 3.5 percent, of the American forces in Iraq would come home later this year. That's it. The rest of our troops would remain in Iraq until at least next summer. The President anticipates that at least 130,000 American men and women would remain in Iraq indefinitely for many years to come. 
   The President's plan for Iraq amounts to an open-ended and dangerous commitment of American troops in Iraq, and an open wallet for the American people to pay. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a plan for success in Iraq, nor is it a plan that will make America safer. It is time for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this President and say enough is enough. Democrats will continue to demand change because it is time that we  begin a responsible redeployment out of Iraq.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, the Senate was in session all night long because Senate Republicans refuse to allow a fair up or down vote on an amendment that would redeploy our troops by April of next year. 
   Today, Senate Democrats want a vote on an amendment offered by Senators Levin and Reed, but Republicans are using the filibuster to prevent a fair majority vote. Do Senate Republicans really want to obstruct the process on the most critical issue of our time? 
   The American people are demanding change in Iraq, and while a majority of Senate Republicans refuse to listen, nearly a dozen Republicans have said the administration must change its strategy in Iraq. These Republicans need to realize that their words are important, but they will only have meaning if they choose to act and support the Levin-Reed amendment. 
   We all know that President Bush has no intention of making any changes in his war policy, and so it is up to Congress to force that change, which is why last night's all-night debate in the Senate was so important. Let's hope wayward Senate Republicans are finally listening.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, first I want to thank the distinguished Chair of the committee, Mr. Skelton, as well as my cosponsors on this amendment, Congresswoman DeLauro and Congressman DeFazio. 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 5658 addresses an issue of utmost importance to our Constitution and to the integrity of our government.     
   And it will help restore the trust of the American people in their government. 
   In a free and democratic society, our government should never use the public airwaves to propagandize our citizens. 
   Recent media reports have alleged an organized effort by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Department of Defense officials to manipulate network news military analysts to promote administration spin on the war in Iraq, even though many of those analysts knew the information not to be accurate. 
   Internal Pentagon documents obtained by the New York Times refer to these military analysts as message force multipliers, surrogates who can be counted on to deliver administration themes and messages to millions of Americans in the form of their own opinions. 
   In fact, one analyst apparently referred to the efforts by the Pentagon as brainwashing. A report conducted by media watchdog Media Matters showed that from January 2002 these military analysts, many of whom have ties to the defense industry, appeared on network and cable news stations nearly 4,500 times. That's right, 4,500 instances. Imagine the millions of people who heard those impressions 4,500 times. 
   The American people were spun by Bush administration message multipliers. They were fed administration talking points believing they were getting independent military analysis. 
   Days after the news story appeared, the Pentagon suspended the program. The news outlets who hosted the programs and analysts have been remarkably silent. The Department of Defense Inspector General has already begun an internal review of the program, but given the possibility that the public, as well as decision-makers in this Congress, were misled about the war in Iraq, both in the run-up to the war and afterwards, I believe it is absolutely critical that a public investigation happen that is transparent to this body, as well as to the American people. 
   Congress cannot allow an administration to manipulate the public with false propaganda on matters of war and our national security. 
   My amendment will ensure that no money authorized in this act will be used for any domestic propaganda program within the United States aimed at U.S. citizens. It will require a report to Congress by both the Defense Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office on whether previous restrictions on propaganda have been violated and laws broken. 
   It's finally time for the American people to know the truth. If we allow our government to lie to the American people, we lose the democracy and liberty on which our country was founded, and we risk becoming what generations of brave Americans have fought so hard to defeat. 
   Let us today on this floor in this Congress say never again will we allow this to happen in our republic. 
   I urge passage of this amendment, and today, we will say with one voice that the American people will not tolerate domestic propaganda. We will find the truth. We will correct any abuses of power. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, perhaps the gentleman, my colleague, does not understand that this amendment prohibits lying. ``Be all you can be'' is persuasion. A concerted program of government-directed lies is propaganda. 
   The amendment would simply codify language outlawing propaganda within  the United States aimed at our citizens, and perhaps the gentleman is unaware that similar language has been included in congressional appropriations bills since the 1950s. And thus, this amendment does not represent any change in U.S. policy. 
   Propaganda is narrowly defined as communications designed to influence the people of the United States, and it is limited to domestic programs within the United States aimed at U.S. citizens. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield to my distinguished cosponsor Mr. DeFazio for 2 minutes.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, I'm afraid that my distinguished colleagues on the other side are laboring under a misapprehension. 
   This amendment is very simple. First, it codifies long-standing policy prohibiting propaganda, domestic propaganda. Second, it calls for an investigation into whether or not the Pentagon had a concerted program to mislead the American public and this Congress. 
   This amendment deals with what strikes at the very heart of our democracy: We must trust our military. We must have the truth. We make decisions of life and death in this Chamber when we send people off to war. The American people deserve the truth. This amendment will deliver the truth to the American people. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding time. 
   Dear colleagues, it is my great privilege to rise today for the first time as the Representative for New Hampshire's Second District. It is humbling to serve with so many men and women I have admired for so long and to stand in this Chamber, hallowed by American history as the people's House. 
   But while today is dedicated, in part, to celebration, there is no time to waste in fixing the ills that have plagued this House in recent years. 
   Traveling across my State of New Hampshire this fall, I heard one clear, consistent message from voters--from Democrats, Independents and Republicans. We are fed up with the mess in Washington. Go down there and fix it. 
   Mr. Speaker, while most Americans see Congress as somewhat distant from their lives, they probably couldn't rattle off the names of Congressional leadership, for example, or quote bill numbers, they do understand with absolute clarity when Members of Congress are working for them or when Members of Congress are working for themselves.     
   Now, the Democratic ethics reform package is much needed and it is long overdue. While some in this body may bristle at its stringency, and some are now heard to complain, apparently, that it doesn't go far enough, as a new Member, I can tell you that it is only logical and only just to make these changes to the House rules, starting today and starting now. 
   We must ban gifts and travel from lobbyists, we must put a stop to the pernicious K Street Project, we must reform the way we spend taxpayers' money and the way we write and pass the bills meant to protect taxpayers' interests. 
   I strongly support the adoption of the Democratic rules package. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes.''

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being here with us tonight. I am delighted to be a new Member in the House of Representatives, the people's House, sent by my constituents to help restore the fabric of our democracy, which, during the past 6 years, has really been torn and undermined by a rubber-stamp Congress which refused to ask questions of an administration conducting its policies largely in secret, taking the American people down a path with counterfeit leadership, a leadership that used fear and intimidation to lead, instead of real leadership which helps people face reality, come together and seek common ground and solutions. 
   And for many people, when they think of the United States House of Representatives, they think of Congress as a body which raises revenue and figures out how to spend it. It sets taxes and sets a budget. And that is how a lot of folks think about Congress, and sure we spend a lot of our time doing that.     
   But there is another very important function of the United States Congress in our constitutional scheme, and it is completely independent of what party is in the White House, what party is in the majority in Congress, what party is in the majority in the Senate. It is the way that, in the wisdom of the Founding Fathers, they set up this great government of ours so that there would be checks and balances, there would be controls. And the accountability and oversight function of Congress is what we have restored with this Democratic majority. 
   There have been great leaders who have recognized that important feature and that important job of Congress. And I have got a chart here, a little board and a quote that is really important and talks a lot about what it means for Congress to exercise its function of accountability. 
   President Woodrow Wilson said, ``It is the proper duty of a representative body to look diligently into every affair of government and to talk much about what it sees. It is meant to be the eyes and the voice and to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents. The informing function of Congress should be preferred, even to its legislative function.'' 
   So here is President Wilson, some years ago, recognizing that the oversight and accountability function of Congress is perhaps even more important than the legislative function. 
   So for this Congress, while the last Congress might have been called ``the rubber-stamp Congress'' or the last Congress might have been called ``the Katrina Congress'' because they presided over such a disaster for us, I bet that this Congress, under Democratic majority, is going to be ``the accountability Congress.'' 
   Now, one thing that is interesting, I want to take us back for a moment as we sort of set the tone for tonight to talk about something that happened in ancient times. It has been said that the ancient Romans had a tradition. Whenever one of their engineers constructed an arch, at the capstone was hoisted into place, the engineer assumed accountability for his work in the most profound way possible, he stood under the arch. In the President's war on terror, the capstone he chose is Iraq, but it is everyday Americans, and especially our veterans, returning soldiers who are wounded and our veterans who stood under the arch as it crumbled. 
   Over the past few weeks, we have sustained blow after blow as the President's plan fell apart. But it is not the President who will pay the billions necessary to stabilize Iraq, it is not the President who slept in molding infested rooms at Walter Reed Hospital, it is not the President who lost his job because of a political decision. But maybe it ought to be. 
   The confluence of events of recent weeks, the Valerie Plame scandal, the Walter Reed scandal, the politically motivated firing of U.S. Attorneys, is the result of an administration that went too far for too long without any meaningful oversight, without any meaningful accountability, without a Congress to hold it accountable. It has been said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. And for years, absolute power is what our Republican colleagues, who were in control until November of 2006, gave to this administration. 
   Tonight, I come to the floor with my colleagues to talk about restoring accountability to government because the arch has fallen on us, and we are going to repair it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, I was thinking about what our colleague Mr. Welch talked about in terms of the investigation into the way in which the administration may have interfered for political purposes with the administration of justice by the United States Attorneys, causing the firing of United States Attorneys for political purposes. And it is interesting to me. 
   I come from New Hampshire, a small State. And probably many of the folks who may be listening tonight and many people in this Chamber, although there aren't too many, have heard of the name Daniel Webster. And Daniel Webster said a very important thing. He said: ``There is nothing so powerful as the truth.'' And, really, that is what we are talking about. 
   Our colleague Mr. Ellison talked about trust, and what we are really  talking about is bringing truth to government, bringing integrity to government, bringing openness, bringing transparency, authentic honesty back into the Halls of Congress and wherever oversight and accountability take us. And in terms of what is happening with the United States Attorney scandal, if we have learned one thing about this administration, it is how it responds to its critics. When someone says something they don't like, they get rid of them. The current U.S. Attorney scandal is really just the latest example. 
   And now folks are probably seeing that there is a conflict. The White House doesn't want people from the White House to come to Capitol Hill in the open light of day under oath to tell the truth to committees in Congress and committees in the Senate. And the question you have got to ask is, what is there to hide? Why not come, take an oath, tell the truth, and deal with the issues? 
   I started my legal career in New Hampshire as a prosecutor. I was hired by a good Republican, a man named David Souter, who is now sitting on the United States Supreme Court. And what I learned as a prosecutor from David Souter was that the critical thing about the prosecutor's role was that the prosecutor serves the people. My job was to stand up and serve the people of my State. The job of the U.S. Attorney is to stand up and represent the people of the United States. U.S. Attorneys don't represent the President. They don't represent any particular politician. They represent all of the people. And so their judgment has to be independent judgment in order to see that justice is done because what we are after is justice, not political retribution. 
   So you can imagine what happens in our great system of justice if instead of thinking about truth and justice, the United States Attorney is motivated by political influence. It perverts the system of justice. It means no justice can be had. So the investigations that are going on now, the accountability and oversight over the administration having the folks come down and talk to our committees is absolutely critical. It is fundamental to the preservation of the democratic fabric of this country, because if an administration, if White House officials can exert pressure on the United States Attorneys and remove their independence, then the people can't depend upon our system of justice. 
   So this may be one of the most important of the investigations and the new accountability that we are seeing in Congress. And, frankly, what I have said to folks back home is we are not going to let this go by without getting the answers. So when folks see the battle over the subpoenas, when they see the White House resisting having its people come down, folks are asking why. What are you afraid of? Let the truth come out. Let's find out what happened. Now, that is accountability. That is oversight, and that is why the American people sent us here.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Ellison, that is called a Siberian express. That is not just a chilling effect. That is ice cubes in your shoes. That puts the fear in the prosecutor. Now, prosecutors are brave people, and these U.S. Attorneys were brave people standing up to do their job. But it has to have a chilling effect, and it is exactly what we are talking about. The independence of our United States Attorneys is the hallmark, the foundation of the Federal system of justice, and it has to be preserved. And that is why it doesn't matter whether the White House is Republican or Democrat. If this was a Democratic administration that was doing this, we would be doing the same thing if we were following Woodrow Wilson's advice and doing our job here in the Congress.

   Mr. HODES. You know, I can give you a perspective on that. I won't take too long to do that. 
   My experience, and I had many years as a prosecutor and also many years as an attorney in court, is that the oath that you take to tell the truth is a powerful thing. It is a meaningful thing, and it is an important thing, because when a person swears to tell the truth, it has the effect of opening one's eyes to the importance and the majesty of the process that is involved in coming before a body, whatever body that is, and holding up your right hand and swearing to tell the truth. 
   What happens then is, frankly, the person who is going to tell the truth and swears to tell the truth is subjected to a host of requirements and possible penalties if they don't tell the truth. That also turns out to be a powerful motivator. 
   In this country we have trial by jury where witnesses come to tell the truth. We have investigations by Congress where witnesses come to tell the truth. And that really has proven to be the best, clearest, most open way in an open, transparent democratic government, like the one that we want to have and want to preserve, to get to the truth. 
   That is all we are asking. We are not intending to ask folks to say or do anything they didn't do or to tell us something that isn't so. We just want to get to the truth. 
   So a deal that has people behind closed doors without a transcript of the proceedings, with no way to review what has been said and no ability to do anything if they don't tell the truth, just doesn't cut it.

   Mr. HODES. Thank you, Mr. Klein. It has been a pleasure to be with you here tonight and have this conversation with the people of this country about what oversight and accountability brings to government. 
   I started my remarks this evening with a quotation from former President Woodrow Wilson. And I want to go back further in time to end my remarks with a quote from John Stuart Mill who said: ``The proper office of a representative assembly is to watch and control the government, to throw the light of publicity of its acts, to compel a full exposition and justification of all of them which anyone considers questionable.'' 
   And it is that light of publicity, the light that we shine with accountability that helps preserve this government and leads to an open and transparent government. I am privileged to serve on the Information Subcommittee of the Government Oversight and Reform Committee. One of the things that we did which is essential in terms of the accountability of government, we brought to the floor and passed in this Congress in a bipartisan way much-needed reforms to the Freedom of Information Act. It is an act which every citizen can take advantage of to gain information about the government, to hold the government accountable, find documents and information that is the citizens' right to have. 
   What we did was we restored the Freedom of Information Act to its rightful place where there is now once again a presumption in this government that the government should be open and disclose to its citizens what is going on, what it has for information and documents unless those documents fit into certain narrow exemptions. This has been a critical thing that we have done in this Congress. 
   I am proud to be a new Member and working hard for accountability. And when the American people see that they truly have an accountability Congress working for them to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse and corruption, to save taxpayer money, they will once again regain trust in their elected officials and in the people's House.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Chairman, the challenge of energy independence is perhaps the greatest challenge we face for the future of this country and our planet. It means national security, and it means jobs in the 21st century, and it means meeting the challenge of global climate change. 
   Twenty-three States have already adopted a renewable portfolio standard. In my State of New Hampshire, we have a standard of 25 percent by the year 2025. We should not be hampered by fear that we cannot accomplish great things in the country. Our entrepreneurs and our free market system are ready to meet the challenge. They are waiting for a national standard, for a renewable portfolio standard to provide them the certainty to move forward. It is certainty to the free market that this standard will meet. It is time for a national standard. 
   I support this amendment. I urge my colleagues and all those who understand the power of the entrepreneur in America and the free markets to support this amendment. It is time for full speed ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of an amendment offered by Mr. Welch of Vermont, my distinguished colleague, and me. This amendment would order a study using already appropriated funds to determine how best to administer a renewable energy rebate program for homes and small businesses. 
   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Energy Secretary to establish a rebate program to encourage consumers to use renewable energy to power their homes and small businesses. It included a broad definition of renewable energy, allowing Americans from every corner of the country to benefit from such a rebate. 
   The program has great potential for helping those without the initial capital to make their homes or small businesses green. However, after the program's inclusion in the 2005 Act, Congress did not follow through on its goal of encouraging renewable energy for families and small business owners. While it was authorized for a total of $1 billion from fiscal years 2006 through 2010, not one penny has been appropriated under this program to provide rebates under this program. 
   Now, more than ever, this program is essential to kick-start a clean green energy revolution for millions of American family and our small business owners. 
   Congress needs to know how we can make this program work. Our amendment would require a study using existing Department of Energy funds to create a plan for administering the rebate system and estimating how much money the program would need to effectively encourage families and small business owners to install renewable energy systems. With this information in hand, Congress will be better equipped to determine the best way to encourage renewable energy use. 
   Families and small businesses are among those who face the toughest challenges in coping with rising energy costs. Congress has had the good judgment to authorize a program to fix this program, and it's time we make it work. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher).

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that this noncontroversial amendment for a study is opposed. Since 2005, although the program has been authorized, no money has been appropriated. It is an effective, efficient use of resources to embark on a study with results to be delivered to us in 120 days, so Congress knows how best to implement the provisions of the program already authorized and how much it will cost. We will then be in a position to make educated determinations about how much money to appropriate for this very important program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I also thank Mr. Capuano for his leadership on this matter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and in strong support of accountability and transparency in all public service. 
   For years the former congressional leadership eroded the faith of the American people through corruption, dishonesty, and abuse of power. I came into office pledging to restore the people's trust; and as stewards of the public trust, we must hold Congress to the highest standard and end the abuses of the past. 
   This legislation before us is an important step in restoring the trust of the people we serve in this body. It puts ethics violations in the hands of an independent, nonpartisan board; and that is the right way to give the American people the confidence that any corruption will be investigated fairly and thoroughly. 
   I have also stood with my colleagues Mr. Murphy of Connecticut and Mr. Space of Ohio to cosponsor an amendment that would allow this body to have subpoena power in order to give the board the real teeth an outside investigative body should have. In my  judgment, I would have preferred that the leadership and the Rules Committee had allowed this amendment to reach the floor for consideration. In the fullness of time, I believe we will see the wisdom of giving this new independent ethics body all the tools it needs to investigate alleged violation. However, even without this added power, I will support this bill because the perfect must not be the enemy of the good. 
   Let there be no mistake, Mr. Speaker. This bill has had bipartisan input, and the bill was even pulled from the floor to make sure that on a bipartisan basis suggestions for improvement were heard, reviewed, and incorporated. 
   I was sent to Congress by the people of New Hampshire to clean up Washington. This legislation may not go all the way, but it goes a long way towards helping restore trust in the people's House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 943. 
   January 28, 2008, marked the 22nd anniversary of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. On January 28, 1986, at 11:38 eastern standard time, the Challenger took off from the Kennedy Space Center and disintegrated just 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven members of its brave crew. The accident occurred on what would have been the Challenger's 10th trip into space. 
   I introduced House Resolution 943 to honor the courage and bravery of all seven crew members who died as a result of this tragic accident. The crew of the Challenger embodied the goals of the United States space program and our highest ideals: a commitment to knowledge of our universe and inspiring a new generation of scientific pioneers. 
   The tragic accident that day was especially poignant for those of us in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a small State, and we pride ourselves on our sense of community. And one of those crew members was Christa McAuliffe of Concord, New Hampshire, my hometown. She was a friend. She was someone who was woven deeply into the fabric of our community. She touched the lives of countless students. She was a mom. She was somebody who was loved and admired. And she was on board the Challenger as the first participant of the Teacher in Space program, the pride of New Hampshire and of Concord and of the Nation, for the first teacher in space was enormous and seemed to magnify the tragedy of the accident. 
   Christa dedicated her life to education. She taught at Rundlett Junior High School, Bow Memorial Middle School, and Concord High School between 1978 and 1985. On July 19, 1985, she was selected from a field of roughly 11,000 applicants as the primary candidate for the Teacher in Space Project. Her mission as a crew member was to teach schoolchildren lessons from space and to encourage students to pursue careers in science and mathematics. 
   Twenty-two years after the Challenger disaster, Christa McAuliffe's goal of promoting scholarship in the sciences is more important than ever as our Nation works to stay at the forefront of global innovation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the anniversary of the Challenger disaster and to support House Resolution 943.

   The measure has the support of over 60 Members of Congress, and provides our body a collective opportunity to both recognize and congratulate the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences on its 50th anniversary Grammy Awards celebration. 
   Established in 1957, the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, also known as the Recording Academy, serves as the premier organization of musicians, producers, recording engineers and other recording professionals dedicated to improving the quality of life and cultural conditions of others through music and the arts. As a producer of recordings myself, I am especially aware of the academy's fine and important work. 
   The Recording Academy is best known for its presentation of the Grammy Awards, which is the only peer-presented award ceremony to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry without regard to album sales or chart position. 
   In addition to the Grammys, the Recording Academy is also known for its philanthropic efforts to cultivate the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the recording industry's contributions to American culture through music and education programs offered by the Grammy Foundation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm sure we all agree that the Recording Academy has made a significant contribution to the landscape of our country. For its service in improving the environment for music, music makers and music lovers over the past 50 years, the Recording Academy is undoubtedly deserving of recognition. Therefore, I urge swift passage of House Concurrent Resolution 273.

   As we are aware, February marks the beginning of Black History Month, which was first celebrated as Negro History Week in 1926 by Carter G. Woodson, a noted African American author and scholar, but has since become a month-long commemorative celebration as a way of recognizing and highlighting the role black Americans have played in America since the existence of our country and the role they continue to play on a daily basis. 
   Across our great land, Black History Month is marked by the offering of educational and cultural programs, heightened media coverage and special celebrations and events, all designed to share with the world the strength, ingenuity, and accomplishments of our fellow American citizens. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we move to recognize Black History Month and this year's theme of ``Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism in America,'' let's all recall the experiences and valuable contributions of African Americans to our fine country. Let us not forget that black history is truly American history.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1361, the RECOVER Act. This bill provided a much-needed overhaul to the Small Business Administration and its disaster aid program. After a disaster, the SBA issues loans to help individuals and small businesses rebuild their lives, often shattered by storms and other natural disasters.     
   After Hurricane Katrina, the average time for the SBA to process a loan, not including closing, was 74 days, far above the agency's goal of 21 days. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
   As I speak here today, people all across my home State of New Hampshire are dealing with the aftermath of a recent powerful nor'easter. On April 15, 2007, New Hampshire experienced a severe storm that dropped almost 6 inches of water in a matter of hours. The State as a whole has experienced sustained power and communications outages, and there are currently over 100 local communities that are reporting significant damage to local infrastructure. Our Governor has declared a state of emergency. 
   More than 60 percent of the businesses in New Hampshire are small businesses. This program is absolutely vital to my constituents now more than ever.

   And, really, it all comes down to accountability. Because Mr. Kline and I came to this body as a result of the elections of November 2006. And in those elections, the American people spoke loudly and clearly. In my home State of New Hampshire, they said we need a new direction in Iraq; our strategy is not working. 
   The war in Iraq has not made us safer. The war in Iraq is not enhancing American security. The war in Iraq is not stabilizing the Middle East and advancing our true national security interests. The war in Iraq is costing billions and billions and billions of dollars, sapping our military strength and readiness, and leaving us, as a Nation, poorer and unable to respond to conflicts around the globe and the urgent need of domestic priorities at home, the needs of working families here in America who need the kinds of funds that are being diverted into a war that is not working, that need to be used at home to help take care of Americans.

   It's very important, I think, to take stock of what has happened, where we are now and how we are moving forward, and also to talk about the accountability of the administration and the Republicans, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who have stood foursquare up until now with the failed policies of this President. 
   The picture that I have put up here is a picture of President Bush with virtually the entire Republican delegation standing with him when he rejected the Democrats' attempt to set reasonable guidelines for troop readiness, for benchmarks, for Iraqi accountability, and a timeline for the responsible, strategic redeployment of American troops to protect our security. 
   We've heard a lot in the past few days, in the past few months from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who keep blasting Democrats. They say, well, we're not getting anything done. But Democrats have stood up time and time again to help push a new direction in Iraq. And frankly, and unfortunately, it's been our Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have not helped move this along, who have not stood up to their President and said to our President, this is an American issue. We must all work together for a responsible strategy that protects American security. 
   Now, after 6 months in the majority, House and Senate Democrats really are changing the debate on the war. We're insisting that the Bush administration and the Iraqi Government be held accountable. We need benchmarks to measure progress, or the lack thereof. We need to challenge the stay-the-course strategy, and we will continue to challenge this President's stay-the-course strategy. 
   And what is not too surprising to me now, as we sit here today ready for the July 4th recess and about 6 months into the 110th Congress, under pressure from responsible Democrats and the American public, an increasing number  of Senate Republicans are now distancing themselves from the President's policy, even as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, our House Republicans, continue to cling to it. The question is, when will the rubber-stamp House Republicans face the reality, join the Democrats, together with the American people, in demanding a real change and a responsible, strategic redeployment of our forces from Iraq? That, as you said, doesn't necessarily mean and shouldn't mean, in my view, that we bring everybody home in a precipitous fashion. That's what the Republicans continue to claim Democrats are talking about, but nothing could be further from the truth. Because the Democratic Caucus and the American people understand that what is needed is a responsible, strategic redeployment to protect American security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Klein, I want to pick up on a few points you made, because as I have traveled around New Hampshire, I have met with numerous veterans and lots of folks in the active military. The people in New Hampshire are not especially liberal, left-wing people. They are Americans. 
   This issue is really an issue of what it means to be a patriot. Because we all want the best outcome we can possibly make for this country, for our troops, for our veterans, for our wounded warriors. We want to do the best we can for America. On whatever side of this debate about the proper policy, I think we all need to respect each other's views on that. 
   I find that in New Hampshire. But what I find is a deep yearning that this country is accountable to the American people, that our government is accountable to the American people in a way that sets us on a course for being number one. 
   Now, I don't mean that in any big, bullying way, but number one because, up until recently, in my years--I have been around for 56 years--this country stood on its values. We stood on the principles of truth, justice, fairness, equality, and opportunity for all. That is what the American people expect from their government. That is where they want our country to go. They see that the war in Iraq has diverted us from being as great as we can be, from fulfilling the true promise of America both in the blood and treasure of our brave soldiers lost in the sands of Iraq. 
   They also are very concerned. I speak to people about some of what happened and the mistakes that were made that produced the issues that we are in today. They are very concerned, for instance, that while 9/11 was caused by al Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan with the Taliban, that the Bush administration not only implied but said that somehow, Saddam Hussein and Iraq were tied in with al Qaeda at the time of that attack. It just wasn't so. 
   We have made some serious mistakes that they see. They see that the object of going in, occupying Baghdad and immediately firing the civil service, de-Baathification, firing the Army, simply provided fuel for the insurgency, provided people and weapons to fight against stability in Iraq. They see those questions. 
   Now the question they are asking is, where to? Where do we go from here? The good news is that some of the Republican Senators have begun to see the light. I just want to quote one of our distinguished colleagues who is in the Senate Chamber, Senator Richard Lugar, the distinguished Republican from Indiana, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, who said, ``In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long term. Our security interests call for a downsizing and redeployment of U.S. military forces to a more sustainable position.'' That was a speech by Senator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, on the Senate floor on June 25 of this year. He is beginning to face the reality and getting ready for a new direction in Iraq. 
   We have now been joined by our distinguished colleague, Jason Altmire from Pennsylvania. We are delighted to have you with us. He often speaks with the 30-Something Group. It is a real treat to have him with the New Member Caucus tonight. The Class of 2006 welcomes you, Jason.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Kline, thank you very much for those thoughts. I expect that over this July 4th recess, a number of our colleagues, especially those on the other side of the aisle, will probably be hearing from their constituents about their concerns about the current course in Iraq, the failure of this administration's strategy, with the surge and the way things have been handled, the numerous mistakes, both strategic and implementation and in conception have deeply, deeply hurt us. 
   I know the American people, as we are here in Congress, especially in discussions with Democratic Members on the Armed Services Committee, are deeply concerned that American readiness, that our readiness to deal with other conflicts that may arise, not be jeopardized, and we are going to take important steps and have taken important steps to improve the readiness that has been hurt by these deployments in Iraq. 
   At some point we are going to talk a little bit more about what it has meant for our veterans, but we have been joined by another distinguished colleague who I would like to introduce. JOE SESTAK, a member of the class of 2006 from Pennsylvania, came to this Congress with an extraordinarily distinguished career, serving our country in the military in the Navy. 
   He is a gentleman who understands military, military matters, military operations. He is deeply committed to American strategic interests and is in the forefront of those in the Democratic Caucus who are intent on seeing a new direction in Iraq. 
   I would like to now turn it over to you, JOE SESTAK.

   Mr. HODES. I thank you for those comments. Coming from someone with the kind of military experience you have, they ring especially true. 
   You know, often on the floor of the House of Representatives, what we have experienced in our first 6 months is political rhetoric that masks some of the deeper, more complex and nuanced issues that really are worthy of discussion in deciding as a nation how to move forward. 
   It is really what the American people have been asking, not only of us here in Congress, but especially of their President, their Vice President, the leaders in the White House, who have been responsible for this unfortunate failed policy. And what the American people, who are a generous, compassionate and patient people, have been deeply yearning for, is a real discussion of the kind we are having now, that points the way towards American security. Because, as you point out, we have created, unfortunately, more instability in the Middle East.     
   And now, however we got into it, we have to make the best of a bad situation because we are all in this together. That is the spirit with which we as Democrats are trying to talk to our Republican colleagues. 
   There has been a lot of name-calling on the floor. They call us cut-and-run and say this and that and the other thing. But as you have so well put, we are talking about a strategy. Strategy is the key word. It means a strategic redeployment to protect American security. 
   If we just step back for a moment, I want to share some of the thoughts of a very esteemed retired general, General William Odom, who addressed us recently about the situation there. He said, Look at the situation we are in. Our troops are in a sea of hostile people, approximately 7 million in number, and growing in hostility every day. Fully 80 percent of the Iraqis want the occupation to end. Fifty percent of them think badly enough about us that they would sanction violence against Americans. 
   We are surrounded in Iraq by unfriendly nations, Iran and Syria. We have problems with Hezbollah in Lebanon; Hamas and new issues for Israel. Israel's security has been threatened by the instability in the Middle East because, unfortunately, our misadventure in Iraq has emboldened Islamic jihadists in the region. It has not made us more safe, but has grown the Islam jihad movement. It has been the best recruiting device they have had. 
   So he understands the importance of what to do when American troops find themselves caught in the middle of not one civil war, as he put it, but in the middle of multiple civil wars. He addressed the concern, which is a valid concern on the part of all of us, of what will happen in Iraq when we redeploy in a planned strategic way. People are concerned. What will we leave? 
   We have a government at this point which is essentially not working. It is hardly a unity government. They can't get themselves together to have their army stand up or get the ministers to work together. They seem to have fallen into tribal allegiances. 
   But what General Odom pointed out in recent discussions with experts in the region, including generals of countries whom we have worked with, they have pointed out that it is highly likely that when we leave Iraq, when the American troop presence, which is the cause, in their view, of much instability, is gone, that Iraq--it is not going to be great, but the kind of cataclysmic events that people are predicting, in their view, won't occur because the Iraqis have had a long history of tribal conflict even within the Saddam Hussein regime. And remembering that Iraq was forged in 1916 out of separate tribal entities by the British and French in a grand deal, there has been an undercurrent of these tensions, which the tribal leaders, they believe, are going to work out. 
   Personally, I believe ultimately there will be a political solution in Iraq that the Iraqis must determine for themselves. Our military presence cannot impose a political solution; only they can. In my view, based on the research that I have done and based on discussions with experts in the region, I think it is highly likely that Iraq will devolve into some kind of autonomous regions, perhaps three autonomous regions. In Kurdistan, one representing the Sunnis, one representing the Shia, who then use the central government for certain federal purposes, but one which recognizes, as their constitution wants to go to, that a political solution, trying to hold together this government which isn't working, won't work for them, and they will find once we are gone and they no longer have us as a crutch, they will find the political solution they need to carry their country forward. 
   And if we, as a true world leader, redeploy strategically and wisely and then use our diplomatic resources to bring neighbors, allies, friends, reunite a real coalition in the world to help, we may be able to have the kind of result of a stable state that will help us not only in the region but around the world. And it is what the American people want. 
   It is this kind of discussion and this kind of thinking that the President ought to be having with his generals. I hope that as we sit here tonight talking about Iraq, and as we prepare to return home for July 4, I hope that President Bush is in the White House and I hope he is talking to his generals about what the plan ought to be for a strategic redeployment. But I fear that he is not doing that at this point. 
   Mr. Altmire, why don't I throw it over to you.

   Mr. HODES. I thank all my colleagues, Mr. Sestak and Mr. Altmire from Pennsylvania, Mr. Klein from Florida. It has been a truly interesting discussion tonight focusing on strategy, the complexity of a world that has changed but which Democrats are facing with boldness and leadership to help take our country and the world in a new direction, to reverse the damage that's been done by the administration and reassert our role as a leader in this world on our principles and our values, not merely our military might but only using our military might in service of the good judgment our leaders exercise in the pursuit of peace. 
   As we leave for our July 4 recess, I want to leave us with this thought. The Army says that it will leave no soldier behind. And as we discussed here tonight, the Democrats in Congress have committed to leaving no veteran behind. We have voted and passed the biggest increase in Veterans' Administration spending for health care and needed services in this country's history. 
   The chart I have here shows in dramatic form what has happened over the past few years. From 2003 to 2008, the VA is treating many, many more Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. We've been in a conflict where our soldiers have been deployed, redeployed, redeployed and redeployed again, two times, three times, four times. Whereas compared to World War II, when their active duty tours were 180 days, they're now seeing 15 months, wreaking havoc on the soldiers and their families at the same time. As General Odom put it today, they're experiencing cataclysmic events every day, new kinds of injuries, polytrauma, traumatic brain injuries, PTSD have created great complexity in our VA system. 
   So as we go out on July 4, I would ask us all to think about what supporting our troops really means. In my view, supporting our troops means employing and following a course that is a real, smart, strategic effort to protect American security by redeploying our troops from the middle of a civil war in which they don't belong, number one. That is truly supporting our troops, because they are owed the policy that the civilian leaders should be following. That is what our troops are owed and our veterans are owed when they come home, the best that we can give them. No more broken promises from the White House. No more broken promises from the Republicans who have cut the budgets time and time again, who have cut health care in the VA, who have imposed fee increases on our veterans. No more. We will leave no veteran behind. The Democrats promise that. We have followed through on our commitment. 
   And I am so proud to stand with you all as Members of the 110th Congress to help lead this country in a new direction and be the kind of world leader that the American people expect and deserve. 
   Thank you very much and good night.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on this committee. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1427. This bill provides an overhaul of the government-sponsored entities, and it creates a much-needed, unified regulator for all GSEs. 
   Now, it was the high-profile accounting scandals at Fannie and Freddie in recent years that demanded that Congress restore accountability and strengthen oversight in these institutions. 
   So this bill creates a strong, independent regulator at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System with broad powers comparable to those of Federal bank regulators. The bill also creates an Affordable Housing Fund to be managed by the new GSE regulator. 
   I want to thank Chairman Frank for creating the Energy Efficiency Task Force on the Financial Services Committee. I am pleased to serve on this task force, chaired by my colleague from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter. The task force is dedicated to greening the financial services community, and in connection with H.R. 1427, we included an important provision that would incentivize Fannie and Freddie to purchase green mortgages. This provision is a great first step toward our goal. 
   This is a bipartisan bill, and it is widely supported by financial institutions, lenders, housing industry participants, housing groups and other financial service providers. 
   So when I hear the colleagues on the other side of the aisle speaking against the unified regulator, they are standing against accountability and oversight. And when I hear them speaking against an Affordable Housing Fund, they are standing against poor people in this country who need our help.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to funding the war in Iraq, President Bush and the House Republicans are willing to write blank checks for billions of dollars with absolutely no questions asked. After billions misspent and mismanaged, the President is preparing a new war funding request for the upcoming year that is expected to cost the American taxpayer another $190 billion. Contrast that with the disregard both the President and the majority of House Republicans have shown towards bipartisan legislation that would ensure that 10 million low-income children have access to health insurance. 
   President Bush has just vetoed a bill that would invest $35 billion more in the CHIP program over the next 5 years and allow us to reach 4 million more children who are already eligible for the program. House Republicans will now have to decide if they will once again stand with a President who suffers from misguided priorities or if they will listen to the American people's will. 
   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, it's time to stand up for our kids and stand down from a discredited President.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about a number of issues that are of grave importance to this Congress and to the people of this country. I will be joined by some of my colleagues tonight who represent districts all over this country. 
   We are going to talk about a number of things tonight. We are going to talk about fiscal responsibility, which means money. It means we are going to talk a little bit about how in this Democratic majority Congress we have now taken a new responsible approach to spending the taxpayers' hard-earned tax dollars, because that is one of the main reasons that the taxpayers of this country sent a new Democratic majority to Congress, because they saw what had happened under previous Congresses. They saw that the Congress had engaged in borrow-and-spend policies that had left us with huge deficits, where before we had big surpluses, now we were running out of balance. And everybody knew that they couldn't run their businesses that way. They couldn't run their homes that way. And so they sent us to Congress to make a change about what we were going to do. 
   We are also going to move to talk about health care. We are going to talk about health care for kids because that is an issue that is very, very current. The President has vetoed a fiscally responsible, that means responsible with the money of the taxpayers, bill that would provide health care for the neediest kid in the country. He has vetoed that legislation. He said he doesn't want to have health care for our kids by vetoing that legislation. 
   We are going to be coming up for a vote in not too long about that. So we are going to talk about what it means for kids and for health care, and we are also going to sort of compare that to what is going on with the spending on the war in Iraq because the President and his administration have come and said they want to spend $191 billion more this year on the war in Iraq but they don't want to spend $35 billion to insure our kids. 
   I will just talk briefly now, and I have got a chart up, that shows you where we were when we started this Congress, what had happened with the mess. It is an example of what we were sent to fix, because this chart shows public borrowing by the administrations and the annual average of what we had to borrow to run our government. What you can see is where we came in to Congress. What we saw was, if you take a look down here in the lower corner, we started with President Carter. 
   That little blue line shows that we were borrowing about $50 billion. Then you can see what happened under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Then you can see over here that under President Clinton we were able to handle the taxpayers' money in a responsible way. In fact, President Clinton, who was a Democrat, handled money so responsibly for the taxpayers of this country that when he left office in the year 2000 we were looking at budget surpluses over the next 10 years in the trillions of dollars. But when the Republicans took control, when President Bush came in, in 2000, he turned that upside down and topsy-turvy, and what we were left with coming into this Congress was the fact that President Bush was borrowing about $300 billion during his first 6 years. He had turned surpluses upside down into huge deficits that left us in the hole as far as the eye could see. 
   That is what we came in with. We came in with that, and we had to restore fiscal responsibility. Now, ``fiscal'' is a big word. It just means being responsible with the hard-earned money that the taxpayers of this country send to Washington so that an effective government honors local control but is able to get the projects done and run the programs that the people of this country expect. They expect us to be stewards of the public trust. By that, I mean they expect us to be honest about how we are spending their money. They expect us to use their money wisely. They expect us, just like they do at home and in their businesses, to balance things out and not spend more than we take in. And they want to make sure that we are spending their money wisely.  
   So what we did in very short order, and then I will throw it over to my good colleague from Wisconsin, was the first thing we did when we came into Congress was we established, reestablished, what are called pay-as-you-go rules. It basically means if you are going to increase spending over here, in order to keep the deficit from getting worse and making sure we are headed towards balance, we have to decrease something over here. So we put in these pay-as-you-go rules. Every bill that is covered by those rules has been a fiscally responsible thing to do. It means that we are using the taxpayers' money wisely as we head towards a balanced budget. Because the other thing we did was in the Democratic budget proposal, we set this country on a new track to be responsible about the taxpayers' money. We said we are going to establish a balanced budget by the year 2012. We are going to do that with the pay-as-you-go rules and making sure that we are restraining Federal spending, that even as we shift priorities towards health care for kids, health care for our veterans, benefits for our wounded warriors, with the greatest rise in spending in veterans' benefits in the 77 years of the Veterans Administration, even while we are spending money on competitiveness, we are headed towards a balanced budget with pay-as-you-go rules because we understand that it is not our money. It is the taxpayers' money. Our job is to spend it wisely and to spend it in a balanced way. We also got rid of something called ``fast tracking'' in order to make sure that our spending was responsible. 
   Now, with that as a framework, one of the things we are still facing are huge costs for the war in Iraq. As I said earlier on, the President and the administration has now come and said they want $191 billion more this year for the war in Iraq. We have had a bill that would help insure our kids that would cost about $35 billion. So really, we are faced with a choice in this country. Are we, and are my colleagues across the aisle who are supporting the President, going to decide that it is not worth the investment to invest $35 billion over 5 years in health care for kids, but it is worth the money to invest $191 billion in the war in Iraq? Is that the kind of choice we, as a country, are going to make? Is that something that is sound policy? Does it make sense for our kids? Does it make sense for health care? Does it make sense for the taxpayers? Does it make sense for the country? Those are the kinds of questions that we have to answer. 
   Now, I would like to turn it over to my good friend from Wisconsin, Dr. STEVE KAGEN, a man who understands what health care is about, who has been in the trenches helping kids get well, helping families stay healthy. He understands things about children's health care. I am going to turn it over to you, my good friend from Wisconsin, Dr. STEVE KAGEN.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Well, it is really an important point to underscore, and I appreciate your saying it, which we all agree, that there is nobody on whatever side of the debate you're in about Iraq who doesn't understand that our troops have served with extraordinary bravery and courage. They have performed. It is really up to the policymakers. It is up to the administration, who makes the policy. It is up to Congress, who makes the policy, the Senate. It is up to the policymakers, who send our military to do the job to make the right judgments and right decisions about when they should be sent, under what conditions they ought to be sent, and what their mission is. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the real sad failings is that the mission here has changed so many times, nobody knows what it is anymore. Seventy percent of the American people now understand that whatever it is that we have tried to do in Iraq hasn't worked. The Iraqi Government has not stood up. We have spent lives, our brave troops have given their lives, thousands and thousands of wounded, at a huge cost, because so far we have spent about half a trillion dollars in direct costs for the war in Iraq.  Half a trillion dollars. That has got so many zeroes that I really have trouble figuring out and contemplating wrapping my brain around what half a trillion dollars is. That is $500 billion. 
   That is an awful lot of money to experience what we have experienced in Iraq, because it's clear now that the war hasn't made us safer and more secure. It's clear that, unfortunately, al Qaeda and the Taliban are still strong and resurgent in the Pakistan-Afghanistan area, and still threatening to us. The region is more unstable. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is clear we need a new course. But we don't often talk about the costs, because it is not just the $500 billion or half a trillion dollars we have spent in direct costs in Iraq, but we are facing $1 trillion-plus in total costs for the care of all those who have served in Iraq, who are going to come home and need care on an ongoing basis as we go forward. And the costs in lost productivity to society are huge. 
   When you think about the comparison of the costs between what we have spent in Iraq and what we could spend that money on in terms of providing health care for our kids, as this Democratic Congress in a bipartisan way has proposed, because the SCHIP bill that we sent to the President was a bipartisan bill, we passed a bill in the House and then we sent it over to the Senate. They compromised. We worked with the Senate and we compromised on the bill. The Senate had some different ideas. They sort of reduced things in some areas and sent it back to us. We then sent this compromise bill to the President. 
   But even though it was a compromise bill, and even though it was supported by 45 Republicans in the House and numbers of Senators on the Republican side in the Senate, and I can talk about some of what they said later on, the President decided that $35 billion was too much to spend on our kids. He decided that $35 billion over 5 years for kids' health care wasn't worth the investment; that $35 billion for American kids who needed health care, American kids at the lowest income levels, struggling families trying to make ends meet, was not something that the President of the United States was willing to invest our money in. This, despite the fact that in previous speeches he had promised that he was going to cover millions of new kids for health care. But for some reason, when the Democratic-controlled Congress sent it to the President, he decided that it was too much. He also decided that he could ask us for $191 billion more for a failed policy in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is how it breaks down. Here are the facts. Here are the figures. They are shown on this chart that I have. 
   What this shows is that 37 days in Iraq would pay for 10 million children to have health care every year. It shows 37 days in Iraq, 10 million kids with health care. One day in Iraq is costing us $330 million. That money, $330 million in the SCHIP program, would cover more than 270,000 kids. Just stop for a minute and think about those numbers. 
   Dr. Kagen, I don't know about you, but where I come from, $330 million is a significant amount of money. That is what we are spending every day in Iraq. It would cover more than a quarter of a million kids for a year of health care. When you get into a week in Iraq, we are spending $2.3 billion, that is billion dollars, $2.3 billion every week, and that amount of money, if we spent it on SCHIP, would cover 1,891,000 kids. That is a huge number of kids, for 1 week of Iraq war spending. And it is hard to say we are spending our money wisely in Iraq. 
   Let me just tell you a little bit about a hearing that I was on. I have the privilege of sitting on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and one of the issues we took up in the past couple of weeks was the issue of the cost of corruption in Iraq. 
   Now, the Middle East has always been a difficult place when it comes to how governments spend money, how they account or don't account to their citizens, what kind of accounting practices they have, and the issue of corruption has traditionally been one that throughout the Middle East has been a significant problem. So you would think, for instance, that maybe in Iraq, now that we are there in such strength, we have 160,000 of our troops fighting there, we have support personnel, we have a huge number of contractors, another bit of a problem that we ran into. But with all these contractors and all these people and all the American money and all the oversight and all the planning, you would think that maybe after 5 years of the Iraq occupation we would be in a position to do something about the corruption in Iraq, to make sure that money was being spent wisely, because if you are going to spend $2.3 billion in one week in Iraq, which otherwise would cover almost 2 million kids for health care for 1 year, you want to make sure that it is going to be spent well. You would think you would want to make sure. 
   So at this oversight hearing we had on October 4, we had the chief judge from Iraq who was dealing with corruption and accountability under the new al Maliki government that we have supported come to our hearing. By the way, he is no longer in Iraq, because he fears for his life. So not only is there a problem on the money side, but there is a problem when people try to do something about it. He now fears for his life, so he is over in this country, and he came to testify. His name is Radhi Hamza al Radhi, former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity. 
   He took the oath, and testified as follows. He told us that the corruption within the Iraqi Government has cost the Iraqi people $18 billion. So instead of its original purpose, infrastructure, new hospitals, electricity, things that the people need, he told us the money is now being used to finance terrorist militias in Iraq. 
   Also of note with this government of al Maliki that we are supporting, what the judge said was, when we asked him, why are you here and what happened when you tried to do something about the corruption? What he said was, well, I tried to investigate many cases of corruption within the government of Iraq and with Iraqi officials. It was my job. I was set up. I was supposed to coordinate with the Americans who were overseeing the corruption and coordinate with the Iraqis who were overseeing the corruption. My job was to investigate corruption. 
   But he ran into a bit of a roadblock. You know what he told us the roadblock was? The roadblock, for example, was Prime Minister Maliki himself, who blocked his attempts to uncover the truth and to deal with corruption. Why did he do it? He did it because the people that the judge was investigating were Shia, so the Prime Minister didn't want those people investigated, or because they were related in some way to the Prime Minister, so those people couldn't be investigated. 
   So with the money we have poured into Iraq, the money we have poured in for reconstruction and other things, the Iraqi Government is missing $18 billion worth in corruption. That is what we are dealing with in Iraq. That is where our money is going. And instead of covering our kids for health care, we want to spend another $191 billion more in Iraq.

   Mr. HODES. As I hear the stories that you are telling me from the folks back home in your district in Wisconsin, it literally breaks my heart to think, as a Member of Congress, we are having to fight, we are having to fight hard for the people of this country to override a Presidential veto which says we are going to spend money on a failed war instead of spending money on health care for our people. Health care for our people. We would rather spend the money over there on something that isn't working. But questioning whether or not we are being wise about making a basic investment in the health care for kids with a program that has worked well to help lift kids out of poverty and into health, because when kids are healthy, they can learn. When the kids are learning and productive, their families are working better. Those are the kinds of things that the American people expect us to be spending our money on. 
   They are asking those questions. Why are we spending so much money in the sands of Iraq and with so little to show for it and why aren't we investing for kids at home. And they may not even know where all that money is going because the numbers are so big; $191 billion, what does that mean to anybody? When I carry around a $10 bill in my wallet, I can handle those sums. But $191 billion, what is it going for? What is it paying for? What kind of value are the taxpayers getting for what they are spending?

   Mr. HODES. It is a fair thing for the American people to expect competence from their government. They expect us to manage their money well, to manage it wisely, to be smart and be prudent and to be basically competent. That is one of the things that an effective government does. 
   When you think about some of the ways that our government has unfortunately mismanaged the effort in Iraq, the imagination cannot even keep up with what kinds of things have gone on. 
   Here are a couple of things. We know that the Bush administration has tragically mismanaged the war. The money we have spent on contracting has just been like throwing it out the window because we have had contracts upon contracts and subcontracts, nobody knows where the money has gone. Somebody is making a lot of money in Iraq. It was a free-for-all from the beginning with no-bid contracts, contractors piled on top of each other, and millions and billions of dollars. 
   We heard in one of our hearings in the Oversight Committee how we shipped $12 billion in cash over to Iraq during the early days of the occupation. The money was just given away to the ministries in Iraq and spent without any kind of accountability. And there have been how many prosecutions for war profiteering? Very few. 
   Luckily, our Congress in the past few days has enacted the War Profiteering Act, and we hope that will mean some real accountability. But there are billions unaccounted for. We have spent more than $50 billion on U.S. contractors for relief and reconstruction activities in Iraq alone; yet we heard in our hearings how these contractors who were being paid millions and billions of dollars weren't getting the jobs done. Things were left unfinished. The money was being wasted, and with all that, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction had a report recently. He said that the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, that was the government that we set up under Mr. Bremer, who is a good friend of the President, we set up this Coalition Provisional Authority. He said, I am the ruler of everything, I'm running the show. He ran the show. They can't account for $8.8 billion. I will say it again: They can't account for $8.8 billion. 
   If you look at what that involves, that is about the money to insure over 8 million kids under SCHIP, $8.8 billion. That is about the equivalent that it means. Gone, unaccounted for, can't figure it out. That is not competent management. 
   Take the issue of Blackwater that we have dealt with in hearings the other day. We found out that this company, Blackwater, which is providing security in Iraq and which now is under question for a terrible incident in which many Iraq civilians seem to have been gunned down, it is now being investigated by the FBI. Well, Blackwater is charging the government $1,222 a day for the services of a private military contractor. Each person they have got, $1,222 a day. That is $445,000 a year for each of these security guards, and that is over six times what we pay an equivalent U.S. soldier. 
   When we heard that during the hearing, we sat there stunned. We scratched our heads. We brought in the State Department and asked them what they knew about it. They couldn't give us any good answers. They were being  guarded by these guys at these exorbitant costs, but they were not willing to talk to us. They weren't able to talk to us and couldn't give us any answers. We wanted to know why shouldn't we have U.S. soldiers perform these duties at a much lower cost. 
   Now, one of the things that we expect from our government is competent management. We certainly haven't gotten it in this effort in Iraq, and we want to make sure that our kids are covered. We have incompetent management in Iraq, or are we going to cover our kids. Those are the kinds of choices that we are facing. They are pretty basic choices.

   Mr. HODES. It is extraordinary to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and have the privilege of representing hardworking families in this country who get it. I believe the people of this country know in their hearts that our kids are important. The kids are not Democrats or Republicans; they are American kids. That is why the SCHIP bill is a bill about American kids. It is not a partisan bill. In fact, it had enormous bipartisan support. That's why 45 Members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans supported the bill. That's why it was supported in the Senate by so many Republican Senators. 
   Some of the things that were said by Republicans about the SCHIP children's health care bill which our President has now vetoed and which we are trying to override so we can bring health care to the most needy American kids, so we can make the investment that the American people understand is the moral thing to do, the smart thing to do with money, the smart thing to do for our future, they understand our kids are our future. Here is what some Republicans have said about that bill. 
   Representative Rehberg from Montana said: ``I think it is a sensible, reasonable compromise.'' Sounds right to me. He said that on September 25. 
   Representative THOMAS PETRI, a Republican from Wisconsin, said: ``A lot of hard work has been put into this bill, including the successful efforts of Senators ORRIN HATCH of Utah and CHUCK GRASSLEY of Iowa, both good Republicans and conservatives. So,'' he said, ``I am comfortable that this bill is the right compromise, that it will provide much-needed health insurance for the Nation's low-income children, and do it at a reasonable cost.'' He said that in the Northwestern in Wisconsin, a paper, on September 25 of 2007, this year. 
   Representative WAYNE GILCHREST, a Republican from Maryland, says, ``This is a compromise version of the bill which has the support of a broad coalition of groups. It focuses on the lowest-income kids, and fixes a lot of problems with the current programs.'' 
   Now, these aren't the words of Democrats. These aren't the words of people who some folks might even dismiss as liberals. You know, when you use the word ``liberals,'' just trying to spend people's money, they say.     
   These are the words of my Republican colleagues who sit here day after day and have come together in a bipartisan coalition, in a bipartisan way, as good Americans to send the President a reasonable compromise that represents the best thinking, the best work that we could produce to cover our kids. Because the children's health care bill that we sent the President is not only good health care for kids, it's good health care, period. And it's done in a responsible way because what we did was we said we'll spend $35 billion over 5 years, we'll fix some of the problems with the current program, we'll not only insure the 6 million kids who are now the beneficiaries of this SCHIP program, but we'll expand it to about 3.8, almost 4 million more kids, but we're going to pay for every penny of that investment. How are we going to pay for every penny of that investment? We're going to frankly ask smokers to pay some more than they're paying now and use that money to pay for our kids. 
   So there's a trade. We have health care for kids and sound health policy because when we have smokers, we've got secondhand smoke, we've got huge rates of disease. So we're going to be sound fiscally. That means spending the taxpayers' money wisely. We're not going to spend new dollars. We're going to take from over here and pay for our kids over here. 
   So that's what we proposed, and as I said, all these Republicans, good, good Americans, and our colleagues here decided that it was worth it on a bipartisan basis, and here's what the President proposed. Here was the President's approach to what he wanted to do for America's kids. 
   Under the President's budget, 840,000 of our kids will lose their SCHIP coverage. Eight hundred forty thousand kids under the President's proposal will lose their health care. That's what he wants to do, and what we proposed, in a bipartisan way, in this Congress, one of the stunning achievements of the 110th Congress was doing what the American people asked us to do, because one of the things I heard when I came to Congress was we want to see  you folks get past the bickering. We want to see you folks get past all that gridlock in Congress. We want to see Republicans and Democrats come together, come together and put the interests of Americans first. 
   And so on this bill, the kids' health bill, that's exactly what happened. Republicans and Democrats came together, sent it to the President, and said, Mr. President, this stunning example of bipartisan cooperation is ready for your signature, pick up the pen and help America's kids, Mr. President. 
   And what the President did and I personally in my heart of hearts find it not just disappointing but disgraceful, that what he did was he vetoed that bill. And now we're faced with trying to bring some of our Republican colleagues along to help override that veto so our kids, our poorest kids can have health insurance. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Well, I hear you loud and clear, and I think the American people do, also. 
   You know, there's often a mistrust of politicians, and you and I came to Congress not from lives as professional politicians. You and I came to Congress because we saw trouble in our country. We saw priorities that weren't being handled right. We saw policies that weren't working for hardworking American people. We saw a country we loved where the Constitution was treated as a nuisance, where the American people weren't told the truth, where the real needs of hardworking folks in our districts, in our home States, the needs for health care, for good schools, for good jobs, for rational trade policies, for an end to wars that didn't work weren't being answered by the politicians when we ran for office. 
   You were a doctor. I practiced law for years. I was never in the State legislature. I don't think you were either. We came here to do the most good for most of the people all of the time. 
   And on this bill in particular, it is such a shame that it has become any kind of political football. We didn't make it that way. What we did on this bill was we reached across the aisle and we said to our Republican colleagues, come on, this is for America; we can at least agree on this, that we're going to get past the gridlock, we're going to help kids because that's what Americans are about. 
   We're good, decent people who understand that our kids are our future, and whatever political party we're in, our kids are our future. We love them and we want to help them. They shouldn't be sick. The sight of one sick child who otherwise could have been helped with the SCHIP bill, who goes ill, who lies there sick because his family or her family can't afford to take her to the doctor because this President has decided that a war in Iraq is worth spending $191 billion on but our kids aren't worth $35 billion over 5 years is something that I think you and I have a hard time understanding. It has a direct impact. 
   And for us as politicians here in Washington, sitting in the House of Representatives, it's a great privilege, great honor, great obligation which we take seriously, but ultimately, the way change happens in this country is at the grassroots. It's people around America, and there are probably a lot of folks who are listening to us tonight because this goes out all over the country, and what I'm begging the people of this country to do, what I'm asking is that it's up to them, Mr. Speaker. It's up to the people in this country to say to the President, to say to their representatives, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, who haven't voted for the SCHIP bill and who have got to vote to override this veto, it's up to the people of this country to step up, step forward, use e-mail, use mail, use the telephones. Don't let this go. 
   We need the people of this country to step up and speak to their representatives and say this veto must not stand. It's not right for America. It's not who we are. It's not the moral thing. It's not the right thing to do monetarily. It's not the right thing for our kids, to send a message loud and clear to the  President of the United States that says we're not going to stand down with you, we're going to stand up for our kids. 
   Because if we don't do it, if the people of this country don't do it, if the House of Representatives, if the Congress won't stand up for kids, we know the President won't, who will? We have the opportunity in the next week or so to come to a vote, and I think it's going to come up to the floor of this House on Monday next week. Maybe I'm off on my date. It will be the 18th of October. There's going to be a vote right here on this floor where you and I are standing of whether or not we are going to override the President's veto, and I want my colleagues and especially those who we need on the other side of the aisle who are thinking about whether or not to support the President or support the kids to hear from the people of this country, because I'm betting, as sure as I'm standing here representing the good people of New Hampshire, I'm betting the people of this country want the President and the Congress to stand up for kids, not to stand down with the discredited President. 
   That's what I'm betting. That's where I am putting my money. I'm putting my money on the kids, and I'm putting my money on the people of the United States of America. What do you think?

   Mr. HODES. You know, in my home State, the bill would preserve care for 11,000-plus children, and we could add 8,000 children with our bill. I think, as we have talked tonight with each other and with the American people about what this means for our children, it is clear, certainly, that you and I are here listening to the American people, trying to do the best we can for hardworking families and our kids. 
   There is nothing as simple. It's a pretty simple proposition we face. Are we going to stand up for our kids, or stand down with a discredited President, and we both said that we need the American people to speak loud and clear, because we are two voices among many. But the American people can speak on this issue with a solid unified voice, send a message to Congress, send a message to the President, that we will stand up together for our kids. It's the least we can do. It's the best we can do. Together, we can make a difference for the kids of this country.

   I want to thank the chairman for his extraordinary leadership on this important issue and for standing up for veterans around the country. 
   I rise today to echo the concern of my colleague, Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter. New Hampshire remains the only State in the Nation without a full service VA hospital, forcing many veterans to drive long distances to get the care and treatment they desperately need and that they've earned. With record high gas prices, New Hampshire veterans are simply paying more to get critical medical care, and that's plain wrong. 
   I would like to echo the concerns of my colleague and also ask the chairman to clarify that the increases in fee-based care contained in the underlying bill are meant to address issues like those we have in New Hampshire. 
   And I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman and members of his committee on this important issue for Granite State veterans.

   Mr. HODES. Well, I thank my friend from Connecticut and my friend from Pennsylvania for being here. You know, I'm on the something side of 30, but we are all new Members here tonight. And we came here, in large part, because the American people are way ahead of the politicians in this country. And the American people have had it with this exercise in Iraq. In overwhelming numbers, they, in their wisdom, have had it, and they spoke loud and clear to that in November of this year and that, in large part, is why we, and many of our colleagues, are now privileged to serve in the House of Representatives. 
   And what we have done today in passing the Iraq accountability bill is truly historic. And it started here in the House; it went to the Senate through the wisdom of our founders. There was a conference of House and Senate leaders. The bill came back here in slightly altered form. And now, as we sit here tonight, speaking about this bill, it's on its way to the desk of the President of the United States. And the President of the United States has a choice to make about the direction of this country. He, now, has a choice to make. He has a choice to make about supporting the troops. He has a choice to make about holding the Iraqis accountable, as he said he was going to do. He has a choice to make about supporting our veterans. He has a choice to make about supporting our wounded, whose care has been a disgrace, as many of us have seen. The President of the United States has these choices to make. 
   Now, we have had a lot of rhetoric in the chamber today, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle called this shameful. They accused us of weakening America. They essentially questioned our patriotism. They said we didn't support the troops, and that is poppycock. It's disinformation. It's not true. 
   We all, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, and I know this is true of the people in this country, care deeply about this country. And what we want to see is an America with real strength that is protecting the real security of the American people, and that is leading the world, as we once did, as the most credible of nations, as the nation which, in World War II, stood up to lead the fight against fascism, and then had the courage to put Nazis on public trial in the Nuremberg war trials because we were strong enough to have a transparent due process system. We weren't afraid. And we shouldn't be afraid in resolving this conflict in Iraq, in acting with the real strength that means real security. 
   Now, our brave troops have done everything that we've asked of them. They fought through an invasion, and after that, it was an ill advised invasion, but then, through the incompetence and mismanagement of this administration, they have been left in the quagmire of a civil war. 
   And I want to turn now to the words of somebody with far more military experience than me, to talk about the effect of what we have done here in the Congress tonight. Major General John Batiste, United States Army Retired, said, this important legislation sets a new direction for Iraq. It acknowledges that America went to war without mobilizing the Nation, that our strategy in Iraq has been tragically flawed since the invasion in March 2003, that our Army and Marine Corps are at the breaking point with little to show for it, and that our military, alone, will never establish representative government in Iraq. And Major General John Batiste said, the administration got it terribly wrong. And I applaud our Congress for stepping up to their constitutional responsibilities because this Congress, as Major General John Batiste has recognized, unlike the rubber stamp Congresses that have preceded us for years now, is finally the accountability Congress. We are holding our government accountable by passing the Iraq accountability act, which forces the Iraqi government to take responsibility for their own stability. 
   We are into the fifth year of this war. Hundreds of billions of dollars, and still, no progress on reforming the Constitution. 
   What about reconciliation? What about all the ministries in the Iraqi government fighting amongst themselves? What about the Sunni/Shia divide that al-Maliki does not seem to want to face and deal with? The Sunnis and Shiites killing each other, and our troops in the middle of it. 
   So we hold our government accountable to our troops, to our returning soldiers and our veterans. This accountability Congress has held oversight hearings to investigate government mismanagement and corruption in Iraq. We found, for instance, in oversight hearings, that this administration shipped $12 billion of cash over to Iraq without accounting for it, and gave it away to Iraqi ministries to use as they would, without ever asking for a single shred of accounting. No paper trail, no nothing. We're restoring accountability to contracting, ending the massive waste caused by no bid contracts. 
   And the contractors in Iraq, just so we are clear, on this, we now know that, in addition to the 150,000 troops, give or take, currently in Iraq, there are 126,000 private contractors. And as John Murtha so eloquently talked about the floor tonight, we've got a situation where our brave soldiers are standing there, they are making $25,000 a year, let's say they are pumping gas and doing some security details. And next to them there's a private contractor making $80,000 a year doing the same job. Some of these private contractors, we heard, are making $300,000 a year. That's more than any government official in the United States government. And you want to know where our billions and billions of dollars have gone. 
   So we're restoring some accountability to government with the Iraq Accountability Act tonight. We're restoring openness and transparency to government, to repair the fabric of our democracy that has been undermined in the course of this administration. 
   So this President does have a choice to make tonight. And I think of the  words of Zbigniew Brzinski, the former National Security Adviser, who called this war an increasingly immoral, futile exercise in presidential hubris, because, my friends, I'm sorry to say that the President of the United States has said that he's going to veto what Congress has passed. He is going to essentially turn his back on the will of the American people. He's going to go against the advice of retired generals in droves who've come out to talk about the reality. And I believe the American people are going to be disappointed in that veto because they want a new direction in Iraq. And that is the course we have set tonight. I'll kick it back now to Mr. Murphy.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, the interesting thing about what this bill does, I mean the reality of what it does, is it gives this President an opportunity, it gives him a fabulous opportunity, to face reality, as a leader should, and understand that he is being given the opportunity for a new direction, for a new direction that is tough and smart, and smart about our security, because it is designed to make sure that our interests in the Middle East are taken care of in a responsible way. The American people know that. They want us to be responsible in the way we resolve the situation in Iraq. 
   Major General Paul Eaton addressed the notion of why this is so responsible when he said, ``This bill gives General Petraeus great leverage for moving the Iraqi Government down the more disciplined path laid out by the Iraq Study Group. The real audience for the timeline language is Prime Minister al-Maliki and the elected Government of Iraq.'' Because it gives the general, it gives the President, the leverage to say, folks, it is time that you stepped up, to say to Prime Minister al-Maliki it is time you stepped up. Are you serious about reconciliation? Are you serious about the political stability that Iraq needs? Are you serious about the economic stability Iraq needs? Are you serious about it, or are you just waiting because we are going to be there forever? Because right now, the President has made an open-ended commitment, and this bill responsibly puts an end to that open-ended commitment. 
   Now, the folks on the other side of the aisle have said, time and time again, that this somehow weakens us because it gives notice to our enemy, whoever that may be. They say it is al Qaeda. We are in the middle of a civil war. There is some al Qaeda there to be sure. What Major General Paul Eaton said is, ``The argument that this bill aids the enemy is simply not mature. Nobody on the Earth underestimates the United States' capacity for unpredictability. It may further create some sense of urgency in the rest of our government, beginning with the State Department.'' 
   Because we have got to ask, where are the diplomats? Where are the diplomats? There are some provincial reconciliation teams on the ground, working around the country and they are talking about more. But where have been the diplomats? Where has been the diplomatic effort that everybody acknowledges is really what is necessary to bring some stability in the Middle East? 
   Why did it take Speaker Pelosi to go to Syria to begin some dialogue? Because everybody recognizes that we have got to talk to people, even those who are our enemies in this complex world in the 21st century. 
   So this bill gives the President, it gives the generals, the leverage to forge a new direction.

   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman. 
   You know, I was hopeful that we could bring both sides of this House together on this bill because our goal is a common goal, to achieve real strength and real security for America. 
   We all honor our troops. We have a difference in opinion, apparently along party lines primarily, about how best to achieve that. Our friends on the other side of the aisle, and the President, apparently, think that an open-ended commitment and putting more troops into a city of 7 million people into a civil war is the way to do it. We believe that there is a smarter way to help the Iraqis step up and to achieve that security. 
   Let me just talk briefly about what this bill does, because it really does three important things. First, it adopts the military's own guidelines for troop readiness, training and equipment. We've been sending our soldiers without the right equipment, without adequate training, and without enough  rest between deployments. They're stretched. They've been deployed two times, three times, four times. The length of their deployments have been stretched. And we've adopted the military's own guidelines to say that before troops are sent to Iraq they must be properly equipped, they've got to be trained, they've got to be ready to go. 
   I can't understand why the President would veto a bill that adopts the military's own guidelines for troop readiness. Because by his veto, he will therefore be rejecting the military's guidelines for troop readiness. He will be saying to the American people, I am perfectly satisfied with sending troops that aren't ready into combat. 
   The second thing this does is it fully funds the troops, as we have said. In fact, it provides $4 billion more than the President asked directly to the troops. So if he vetoes the bill, he will essentially be saying I'm vetoing, I'm rejecting funding for our troops. I am rejecting the funding that he asked for. I don't understand how he will do that, but that's what his veto will mean. 
   And finally, we provide a responsible way to redeploy that actually answers the concerns that people had about flexibility for our military commanders on the ground. Because what we do is we set a date based on benchmarks for the Iraqis that the President himself set out in a January 10 speech for the beginning of a strategic redeployment, and we give the military commanders the flexibility on the other end to reach the target goals. So if the President vetoes his own announced benchmarks for the Iraqis, I just don't understand it because he will be vetoing what he said in a speech to the American people on January 10 as his idea about what the Iraqis ought to be doing for themselves. He set the benchmarks, and now he said that he intends to veto his own benchmarks. It's beyond me to understand why he's going to veto what he said he wants to do. 
   If I can just go on for one more moment. I want to talk about some of the other money in this bill because this is really important. People have complained, I've heard it at home, about what they think is excess domestic spending in this bill. But here's what this bill does in terms of funding that is related to supporting our troops. 
   This bill provides $3 billion more for mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles for troops in Iraq.

   Mr. HODES. The bill honors our returning veterans by providing $2.1 billion more for military health care than the President requested, including $900 million for post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury care and research, and $661 million to prevent health care fee increases for our troops. Because what they are now facing under this President's policies is getting sent off to war to fight for their country and coming home to find that their health insurance costs more, that the military health system is too overloaded to take care of them, and that the veterans' system has been overloaded beyond capacity. 
   Now, if the President vetoes these increases for the veterans and wounded warriors that his policies have created, it will be something that I don't understand and I don't think the American people are going to understand. And so he has a challenge in front of him. He has a challenge and a choice to make. And maybe between now and when this bill hits his desk, he will have one of those moments on the road to Damascus and decide that he will face the reality and do right by our troops, do right by the American people, do right by this country and set a new direction in Iraq. 
   I will kick it back to you, Mr. Murphy.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Red Sox Nation. In this House, we often disagree on many issues of national importance, but today we are all part of Red Sox Nation. After trailing Cleveland 3-1 in the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox won seven straight games and won their second World Series crown in 4 years. 
   In my home State of New Hampshire, we are made up of diehard Red Sox fans, and we are a proud part of Red Sox Nation. There is no such thing as a fair-weather Red Sox fan. Granite Staters went four generations without being able to celebrate a Red Sox championship, and that is why it has been a great week and great year to be a Red Sox fan.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, with nearly 8,000 foreclosures being filed daily, there is no question that Americans continue to fear losing their homes. In my home State of New Hampshire, it is predicted that nearly 4,300 families will lose their home by 2009. 
   This month, the House passed landmark housing legislation that will address the housing crisis directly, stabilize the housing market, and make a real difference for families at risk of losing their home. The bill will also help revitalize communities that have become vacant because of high housing foreclosure rates. 
   We are also working to provide relief to families struggling under the burden of higher gas prices and soaring costs for food and health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot fix our struggling economy until we address the housing crisis, but the Bush administration has ignored this growing problem for far too long. 
   I hope that President Bush and his allies will reconsider their opposition to our commonsense housing package so we can provide hope to the millions of Americans struggling in President Bush's recession.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker. Last night I watched the State of the Union Address in this hall for the first time as a Member of Congress. While I found the pageantry inspiring, I wish I could say the same about the speech itself. 
   We heard another attempt to allay with hollow rhetoric the concerns of an alarmed Nation about the war in Iraq. And rather than seizing an opportunity to level with the American people and set the new course they rightly demand, the administration, once again, chose to cling to its delusions and insist that its failing policies be enacted. 
   In 2003, the administration requested and received from Congress authority to invade Iraq on the basis of the claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and presented an imminent threat to our national security. Senior administration officials claimed that the Iraqi Government was connected with the al Qaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks of September 11, 2001. And we now know that neither the premise for the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq nor the claim of a connection to 9/11 was true. 
   After the fall of Baghdad, the administration sent in officials with little or no knowledge and understanding of Iraq, its people, its culture or its politics. Costly mistakes, including the dismantling of the army and the failure to secure weapons stockpiles, paved the way for the current situation in Iraq: More than $450 billion spent with billions unaccounted for; an undependable Iraqi Government, unwilling or incapable of controlling warring sects in their militias; more than 3,000 American deaths, and more than 25,000 soldiers maimed or grievously wounded; hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed, wounded or driven from their homes by sectarian violence; and a profound loss of respect for our country in the region and around the world. 
   All in all, it constitutes an unparalleled foreign policy disaster for the United States. 
   The administration still has no plans for a responsible exit strategy to protect our security. And unbelievably, the administration wants to send an additional 21,000 troops to Iraq. 
   The proposal is a cavalier rejection of the sound views of the American people, the consensus of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and the counsel of wise military commanders. 
   In a city of some 7 million people, and without a unified government or the infrastructure to provide jobs to an ever more agitated population, an injection of 20,000 troops will not succeed. It can only stoke the flames of chaos and bloodshed in Iraq. 
   Our national strategic interests, Mr. Speaker, require a change of course, not an escalation. The imperative to support our troops requires a change of course, not an escalation. 
   Last year the Republican-controlled House declared in the defense authorization bill that 2006 would be a year of transition to Iraqi control of Iraq, and that redeployment would begin at that point. Yet here we are in 2007 with the administration calling for an escalation supported by many in this body. 
   In my judgment, Mr. Speaker, the time has come and gone for this Congress to say ``enough is enough.'' The time has come and gone for statements of concern. The time has come and gone for ``trust but verify.'' The situation in Iraq is dire. 
   It is now time for this Congress to do what the American people said so clearly in November that they wanted us to do: Change the course in Iraq. We have a saying in my home State in New Hampshire, ``When you're in a hole, stop digging.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I support our valiant troops, and I oppose the administration's proposed escalation. I resolve to work with my colleagues over the coming weeks for a concrete new direction in Iraq. In the absence of an acceptable plan from the President, the American people are calling upon Congress to lead the way. Popular demand for new direction in Iraq is, in large part, the reason I am here in Washington and the reason Democrats now hold the majority.     
   We can no longer accept empty promises from the administration or hope the administration will honestly confront the realty of its failures. The American people are looking to this Congress for leadership. They are impatient. And we must and we will respond.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1980. 
   Rural poverty is a particularly harsh brand of indigence. It tends to be more extreme than urban poverty, and because it develops in areas far from television cameras and daily newspapers, to most people in this country, rural poverty is faceless. But its presence and its consequences are very real, and they present formidable challenges to both our country and our conscience. 
   In my own home State of New Hampshire, we have largely a rural State. Our cities by some measures are hardly cities. They are large towns. And while we are known for the beauty of our mountains and our lakes and our tourist economy as well as our high tech economy, there are pockets of intransigent rural poverty throughout our State. In the far north the rate of poverty is much higher than it is in most other places in the State, and generally the poverty rate in rural areas of the country is 14.6 percent, which tops that of most urban areas. 
   People who are living in rural poverty face numerous challenges. Inaccessibility of housing with high rents. In New Hampshire the average price for an apartment for a family of four is now $1,000, and this is at a time when folks who are living in rural areas are facing a softer economy and gas prices which are rising, and the challenge of finding a decent place to live for people who live in rural areas is a powerful challenge. People who live in rural areas are farther from basic services. They are less likely to take advantage of them. 
   There is a desperate need in parts of our country, including my own State. And as the people's House, we have a moral imperative to help children and parents trapped in destitution. 
   H.R. 1980 and H.R. 1982, which will come to the floor later, are compassionate, responsible bills which encourage the development of low- and moderate-income housing in our most stricken areas. There is no doubt, because I have seen it with my own eyes on numerous occasions at home, that a clean, safe place to live is often the first step on the road to self-sufficiency. We are not talking about handouts. Encouraging economic development in poor areas helps creates jobs and a solid tax base, which build toward self-sustaining prosperity. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1980 and its companion 1982 are wise, compassionate investments in our country's future. I urge my colleagues to support their passage. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 408. This resolution recognizes and honors the Cathedral Square Corporation on its 30th anniversary in September of this year. 
   The Cathedral Square Corporation is based in Burlington, Vermont, in the district of my esteemed colleague, PETER WELCH. 
   In 1977, the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, the Cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont, recognized the need to provide safe and affordable housing for its low-income seniors. It organized the Cathedral Square Corporation and began construction of a single project. Since then, it has grown into one of the largest and most innovative nonprofit housing developers in Vermont. 
   The Cathedral Square Corporation has developed much needed housing for persons with mental health challenges, younger adults with severe mobility impairments, and completed one of the first assisted living conversion projects in the country for very low-income seniors who otherwise would be in nursing homes. In addition, the Cathedral Square Corporation has worked with the community to save the historic Ruggles House, a property on the National Register of Historic Places, converting it to shared housing. 
   This extremely important organization has worked to develop an intergenerational community, serving the elderly, teenage parents, and parents returning to college. 
   In total, Madam Speaker, the Cathedral Square Corporation currently manages housing for 837 seniors, 79 young adults with special needs, and 24 low-income children. And every property managed by the corporation provides as many services as possible to enable independent living by the residents. 
   Madam Speaker, not only has Cathedral Square Corporation made possible 40 affordable housing communities throughout Vermont, but the board of directors and staff of this corporation are always looking to the future, anticipating the housing and service needs of those Vermonters who otherwise would have few housing options. 
   The Cathedral Square Corporation doesn't just build housing, they provide homes and help create community. They are an outstanding example to all housing groups, and I applaud their innovation and their diligent work and service to the community. 
   I congratulate the Cathedral Square Corporation. And this resolution congratulates them on 30 years of distinguished service.  
   Madam Speaker, at this time I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3873. 
   Mr. Speaker, rural poverty is a particularly harsh brand of indigence. It tends to be more extreme than urban poverty, and because it develops in areas far from television cameras and  daily newspapers, to most Americans it is faceless. But its presence and its consequences are real, and they present formidable challenges to both our country and our conscience. 
   The poverty rate in rural areas is 14.6 percent, topping that of most urban centers. Rural families are farther from population centers and, thus, less likely or able to take advantage of basic housing services. There is desperate need in parts of our country. As Members of the people's House we have a moral imperative to help children and parents trapped in destitute circumstances. 
   The shortage of affordable housing is a problem nationwide and a crisis in rural communities. To reduce the barriers rural families face when trying to find affordable housing, together with my colleague from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito), we have introduced H.R. 3873, the Section 515 Rural Housing Property Transfer Improvement Act of 2007, which would take important steps to help alleviate this rural housing crisis.     
   The section 515 rural housing program provides loans for the Rural Housing Service. These loans are made to nonprofit, for-profit, cooperative, and public entities for the construction of rental or cooperative housing in rural areas. The loans are made to make units affordable for low and very low-income areas in rural areas. This important program serves roughly 450,000 families. 
   Section 515 loans have financed approximately 16,000 projects. Of those, more than 50 percent of the projects were constructed more than 25 years ago. These aging properties are often in desperate need of renovation, which most often happens when a property is sold. 
   When a section 515 property is sold, the transfer of ownership must be approved by the State's rural development office. The process by which States approve the transfer of ownership of section 515 properties is too slow and steeped in bureaucracy. Families sometimes wait years for housing while loans are held back by red tape. Our bill will make several key changes to cut through the red tape so rural families can move into affordable houses. 
   Now, while some State rural development offices transfer section 515 applications in a timely way, others do not. Nonaction on these applications often results in deals going bad. Because of the reduced turnaround and red tape, the appraisals become outdated and invalid, so the deal cannot be underwritten. 
   Under our bill, if applications are not processed in a timely way by the State rural development office, the applications will be transferred for processing to the national Rural Housing Service. The State offices that process applications on time won't have to worry about provisions in the bill. 
   The bill will also improve the way rural housing program money is used with low-income housing tax credits. When the tax credits and rural housing programs are used together, there are often different rules and procedures required of the participants in the deals from each of the agencies involved. More red tape. Our bill requires the USDA to work with the IRS to resolve the differences. Better coordination will make tax credit deals move smoother through the USDA and leverage more money for much-needed rural housing. 
   H.R. 3873 will help both the owners of the property as well as residents in rural communities both in my home State of New Hampshire and across the country. 
   I'm pleased that 13 housing organizations support H.R. 3873, including the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing as well as the Housing Assistance Council. 
   The Financial Services Committee reported the bill by voice vote. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 3873. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I believe that this amendment is a good complement to Chairman Frank's antipredatory lending bill, and I commend colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for the bipartisan nature of this amendment, which is similar to H.R. 3837, the bill of which I was a proud cosponsor. 
   Many of my constituents have had problems with their mortgage servicers. This amendment makes sure that servicers provide faster responses to consumer inquiries and provides increased penalties for abusive servicing practices. 
   Escrows help homeowners pay their property taxes on time, but many homeowners are unaware of the total cost of the loan because the exact amount of taxes and insurance isn't disclosed at the time of closing. This amendment would make sure that homeowners are informed of the actual amount of the loan, including the escrow payments. 
   And also, lastly, faulty appraisals have been a huge problem and can have a devastating impact on a family's single largest investment, their home. If the initial appraisal is inaccurate, reselling the home for what the family paid can be nearly impossible. 
   The amendment creates a Federal independent standard for appraisals enforced by tough penalties. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, there's no doubt that the housing crisis and the consumer credit crunch are getting worse. Last week, we learned that the number of homes facing foreclosure more than doubled from last year. In my home State of New Hampshire, foreclosures have increased nearly 96 percent. 
   That is why it is so important that Congress pass the comprehensive housing package that is coming to the floor this week. The legislation is the most innovative and comprehensive solution to the housing crisis yet. It will give relief to the millions of working families struggling to pay their mortgage with the rising price of gas and food. It would help nearly 1.5 million Americans in need. Our package would also offer assistance to State and localities to purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties. 
   Madam Speaker, our economy cannot rebound unless we act now to give relief to millions of Americans in need. We have a bold proposal to take this decisive action. I certainly hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand the urgent need and that we will receive bipartisan support for this proposal.

Officer Charron, `` who died at the young age of 24, served the people of New Hampshire admirably, and this bill would be a fitting tribute to his courage and sacrifice to the Granite State. 
   Jeremy was a graduate of Hillsborough-Deering High School, where he was elected to be the president of his senior class. After graduating high school, he served in the United States Marine Corps from 1992 to 1996 and went on to attend the New Hampshire Police Academy. 
   Six weeks after graduating from the academy, in the early morning of August 24, 1997, Officer Charron noticed a suspicious car parked in Webster Park in Epsom. When the two people inside stepped out of the car, Officer Charron was fired upon three times, with one round entering his unprotected left side. 
   Although mortally wounded, Officer Charron was able to return fire. He struck the vehicle several times even as the car fled from the scene before succumbing to his wounds. The  suspects were later captured by local law enforcement, and the gunman later pled guilty to capital murder and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. 
   Officer Charron is survived by his parents, Robert and Frances, his two brothers; Robert and Andrew, and his two sisters; Amanda and Bethany.

   First, I thank the distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the distinguished subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, as well as Mr. Graves for their work on this important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill which includes the Northern Border Regional Development Commission. Parts of my home State of New Hampshire, Grafton, Sullivan and Carroll Counties, and especially in Coos County, the beautiful region known as the North Country, have taken an economic beating and are struggling to recover. A staggering number of jobs have been lost. We have seen manufacturing plants close, pulp plants disappear, and our young people leave to places that offer more opportunity. 
   New Hampshire's North Country has suffered repeated economic body blows. For people who live there, it is getting harder and harder to get by. As I travel throughout my State, I speak to hardworking folks who have the drive to improve their neighborhood but who feel their communities have been ignored by the Federal Government for years. The commissions created in this bill would be charged with investing Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most distressed counties in New Hampshire and the ice belt region. I use the word ``invest'' purposely. New Hampshire is a very frugal State. We believe in small, effective Government. But we also know that a wise, effective Federal Government honors local control and invests wisely to promote opportunity and prosperity. 
   This commission employs a bottom-up grassroots approach that ensures that actions reflect both local needs and regional economic development goals. It also ensures that States have a deciding voice in what investment is made within their borders. The bill says that if you are willing to work hard and play by the rules, we are here to help you get ahead. That is why this bill enjoys such bipartisan support. It is an important step for many communities in New Hampshire. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself so much time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1145 recognizes the 100-year anniversary of the establishment of St. Mary's Cooperative Credit Association, the Bank of the People, and the birth of the American credit union. 
   I want to thank Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank for his support in bringing this legislation to the House floor. 
   St. Mary's Bank Credit Union is the oldest credit union in the United States. It was founded in 1908. Its mission was and continues to be to help New Hampshire residents with a wide range of affordable products and services, including checking accounts, personal loans, real estate loans, business banking and savvy financial planning. 
   In 1917, the New Hampshire State legislature approved a bill changing the name from St. Mary's Cooperative Credit Association to La Caisse Populaire, Ste-Marie, The People's Bank. In 1925, an amended charter allowed the institution to be called either La Caisse Populaire, Ste-Marie, or St. Mary's Bank. 
   There are 24 credit unions in the State of New Hampshire with 403,000 members statewide. That's almost one-third of New Hampshire's population. New Hampshire credit unions alone have more than $3.7 billion in assets. Credit unions provide an avenue for families struggling during the credit crunch in these tough financial times to get critical services and low-interest loans. In these tough times we must do everything we can to help working families drowning in debt, and credit unions are important to easing the financial hardships on New Hampshire's working families. 
   Today's resolution honors our Nation's first credit union from New Hampshire, but the excellent work and important contributions to New Hampshire of St. Mary's stand as a fine example of the work of credit unions all across this Nation, which provide working families access to financial services they must have to prosper.

   Thirty-six counties in four States that would become part of this commission have poverty levels above the national average, median household income that is more than $6,500 below the national average, persistent unemployment fed by constant layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries, and a significant out-migration and loss of younger workers. 
   The recent announcements of mill closures in Groveton, Gorham, Berlin and Littleton, New Hampshire, confirm a clear, persistent pattern of economic distress in this region and across the northern border. 
   The people of the north country need a new start and more resources to rebuild their communities for a new economy. The northern border commission, coupled with other efforts, will help revitalize the region and rebuild communities which need our help. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this rule. The people of New Hampshire's north country, and the northeast northern border region are counting on us.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here tonight on the floor of the House of Representatives with a number of my colleagues who will be coming in and out, I imagine, as the evening goes on. And I'm also especially glad to be able to follow my colleague from Iowa (Mr. King), who's got an interesting, but obsolete, perspective on the energy future for this country and what we need to do not only in the current crisis, but for the future of our great country, for the future of our economy, for the future of our energy use. 
   So tonight we will be talking about what it means to go green. Because, let's face it, green is the new red, white and blue. And before I jump into the energy issues, but sticking with the theme of going green, I cannot help but stand to congratulate the Boston Celtics for winning the NBA finals. And if anybody exemplifies what it means to be green and to be champions, it certainly is the Boston Celtics. It's the kind of lesson that we all could learn in this country. 
   Many of us in New Hampshire are diehard Celtics fans. And some of a certain age, including myself, remember the great championship Celtic teams from the sixties, seventies and eighties. And this has been the longest stretch in the Celtics' franchise history without winning a championship. 
   The Boston Celtics last night beat their rival, the Los Angeles Lakers, by a whopping 39 points. It was the first NBA championship for Boston since 1986. Now, Celtics fans are especially proud today of Captain Paul Pierce, who, in the great tradition of Celtic champions like Red Auerbach and Larry Bird and Kevin McHale and Dennis Johnson and other greats, was the obvious choice for the NBA Final MVP Award. I'm proud to stand tonight to congratulate Paul Pierce for securing his place in Celtics history and the rest of the team for bringing the 17th banner back to New England. It's time to go green: Go Celtics. 
   Now, along with going green, what's important to note is that, as we are here tonight, in my home State of New Hampshire, New Hampshire families are paying record prices for gasoline. Today, the average is $4.04 for regular gas and $4.73 for diesel. Last year at about this time, New Hampshire families were paying $2.92 for regular gas and $2.82 for diesel. 
   Now, for some reason, as if to rewrite history, the President of the United States and my Republican colleagues, regrettably, would like to shift the blame for the soaring energy prices to the Democrats in Congress. They would like somehow for the American people to believe that it is simply the fact of the switch of majority in 2006 and Democrats who have been here working hard on reasonable, responsible, smart energy legislation, who are somehow the cause of the pain at the pumps. Well, tonight we'll talk a little truth, we'll talk a little truth to what are outrageous scams. It is simply not true. 
   The President today proposed, for example, drilling in ANWR. He proposed giving the oil companies even more access to drilling. The President's proposal today is, unfortunately, another page from the administration's energy policy that was literally written by the oil industry. I don't think anybody can forget that it was Vice President Cheney, an oil man, who, together with President Bush, an oil man, sat in secret with the oil companies to create this country's energy policy. 
   The product of that energy policy is that today, after the first quarter of 2008, we've had another record year for oil company profits. Apparently Mr. Cheney's energy policy seems to be working for the oil companies. In 2002, the profits of the oil companies were $6.5 billion in a quarter. And today, in 2008, first quarter of 2008, the record year for oil company profits, $36.9 billion in profits, while we pay $4.04 at the pump. 
   So the plan from the President now is to give away more public resources to the very same oil companies that are raking in record profits; and all the time those oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres of Federal lands they've already leased; 68 million acres of Federal lands they've already leased  and already have done the environmental permitting on. That's 68 million acres ready to be drilled on for oil. 
   The President's speech, in a time of record gas prices, had no ideas for more efficient transportation or renewable American energy; no ideas for conservation and an alternative future that will actually free us from oil; no real ideas to deal with the current crisis now, as well as looking toward the future because they are inseparable. And we are now paying the price, frankly, for 30 years of not paying attention as we should, and for 8 years under the Bush administration, together with a previous 12 years, much of that with a Republican Congress in which energy policy has been designed for the oil companies, favoring the oil companies, and the American consumers have been paying the price. The President's proposal is nothing more than a continuation of addiction to fossil fuels and dependency on an oil industry earning record profits. 
   Now, just before I turn it over to my colleague, my good friend from the State of New York, John Hall, who has been working on environmental issues his entire life, what is clear is that we will need to transition from the current addiction we have to oil that binds us to unfriendly countries, that threatens our national security, that depresses our economy, we will need to transition to a future of energy efficiency and conservation, and renewable and alternative fuels, which will explode the entrepreneurial spirit of this country, deliver real security, real jobs, and a sustainable future. But in that transition, what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like the American people to think is that somehow, by drilling in Alaska, they will see some real benefits. 
   We will talk more about it later. But the last thing I will say before I turn it over to Mr. Hall is, what the Department of Energy has told us about drilling in Alaska is very simple: Even if you opened ANWR to drilling it would take until about 2025 to see any of the benefits, and at that point you might reduce the price at the pump by 1.8 cents. So that is what the President of the United States proposed today to deal with our energy crisis and the future of our energy use.     
   Drill in ANWR, and by 2025, we will reduce the price by 1.8 cents. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to turn the proceedings over to my colleague from New York, John Hall.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (THE FRESHMEN CLASS OF THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Thank you. And what strikes me is as you recite the litany of terrible tragedies, natural disasters, or unnatural disasters, that have struck the world, my district underwater in various parts of it, as yours has been in the last 5 years, with unprecedented floods, the floods around our Nation, hurricanes, Katrina, in Burma, Indonesia, around the world, clearly, the world's climate is changing. 
   What strikes me as radical is to attack the notion that global warming is here. What seems radical to me is not to accept that we're going to need to make the kind of transition that seems evident that we will have to make from a fossil fuel past to a new energy future. And in the middle of all this, how convenient it is at summertime with people in pain from rising gas prices, caused by lots of things, to say, for my friends on the other side of the aisle, it's those Democrats, if only they would let us drill, if only those Democrats would let us drill, everything would be fine. If only we could drill in ANWR. If only the Democrats weren't stopping us from drilling, gas prices would come down. 
   Let me point out that since the 1990s, the Federal Government has consistently encouraged the development of its oil and gas resources, and the amount of drilling on Federal lands has steadily increased during that time. The amount of drilling on Federal lands has steadily increased. 
   Now that includes the period of time in which the Democrats have had the majority in Congress. Federal lands have been open to the oil companies. They have leases. The environmental permitting is done. As you pointed out, they haven't been drilling, although the number of permits has been going up. In fact, we would call it an explosion in Federal permits to drill for oil on Federal lands, a resource for all the people which, through the wisdom of the Federal Government, the Federal Government is allowed to be drilled on in the environmentally proper ways. 
   In fact, 5 years ago, there were 3,802 permits to drill, and in 2007 there were 7,561 permits issued to drill. We're not stopping drilling. We're not stopping drilling. What we are talking about, though, is truth. 
   And one of the questions that you have to ask is, so where is the drilling getting us? What effect will the drilling have, has the drilling had, on gas prices? Well, if the President's answer is we want to drill more, if my friends across the aisle's answer is, oh, drill more, the more you drill, the lower the gas prices will be, then let's at least first take a look at that claim that more drilling means lower gas prices. 
   In fact, between 1999 and 2007, when the number of drilling permits issued for development of public lands increased, as you said, by 361 percent, gasoline prices have also risen dramatically. The chart to my left shows emphatically, categorically, with no room for argument, that more drilling, more permits, doesn't equal lower gas prices. When you look at this chart and you start down here in the corner that I'm pointing to, we have the price of gas along this side. I'm pointing to here. The years are along the bottom. We see in red, the bars are drilling permits issued. In blue, we see the number of wells drilled. And the green line is the price of gas. So we're showing all three components of the question I asked: Does more drilling lower gas prices? Because if it doesn't, then the President's argument to drill in ANWR holds no water. The complaints of the minority that we're somehow stopping progress, we are the fault for keeping gas prices high, holds no water. And we're going to have to look for other enemies to point the finger at and other solutions for our energy.     
   So let's take just a quick look. Without going through it all, what this trend clearly shows, as you can see, are the permits issued. This starts in 1994 and goes up to 2007. As you can see, in the early years, with the red bars, there are more permits issued than there is drilling because, first, you have to issue the permits before you drill on it. 
   Then by about 1999, after we've issued permits from 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997--here we are in 1998 and 1999--what we're seeing is that the number of wells drilled has caught up and has surpassed the number of permits issued, and it's relatively stable through there. 
   Then starting in the year 2000, we're going to see that the number of wells drilled is declining. As you pointed out, the oil companies are getting permits. They're buying up leases. They're holding onto the supply, but they're not drilling wells, not because there aren't the permits issued, not because they couldn't drill but because of some other reason. Now, let's remind ourselves that they're also making, in these last years here, record profits while their drilling on public lands available to them is lower than the permits issued. 
   Now let's take a look at the price of gas. Notice how the price of gas basically tracks these lines. So it shows more permits, more drilling, higher prices of gas. More permits, more drilling, higher prices of gas. The argument that if we simply open up ANWR to drill will somehow lower the price of gas is absolutely wrong. It just doesn't hold water. 
   What is so interesting to me is that this is a, theoretically, free market economy, and this country has always stood for free markets with reasonable regulation because, as Abraham Lincoln--a good Republican--said, the purpose of government is to do what the free markets cannot or will not do so well for themselves. 
   In our free market economy, if the oil companies tapped the 68 million  Federal acres of leased land, it could generate an estimated 4.8 million barrels of oil a day. That is what is available to them now under lease with the environmental permits done. 4.8 million barrels of oil a day is six times what ANWR would produce at its peak in the year 2025. It's available to the oil companies today. Yet, somehow, the President and our colleagues want to open ANWR, which will take 20 years to get done and will reduce the price, theoretically, by 1.8 cents. It simply doesn't hold water. 
   The fact is that 80 percent of the oil available on the Outer Continental Shelf is in regions that are already open to leasing, but the oil companies, in their wisdom, haven't decided it's worth their time to drill there either. They have the leases. They have the permits, but they don't want to drill there. So we have the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a small place up there in Alaska where the caribou are wild, where wildlife flourishes, where it's tough to get the oil out of there because you've got to build a pipeline forever. We have onshore Federal lands available to the oil companies. We have offshore lands available to the oil companies. They're not drilling. They want more leases. It sounds kind of like grab and greed to me. Grab and greed. 
   We're a nation that has, perhaps, 2 percent of the world's supply of oil. We use 24 percent of the world's supply of oil. There is a disconnect there. We need to find new solutions because the bottom line is we cannot drill our way out of an energy situation in which foreign countries, many of them unfriendly to us and multinationals who are making record profits, control our supply of oil. It has had disastrous consequences for our foreign policy because now you read the various evidence that's coming out about the reason we went to war in Iraq. 
   I just finished the book of President Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, called ``What Happened,'' which is on the reason we went to war. What is very interesting is that, when you read the passages of the discussions in the White House about why we went into Iraq and Vice President Cheney's concerns about oil, many of the fears that people have seem to be clarified about the reasons we went to war in Iraq. 
   Now, I understand the motivation that says we need oil and that we need to secure our supplies and that we're going to use our geopolitical power and our military might to make sure we have the energy, but the bottom line is, when our energy future runs our foreign policy instead of our foreign policy and our energy future being tied together for our independence, we're at great risk. Here we are in 2008, stuck in a quagmire of a war with a huge debt. We have a deficit with China. Our gas prices are soaring. There is no way to drill our way out of the solution, and so we're going to talk about some more facts, some more truth and some of the things we're doing both to deal with the current issues and what we're doing for the future of this country. 
   I'll yield back to you, Mr. Hall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Thank you, and I appreciate the kindness and decorum with which you discuss the change in apparent policies from our President, who was Governor, apparently understood the importance of a renewable electricity standard which would help industry, help consumers and help move us to the kind of energy future that is responsible, American independent energy future. 
   As Governor of Texas, as you said, he signed a 10 percent renewable energy standard. As technology has developed, in our bill in the House, when we tried to pass a bill with a 15 percent national renewable portfolio standard to give our utilities who generate the power and the electricity we need the certainty they are waiting for, to unleash the free market forces, to use the renewable and alternative energies with technology already existing to do it, that would come from a variety of sources around the country and start to give us the kind of power around the country that could come from renewable and alternatives, but unfortunately it didn't get past the Senate where, unfortunately, Senators from my State of New Hampshire stood in opposition to it, along with a number of their Republican colleagues. It didn't pass. 
   We did pass an absolutely important, precedent-setting new CAFE standard, which means that for the first time in 30 years the mileage standards for automobiles will begin to rise. We have been able to pass legislation to correct the obsolete standards we were stuck with, and now by 2020 we will be in a 35-mile per gallon standard. But as you discussed in your earlier remarks, the technology is here today for our automobile companies, which are now languishing in the doldrums. These former engines of the American economy, in which some people estimate 20 percent of the workforce of this country is in some way involved directly or indirectly in the supply chain, our car companies are taking a back seat to others which seem to have gotten on the new technology bandwagon a lot earlier. They have simply fallen behind, when if they had kept up with advanced technology, technology that's available now, think about the markets around the world, which our car companies, thus the people who are working directly and indirectly in that supply chain would then have the benefit of, we would then be exporting advanced technology instead of being behind the rest of the world, because the technology is certainly here now. 
   One area that you touched on that I would like to amplify are the kinds of innovative and entrepreneurial activities that are going on at home in our districts in our State. In New Hampshire, we have a lot of wood, and in much of the Northeast and in much of the cold belt of this country we are heavily forested, have a lot of wood resources. 
   One of the things that I was glad to see in the farm bill, not a perfect bill by any measure, as you know, in any of these large bills, there is a lot to like, there is a lot not to like. 
   One of the things that's important in the new farm bill is that cellulosic ethanol will receive much more help from the Federal Government, as opposed to corn ethanol, which we now know I think to be somewhat of a problem. The subsidies were lowered for corn ethanol, raised for cellulosic ethanol. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues on all sides of the aisle, whose districts produce a lot of corn and have been producing corn for fuel, we now know there are some issues with corn ethanol. It takes about this much energy to produce this much corn ethanol. There may be some byproducts. Food pricing around the world has suffered, so we clearly need to find a range of solutions. 
   Cellulosic ethanol means ethanol that can be added to the fuel of automobiles and other vehicles that comes from wood waste, biomass, switchgrass and other organic matter other than corn. It's very important in the Northeast where we can use wood chips, and the waste from logging and forestry products. 
   One of the fascinating things that I had the privilege to visit in my own district was a wood pellet plant in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, New England Wood Pellet, which is one of the pioneers of wood pellets. Now, wood pellets are essentially compressed wood waste where you take sawdust. Then you are able to compress it under very high heat. 
   When compressed and fed into a stove, it's incredibly efficient, extraordinarily clean at the same time, and very convenient. You can put it in the hopper, and power your home and heat your home with it. The sad thing is that after wood-pellet technology was developed in the United States, the leader has become Germany. 
   Now, when I was visiting a closed paper plant up in my district, there were Germans who were thinking of coming to take it over and turn it into a wood pellet plant. So we have the capacity, clearly in this country, to use our entrepreneurial skills and use local resources to produce our energy.  
   The even more interesting thing about the wood pellet plant in my district is that they have attached an innovative system to their wood pellet plant. What they have done is they have brought in a large turbine, it kind of looks like a jet engine, that's housed in a small business, that's attached to the wood pellet plant. Now, as I said, the wood pellets are produced using extraordinary amounts of heat and sawdust to compress it into the wood pellets for use in a stove. 
   What these folks have done is they have attached their own heating and electricity generating system right off their own building, so they have these two buildings interconnected. The turbine, which looks like a large jet engine, is fed through a series of filters and tubes. What happens is from the wood pellet process, the waste gases and the waste, of which there is some, is fed through the filtering system, gasified, and then fed into the turbine. 
   The turbine spins, it provides heat first to preheat 
   the heating system that makes the wood pellets. It provides all the power, the electrical power to run the wood pellet plant, and it provides additional electric power which they sell back to the electric grid. 
   So they are heating their plant, they are preheating their manufacturing process, they are providing the power for their building. They are selling electricity back to the grid all in an integrated system that is creating fuel from a locally produced product that can be used to heat homes in a renewable energy efficient and appropriate way. 
   Now, if that one small wood pellet plant in my home district of New Hampshire can do that, we can be doing that all over the country in different ways, whether it is geothermal, whether it is tidal, whether it is small hydro, of which there is plenty all over this country, solar, wind, biomass, we have the capacity. We have the brains. We have the entrepreneurs, we have the technology, the computer systems, and the people who are just waiting to have the entrepreneurial spirit of this country unleashed. 
   To hear the President, and to hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, trying to propose that we go backwards in time to a technology which clearly does not lower the price of gas for consumers and clearly threatens our planet, is surprising, to say the least. I asked my friends on the other side of the aisle, for whom I have great respect, because this is an important process, to have two different philosophies come before the American people so that they can help discern the truth. 
   I have asked them, and I have yet to hear a good answer, what is it, what is it that prevents you from seeing the free markets, which you say you believe in, are waiting for the signals from the Federal Government, are waiting for the standards to be set here in Congress, are waiting to be unleashed. They know it means jobs, they know it means good products, they know it means new markets around the world, they are ready. 
   The utilities are ready, industry is ready, the market are ready. I just don't understand the thinkers who are stuck in the past and aren't ready, not only to address the issues we are facing today, but help move this country into the future. 
   I don't have an answer. I haven't heard an answer. I certainly would like to hear one, because what is being proposed by the President makes no economic sense except perhaps to the oil companies, whose record profits will go up even more if the President's plan were followed. They would get more leases, get more permits, do less drilling, let the price go up, and make more money as they have been. 
   That doesn't seem to be a good deal for the American people, so why the President would propose it, I have no idea. But I don't understand why he and his colleagues, his supporters, don't understand that the future is simply waiting. 
   If they are real free market folks, then let's go, let's unleash the free markets. 
   Do you have an answer for me, Mr. Hall?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I would be happy to talk about that. One of the interesting things that we have seen, unfortunately, is a do-anything-to-stop-progress mentality from our colleagues. While they have been long on accusations about the Democratic attempt to move us, to address the current issues and move us to a new future, their leadership has unfortunately been lacking. 
   For instance, on the issue of OPEC price fixing, the House will once again take up legislation to empower the Justice Department to take legal action against OPEC-controlled entities for participating in oil cartels that drive up oil prices globally in the United States. We are in the grip of monopolies with price fixing. It is a  basic right of American law that we deal with that in the proper way to stop price fixing. The Republicans have stood in the way without any leadership on that issue. 
   In terms of price gouging by the oil companies, we have passed, the Democrats have passed legislation cracking down on Big Oil that are gouging American consumers. 
   The Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act would give our Federal Trade Commission authority to investigate and punish companies that artificially inflate the price of energy. It sets criminal penalties for price gouging, and permits States to bring lawsuits against wholesalers or retailers who engage in such practices. The Bush administration has threatened to veto the measure and the Republican leadership has consistently voted ``no, no, no'' and ``no'' on price gouging. 
   On renewable energy as we discussed, we have been moving towards renewable energy provisions. The House leadership of the Republicans, every single one of them has voted ``no'' on renewable energy. They are voting ``no'' on America's future. They are voting ``no'' on a responsible free market. And on our energy security which we have been working on as Democrats to make sure that we are moving to real security for the United States and energy independence, they voted ``no, no, no.'' 
   So in closing, and there is so much more we could say about what we have been doing, but as I close tonight I want to say to you and to the Speaker's attention I appreciate, another member of our freshman class of 2006, a distinguished member, that it is time to say yes to the future. It is time to say yes to American consumers. Our special interest must be the interest of the people of this country. It must be an answer to the pain that they are feeling at the pumps, and where they know, where the American people know the great future and destiny of this country lies. 
   So our job is to say yes. We understand that we need to do something now and we are. We are answering the call now. Democrats will answer, Republicans will say no, but we will be steadfast in the special interest of the people. We will be responsible in unleashing the forces of the free market to take us into the energy future that the American people need and deserve. It is time to say yes to the future. Green is the new red, white and blue. I look forward to working in the years to come on the legislation and the policies that will move us into the future in a way that the American people will be proud of, and I thank you for being with me tonight.

   Mr. HODES. I thank you both for being here tonight to talk about what is really a critical issue, the increase in the minimum wage which took effect on July 24, 2007, so we are actually celebrating it tonight. 
   It is not just an  important economic issue that will affect nearly 13 million people across this country, 5.3 million people who will directly benefit immediately and 7.2 million people who will indirectly benefit as a result of a new wage floor, but it is an example of what we are taking on really as a moral imperative in this new Congress. Because when you think about waiting 10 years for a rise in the minimum wage, Madam Speaker and my friends, you cannot imagine how, in a period of growing income inequality, those who need a reasonable minimum wage the most have been left behind so much. 
   I have next to me a chart which has a mathematical equation about what has happened in terms of our national debt over the past few years. And what you can see is that, from 2001 to 2006, we have had a huge increase in the national debt. In other words, we as a Nation have gone deeper and deeper into debt as we have borrowed to make ends meet. 
   So I want to set the context for the importance of this minimum wage, because while we as a Nation have borrowed to make ends meet for things like our war and tax breaks for those at the very top, we have had growing income inequality. 
   The three of us are on the Financial Services Committee, and recently we held some hearings with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and we discussed a startling new report that was put out by a group called Financial Services Forum. The Financial Services Forum is a Wall Street group that was dealing with the effects of globalization and income inequality, and they pointed out some startling statistics. 
   One of the things they pointed out is that, over the past 5 or 6 years, corporate profits in this country have doubled. Corporate profits have doubled, and productivity is way up. And what that means is people are working much, much harder to make corporate productivity and corporate profits go up, but where have those benefits gone? 
   What we have learned in this report which was prepared by Wall Street CEOs is that the benefits have largely gone to the top 3 percent in this country, and that 97 percent of people in this country, including highly educated people, from folks who are making an awful lot of dough, you would think, people with college educations, master's degrees, even Ph.D.s, right down to the lowest rungs, for 97 percent, over the past 5 years, real wages, real income have slipped. So 3 percent have made out, and for 97 percent real wages have gone down. 
   Now, what does that mean for those at the very lowest rungs of the economic ladder? It means that those who have been getting along with $5.15 as a minimum wage, their real earning power has slipped even faster. As prices have gone up for gas, just to put gas in your car to get to your minimum-wage job, you have to work a whole day. 
   So what we have done, what we have done here in the Democratic Congress finally, after 10 long years, is to honor those who work hard, honor those who play by the rules, honor those who need just a little bit of economic fairness, and help bring them up to the benefit of everybody in society, because as we raise the minimum wage, folks can now afford to be part of our society. They can afford to go out and maybe go out to a movie. They can afford to go out and buy that pair of eyeglasses or get that haircut or do something for their kids that they weren't able to do before. And that helps us all. 
   So I am very proud, as a new Member of Congress, to have made good on the pledge that we talked about during our campaigns, to come to Congress and make sure that as one of the first and most important things we did, we would raise the minimum wage. So it is a great day.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Ellison, it's a great question because what we've got today in America really is a large body of people, 37 million people, mainly, who are working poor. These are folks who, a lot of them are single parents; many of them happen to be single moms. And a lot of the folks, the working poor in this country who are struggling to make ends meet, are not just working one job. They're working two jobs; they're working three jobs to make ends meet. They generally are without health insurance, many of them. They don't have people to help take care of their kids. They struggle every day. 
   And I just want to expand on some of the points that Mr. Klein made, because as we moved in Congress to appropriate money for the Labor and Health and Human Services portion of the budget, it's important for the American people to understand that we did so in an absolutely fiscally responsible way, and to understand that we are making investments in America's future. 
   The President, in his budget, proposed cutting Health and Human Services and education programs by $7.6 billion below 2007, after adjusting for inflation. We knew that we had to come and make fiscally responsible investments in our future. So we rejected the President's damaging cuts, and we proposed a very modest increase, about 3 percent over 2007, after adjusting for inflation, so that our final bill was still $2.9 billion below the 2005 level for the appropriations for Health and Human Services and Education. So we actually came in below where we were a couple of years ago, and we did it in a way that is responsible because we adopted PAYGO provisions. We have to balance any increase with a responsible cut in another area. So we're being fiscally responsible in the overall picture. 
   And some of the things we did for the working poor are really important. One of the important things we did was we started to address the problem of 47.7 million uninsured people in this country. And we expanded access to health care for the uninsured. And we did that by funding several initiatives to provide health care for more than 2 million uninsured Americans. For instance, our bill provides $200 million, or 10 percent, more than 2007, and the President's request for community health centers enabling these centers to serve an additional 1 million uninsured Americans. 
   We also included $50 million for an initiative to assist States in providing high-risk insurance pools to support affordable insurance for almost 200,000 people who are medically high risk. So we are beginning to move 
   in a big way on health care, which is a vital economic and national interest, especially for the working poor in this country. 
   I'll throw it back to you.

   Mr. HODES. Well, you know, I'm glad to be here even though it's late at night. We're working hard for folks, and one of the things I think that's important for the American people to understand is that we have taken the task of reversing drastic cuts to important programs that have gone on under this President and the Republican Congress for many years. And we're doing it in a way that is fiscally responsible. We've introduced pay-as-you-go rules so that when we expand in one area, we're going to make sure that we're matching it with appropriate cuts in other areas. It's a vital, vitally important new thing that we're doing here in this Congress to make sure that we are stewards of the public trust, and that we are taking care of the people's money, we're not just pending it willy-nilly. 
   Now, unfortunately, we're dealing with a President who threatens vetoes, who has proposed drastic cuts in programs that are important investments for all Americans whether it's Community Development Block Grants or the HOPE VI program or section 8 or any program that really helps bring those at the lower levels up into the middle class and helps those in the middle class. This President has proposed to veto and he's proposed drastic cuts. We understand that we're going to make the right kind of investments to move this country forward. So I'm very proud of what we're doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (ESTABLISHING AN OMBUDSMAN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague. I also would like to thank Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, as well as Subcommittee Chairman Michaud and Ranking Member Miller, for their strong bipartisan leadership in helping to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   This bill would establish an Office of the Ombudsman in the Department of Veterans Affairs to help our veterans cut through the red tape of the vast Veterans Administration bureaucracy to get the health benefits they have earned. After serving their country with honor and distinction, the last thing our veterans need is to fight the VA back home. Yet, unfortunately, many veterans have told me stories of drowning in bureaucracy at the VA. The good news is there are lots of numbers to call; the bad news is there are lots of numbers to call. 
   This bill was filed in response in part to the story of one of my constituents who was one of those soldiers trapped between active duty and veterans status. He was on active duty, but stuck at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, without knowing where to turn. 
   Chris was in a Humvee which had been blown up with by an IED. His arm was shattered in 13 places. He had metal fragments implanted in his head. He was suffering from a traumatic brain injury. Fortunately, he turned to us and we were able to work with his family and fiancee to advocate for him. He ultimately got the treatment he needed and was honorably discharged. Last week, I saw Chris and his new wife and new baby. He is working in Newport, New Hampshire, as an auto mechanic and owns his own home. He will likely need continuing treatment in the VA system. 
   This legislation will help veterans like Chris get the care and treatment they deserve, especially during the transition from active duty to the VA system. Our veterans who sacrificed for their country need help navigating that VA medical system. I wish it weren't so, but it is. Under this bill, veterans and their families will have advocates in the VA. 
   Let's honor our veterans by providing them with the advocates they need and deserve and support the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to exercise the power Congress has under article I of the Constitution and to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program. This vote is significant because it underlines the difference between what the President values and what the American people value. To the President and his allies in Congress, $190 billion this year for the occupation in Iraq is a necessity. But $35 billion to provide health care to 10 million uninsured children in America is an extravagance. 
   If we are successful and we override that veto tomorrow, SCHIP will preserve the coverage of 11,892 children in my home State of New Hampshire and make funds available to cover an additional 8,720 kids. If we are not successful, I personally would like to invite President Bush and his allies in Congress to come home with me to Concord, New Hampshire, and explain to these 20,000 kids why they can't go to a doctor when they break a bone or get medicine when they are sick.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, I am glad to be with you tonight to talk about where we have been  in the 110th Congress, where we are, and where we are going, because this Congress really has changed the direction of America. 
   If you think back to where we were over the past 6 years, this country was frustrated. Frustrated because of the squeeze on the middle class with fiscal policies that weren't working. They weren't working for the middle class and those trying to get into the middle class. They may have been working for those at the very, very tippy top of the financial scale, but not for anybody else. A frustrated middle class and an America which has come together because of a foreign policy which has made us weaker, which has ruined our reputation in the world, which has mired our brave soldiers in a civil war. 
   They asked for change in November. And in the past 3 months we have delivered substantial change. So tonight we are going to talk about the Accountability Congress. We have changed the Congress of the United States from a Rubber Stamp Congress that didn't hold anybody accountable for anything, but simply rubber stamped what the administration wanted to do without question.     
   They held no hearings, held no accountability over agencies, and we have replaced it with an accountability Congress that holds the administration accountable, that holds agencies accountable, and is accountable to the American people for making real progress. 
   So I am very proud to be with you tonight. And I look forward to the next hour when we get to talk about what we've done, where we are and where we're going. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. HODES. I am glad you asked. Because in the campaign, as we went around, we all heard about the squeeze that our families were in all over this country, complaining about the cost of higher education and the difficulty they were having in paying for the loans that folks have to take out in order to pay for an education. Of course in order to be competitive in a global economy, we need more kids going to college, we need more opportunities for more people in this country. 
   In my home State of New Hampshire, we actually carry the highest debt-per-student in terms of student loans of any State in the country. So it has been really important at home in New Hampshire and around the country for this Democratic Congress and the new majority to take action. 
   Now, Mr. Ellison already talked about one of the things that was done in terms of making college more affordable by voting to cut student loan interest rates in half. We've talked about what we have done to restore pay-as-you-go rules, because once you've got fiscal responsibility, once we've restored fiscal responsibility that was absent from the 6 years that the Republicans were borrowing and spending us into a black hole of a deficit, we can start acting with a social conscience and help our college kids. 
   So one of the things we have done, as this chart shows, is we passed a budget, a Democratic budget that restores fiscal balance, it cuts the deficit, balances the budget over 5 years. And what it does for our kids in college is, first, we propose an increase of the maximum Pell Grant to at least $4,600, significant increase. Our budget, the Democratic budget, the responsible budget, the pay-as-you-go, balance-the-budget-in-5-years budget rejects all of the President's irresponsible proposed cuts to higher education, including that he wants to eliminate the Perkins loan program, Federal supplemental opportunities grants, and leveraging education assistance partnerships. The President's budget actually wants to take opportunities away from our kids going to college and families who are trying to send their kids to college. We have turned that around. We are going to make it easier and more affordable for kids to go to college

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. I thank you, Mr. Ellison. You know, I couldn't help when I was listening to Patrick Murphy, a brave veteran who served his country and came to Congress and is serving again, continuing his service, to think about how touched I was when he talked about his new baby. Because, really, what we are talking about here is a vision for this country and a vision  for the world that is going to take us on into the 21st century, because we face challenging new times. Things have changed in this country, and the American people know it. And in many ways they are far ahead of the politicians, they are far ahead of many of us. They understand that things have changed in this country. 
   The conflicts we face are different kinds of conflicts. It is no longer nation against nation. We face threats from a shadowy network of people, terrorists who would do us harm. And we have to be strong to be able to fight terrorism. 
   But what does being strong mean in the 21st century? The American people have demanded a new direction. They have demanded a new way to defend our country. They want us to fight terrorism, and we intend to fight terrorism; but we intend to do it with a greater focus on those who attacked us on 9/11, with a greater focus on homeland security, on making sure that we are keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. Perhaps the greatest threat we face, which went by the boards because of this administration's preoccupation with fighting the wrong war in Iraq which has diverted us from really focusing on the concentrated effort we need from law enforcement, from intelligence, from military, from diplomacy, from the soft power that America, has been extending our cultural ideals and principles out into the world to show people that we are not merely going to bully people with weapons, but we are also going to stand on our ideals and principles. 
   So defending our country and staying strong means making sure that we have a responsible strategy to disengage from Iraq so we can deal with Afghanistan, and Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden is still hiding out, still directing al Qaeda; so that we can do what we need to do to go back and finish the job that this administration left unfinished. That is what defending our country means, because this war in Iraq, as everybody in this country is seeing, has left us weaker. It has caused more terrorism, more death, more disdain for the United States.     
   I am sorry for that. We want to see us return to the place in the world where people care about us because of our values and our principles, and that is one of the most important things that we are going to do in this 110th Congress. 
   We are going to improve our military readiness by making sure that we are going to rebuild a 21st century force, capable of projecting power and our ideals to protect our country and our interests, and that means new thinking. It means new thinking about how we deal with the conflicts we are in, how we deal with the conflicts in the future. 
   It means part of the reason that we hope the President takes his cue from the American people and faces the reality of the mess that he has made and changes direction is so that we can rebuild our military to make sure that we can face the conflicts of the future. 
   We are going to demand accountability, and we are going to end the rubber-stamp approach to congressional oversight of the war in Iraq and we have started to do that. We are going to continue to do that. We are going to fight the war on terrorism, and we are going to hold our own government accountable for failed policies. We are going to respond to the American people who want a new direction, and we are going to deliver on homeland security. 
   That is the first way. That is the first thing on our agenda. It is a new vision of what it means to be strong. It is a new vision of what it means to defend our country. 
   We can have all the military might in the world and we do. We spend more in our budget than all the rest of the world combined spends on defense, and I ask, you has it made us safer? Have the policies of this administration made us safer? The answer is no. 
   We see there has got to be a new direction. We see there has got to be a new vision, and that is what Democrats are bringing to this 110th Congress when it comes to defending our country and keeping us strong. There is a new definition of national security, and that is what we are all about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Speaker, it was with great sadness that I learned of TOM LANTOS' passing yesterday. As our colleague and our friend, we knew him to be a man of incredible courage and strength, a man who had overcome unimaginable adversity to serve as a voice for justice against the dark forces of human evil. 
   TOM was born to Jewish parents in Hungary. He was 16 when Hitler's army marched in to occupy his birth country in 1944, and he tragically lost much of his family in the Holocaust. TOM courageously escaped from forced labor camps not once, but twice. 
   Here in Congress, he rose to the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee with the unique perspective and the power of real moral authority. Promoting human rights for all is a part of his lasting legacy. Those who follow TOM LANTOS in that cause have a high bar to match. 
   TOM and his beloved wife, Annette, were blessed with a wonderful and extraordinarily talented family, including my dear friend, his daughter, Dr. Katrina Swett, TOM's son-in-law, Ambassador Dick Swett, our former colleague who held the seat I now hold. They and their family are my neighbors in my home State of New Hampshire. TOM was a frequent visitor to the Granite State, a remarkably devoted father, mentor, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was a patriarch in the best sense of the word, and on behalf of all of New Hampshire's citizens, we mourn TOM's passing as one of our own. 
   I am honored to have served with such a remarkable and accomplished individual. He was the first Member of Congress to welcome me when I arrived. He was an inspiration to me. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time. I know they will take solace in the lasting legacy that their beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather left us. 
   He showed us that even in the darkest corners of the human experience, one strong, clear voice, one irrepressible beacon of light can stand as an unwavering candle whose flame will never go out. 
   Thank you, TOM.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I'm glad to be here tonight. I will soon be joined by a number of my colleagues in the historic class of 2006, the Majority Makers. And we are here tonight to talk about the economy. 
   There certainly is a lot to talk about. We've come back recently from 2 weeks at home in our districts where we've all made observations and talked to our constituents, talked to the people we represent. We've gotten out and visited people in their homes. We've been out shopping, we've been to the malls, we've been all over and hearing the way the sorry state of the economy is having an effect on middle-class families and working-class families, and things are not right. 
   Hard times are here, and unfortunately, those hard times may be with us for a while. Some have been seeing this coming, and I would like to say that certainly my Democratic colleagues, including people I serve with on the Financial Services Committee, have been seeing this coming for quite a while. We have been working on it, talking about it, passing legislation to deal with these issues. 
   Others have come a little bit late to the table and are just beginning to see that middle-class families in this country are facing rising costs, difficult times. We've had a feed-the-rich policy and a squeeze-the-middle class, and it's time that we did something about it. 
   I recall that about a year ago, maybe a little more than a year ago, when I had just joined the Financial Services Committee, I had the opportunity to talk to the Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke. He came before our committee and testified about the state of the economy. Now this was before we'd seen the mortgage crisis and the credit crunch and the bailout for Bear Stearns and all of the other things that are now making headlines in what are fairly arcane policy matters but now take up the front pages of our newspapers. 
   And we asked Mr. Bernanke about the state of the economy and what he saw then, and it was very interesting. At the time, he was reporting that corporate profits were in good shape, that corporate productivity was in good shape. In other words, that corporate productivity was on the rise. Corporate profits seemed to be okay. It meant that people who were working were working a lot harder and helping the corporations earn profits, and their productivity was good. 
   But we saw troubling signs. Back then, we saw that real wages in income for middle-class families were stagnant or had been slipping backwards in real dollar terms. We saw that we had had a record trade deficit, $758 billion. We've seen tax cuts for 7 years under this administration which mostly benefited the very wealthy. In fact, last year, the 500 top wage earners in this country  earned about $18.8 billion and paid about 17 percent of their income in wages. That's not what they were supposed to pay, apparently, according to the tax rates, but that's what they've ended up paying. They're doing pretty well. 
   So while middle-class families were experiencing slippage in their real wages and income going backwards and facing ever-increasing costs, we had gasoline prices rising, home heating oil was about to start zooming up that winter, costs for education were going up. We asked Mr. Bernanke whether or not the increase in corporate profits and the higher rates of corporate productivity necessarily were the best indicators of the health of the economy. Because we also pointed out at the time there was a troubling issue on the horizon, and the issue was that there had been many loans made to people over the past few years, let's call them subprime loans, which meant loans that were given to people with rates that started out being very good but then kind of rose precipitously and that we saw a problem with these subprime mortgages which may not have been given with the right kinds of appraisals which had been given to people who couldn't pay them back, whose incomes weren't sufficient to own homes, whose assets weren't sufficient, for whom there were no requirements to put money down like there used to be in the old days. 
   We took all of this in, and many of us had just come to Congress. We asked Mr. Bernanke whether or not that was a true measure of the health of our economy. And I do have to report that Mr. Bernanke is an expert economist and a very smart man who runs the Federal Reserve. He's the chairman, and his job, along with the other members of the Federal Reserve board, is to help control the money supply, among other things, in this country. It's like turning on the spigot for money that flows into the economy and helps make more credit available and deals with interest rates, and they deal with whether or not to cut interest rates or raise interest rates which then affect consumers who want to borrow money for mortgages on their houses or second equity lines, as many people have, also, on their houses or credit cards or to buy a car. So that credit and the flow of money, in large part, is controlled by the Federal Reserve. 
   His answer was he thought things were in pretty good shape. 
   Well, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, today, the chickens have come home to roost on 8 years of this administration's fiscal policies. I just pulled this off of the AOL service before I came down here to speak about these matters, and today, for the first time, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged that the U.S. could reel into a recession from the powerful punches of housing, credit, and financial crises. Yet, he didn't have much to say at this time about what the Federal Reserve is going to do next. 
   I have to tell you, after a couple of weeks at home, Mr. Bernanke doesn't have to tell us that we are in a financial crisis. There are neighborhoods in some of the cities in New Hampshire where you go on a street and we are seeing four and five houses foreclosed. We are seeing the ``bank owned'' signs. And what that means is 
   there is nothing worse to a family than losing a home. And what happens when a family loses its home is not only are they in peril, are they in distress, but whole neighborhoods are in distress. Because when homes are foreclosed in a neighborhood, it puts pressure on the housing prices in the neighborhood, it puts pressure on the other financial indicators in the whole community. So there is a huge ripple effect from what has turned into a housing problem. 
   At home in New Hampshire we are seeing it. In fact, by the end of 2009, Mr. Speaker, we anticipate seeing more than 4,900 foreclosures in the small State of New Hampshire alone. That's a huge rise. In some places we are seeing a hundred percent foreclosures. We've seen mill closings up north. We are seeing the job market beginning to soften in New Hampshire and around the country. Things are getting tough. 
   Rising costs, credit problems, home mortgage foreclosure crises, the war in Iraq goes on at the rate of $12 billion a month. Nobody has to tell the middle-class families of this country who have been squeezed by 8 years of this administration's policies that we are having hard times. 
   So tonight we are going to talk about what those hard times are, how we got there, and what we are doing in Congress, what my colleagues are doing, what we are trying to do here, especially on the Democratic side, to deal with these crises, and how we got here; and we are going to hear about what is going on in some of the other parts of the country as well. 
   I'm joined tonight by my other colleagues, as I said, from the Majority Makers, the class of 2006, Mr. Speaker, of which you are a part, which we are very proud of. 
   And I would like to introduce now and turn it over to my distinguished colleague from the State of Florida, the Sunshine State, where things are, frankly, much warmer than they are back home for me in New Hampshire where there is still snow on the ground and people are still digging out from a record snowfall. 
   So I will turn it over now to my distinguished colleague from Florida (Mr. Klein).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Thank you, Mr. Yarmuth. I really appreciate hearing from both of you about your perspectives about what's going on. 
   And the discussion we've had brings to mind a quote that I read by Abraham Lincoln, who was a good Republican. Today he might not be a Republican. Today he might be a Democrat. And it really addressed some of the fundamental underpinnings of the debates that we are having about how to fix things. What Abraham Lincoln said was that ``the purpose of government is to do what the free markets cannot or will not do so well for themselves.'' And today in Congress and around Washington and around the country, we are beginning a debate at one level about what kind of changes we need to make and what kind of help we need to offer to struggling middle-class families. And those are two separate questions really. 
   One of the questions is, what kind of changes do we need to make to the regulation of our financial systems? That integrated big financial system that, as Mr. Klein pointed out, deals with banks. It deals with stocks. It deals with housing. It deals with real estate. It deals with insurance. It's a complex system that is now regulated in Washington. It's regulated at the State levels because there are regulators in the States who regulate all these industries. And Washington, what we are now seeing is that we've had Depression-era regulatory systems that really took their eye off the ball over the past 8 years certainly. While things for the middle class were squeezing tighter and tighter and tighter and those at the very top were doing okay, the regulators didn't seem to notice. And a lot of people are asking questions: Well, why not? 
   The interesting thing here is to hear how the tunes of some people in this Chamber have changed. It used to be that some of our colleagues across the aisle who were saying don't regulate, deregulate, and that was a huge push for this administration and many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and, in fact, many have said just let the free markets take care of it. Well, what we are seeing in this boom-bust cycle is that the free markets need some control from government. It's got to be balanced, of course, because you don't want to go too far with the free market. But what we have seen, for instance, just in the housing crisis is this: When I go home to talk to my community bankers in New Hampshire, what they tell me is that their foreclosure rates aren't really any different than they were before we got into the crisis we are in. They're not seeing a huge spike in foreclosures. They are regulated very closely. They have to follow strict standards. And they have been making loans the way they always have. They've been requiring down payments. They've been asking people what are their incomes? They've been verifying those incomes. They have been appraising properties accurately. They have been making sure that the loans they make in their communities are the kinds of loans that a lot of people are familiar with. Unfortunately, there were a lot of lenders who weren't regulated in the same way and they were making loans to people who probably shouldn't have loans, maybe people who were speculating. And then what was happening was those loans were being packaged. And they were going to Wall Street where they were being packaged into huge kinds of packages of loans and sliced and diced into securities with very odd names and securities that many of us don't even understand: ``Credit Default Swap Exchange Opportunities,'' not listed on any stock exchange, traded sort of desk to desk on Wall Street, essentially where people were taking air and risky loans and slicing them up and selling them around the globe because we're in a global economy. There are global markets, especially on the financial side. So I read articles where pension funds from municipal employees in towns in Norway were going underwater because of the mortgage crisis here. 
   And so one of the fundamental questions that we have got to ask is how are we going to fix this regulatory scheme? Because really if you think about it, over the past 8 years, we have had the Bush tax cuts, which advantaged the very rich; and as you said, Mr. Yarmuth, pay for CEOs has gone through the roof, 350, 400 times what the average person is making. So while we had tax cuts that were advantaging the very rich and the middle class was being squeezed, we were spending $800 billion on the war in Iraq. And while that was going on, the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates very low. And mortgages were being handled in a different way, packaged, sliced and diced into stocks, and sold by unregulated lenders. So with very low interest rates, what people were lulled into thinking was that the prices of their houses would just keep going up and up and up and up, and people began to treat their houses like it was a revolving ATM machine. 
   I know that I got calls from people offering to rewrite my loan. I have a 30-year fixed loan. I'm very glad about it now. They were offering to rewrite my loan. They gave me all kinds of incredible deals. They were so incredible that I couldn't understand them, and I figured if I can't understand them, thank you very much but I'm going to stick with something simple. They were talking about a rate here and then in 3 years the rate would go there, and don't worry, when the rate goes up and if it goes up, you won't have to worry. Don't worry because your house will be worth more, and when your house is worth more, you will be able to refinance it again. So for the past 8 years we have seen that spiral. What happened was when the housing market crested and began to come down, everything began to unravel down the line, not only housing prices but then the credit crunch. It meant that people couldn't borrow for their businesses. They can't borrow to get out of their problems with their housing prices. We have seen at the same time a huge rise in energy prices. Jobs are now under real pressure in terms of people losing their jobs. And this has exploded into a crisis that we now have to deal with in Congress.     
   But we haven't been silent about it. Some of the things we have done, I am just going to talk really briefly, then hand it over to you, Mr. Klein, we took action. One of the things we did was we expanded affordable mortgage loan opportunities through the Federal Housing Administration for families who are in danger of losing their home by increasing the loan limits that the Federal Housing Authority administration could make to help with the fact that house prices have gone up. It's a very important part of the economic stimulus package which this Democratic Congress passed to put money into the hands of consumers through rebates that will come when people file their tax returns this year. Instant money. We address the housing piece, and we also helped small businesses in lots of significant ways. 
   So we haven't been sitting around. We are working on helping people. That was just a one-time shot, a shot in the arm for the economy. We are going to do other things because this is really once in a lifetime, in some way, kind of a problem. 
   People are using words like recession and other words like that. But as Mr. Klein said, let's just say that hard times are here. They are hard times that we haven't really had to face in this country in this way in a long, long, long time. And we are going to take action to make sure that we are helping squeezed middle-class families and hurting working families to get on their feet. We are going to offer a hand up. It's not going to be a handout, but it's going to be a hand up of the kind that the American people expect.  
   The last thing I will say before I turn it over to you, Mr. Klein, is that so far, the administration at the other end of the mall on Pennsylvania Avenue has set up an 800 number for homeowners. But so far, I am not sure that the administration really understands and is really feeling the depth and breadth of what our folks are facing back at home. I would say Mr. Bush ought to get out a little more and maybe he would see that some steps are necessary to help the middle-class families and working families. Because we are going to have to soften the hard landing that's coming. 
   With that, I will turn it back over to Mr. Klein.

   Mr. HODES. It's very interesting to think about. One of the great things about the Financial Services Committee under Mr. Frank is that very often we are able to work in a bipartisan way in the kind of spirit that the people of this country really are hoping that we will take to deal with these complex financial matters. Because  while we are dealing with try to fix the regulatory scheme and figure out exactly what measures, which we will talk about, are the kind of measures are going to help people on the ground who are losing their homes, it's really important that we are able to come together. 
   So there may be different philosophical approaches. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle on the Republican side, Mr. Bush in the White House may say, no, no, no. They may say to keep hands off. Let the free markets do everything. 
   But now people I think are beginning to come along and see that this is exactly the kind of situation where some appropriate government intervention to fix fundamental problems in the financial schemes and help with this mortgage crisis are going to be necessary. I am hoping that the President is going to come along. I am hoping that he is going to come on out of the Rose Garden. I am hoping that he is going to see that we need more than a 1-800 number, 1-88 I AM IN TROUBLE. 
   I am hoping that Secretary Paulson will continue to have what I think has been a pretty good dialog with the White House about what we have to do and that we are going to see the cooperation between the regulators, Mr. Paulson, the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President to move things forward.

Our job is going to be to try to deal with the 21st century realities and make the landing softer than it was then. 
   I would now like to turn it over to a distinguished colleague and an extraordinary leader, Mr. Ellison, from Minnesota, who serves on both the Judiciary Committee and serves with us on the Financial Services Committee, someone who has been a leader in his commitment to protecting consumers, dealing with the problems that people are facing every day in their lives, who understands that hard times demand from the Congress imaginative action, and has a way of addressing things in a head-on way that has been a great example for all of us here in Congress. 
   With that, I am very happy to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).

   Mr. HODES. Thank you very much for that perspective. 
   Before I introduce another colleague from the class of 2006, The Majority Makers, I do want to point out that we have not been quiet about what we think is necessary. Some of the things that we have done here in the House of Representatives, back in November we saw what was coming. We have been ahead of the curve. 
   We saw what was coming on this mortgage crisis and we passed the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act to strengthen consumer protections against risky loans. We wanted to make sure that going forward, the kind of lending practices that we have seen causing this mortgage and housing crisis would not be repeated. 
   That bill is sitting now somewhere across Statuary Hall, across the Rotunda on the other side of this building in the United States Senate, hopefully going to be passed by the United States Senate. But it is being held up there, like much legislation that we have passed here in the House to help middle-class families, to help working families, which has been held up in the Senate. 
   So I am hoping our colleagues are going to see the wisdom of making sure that we have loan standards in this country that really help to ensure that people who shouldn't get loans aren't getting the loans, that lenders who are taking advantage of people aren't taking advantage of them when they make the loans. 
   It goes along with what we have done to expand affordable mortgage loan opportunities for families in danger of losing their homes through the FHA reform. That is also being held up over in the Senate by Senator Shelby, who apparently is upset about the economic stimulus package and has taken it out by refusing to deal with that loan. 
   We have strengthened Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase their loan limit size. We are hoping that that goes through. And we have increased the supply of affordable rental housing to address the current shortage with the bill you talked about, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which we have to get through the Senate, across the way. It has to go up the Mall to the President. We have got to pass these kinds of measures. 
   We have done our job here in the House on those kinds of measures to help middle-class families and working families and people who are being struck. There are some other things that are coming from Mr. Frank and the Financial Services Committee in a couple of days as we hold hearings and pass things through. 
   But now what I would like to do in about the last 10 minutes that we have got is to introduce another colleague and turn it over to my esteemed, distinguished colleague from New York, a gentleman who understands small business, a gentleman who has been working hard for veterans, a gentleman who understands the problems that he is seeing in his community in Upstate New York, the distinguished gentleman from New York, JOHN HALL.

   Mr. HODES. Thank you, Mr. Yarmuth. 
   I appreciate the time we had, Madam Speaker, to talk about the economy. In the coming days, the Financial Services Committee will be presenting two very important proposals to help more on the mortgage crisis. One, we will provide some loan-ability and guarantee-ability through the Federal Housing Administration to lenders who are willing to write down loans and help people who are facing foreclosure and who may be in distress on their homes in order to make more money available to prevent foreclosures, and to help those, say at least 1 million, perhaps up to 2 million people who have been in foreclosures. 
   The second thing is we expect to propose a program of loans and grants to help States and cities acquire properties that have been foreclosed and facilitate returning them to the rolls as owner-occupied or rental units. 
   Taken together, these initiatives are going to be very important. They are going to allow millions of families to avoid disasters, they are going to help hard-pressed jurisdictions avoid the cascade of deteriorating neighborhoods and abandoned houses that follow the kind of crises we have seen, and they are going to help stem the steep and destabilizing decline in house prices that led to and is intensifying the financial crisis, because we cannot allow this crisis to continue unabated. 
   This Congress is ready to act. We are going to help middle-class and working families out of this hole. 
   I thank my colleagues for joining me tonight, and I thank Madam Speaker for her indulgence in allowing us to go over a short amount of time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to first thank my colleagues, Ms. Shea-Porter, Mr. Welch and Mr. Arcuri, for their work on this important amendment. This amendment will help schools in my district in New Hampshire to power their classrooms with alternative energy sources, including wood pellets and wood biomass, sources that are plentiful throughout New Hampshire. For example, under this new program, the program would help invest more than half a million dollars for Concord, New Hampshire's school district, and almost $1.5 million for Nashua, New Hampshire's schools. These dollars will allow our schools to reinvest in cost-effective and clean alternative energy. 
   Schools throughout New Hampshire are already investing to a limited extent in renewable energy and saving money. For example, Merrimack Valley High School and Middle School recently switched to wood biomass to heat their school facilities. In just one winter, the school district saved $80,000 in heating costs, and that was before the recent steep rise in the price of a barrel of oil. From March to March, that is $1.50 a gallon for heating oil that the costs have gone up, so we can only imagine what they will save in the coming winter. 
   As you can see, the alternative energies we promote here will help save money for our Nation's school districts in power and heating costs. That means schools will have more dollars to invest in improving our children's education. It means our school districts can afford more teachers in the classroom, more computers for our students and smaller class sizes to give our kids more individual attention. It means that our wise investments in this bill will pay huge dividends. 
   Energy efficiency, conservation and renewable energy are the key to a secure energy future for the United States of America. We can't drill our way out of the energy crisis we face. Green is the new red, white and blue. 
   To create a 21st century energy policy, we must all collectively make changes in how we power our buildings in both the private and public sector. This amendment will help our schools become leaders in an energy plan for the 21st century and give our school districts more resources to invest in our children's education. I am proud to support this amendment. I urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, it appears that congressional Republicans are finally coming around to the possibility that the war in Iraq cannot go on indefinitely. 
   This weekend House Republican leader John Boehner said if this troop escalation plan is not working by September or October, a plan B would need to be explored. This timid response is a sign that the Republicans see the writing on the wall and are desperate to hedge their bets on a failed policy. 
   The minority leader's timetable of this fall comes just days after Mr. Boehner joined President Bush in abandoning the benchmarks for Iraqi success the President himself established in January. Last week the minority leader and almost every Republican joined the President's call for an open-ended commitment of American troops and tax dollars in Iraq. Now feeling the pressure from the Americans who wisely support benchmarks and timelines, it appears that the Republican leader is backtracking. 
   The American people and the majority of this Congress will stand firm in supporting our troops and showing leadership for a new course in Iraq. Let's hope the minority leader lifts his head out of the sand, and he and his party and the President join us in moving Iraq in a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. 
   I am happy to be here tonight with my colleagues to speak about the issue that predominates in the minds of the people of this country, certainly in the minds of my constituents. 
   We are in a disastrous and unnecessary war in Iraq. I have received literally thousands of letters, phone calls and e-mails from the constituents of the Second District of New Hampshire, the people I represent, the people who sent me to Congress, telling me one thing loud and clear: They want us out of this miserable war. They want our troops out of the impossible trap of being caught in multiple sectarian conflicts. 
   I have only been in office for 6 months, yet I have received thousands and thousands of communications from the people I represent. It is past time to change course. 
   Now, when we do change course, and it is inevitable that we will change course, we must do it responsibly and with a view towards ensuring that our core values and our vital national security interests are protected. We are not talking about precipitous withdrawals. Today, when we passed the Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act, we made sure that we set a stage for a responsible course for redeployment of our troops, not a precipitous withdrawal. 
   Day after day, poll after poll, letter after letter, plea after plea, the American people, and certainly the people of New Hampshire, are demanding we bring this war to a responsible end. As we sit here today, we unfortunately are witness to a stunning lack of leadership, a failure of leadership, a failure to face the reality from the Bush administration. 
   The President's sad and sorry statement today was counterpoint to the mistakes that have been made in the past. In the absence of leadership from the White House, Congress has the duty to pick up the ball. We have the duty to exercise the moral leadership, the courage and the boldness that the American people know will be necessary to forge a responsible and comprehensive strategy to protect our security interests and lead this country back to a place where our military is strong, where our troops are fighting the right fight against al Qaeda, and where the American people's trust is restored in their leadership. 
   So I am glad to be here tonight, and I yield back to you, Ms. Sutton.

   Mr. HODES. Thank you. It's very moving, as we stand here, to think about the real impact, the effects of this misbegotten war on the people of this country. The war is a cancer on the body politic that it is our job to deal with. It's unfortunate. 
   We were sent to Congress, those of us who are here, largely to serve as catalysts for change. The legislation we passed today is that beginning, and I recall standing here where I'm now standing in the well of the House of Representatives a few weeks ago to welcome to this chamber men and women who had recently served their country, who were coming from Walter Reed, who had come from other military hospitals where, as my friend from New York Mr. Arcuri points out, the costs of dealing with the traumatic injuries that have been inflicted on more than 25,000 people in this war have not even begun to be calculated on the chart next to me. They run into so much money that the mind cannot grapple with it. 
   These brave men and women came to the floor. They came on crutches. They came in wheelchairs. And each one is a story of bravery and of sadness for me because I saw people whose lives were shattered, people without one leg, people without two legs, people without two legs and a arm, people without two legs and an arm, with traumatic brain injuries, and veterans in addition to the active duty wounded warriors who came here to meet Members of Congress and talk to us about the difficulties they were having in their lives, veterans for whom the Veterans Administration was not responsive, and we have dealt as a new Democratic majority with those issues as well. 
   I tried to think of what I could say. There was one soldier who sat in the front row with a young lady, it was his wife or his fianc&#233;, who wanted to talk to us about what was really happening in Iraq. And he started by saying, I have three things to tell you. He said, number one, they're not telling you the real story about what's going on there. Number two, and he stopped because he'd forgotten number two. He couldn't get to it.     
   He had traumatic brain injury. I ask myself, what will it take for the President of this great country of ours, for those predominantly on the other side of the aisle who support a surge which has weakened our security, strengthened al Qaeda, weakened our military, continued the destruction of our reputation in the world; what will it take for this President to face the reality of what his policies have created, to come before the American people with courage and dignity and say, ``We have made some terrible mistakes, and it's time to correct them. We will change course, because I know it's the right thing to do. I know we must do it. We honor the service of all those who have served in this conflict. But now we will go and we will fight al Qaeda where we need to in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We will deal and set our strategy in the Middle East so that we can effectively deal with the threat of Iran, the threat posed by Syria, the threat posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon, the threats posed by Hamas and Fattah in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will, once again, reassert our leadership in the world with the moral courage, with the principles and the values and the dignity that the American people expect. We will face up to our past mistakes, but we will lead into the future with a comprehensive strategy to protect American security''? 
   I am waiting. The American people are waiting. Congress is waiting. 
   Enough name calling. We are all in this together. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. The comprehensive strategy that we have adopted today is an American issue that will move us forward. The real honor that this President and those who oppose a new direction can do to those brave men and women who came to this floor shattered is to acknowledge the past mistakes and move forward to strengthen America and protect us all.

   The Iraq War has destabilized the region, and the United States must reassert and protect its fundamental national security interests by actively taking the necessary steps to stabilize the Middle East. 
   Today Congress will debate a plan which stands in stark contrast to the delusional policies of the Bush administration which have sapped our military readiness, strengthened al Qaeda, wasted our resources and betrayed the trust of the American people. 
   There is a way forward, and we must be bold, courageous and strategic. Without leadership in the White House, we must continue to exercise leadership in the people's House. And I assure the American people that we will.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to voice support for our troops, without reservation, and to oppose the administration's proposed escalation in Iraq. 
   We are at a turning point in American history. This Congress will shortly vote on a bold, clear resolution, repudiating the administration's failed policy in Iraq, a fiasco which has weakened our security, threatened our military readiness, cost thousands of lives and wasted billions of dollars. 
   I was elected to Congress from the great State of New Hampshire, promising return of congressional accountability and oversight. For the past 6 years, while Congress was under Republican control, only 12 hearings were held on the Iraq war, but in the past 6 weeks this Congress has held 52 hearings. 
   The evidence is clear that the American people and Congress were misled into the war in Iraq. No weapons of mass destruction, no links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, no imminent threat to our national security. Our resources, effort and attention were recklessly diverted from the war in Afghanistan, which I supported, and which continues to require our vigilance and commitment. 
   This administration has now lost its credibility with the American people and with the world. To succeed in the Middle East, we must regain our moral compass and embrace a new direction in Iraq. The administration's stubborn arrogance and incompetence has magnified the chaos in Iraq. 
   Our brave troops have done everything asked of them, but the administration's failures in planning postconflict reconstruction and its shocking incompetence in management have opened the Pandora's box of sectarian violence and civil war. 
   Escalation has been tried before and it has failed before. The administration claims this escalation is different. The administration says there are benchmarks for the Iraqis, but what I have concluded from our hearings and briefings is that no firm benchmarks for the Iraqis have been set. 
   Clearly, the administration intends to escalate, whether or not the Iraqis step up. And today it is reported that they plan to send our troops off to Iraq without up-armored Humvees. This is deja vu all over again, a lack of planning, combined with a lack of candor. 
   Relying on a military force alone as a strategy continues the administration's one-legged-stool approach to foreign policy. Absent an Iraqi Government committed to forging a political solution to the country's woes and absent the infrastructure for jobs and reconstruction programs, the one-legged stool cannot stand. We have already lost billions in U.S. and Iraqi dollars to fraud, waste and abuse. 
   Baghdad is a city of some 7 million people. In a city that size, an injection  of 20,000 troops is too little too late. The administration talks of victory in Iraq. The word is meant to stir our patriotic fervor. But in this matter, it has, unfortunately, a sad and hollow ring. 
   As a result of the administration's ineptitude, we are left making the best out of a bad situation. We owe it to our troops, the American people, and the Iraqis to act wisely and strategically. The administration talks tough. We must be tough, smart and fearless. That means a new direction in Iraq. 
   Our first order should be to address the missing second leg of the stool. Replace the military surge with a diplomatic surge, convene a high-level team of special envoys, send them to the region, and send them there until the job is done. 
   The third leg of the stool is economic. We need a real economic reconstruction program, but only on strict conditions that the Iraqi Government step up to quell the violence and engage in reconciliation and oil revenue-sharing. 
   It is past time to remove our troops from the middle of this civil war, redeploy them strategically in the region to give pause to our foes and send the troops we need to Afghanistan where they can support the government and deal with the resurgent Taliban. Dealing with Iran is, of course, challenging; but harsh rhetoric and saber-rattling are counterproductive in the complex, destabilized Middle East. 
   The true test of leadership is facing reality and having the good judgment and wisdom to adapt to the reality. By passing this resolution, we are sending the administration an unambiguous message: No more blank checks. We have had enough. It is time to face the reality in Iraq and develop a responsible and comprehensive strategy to protect American security in the region. 
   Much has been asked of this country in the past, and the future will inevitably require sacrifice, but it does not require sending 20,000 more American troops to Iraq. It does not require an escalation of this war. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I oppose the administration's escalation of the war in Iraq.

   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for yielding time and for his leadership on this important, innovative and historic legislation. We are fortunate to have him at the helm of the committee at this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the housing crisis is getting worse. In my home State of New Hampshire, foreclosures have increased nearly 100 percent this year. Across the country, credit is a hard to come by. The markets are unstable, and in my judgment we haven't heard all of the bad news yet. 
   There are many important specific reasons to support this bill today. Fundamentally, however, the housing markets and the institutions which deal with mortgages are the cornerstone of our economy. There is some risk in change, and the provisions for Fannie and Freddie are not without some risk, which through the excellent work of the chairman, in consultation with our colleagues in the Senate, have been minimized to taxpayers. But the far greater risk we face is inaction. I urge bipartisan support for this bill. It must be passed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I join Congressman Michaud in expressing thanks to Chairman Oberstar and other members of the Transportation Committee. 
   I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. This bill includes the Northern Border Regional Development Commission Act, the first bill I introduced as a Member of Congress, a bill with bipartisan support, and for which I extend a special thanks to Congressman Michaud, who has shown extraordinary leadership in the northern border region for economic development. 
   Mr. Speaker, parts of my home State of New Hampshire, and especially the beautiful region known as the North Country, have taken an economic beating and are struggling to recover. A staggering number of jobs have been lost. We have watched as plants closed and our young people disappeared to places that offer more opportunity. New Hampshire's North Country has suffered repeated economic body blows, and for the people who live there, it's getting harder and harder to get by. 
   I get up to the North Country quite frequently, and have spoken with hardworking folks with the drive to improve their neighborhoods, but whose communities have been ignored by the Federal Government for years. 
   If you were to pick up the paper today, Mr. Speaker, you would see pictures of the smokestacks of once thriving pulp mills coming down, having been subject to explosives. 
   Because of the challenges New Hampshire's North Country face, and the sincere desire of the people there to turn things around and to create new jobs and new investments, there's a compelling case for leveraging Federal investment in the region. In fact, the northern border region, or the ice belt, which includes the northernmost counties of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, has higher unemployment, a higher percentage of people living in poverty, and lower household income than the rest of the Nation. 
   The commission created in this bill would be charged with investing Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most distressed counties in that northern border region. 
   By design and purpose, this bill follows the successful regional development models created in the mid 1960s to improve the economic standing of targeted regions in the South. Based on this successful model, the commission would create a unique Federal-State partnership charged with promoting development through regional planning, technical assistance and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity. 
   The bill works like this: Community development districts and other nonprofits are encouraged to bring project ideas to the commission from the local level. This bottom-up, grassroots approach insures that actions reflect both local needs and regional economic development goals. It also insures that States have a deciding voice in what investment is made within their borders. 
   With a proposed budget of $40 million per year, the Northern Border Regional Development Commission can help meet a range of local needs. Whether the need is agricultural development, land and forestry conservation to maintain productive traditional uses, investment in transportation infrastructure, alternative and renewable energy or health care facilities, this commission will play a key role in investing in the region's economy. 
   The bill says, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, we're here to help you get ahead. The communities in the northern border region deserve effective government working for them. The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act is an important first step toward providing good-paying jobs, economic opportunity and revitalized communities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   I want to commend Chairman Obey and members of the Appropriations Committee for working together to bring this continuing resolution to the floor today. 
   One area I want to specifically address is LIHEAP, the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program. Thousands of the people I represent in New Hampshire are staring out at a cold winter ahead and record-high home heating oil prices. This continuing resolution provides $5.1 billion for the heating assistance program. While this is a record amount of funding for the program, it unfortunately will do little more than provide the same amount of fuel to the same number of families as New Hampshire covered last year, leaving thousands of families with no assistance at all. I am deeply disappointed that we could not find more to help meet the needs of families in my district and in districts around this country. 
   What this lack of funding will mean is that many eligible families for this program will not be able to receive assistance to keep their homes warm this winter. I will reluctantly support what is before us because this crisis is too important for us to come home emptyhanded this winter. 
   But I want to express my frustration that we cannot find more funding for the families in New Hampshire and around the country who will not be able to get critical heating assistance this winter. Many folks are going to have to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families. 
   This week, Congress is discussing and debating the proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. It is bitterly ironic that this Congress will shortchange families struggling to keep their homes warm this winter but still find money to bail out Wall Street. 
   As we debate the administration's financial package this week and contemplate their reckless disregard for the welfare of the American people, Members and leaders on both sides of the aisle should think long and hard about spending $700 billion of taxpayer money on bad Wall Street debt, while millions of our own taxpayers will not be able to heat their homes this winter.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, we recently traveled to Walter Reed Army Hospital, where, as a panel, we heard graphic testimony from numbers of witnesses. Witnesses included Staff Sergeant Shannon, who testified, wearing an eye patch, suffering from a traumatic brain injury, about the kind of treatment he had received at Walter Reed Army hospital. 
   The testimony was striking. He told us, Mr. Speaker, that after a few days of inpatient treatment, he was transferred into a limbo of outpatient treatment in which he couldn't find his way around the grounds and didn't have help for that; in which the assistance he needed wasn't there. And he is still in that limbo. 
   We heard graphic testimony from Mrs. McLoed, whose husband had suffered a traumatic brain injury and who also hasn't received treatment as an outpatient at Walter Reed of the kind that we would expect. 
   And we heard from Specialist Duncan, also testified with an eye patch on, that he had been living in intolerable living conditions in what is now the infamous building 18 at Walter Reed Army Hospital. 
   The testimony was gut wrenching. Nobody who was in the room could have not been affected at hearing how our soldiers, our brave troops who had been injured in combat and come home, to be sent to intolerable living conditions, with mold, peeling wallpaper, cockroaches and rats in their living quarters, and no way to work through a system that was a Byzantine bureaucracy, seemingly designed to deny care, instead of provide care for those who both need it and deserve it most. 
   It was with a heavy heart that I heard the testimony of the generals who were in charge of this system. The Surgeon General, General Kiley, who said that it wasn't his job to inspect the barracks at building 18; he had people to do that.  
   And the gentleman next to him, General Weitman, whose command recently was relieved, the person he essentially pointed to, the man who had been there for 6 months. But General Kiley had been there from 2002 to 2004. He was the fellow in charge of the whole operation. 
   General Weitman had been preceded by General Farmer. These conditions were known. And, in fact, General Kiley had been told on numerous occasions of the graphic problems with the system he was overseeing, and nothing had happened. 
   It is now time to fix these problems, Mr. Speaker. It is time for this Congress to hold the system accountable. It is time for the Armed Forces medical system to step up with the kind of accountability and oversight and fix that our soldiers deserve. 
   I look forward to participating in the fix of that system as a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. I look forward to hearing from the generals how they are going to fix things for our soldiers. Our soldiers need it. They deserve it. 
   And especially at a time when the President proposes to send more troops to Iraq, I ask the question, how can he do it at a time when the medical system of the Armed Services is incapable of handling the inevitable casualties that will result? 
   There is a disconnect, Mr. Speaker, and it is time that we change that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HODES. (PRESIDENT BUSH CANNOT TURN HIS BACK ON SOLDIERS WHO'VE BEEN WOUNDED IN HIS WAR -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HODES. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush sent American troops to war in Iraq, he had an obligation to ensure they were cared for if they came home wounded. Unlike in past wars, medical technology and protective gears have advanced to the point that soldiers who would have died in the past are now surviving devastating combat injuries. Their survival, of course, is a great development. Unfortunately, as the case at Walter Reed shows, many of our injured soldiers are not receiving the treatment they need and deserve when they return home. 
   We should all be outraged at what is happening at our military hospitals. Fortunately, this Congress is taking action. At the end of this week, House  committees will have held four hearings on the inadequate treatment our wounded soldiers are receiving at Walter Reed. We are now learning that this is more widespread than Walter Reed, and we must explore major reform options that fix this problem immediately. 
   Inadequate oversight of the Bush administration by past Congresses allowed these conditions to develop. The new Democratic Congress is going to hold those responsible accountable and ensure that our soldiers receive the help they have more than earned.
