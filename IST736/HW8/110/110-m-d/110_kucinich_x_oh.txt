<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5104, a 30-day extension of the Protect America Act. 
   When the Protect America Act was passed by this body on August 4, 2007, I voted against the legislation because it gave legitimacy to the administration's surveillance of Americans without warrants. It is in the best interest of our Nation to allow this temporary law to expire and return to the permanent FISA law until this body can agree on legislation that protects our Constitution and upholds the civil liberties of U.S. citizens. 
   The FISA Court has ruled to prohibit warrantless spying on Americans when communications between foreign targets overseas are routed through the U.S. The permanent FISA law leaves in place mechanisms to monitor potential terrorist activity with the approval of the FISA Court. 
   We cannot allow baseless claims of being soft on terror to drive this debate. Those who use fear to gain power for themselves are in effect subverting our Constitution. 
   We are at a moment in the history of this country where it is absolutely important that Congress must not accept a false choice. We must defend Americans and our Constitution from the politics of fear. We must demand that the President cease his attacks on our civil liberties. 
   I oppose this legislation, and I will oppose all future attempts by this body to pass fear-provoking legislation that sanctions oppression against the American people. 
   When our Constitution was written and amended, the fourth amendment said: ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'' 
   This fourth amendment has been the bedrock of the freedoms that Americans enjoy from a government that would use its power to go deeply into people's private affairs. 
   We must stand for our Constitution. We must stand for the Bill of Rights. That is the purpose of my presence at this very moment before this House.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (PRIVATIZATION OF IRAQI OIL--SPOILS OF WAR TO BUSH ALLY? -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. The recent oil deal between the U.S.-based Hunt Oil Company and the Kurdistan Regional Government raises questions since Hunt Oil, a privately held oil company based in Texas and its founder, Ray Hunt, have close ties to Vice-President CHENEY and are large donors to President Bush. The deal also appears to undercut the goal of oil revenue sharing but is predictably consistent with the administration's attempt to privatize Iraqi oil assets. Both Hunt Oil Company and Kurdistan are strong allies with the Bush administration. 
   As I have said for 5 years, this war is about oil. The Bush administration desires private control of Iraqi oil, but we have no right to force Iraq to give up control of their oil. We have no right to set preconditions for Iraq which lead Iraq to giving up control of their oil. The Constitution of Iraq designates that the oil of Iraq is the property of all Iraqi people. 
   I am calling for a congressional investigation to determine the role the administration may have played in the Hunt-Kurdistan deal, the effect the deal could have on the oil revenue sharing plan and the attempt by the administration to privatize Iraqi oil.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, $183.7 billion war-funding request in light of more than 4,000 U.S. troops who have died, tens of thousands injured, a million dead or more innocent Iraqis, a cost of $2 to $3 trillion. We're borrowing money from China to fight this war. We're ruining our economy. We're ruining our moral standing in the world. We're ruining our children's future and making the world more dangerous for a war based on lies. 
   Why do we keep funding it? Support the troops by bringing them home. End the war. End the occupation. Close the  bases. Bring the troops hope. Set in motion an international security and peace-keeping process that can create the circumstances for our troops to come home. Have a program of reconciliation and reconstruction in Iraq. Return all oil assets to Iraqi control. End the war. Stop funding it. 
   Vote ``no'' on the war appropriations.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The primary beneficiaries of H.R. 5818 are the neighborhoods and neighbors of high concentrations of houses made vacant by the foreclosure and predatory lending crises. Helping those neighborhoods should be a nonpartisan and noncontroversial act. Such neighborhoods are the totally innocent bystanders of the predatory lending and foreclosure crises. Neighbors and neighborhoods are victims of the meltdown of subprime loans that preceded this wave of foreclosures, and there's no moral hazard in helping the neighbors. The Kucinich amendment ensures that the funds authorized by H.R. 5818 are targeted to help the most needy neighborhoods. 
   When a foreclosure leads to a vacant and abandoned property, this is what happens to the neighborhood: Crime goes up, as the vacant property can become home to criminal activity, drug places, and fire hazards; local government costs for police, fire and building inspections go up; vacancies go up, abandoned properties initiate a chain of events that begets more abandoned properties; neighbors lose equity in their homes, because vacant properties have a strong negative effect on the value of neighboring properties. 
   My amendment clarifies that the purpose of this legislation is to help State and local governments ``preserve the equity and ensure the safety of neighbors of homes made vacant'' by the foreclosure and predatory lending crises. 
   My amendment also ensures that the neediest neighborhoods receive priority in the plans developed by States, metropolitan cities and urban counties. The neediest neighborhoods are defined with ``high concentrations of vacancies,'' ``large increases in the rate of vacancy'' in the last 2 years, and ``significant levels of loans determined to be at risk of foreclosure.'' These vacant property statistics have been gathered by the United States Postal Service and analyzed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and their use will better target the funds authorized by H.R. 5818. 
   My amendment is the product of a collaborative effort between my subcommittee, the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity and the Financial Services Committee. The amendment draws upon the academic research and input from practitioners in this area. 
   My amendment is supported by community development professionals and advocates, such as Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the National Vacant Properties Campaign, and Smart Growth America. 
   I will place their letters of support in the Record at this point.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Chairman, I am sure the American people may find it ironic to see a drumbeat here for a secret ballot in the very House of the people where we depend on having our votes for all the world to see. 
   Workers rights are human rights, and the fight to broaden and increase workers' rights is a fight to bring economic justice and dignity to those who have created the infrastructure, the wealth and the prosperity of our Nation. 
   In this fight, no tool is more fundamental than the right of workers to organize. Organization is power, and when wielded effectively, the results are obvious. Union members' weekly wages are 30 percent higher than the wages of nonunion members. Sixty-eight percent of union members have a guaranteed, fully insured pension, while only 14 of nonunion workers can say the same. Over three-fourths of union members receive health coverage from their employers. Less than a majority of nonunion workers have that same coverage. 
   Despite protection in Federal law by the National Labor Relations Act, the right to organize has increasingly come under attack. This is a chance to stand up for the right to organize.

   Mr. KUCINICH. I am totally opposed to any attack on Iran. It would have disastrous consequences for Iran, the U.S., the region and the world. It would put 140,000 U.S. troops in great jeopardy. It would expose Israel to maximum peril. Even the talk about such an attack should be subject to a review not only by Congress, but by an international tribunal. Iran has neither the intention nor the capability of attacking the United States, yet the administration has been preparing for some time for an aggressive war against Iran. 
   Congress must insist the administration come forward now with facts, not fiction, regarding Iran. We must not allow the President to remain unchallenged while he continues to use the media to create a pretext for an illegal war. 
   Congress must insist the President come to the full Congress for permission to take any action against Iran. If the President proceeds to attack Iran after an express congressional authorization under article I, section 8, both he and the Vice President should be subject to impeachment. 
   We must take a stand against aggressive war or we will lose our democracy.

President Bush has every intention of keeping the troops in Iraq through the end of his term. However, the money is there to bring the troops home now. If Congress appropriates more money for Iraq, the war will escalate and more troops and innocent civilians will die. The American people voted for a new direction. That direction is out of Iraq. Let us rescue our troops. Let us rescue a domestic agenda. Let us reverse policies which have created chaos, massive civilian casualties and destruction in Iraq. Let us reunite the community of nations in the cause of stabilizing Iraq.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Title IV Sec. 405 Pay-As-You-Go rules before the House today. I support these rules that will enable us to patch a sinking ship. The Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans have driven us into permanent deficit spending. These rules will stop the sacrifice of the nation's well being for the benefit of the few. 
   I continue to be concerned about our weakened economy and the shrinking industrial base. I believe Congress should be enacting measures that will expand the economy, revitalize the rust belt, expand our manufacturing base, prime the pump when needed in recession, and invest in infrastructure improvements. I believe Congress should enact universal healthcare for all and universal pre-kindergarten. Unlike the irresponsible tax cuts in the past 4 years, I am prepared to ensure these programs do not run up deficits over the long term. This can all be accomplished under these rules.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment and the underlying bill that reauthorizes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I want to thank the chairman of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee for working with me on three critical provisions that are included in this amendment. I also want to thank the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee and the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee for putting together yet another bill that protects NASA and for working with me on this amendment. 
   The most important provision in this amendment is an extension of the ban on layoffs until at least 2011. Since announcing the ambitious vision for space exploration, the administration underfunded NASA. But Congress has consistently, and I might point out, in a bipartisan way, rejected these destructive cuts and layoffs. I am particularly proud of the way our own Ohio delegation has worked together on this. 
   Layoffs undermine not only workers' lives and the mission of the agency but also the regional economy. According to the researchers at Cleveland State University, NASA Glenn in Brook Park generated a demand for products and services of $955 million and was responsible for over 6,000 jobs in northeast Ohio in 2006. 
   Over the last few years, NASA has hired nearly three-quarters of its new science and engineering employees as short-term employees, thereby denying them full Civil Service protections. The 10 percent cap on short-term positions in this amendment will help NASA compete for the best and brightest in the field. 
   The third provision would temporarily extend health care benefits for employees in transition. The sudden loss of health care coverage is a major factor currently discouraging employees from taking a buy-out. The provision would be helpful in fostering a respectful workforce transition plan during this time of change for NASA. 
   This amendment and the underlying bill keep NASA healthy by supporting its employees. All across this country,  from one end of the country to the other, there are NASA employees who are performing a valuable service, who are helping us to create the jobs of the future and enabling America to fulfill its vision to keep reaching.

   These concerns include whether the Department of Energy would take into account the protection of national parks, State parks, conservation easements, and historical sites like battlefields when determining where an electric transmission corridor should be designated. The answer is they don't. 
   Whether the Department of Energy is considering the effects of a corridor designation on the private property rights of landowners. They did not. 
   Whether the Department is considering the environmental impact of corridor designations. The answer is they did not. 
   Whether the Department of Energy is considering alternatives to constructing new electric transmission lines, like demand-side management, distributed generation, and energy efficiency. They did not.

Madam Speaker, I regretfully oppose this rule, not because I lack appreciation for the work of my colleagues in trying to craft a bill that would get consensus, but because we are right back to where we were in January of 2007. We made a commitment that we would take control of this Congress and would end the war. Now, with this bill, we are saying we will set a goal of 18 months from now. So what happens 18 months from now? We have to end this war by stopping the funding. 
   In this bill we are telling the Iraqis they are going to have to pay for the reconstruction. We are telling the Iraqis they are going to have to give a discount price for oil, so they are going to subsidize the war against their own country. 
   We are losing a lot in this war, not only hundreds of billions of dollars, not only the lives of our troops, not only the injuries, but we are also losing our sense of humanity and compassion. There have been over 1 million innocent Iraqis killed as a result of this war.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, we are sacrificing our entire domestic agenda for an illegal war in Iraq. 
   When you look at the President's budget, reductions in education and health care over a period of time will cause many necessary programs to be cut for the American people. Meanwhile, the White House is discussing whether or not to bring refugees from Iraq to the United States. 
   Now, think about it a minute. We are prosecuting an illegal war in Iraq, we are illegally occupying the country, we are building permanent bases in Iraq, and now we are talking about bringing refugees here. The real humanitarian thing to do would be to end the war by ending the occupation, closing the bases and bringing our troops home. 
   That is exactly what my 12-point plan would do. I reached it with the help of people from the international community, the U.N., people who have experience in peacekeeping. They say we can bring in an international security force once we get agreement from the countries in the region, and we can bring our troops home. 
   We have to stop this disaster in Iraq, bring our troops home, end the occupation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   This is a 1,513-page document which was completed today at 11:12 a.m., and delivered most recently to the Clerk's desk. I am sure many Members are familiar with some of the aspects of it, but perhaps not all. 
   My good friend, Mr. Skelton, whose work I am always grateful for, your commitment to this country is very admirable. It takes a lot of work to do what you do, and I stand here today to express reservations to, and opposition to, this bill; and the reservations I have are of course that this bill will continue to fund the war in Iraq. 
   I have offered Congress an alternative, which is that we can end the occupation, close the bases, bring the troops home, set in motion a parallel process of an international security and peacekeeping force that would move in as our troops leave. We all want to protect our troops. I think the best way to defend and protect them is to bring them home. So that is one of the first concerns I have. 
   The second concern I have is section 229 of the bill relates to protection of U.S. and allies from the Iranian ballistic missile. One of the things in the bill that I am very concerned about, Mr. Chairman, is that it says that Iran maintains a nuclear program. Now the National Intelligence Agency, which made information available to this Congress, would assert otherwise. I think that we have to be very cautious about building out an entire part of our defense, planning for an attack from Iran, when we haven't even made an effort to break down the walls that have been built up over 29 years and use diplomacy. Yet, we are actually defining and making a connection between a nuclear capability that Iran clearly doesn't have at this moment and ballistic missiles. And by creating that linkage, we are actually creating an architecture of fear. I don't think that is a sensible way for the greatest Nation of the world to be pursuing its policy. In connection with that, it creates increased tensions for Europe. 
   I am concerned that we keep building these missile interceptors in Alaska that in a sense helps to frame an interceptor system that has not even been proved to be technologically feasible; that we are getting into nanotechnology without any serious discussion of what it means when you start using nanotechnology and marry it to weapons production.     
   The discussion in this bill about a Space Posture Review speaks of the United States policies in space as space control, space superiority, targeting objects on Earth from outer space. Now, that doesn't sound like the America that many of us would want to participate in when we think that we are going into kind of a Buck Rogers scenario here. 
   Another section deals with continuing and encouraging the School of the Americas, something a number of Members have opposed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have gone over a good part of this bill, as much as I could with this short a period of time, and I think when we, on the one hand, accept the judgment of Members of Congress that we don't want a permanent presence in Iraq, and on the other hand give $80 million for one base, $86 million for another, $88 million for a third, and $103 million for a fourth, that sounds like a permanent presence to me. Either that or it is the most expensive trailers in the history of humanity. 
   So there are so many factors in here that really I think need to cause us to be cautious. Also the one about Pakistan, because I think we are setting the stage for sending U.S. troops to Pakistan, something the American people do not want to do. 
   I want to thank my friend, nevertheless, for his commitment to our troops. We agree that we should protect our troops.

Madam Speaker, one of the things that I just want to call to your attention, to my friend, I am concerned about that section 229 about Iran, especially in light of the new development that may have happened since this was drafted and the draft that you cite about the National Intelligence Estimate. I am not sure that that discussion about the National Intelligence Estimate has really been given weight with respect to the language in section 229 which essentially says that Iran maintains a nuclear program. When you say that Iran maintains a nuclear program and it is in that legislation, I think we set the stage for some problems. 
   I want to thank the gentleman for being so kind to yield to me.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, over the past few years this administration has been beating the drums of war against Iran. There are parallels against their efforts to try to create a war against Iran and the falsehoods that set us on the path to war against Iraq. We know that the United States intelligence community was able to demonstrate that the administration's claims that Iran had a nuclear weapons program were in fact not true. 
   The January 6 incident at the Strait of Hormuth is still another cause for this Congress to look deeply at the administration's Iranian war buildup, because it appears from news reports that the Department of Defense grossly inflated an encounter that took place in the strait, an encounter that was not like any that had taken place before, and then not only inflated it, but fabricated information that would cause the American people to believe that Iran was demonstrating military aggressiveness. 
   We really have to get off the path of war towards Iran and start working on building diplomatic relations.

It would order the privatization of Iraq's oil and open the door for the President to order an attack on Iran without congressional authorization. 
   Democrats were brought to power not to spread war, but to stop it. The administration took us into war for oil. We should not be confirming that purpose by promoting privatization in the Iraq funding bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In Afghanistan, as is true of all wars, bombs have missed their targets, civilians have been maimed and killed, property's been destroyed. Both homes and families have been devastated and literally torn apart. 
   As the United States seeks to abate terrorists, we must also learn to avoid the unintended consequences related to our foreign policy. One approach is to accept responsibility when we harm innocent civilians and provide compensation for the impact that war has had on civilian lives that are accidentally caught in the crossfire. 
   The United States has a moral obligation to help the innocent civilians of Afghanistan, whose lives have been devastated by war, to rebuild their lives and their country. The United States must live up to this moral obligation by providing humanitarian assistance for innocent victims of war who are harmed by combat operations. 
   Currently, the U.S. military has two systems in place that provide monetary compensation to civilians who, as a consequence of U.S. military action, have been accidentally harmed. 
   The Foreign Claims Act provides for the compensation of civilians who have been injured, died or whose property's been damaged from noncombat activities and negligent or wrongful acts. 
   Alternatively, condolence payments can be paid by the U.S. military directly to victims, or their survivors, who suffer a physical injury, death or property damage in amounts not to exceed $2,500. 
   Congress should support the Foreign Claims Act and condolence payment systems to the greatest extent possible as this money helps innocent people of Afghanistan rebuild their lives. 
   Today's bill, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007, seeks to increase the maximum amount of condolence payments; and I commend this action and urge the President to heed the intent of Congress in this matter. 
   There's another avenue for the United States to make major gains. Brigadier Richard E. Nugee, chief spokesperson for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, recognized that NATO forces had killed dozens of civilians in Afghanistan in 2006, and here's what he had to say. ``The single thing that we have done wrong and we are striving extremely hard to improve on is'' the unfortunate killing of innocent civilians. 
   NATO, realizing their past mistakes and in an effort to advance goodwill and allay resentment among Afghans caused by innocent civilian casualties, established a post-operations humanitarian relief fund, placed under the ISAF's Commander's discretion, to compensate Afghans harmed by combat operations.     
   This NATO program is alike in its objective to both the Condolence Payment system and the Foreign Claims Act. This system is noble in its intent. 
   I urge the United States to show its commitment to the people of Afghanistan, to honor our promise to win their minds and hearts by increasing the functionality of the NATO humanitarian assistance program for innocent war victims. 
   This amendment shows the commitment of the U.S. people to Afghanistan by diverting $500,000 to the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund of the U.N. International Security Assistance Force. The international fund has received contributions from the Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden. By diverting this money the United States is sending a message to and joining with NATO and the international community to show our commitment to the people of Afghanistan. 
   The Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict, CIVIC, founded by Marla Ruzicka, who worked tirelessly in Afghanistan to win compensation for civilian war victims before she was killed by a car bomb in Baghdad in 2005, supports that commitment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to insert in the Record a letter of endorsement from Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support of this resolution honoring the 45th anniversary of John Glenn's historic flight, making him the first American to orbit the Earth. 
   His journey in the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft was made all the more incredible by the complications that ensued during the flight. Scheduled for three orbits, the final two had to be piloted on manual control after a malfunction in the automatic controls. Still on manual control, Mr. Glenn piloted the capsule during reentry into the earth's atmosphere. 
   The spacecraft also sent a signal to the ground that the heat shield, designed to prevent the craft from burning up on reentry, was loose. Though ground control did not tell him, Mr. Glenn quickly deduced there was a problem. An external piece of the craft called a retropack, which was supposed to be jettisoned before reentry was left on to try to keep the heat shield in  place. During the reentry, pieces of retropack flew past the capsule's window in flames. Still, Colonel Glenn landed safely in the Atlantic Ocean to the relief of the Nation. During the flight, John Glenn was subjected to 7.7 Gs and traveled 76,000 miles. 
   His success helped lay the groundwork for the continuous string of successes NASA has since accumulated. John Glenn went on to continue his lengthy record of public service as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, even returning to space flight in 1999. 
   When we stand here and look back 45 years, it is almost impossible to imagine that a man would step into a small container with a huge rocket behind it that would propel him into an orbit. And when you think of the kind of courage that he demonstrated then, what is interesting about John Glenn is that all of the attention, the fame and adulation that came after that didn't affect him one bit. He was basically someone who served his country in the military, then went on to serve his country as a U.S. Senator, and while this historic occasion is being recognized, I think also we pay tribute to John Glenn the man, who has demonstrated that it is possible to be able to walk with kings and never lose the common touch. 
   And also, we celebrate his wife, Annie, who has been a constant companion at Senator Glenn's side and has always represented the finest tradition of American couples. John and Annie Glenn have so much to be proud of, and this Nation owes both of them a debt of gratitude, and I am glad to see that we are honoring the 45th anniversary of his historic flight. Also, I am so pleased that so many of my colleagues from Ohio are here to join in paying tribute to John Glenn.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, in large part because of its support for NASA. The Committee did an admirable job of finding money to keep NASA healthy and balanced in the face of a destructive budget request from the Administration. 
   Ultimately, inadequate funding puts at risk NASA's most valuable asset, its workers. It is the workers who have won the awards and have driven the incredible accomplishments the agency has amassed. When its world class work force gets a message from Congress or from the Administration that funding is not reliable, the workers often feel the need to leave the agency. When given the choice, no worker wants to worry about whether their job will be there next year. When employees leave, they not only take their award winning talent and intelligence, but their deep institutional knowledge. These losses are dents in NASA's armor that take years, if not decades, to repair. 
   That is why I am so glad to know that the committee has acted to protect NASA. This bill  prevents unnecessary layoffs, it funds Aeronautics and Exploration in order to fulfill the agency's mission, and it prevents the administration from moving large chunks of money around the agency against the will of Congress. 
   I am proud to represent the NASA Glenn Research Center in Brook Park, Ohio. Its economic impact is felt throughout the entire state. In FY04, the year for which we have the most recent data, the economic output of NASA Glenn alone was $1.2 billion per year. It was responsible for over 10,000 jobs and household earnings amounted to $568 million. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to protect NASA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative but to go to war; that was wrong. Now Congress is telling the American people we have no alternative but to continue the war, and that by continuing the war for just another year or two we will then be able to end the war. War equals peace. I don't think so. 
   This war has achieved a momentum that has swept up into its tragic hold people of otherwise good will who would vote to continue a war when they really want peace and when the American people want peace. 
   I believe you cannot say you are for peace and vote to keep this war going. You cannot say you are for peace and facilitate the theft of Iraqi oil. You cannot say you are for peace and give the President enough money not just to keep this war going, but to attack Iran if he so chooses. If you want peace, vote for peace now. If you want peace, stop funding this war. If you want peace, stand for the truth. 
   What America must do and what Congress has the power to do is to stop the war now, use the money in the pipeline to bring the troops home, set in motion a diplomatic process that would involve the world community in moving into Iraq as our troops move out. We need to stand for peace. H.R. 1234 is the vehicle to do that

   Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative but to go to war. That was wrong. Now Congress is telling the American people, we have no alternative but to continue the war for just another year or two, and then we will be able to end the war. So war equals peace. I don't think so. 
   This war now has a momentum of its own, which has captured even people of good will who say they want peace but are going to vote to keep us at war. The same false logic that trapped Members into voting for the war is trapping Members into voting to continue the war. 
   I believe you cannot say you are for peace and vote to keep this war going. You cannot say you are for peace and facilitate the theft of Iraqi oil. You cannot say you are for peace and give the President money not just to keep this war going but to attack Iran if he so chooses.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, assuming we get there, how strange the politics of today will seem to future generations. Here we are debating whether to send more troops into a nation we are already illegally occupying for oil. Here we are contemplating the U.S. invading another nation, Iran. I wonder if we would be having that discussion if Iran did not have a tremendous amount of oil. 
   All around us we are in conflict because we are addicted to oil. Our energy consumption choices are causing global warming which is causing weather patterns to change. Think about what we have seen in the last few weeks alone: snow in Los Angeles, billions of dollars in damage to California citrus crops because of a freeze. 
   The burning of fossil fuels has contributed to erratic weather. Last year, we had the warmest weather in the United States continent in 112 years. 
   Now, instead of separating the world with our politics, it is imperative that we bring the world together to meet the challenge of global climate change. I am hopeful that in his State of the Union Address next week, the President is going to take a direction to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. My colleagues, a few years ago I was doing some climbing of hills and mountains in Colorado, and when I had started my journey I looked up into the hills and it looked like it would take a few hours to climb to a hill. I started my climb and I finally got there, it took about a half a day. And when I got to the top of this hill, when I was first starting I thought I would just get there and I am right at the top, I am at my destination; but as I got to that top of that hill, I saw there was another hill, and I had to climb another half day. 
   This Congress is about to climb a hill, and that hill is opposition to the escalation. But when we climb that hill, we are only going to be halfway there because the top of the hill we've got to reach, that second hill, is called ``ending the occupation.'' Stopping the escalation is only half the journey here, we have to end the occupation. 
   Similarly, people say, well, now they oppose the war. Well, opposing the war, well, that is halfway up that hill. Take that journey. But going all the way up the hill you are going to have to say, stop the funding for the war. The Kucinich plan enables us not only to stop the funding for the war, but to secure Iraq and create a whole new America and world.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, it has been said several times but bears repeating. When you're in a hole, stop digging. Our dependence on oil--foreign and domestic--requires us to stop making the problem worse by giving oil companies billions upon billions of dollars in truly unnecessary subsidies that worsen our dependence. This bill redirects $14 billion away from these subsidies and toward more sustainable energy production. 
   The transition to a renewable energy economy is not optional. The question is whether we will wait so long to create the transition that we do not make it on our own terms. Europe gets it. They are pouring orders of magnitude more money into research on renewables, positioning their industries to thrive in the future. On the other hand, this Administration has been digging its heels in by throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at an industry that made record profits on the backs of hard working Americans. We have a long way to go to catch up and this bill steers us firmly in that direction. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill and our Nation's veterans. Their service and sacrifice for our country is honorable and today this body will properly honor them by ensuring greater resources for their care and wellbeing. Congress has responded appropriately by increasing funding by $2.9 billion above the President's request. 
   This bill responds to the needs of our returning troops from Iraq and Afghanistan by including $3.8 billion for mental health resources to provide treatment for post traumatic stress syndrome and traumatic brain injuries. It includes $300 million above the President's request for maintaining VA medical facilities. Access to these facilities and ensuring their proper upkeep has a positive impact on our communities and is imperative to serving the needs of our veterans. This bill increases enrollment in VA medical care for all veterans, including those on a limited income, by 10 percent. To help veterans in rural areas that must travel to get needed health care, the mileage reimbursement has been increased from 28.5 cents to 41.5 cents. 
   I therefore support this bill. These improvements to our VA system will have a beneficial impact on our veterans and move our Nation in the direction of providing them with the care they need and deserve. 
   However, this bill includes funding for military construction projects for military operations in Afghanistan. The Bagram Air Base is the main base for the Combined Forces Air Component Command, CFACC. Funds from this bill will be used to fortify temporary buildings, expand refueling capability and build an aircraft maintenance hangar at Bagram. As the U.S. expands and improves military facilities in Afghanistan, the likelihood that our troops will remain in the region increases. 
   Including these funds, which keep our troops in harms way, in a bill meant to support our veterans is an affront to our Nation's veterans and to the level of transparency our government should maintain.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the President's representative from the military is on Capitol Hill urging us to continue to stay in Iraq, telling us to wait, don't leave. 
   What are we waiting for, until the cost of the war reaches $6 trillion, so  that our American economy goes totally bust, so that we don't have any more money for education or health care or housing? 
   What are we waiting for, for the casualties to get to 10,000 or 20,000 deaths of our service men and women? 
   What are we waiting for, for America to stand alone against the world? 
   It is time that we take a new direction. It is time that Congress regain its rightful role as a coequal branch of government. It is not appropriate for leaders in Congress to say, well, it is the administration's fault that the war continues, when in fact we have the authority to cut off funds. 
   Congress must take a strong stand and say no more funding; end the war, stop the occupation, close the bases, bring the troops home, set in motion an international peacekeeping and security force that comes in as our troops leave, work for a program of reconciliation between the Shiites, the Sunnis, and the Kurds, work for a program of repatriations, and stop trying to control the oil of Iraq.

   As Congress prepares to debate a nonbinding resolution on Iraq, this administration is already on its way to the next war against Iran. We are losing our democracy to war and to debt. We are borrowing money from China, from Korea and Japan to fight a war in Baghdad and to prepare for war against Iran. 
   Meanwhile here at home, there are so many people that lack access to adequate health care, who do not have money for housing or education. We do not have money for job creation, but we have money for war. It is time to stand up for the American people. It is time for Congress to assume its full power under the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, as we debate this nonbinding resolution on Iraq, the administration is preparing for the next war in Iran. We are losing our democracy to war, massive debt, fear and fraud. The American people need Congress to surge towards the Constitution, surge towards the truth. 
   Now, some call this resolution a first step. I would like to believe that Congress will respond to the will of the American people expressed in the November election. They expect us to take real action to assert our constitutional power, to take America out of Iraq by refusing to provide any more funding for the war. That is our right. That is our duty. We have a duty to restrain an administration which is conducting an illegal war. We have a duty to hold to a constitutional accounting a President and a Vice President who led us into a war based on lies. 
   I led the effort against the Iraq war resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask to include into the Record an analysis of the President's war resolution which was given to Members of Congress back in October of 2002. It pointed out that there is no proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, anything to do with 9/11, anything to do with al Qaeda's role in 9/11. It is not as if Congress had no idea the war was based on untruths. 
   Now we must tell the truth, not just about the escalation, but about the occupation. We are illegally occupying Iraq. We attacked a nation which did not attack us. We must recognize the wrong that has been done and move to right it. 
   Instead of debating the end of the war, Congress is ironically preparing to give the war a new beginning. Some have made it clear long before this particular resolution that they will continue to fund the war by approving the upcoming supplemental appropriation, even though money exists to bring the troops home now. 
   When we equate funding the war with supporting the troops, we are dooming thousands of young Americans who are valiantly following the orders of their Commander in Chief. If we truly cared about the troops, we would not leave them in the middle of a civil war. If we truly cared about the troops, we would not leave them in a conflict for which there is no military solution. 
   The war is binding. The resolution is not. This resolution will not end the war. It will not bring our beloved troops home. It will not even stop the administration from sending more troops. That is because this resolution is nonbinding. 
   The war is binding. The resolution is not; 3,100 U.S. troops are bound in death; 650,000 innocent Iraqi civilians are bound in death. 
   The war is binding. The resolution is not. American taxpayers are bound in debt. The war could cost $2 trillion. We are borrowing money from Beijing to fight a war in Baghdad. Worse, each and every time Congress votes to fund the war, it votes to reauthorize the war. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but there are weapons of mass destruction at home. Poverty is a weapon of mass disruption. Lack of education is a weapon of mass destruction. Poor health care is a weapon of mass destruction. We must find and disarm those weapons of mass destruction which threaten the security of our own Nation. But Congress must first take responsibility. 
   The Federal Court has made it abundantly clear that once a war is well underway, Congress' real power is to cut off funds. Funding the war is approval of the war. 
   The American people are waiting for us to provide real leadership to show the way out of Iraq. My 12-point plan responds to that demand. This plan, drafted with the help of experts in international peacekeeping, specialists with U.N. experience and veteran military advisors, creates a peace process which will enable our troops to come home and stabilize Iraq. 
   Here are the elements of the Kucinich plan. 
   First, Congress must deny any more funds for the war. 
   Second, the President will have to call the troops home, close the bases and end the occupation. 
   Third, a parallel peace process which brings in international peacekeepers must begin. That is third. 
   Fourth, move in the international peacekeeping and security force and move out U.S. troops. Peacekeepers will stay until the Iraqis are able to handle their own security. 
   Fifth, order U.S. contractors out of Iraq. 
   Sixth, fund an honest process of reconstruction. 
   Seventh, protect the economic position of the Iraqi people by stabilizing  prices in Iraq, including those for food and energy. 
   Eighth, create a process which gives the Iraqi people control over their economic destiny without the structural adjustment policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
   Ninth, give the Iraqi people full control over their oil assets, with no mandatory privatization. 
   Tenth, fund a process of reconciliation between the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. 
   Eleventh, the U.S. must refrain from any more covert operations in Iraq. 
   And twelfth, the U.S. must begin a process of truth and reconciliation between our Nation and the people of Iraq. 
   There is a way out. Congress should stand for that. And we will have an opportunity to do it once again in about 6 weeks 
   Analysis of Joint Resolution on Iraq  
   Whereas in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its people in order to defend the national security of the United States and enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq; 
   Key Issue: In the Persian Gulf war there was an international coalition. World support was for protecting Kuwait. There is no world support for invading Iraq. 
   Whereas after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them, and to end its support for international terrorism; 
   Whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors, United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated; 
   Key Issue: UN inspection teams identified and destroyed nearly all such weapons. A lead inspector, Scott Ritter, said that he believes that nearly all other weapons not found were destroyed in the Gulf War. Furthermore, according to a published report in the Washington Post, the Central Intelligence Agency has no up to date accurate report on Iraq's WMD capabilities. 
   Whereas Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on October 31, 1998; 
   Key Issues: Iraqi deceptions always failed. The inspectors always figured out what Iraq was doing. It was the United States that withdrew from the inspections in 1998. And the United States then launched a cruise missile attack against Iraq 48 hours after the inspectors left. In advance of a military strike, the U.S. continues to thwart (the Administration's word) weapons inspections. 
   Whereas in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United States interests and international peace and security, declared Iraq to be in ``material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations'' and urged the President ``to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations'' (Public Law 105-235); 
   Whereas Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations; 
   Key Issues: There is no proof that Iraq represents an imminent or immediate threat to the United States. A ``continuing'' threat does not constitute a sufficient cause for war. The Administration has refused to provide the Congress with credible intelligence that proves that Iraq is a serious threat to the United States and is continuing to possess and develop chemical and biological and nuclear weapons. Furthermore there is no credible intelligence connecting Iraq to Al Qaida and 9/11. 
   Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region, by refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by Iraq from Kuwait; 
   Key Issue: This language is so broad that it would allow the President to order an attack against Iraq even when there is no material threat to the United States. Since this resolution authorizes the use of force for all Iraq related violations of the UN Security Council directives, and since the resolution cites Iraq's imprisonment of non-Iraqi prisoners, this resolution would authorize the President to attack Iraq in order to liberate Kuwaiti citizens who may or may not be in Iraqi prisons, even if Iraq met compliance with all requests to destroy any weapons of mass destruction. Though in 2002 at the Arab Summit, Iraq and Kuwait agreed to bilateral negotiations to work out all claims relating to stolen property and prisoners of war. This use-of-force resolution enables the President to commit U.S. troops to recover Kuwaiti property. 
   Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people; 
   Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council; 
   Key Issue: The Iraqi regime has never attacked nor does it have the capability to attack the United States. The ``no fly'' zone was not the result of a UN Security Council directive. It was illegally imposed by the United States, Great Britain and France and is not specifically sanctioned by any Security Council resolution. 
   Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq; 
   Key Issue: There is no credible intelligence that connects Iraq to the events of 9/11 or to participation in those events by assisting Al Qaida. 
   Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American citizens; 
   Key Issue: Any connection between Iraq support of terrorist groups in Middle East, is an argument for focusing great resources on resolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. It is not sufficient reason for the U.S. to launch a unilateral preemptive strike against Iraq. 
   Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist organizations; 
   Key Issue: There is no connection between Iraq and the events of 9/11. 
   Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so, and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine to justify action by the United States to defend itself; 
   Key Issue: There is no credible evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq has successfully concealed the production of such weapons since 1998, there is no credible evidence that Iraq has the capability to reach the United States with such weapons. In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq had a demonstrated capability of biological and chemical weapons, but did not have the willingness to use them against the United States Armed Forces. Congress has not been provided with any credible information which proves that Iraq has provided international terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. 
   Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain activities that threaten international peace and security, including the development of weapons of mass destruction and refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, repression of its civilian population in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 949; 
   Key Issue: The UN Charter forbids all member nations, including the United States, from unilaterally enforcing UN resolutions. 
   Whereas Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has authorized the President ``to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677''; 
   Key Issue: The UN Charter forbids all member nations, including the United States, from unilaterally enforcing UN resolutions with military force. 
   Whereas in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that it ``supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military Force Against Iraq  Resolution (Public Law 102-1),'' that Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and ``constitutes a continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf region,'' and that Congress, ``supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688''; 
   Key Issue: This clause demonstrates the proper chronology of the international process, and contrasts the current march to war. In 1991, the UN Security Council passed a resolution asking for enforcement of its resolution. Member countries authorized their troops to participate in a UN-led coalition to enforce the UN resolutions. Now the President is asking Congress to authorize a unilateral first strike before the UN Security Council has asked its member states to enforce UN resolutions. 
   Whereas the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105 -338) expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime; 
   Key Issue: This ``Sense of Congress'' resolution was not binding. Furthermore, while Congress supported democratic means of removing Saddam Hussein it clearly did not endorse the use of force contemplated in this resolution, nor did it endorse assassination as a policy. 
   Whereas on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the United States to ``work with the United Nations Security Council to meet our common challenge'' posed by Iraq and to ``work for the necessary resolutions,'' while also making clear that ``the Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be unavoidable''; 
   Whereas the United States is determined to prosecute the war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council resolutions make clear that it is in the national security interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of force if necessary; 
   Key Issue: Unilateral action against Iraq will cost the United States the support of the world community, adversely affecting the war on terrorism. No credible intelligence exists which connects Iraq to the events of 9/11 or to those terrorists who perpetrated 9/11. Under international law, the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order military action to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
   Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding requested by the President to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 or harbored such persons or organizations; 
   Key Issue: The Administration has not provided Congress with any proof that Iraq is in any way connected to the events of 9/11. 
   Whereas the President and Congress are determined to continue to take all appropriate actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or organizations; 
   Key Issue: The Administration has not provided Congress with any proof that Iraq is in any way connected to the events of 9/11. Furthermore, there is no credible evidence that Iraq has harbored those who were responsible for planning, authorizing or committing the attacks of 9/11. 
   Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States, as Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and 
   Key Issue: This resolution was specific to 9/11. It was limited to a response to 9/11. 
   Whereas it is in the national security of the United States to restore international peace and security to the Persian Gulf region; 
   Key Issue: If by the ``national security interests'' of the United States, the Administration means oil, it ought to communicate such to the Congress. A unilateral attack on Iraq by the United States will cause instability and chaos in the region and sow the seeds of future conflicts all other the world. 
   Now, therefore, be it

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the administration now says it wants to talk to Iran. At the same time it is making plans to attack Iran. By saying it wants to talk to Iran and Syria, the administration appears to be reversing course after spending 2 months pumping the media full of anonymously sourced articles reporting to link Iran to the Iraq war. 
   Now it says it wants to talk. Making it appear that it wants to avoid another war. Right. Think about it. Aircraft carriers to the region, mine sweepers to the Persian Gulf, arming neighboring countries with Patriot missiles, ordering an increase in a  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, anticipating an oil embargo. When this administration puts the guns on the table and says let's talk, chances are it is going to shoot first and ask questions later, just like in Iraq. 
   Wake up, Congress. This administration is planning an attack on Iran with or without the permission of this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. In March of 2001, when the Bush administration began to have secret meetings with the oil company executives from Exxon, Shell, and BP, spreading maps of Iraqi oil fields on the desk, the price of oil was $23.96 per barrel, and then there were 63 companies in 30 countries, the U.S. not included, competing for oil contracts with Iraq. Today, the price of oil is $135.59 per barrel; the U.S. Army is occupying Iraq, and the first Iraq oil contracts will go without competitive bidding--surprise--to Exxon, Shell, and BP. 
   Iraq has between 200 billion and 300 billion barrels of oil with a market value in the tens of trillions, and our government is trying to force Iraq not only to privatize its oil but to accept a long-term U.S. military presence to guard the oil and to protect the profits of the oil companies while they charge Americans $4 and $5 a gallon and while our troops continue dying. 
   We found the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We found the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and it is oil. As long as oil companies control our government, Americans will continue to pay, and they will pay with our lives, our fortune, our sacred honor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Four years ago this week, in violation of international law, standing upon a mountain of lies, the United States went to war against the people of Iraq. The U.S. now has a moral responsibility for the deaths of as many as 1 million innocent Iraqis, for the destruction of Iraq and the theft of billions in Iraq oil assets. 
   Those who told lies to take us into war should be held accountable under the U.S. Constitution and at the International Criminal Court. Instead of true accountability on the war, the President and the Vice President could get over $100 billion to keep the war going through the end of their term. More war, more civilian deaths, more soldiers killed or maimed. Less money for housing, for health care, for education, for seniors as we borrow money from Beijing to fight a war in Baghdad. 
   Instead of accountability, the appropriations bill will mandate the privatization of $6 trillion in Iraqi oil assets and provide money which can be used to attack Iran to try to grab another $7 trillion in Iranian oil assets for the oil companies. 
   Support the troops. Stop the war. End the occupation. Support H.R. 1234.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, this is one of those moments where the House gets to demonstrate the degree to which we are truly committed to the unfolding of 14th amendment rights to due process and equal protection of the law. We get a chance to determine that today. I believe that people who happen to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender are entitled to the full and equal protection of employment laws. 
   The principles behind the original draft of ENDA sought to embrace the fullness of a community which has experienced significant undermining of rights in the workplace. None of us can know, unless we have walked in somebody's shoes, but let's imagine for a moment that someone who presents himself or herself as being of another sex or gender, imagine what they must go through in their daily lives. And imagine we who take an oath to defend the Constitution would somehow separate the people from the claims of justice and from the claims of constitutional protection.     
   We all love this country. We all love being Americans. But to be an American means really standing for those constitutional principles and really understanding that life, liberty and pursuit of happiness are something that everyone should have access to and that everyone should have equal protection of the law and due process. 
   I am very concerned, as my Republican colleagues are, that the Baldwin amendment can be offered and pulled back without a vote, because if it was given a vote, I would vote for the Baldwin amendment.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I brought articles of impeachment before this House. The articles have been referred to the Judiciary Committee, and the people of the United States now have a chance to become engaged in a broad discussion about the importance of this action. 
   People ask, why now? Well, recently, the administration asked for millions of dollars to be included in the defense budget to retrofit Stealth B-2 bombers with 30,000-pound bombs that can be used to bomb nuclear research labs in Iran at Natans and Bushir. Think of the humanitarian and ecological disaster that would come from that kind of a bombing. 
   This administration, which took license to go to war based on lies, must be held accountable. And the Vice President must be held accountable for his role in bringing about the war against Iraq and in trying to beat the drums for a war against Iran. 
   As has been pointed out here, we have so many needs here at home. We have people who are losing their homes, losing their pensions, losing their jobs, losing their health care, and we must bring discipline in this House to hold this administration accountable unto the law, so we can begin to focus on a domestic agenda and stop waging aggressive war. 
   Impeach the Vice President.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I want to thank my friend Mr. McDermott for his hard work on this important bill, and I rise in support of the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. 
   The national unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, while the latest unemployment data for my State of Ohio reports a 7.4 percent unemployment rate. These numbers are expected to rise in the coming months. 
   With the loss of an additional 159,000 jobs in September, the American economy is experiencing a ninth consecutive month of job loss. Manufacturing are the hardest hit, with the loss of an additional 51,000 jobs in September and the loss of approximately 442,000 jobs this time a year ago. 
   Furthermore, unemployment is disproportionately affecting African-American men at 11.9 percent unemployment and workers without high school degrees at 9.6 unemployment. The number of workers involuntarily unemployed in a part-time job increased by an additional 300,000 in September. 
   The Unemployment Compensation Extension Act will provide an additional 7 weeks of unemployment benefits to our workers who exhausted their benefits. For States with unemployment rates at or in excess of 6 percent, the bill will ensure an additional 13 weeks of unemployment compensation. 
   Just moments ago, the House of Representatives passed a bill which will give Wall Street $700 billion. The least we can do is help give a little bit more unemployment compensation to American workers.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I rise in opposition to this bill.  
   The public is being led to believe that Congress has reconsidered its position because we have before us a better bill than we had a few days ago. It is the same bill plus hundreds of new pages for hundreds of millions of tax breaks. What does this have to do with the troubles of Wall Street? 
   Driven by fear we are moving quickly to pass a bill, which may produce a temporary uptick for the market but nothing for millions of homeowners whose misfortunes are at the center of our economic woes. People do not have money to pay their mortgages. After this passes, they will still not have money to pay their mortgages. People will still lose their homes while Wall Street is bailed out. 
   The central flaw of this bill is that there are no stronger protections for homeowners and no changes in the language to ensure that the secretary has the authority to compel mortgage servicers to modify the terms of mortgages. And there are no stronger regulatory changes to fix the circumstances that allowed this to happen. 
   We should have created a mechanism for our Government to take a controlling interest in mortgage-backed securities and use our power to work out a new deal for the homeowners. We could have done this. We should have done this. But we didn't. 
   Now millions of Americans will face the threat of foreclosure without any help. And the numbers will soon rise for a number of reasons. Not only because of the Alt-A, jumbo mortgages which will soon be reset at higher interest rates, but because the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is pushing up rates on adjustable mortgages and more than half of the U.S. adjustable mortgage rates are tied to LIBOR. Homeowner defaults will grow in significant numbers. Let's see if Congress will be as quick to help homeowners on Main Street as they were to help speculators on Wall Street. 
   Now the Government will have to borrow $700 billion from banks, with interest, to give banks a $700 billion bailout, and in return the taxpayers get $700 billion in toxic debt. The Senate ``improved'' the bailout by giving tax breaks to people in foreclosure. People in foreclosure need help paying their mortgage, they do not seek tax breaks. 
   Across our Nation, foreclosures continue to devastate our communities, people are losing their jobs, and the prices of necessities are skyrocketing. This legislation, just like the one we defeated last week, will do nothing to solve the problems plaguing American families or help them to get out from underneath the oppressive debt they have been forced to take on. 
   Unfortunately, there has been no discussion of the underlying debt-based economy and the role of our monetary system in facilitating the redistribution of wealth upwards. 
   It is not as though we had no choice but to pass the bill before us. We could have done this differently. We could have demanded language in the legislation that would have empowered the Treasury to compel mortgage servicers to rework the terms of mortgage loans so homeowners could avoid foreclosure. We could have put regulatory structures in place to protect investors. We could have stopped the speculators. 
   This bill represents an utter failure of the democratic process. It represents the triumph of special interest over the triumph of the public interest. It represents the inability of Government to defend the public interest in the face of great pressure from financial interests. We could have recognized the power of Government to prime the pump of the economy to get money flowing through out society by creating jobs, health care, and major investments in green energy. What a lost opportunity! What a moment of transition away from democracy and towards domination of America by global economic interests. 
   Years ago, in a Cleveland neighborhood, I saw a hand-scrawled sign above a cash register in a delicatessen. The sign said: ``In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash.'' The sign above the Speaker's rostrum reads ``In God We Trust,'' but today we are paying the cash to Wall Street. 
   It is not as if we had no other choice but to pass this bill.   
   Foreclosure Victim, 90, Apparently Shoots Self  
   At the age of 90, Addie Polk found herself in foreclosure this week, about to be forced from the home she's lived in for nearly 40 years. 
   So, with a gun in her hand, the Akron widow apparently shot herself in the chest Wednesday afternoon as deputies were knocking on her door with eviction papers in hand. 
   While a nation reels in financial crisis from years of mortgage abuse, Polk is recovering at Akron General Medical Center, awaiting word on where she will live when she's released. 
   Meanwhile, city leaders say Polk has become Akron's ``poster child'' for victims of predatory lenders. 
   ``I think this is a case where we need to step in and help this lady if she is so desperate to shoot herself because she can't pay her mortgage,'' Akron Councilman Marco Sommerville said. 
   Court records show Polk took out a 30-year, 6.375 percent mortgage just four years ago for $45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls. She took out a line of credit that same day for $11,380. 
   Her La Croix Avenue home was appraised by Summit County in 2004 at $31,230. 
   The Countrywide branch did not return a call for comment Thursday. 
   Polk essentially owed the same $45,000 when the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) filed for foreclosure on her home in 2007. Fannie Mae assumed the mortgage from Countrywide. 
   Following foreclosure this year, Polk's six-room, 101-year-old home was bought by Fannie Mae at sheriffs auction for $28,000. 
   Her house now belongs to the lender. 
   Summit County sheriffs deputies say Polk ignored multiple notes and letters leading up to Wednesday's eviction. She also ignored the foreclosure action filed in court. 
   It wasn't until Tuesday that she called the sheriffs office in disbelief. The next day was eviction day. 
   ``I'm positive she believed the deputies were going to come in, clean out the house and set her and her things on the curb, because they did that decades ago. But that's not what happens nowadays,'' sheriffs Lt. Kandy Fatheree said. 
   ``I'm sure she had to be thinking back to the Great Depression when people were set out on the street. She had to be scared to death.'' 
   Deputies Dave Bailey, Jason Beam and Don Fatheree went to the home about 1 p.m. Wednesday to meet with a Fannie Mae representative and escort Polk from the house. They said they had no idea the woman was 90 years old. 
   The deputies' knocks were unanswered, and they were about to leave because the Fannie Mae representative failed to show. Then, they heard a banging noise coming from the home's second floor. 
   Next-door neighbor Robert Dillon heard it, too. More bangs followed. 
   Dillon borrowed a neighbor's ladder and climbed through Polk's second-floor bathroom window and walked into her bedroom. She was lying on her side, a gun next to her on the bed. 
   ``I'm thinking to myself, `Why does Mrs. Polk got a gun?' '' Dillon said. ``After looking around, I touched her shoulder and saw the blood and I said, `Shucks, she done shot herself.' '' 
   Dillon, 62, shouted to the deputies, who alerted Akron EMS. Polk apparently shot herself more than once with a small-caliber handgun, police said. 
   Polk and her late husband, Robert, a Goodrich retiree, moved into the home in 1970. He died in 1995, but Polk continued to live independently, but alone, still driving her late model Chevrolet to the grocery store and church. 
   She appeared to be struggling financially, Dillon said, but he said she never spoke of the foreclosure action looming for more than a year. 
   She had no children of her own and few visitors, he said. 
   ``She didn't need no help. She got around good,'' he said.  
   It is unclear how Polk used the loan money. Dillon said he didn't notice any work being done on the property, and deputies said her front porch was soft from years of neglect. 
   ``Where'd the money go?'' Dillon asked. 
   Sommerville said he is working with the city and the county to assist Polk with housing, once she is released from the hospital. 
   He said the city has been awarded more than $8 million in federal grants in the wake of the mortgage crisis to help cope with the crush. 
   Sommerville said Polk's fate humanizes the problem for the rich and poor. And he urged those facing foreclosure to seek assistance through various local and county agencies. 
   ``It's a sad situation,'' he said. ``She's the poster child for this foreclosure crisis we are facing.''

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, we have come a great distance in 75 years, from the New Deal to the raw deal, from having nothing to fear but fear itself, to being afraid of everything. We have traded democracy's warm heart, containing ideals of faith, fairness and frugality, for the greedy, cold, calculations of the Dow Jones ticker. 
   The New Deal saved free market capitalism with jobs and regulation. Now both sink in the swamp of speculation, manipulation and capitulation. The golden rule of ``Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'' is submerged by the rule of gold: `Do unto others before they do unto you.' 
   Some people will ask of this Congress, what were we thinking? Why did we give a $700 billion bailout to Wall Street without fixing what caused the problem in the first place? Why did we rig free markets for security fraudsters? Why didn't we explore alternatives to let Wall Street solve its own problems? Why didn't we have money to save millions of homeowners, create millions of jobs and a green economy? 
   Why didn't we stop the speculators? Why wasn't there accountability? Why didn't we take time to make an intelligent decision? Why Why Why?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois and Mr. Issa. I rise in strong support of H.R. 6150, the bill that renames the post office at 14500 Lorain Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, as the ``John P. Gallagher Post Office Building.'' I would like to again thank the chairman of the Federal Workforce, Postal Service and District of Columbia Subcommittee and his helpful staff for working with me on this bill. 
   I am proud to have sponsored this bill to honor Mr. Gallagher's lifetime of devotion to public service. Let me share with you the story of this man who was a member of what Tom Brokaw called ``The Greatest Generation.'' 
   This is a quote from an article that was published on June 6, 2004. The subheading was, ``Like dwindling World War II comrades, vet shuns hoopla.'' 
   ``John P. Gallagher is one of the men we honor today. He is a proud veteran, but is also impatient with the embroidery and rhetoric that lingers after the smoke clears and the dead are buried. 
   ``So the man who dodged bombs, bullets and a bad heart was asked whether he's a hero. `No,' he said in his modest room amid medals, patches and other mementos. `You did your job. That's all.' 
   ``He was a combat engineer. He helped clear obstacles at Utah Beach before the infantry came ashore. His service is a virtual core sample of the big moments in the European theater. 
   ``He was in North Africa after General Eisenhower led the Operation Torch Landings, in Sicily briefly, and then in Italy for the Rome-Arno campaign. He was at the little-known place in England called Slapton Sands, where GIs practicing for the invasion of France were surprised and slaughtered by German torpedo boats. Then there was Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes region of Belgium, and a Rhine River crossing.'' 
   For his service in the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, along with the other members of the brigade, he received an exceptional honor during World War II. Charles de Gaulle, then the General Army and Chief of State, Major General of National Defense for France, sent this commendation for John Gallagher's unit: ``For exceptional services of war rendered during the course of the operations for the liberation of France, the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, including all units assigned or attached, which were part of the Assault Force U and which were engaged in the assault on Normandy beaches, this citation is of the order of and confers the Croix de Guerre with Palm, May 25, 1945,'' signed Charles de Gaulle. 
   This was a much-decorated unit, but this was a man who after he finished his service to our country he then went to serve our country in another way, at the city of Cleveland. 
   He was employed by the city of Cleveland for 30 years. He worked his way up to become Superintendent of Sidewalks. Those of you who are familiar with big cities can understand that when a city has thousands of miles of sidewalks, it is very important for those who deliver the mail, as well as people in the neighborhood, to have someone who pays attention to make sure that this infrastructure is kept in shape. That was John Gallagher's job. He served for six mayors of Cleveland, and he did such a good job that when he retired in 1987 he was honored by the city of Cleveland in a special commendation from then-Mayor John Voinovich. 
   Mr. Gallagher is someone whose service to the community went far beyond his work for the city of Cleveland. He was one of the primary advocates for the inclusion of programs for seniors in the city of Cleveland's Gun and Recreation Center. He actually led the charge to create new programs for senior citizens. 
   His home is across the street from a city park where he actually for the neighborhood for years has kept an eye on the park. He has been a lifelong parishioner of St. Vincent DePaul Parish, and he is a fixture each and every week, he has been a fixture until he came into ill health, volunteering as an usher at the 5:30 mass. He is someone who comes from a very strong Irish heritage. His father, who was a Cleveland policeman, was actually born in County Mayo, Ireland, and John lived with his father and took care of him for many years before he passed. John is very involved in the Irish community and is someone who has great respect across the city of Cleveland and throughout Cuyahoga County. 
   When we name post offices, we often name post offices after very famous people, after people who are politicians and are in public service, but we don't often get the opportunity to recognize the work of someone who, a World War II vet who served his country with honor, who continued in public service for many years and who today, like so many members of that greatest generation, just kind of wait their turn to be called to an even higher service. 
   This is a great opportunity for the House of Representatives to show that the kind of people who make up this country, that the kind of people who have served this country and made it the great Nation that it is, deserve recognition. And so for that reason I put forth this bill honoring the life and service of John P. Gallagher through naming this post office after him.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, in furtherance of describing the kind of man that we are honoring here today, when the war was over and people went back about their business, John Gallagher had this idea that he should bring together all of his brothers who served together under these conditions of World War II and to find a way so they could reconnect. And so he was in charge of organizing this group. And for a period of 1963 all of the way through the year 2000, a period of 37 unbroken years, this band of brothers came together year after year after year under John Gallagher's leadership and organization and renewed not just their friendship but their dedication to the cause of service to their Nation. 
   John Gallagher also participated in a very important endeavor where he helped to organize his friends from across the country from the 1st Engineer Special Brigade to raise the funds to erect a monument which was on a German pill box on Normandy Beach in France with contributions from members of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade and under supervision of the brigade commander.     
   And inside the walls were plaques bearing the names of the men of the unit who died in battle. 
   The time comes when this generation will fade into memory. But those individuals who are still alive need to be forever reminded of the great gratitude that this country has for them, not just putting their lives on the line, but the youth of their lives on the line, for showing a continual love of country, for showing love for each other and their fellow soldiers. 
   I am so proud to be here to ask for your support because, in recognizing John Gallagher, we recognize all those who served who still remain with us for serving through their love of country.

   Since 1991, Mr. Russert's piercing assessment of our Nation's political scene graced America's television screens on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' enlightening viewers with tough questions posed to political candidates, elected leaders and influential people of our time. In his relentless search for the truth, Tim Russert served to provide the checks and balances critical to maintaining the integrity of our national freedoms. In every interview, with every question posed, Mr. Russert created an atmosphere of respect, fairness and integrity--an atmosphere in which his ultimate goal as a journalist was sought--discovering the truth. 
   Tim Russert grew up in working-class Buffalo, NY, where the lessons of hard work, faith and family remained at the core of his being. He and three sisters, Betty, Kathleen, and Patricia were raised by their dedicated parents, Tim and Elizabeth (``Betty''). A sanitation worker and truck driver, his father worked two jobs to provide for his four children. He carried the lessons of his parents every day and within every interview. One of the most engaging and effective journalists of our time, his passion and commitment to his profession was  eclipsed only by his devotion to his family and friends. Mr. Russert shared his joy for life with everyone he met, and he treated everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their social standing. Tim Russert never forgot where he came from, and his street-smart common sense, infused with a brilliant mind and kind heart, endeared everyone to him--even his toughest competitors. 
   Madam Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor and remembrance of Mr. Tim Russert, whose professional legacy raised critical and complex societal issues into the clear light of day. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Maureen; to his son, Luke; to his parents and sisters, and to his extended family members and numerous friends. Tim Russert lived his life with passion and joy, and although he will be greatly missed, the love he shared with family and friends will live on forever, and he will be remembered always.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   I think that this House has concurrence, that we share concern about Lebanon. I certainly do, having had the chance, twice in the last 2 years, to not only visit the country, the northern and the southern part, but to meet with all the parties to the disputes. 
   One of the things that I thought was most telling was that there was a concern about working out an agreement without the interference of outside parties, without the interference of Iran or the interference of the United States. There is a feeling of Lebanon-for-Lebanon that exists very strongly in Lebanon. Yet the Lebanese have not had the opportunity to really stand that way. 
   Having gone to Lebanon, as I did right after the war that went past one month in the summer of 2006, and seeing the devastation there, there is no appetite for war on the part of the Lebanese people.     
   The role of Hezbollah is certainly worth looking at. It's also worth considering the depth of support they have among the Lebanese people. 
   We have to be very careful about how we dictate a certain policy in Lebanon for its effect on Lebanon and for its effect on the region. So, therefore, I must reluctantly oppose this resolution, as well intended as it might be, because I'm concerned that it will be seen by some as the United States trying to instigate more civil unrest in Lebanon at the same time that we say that we're supporting the central government. 
   I have met with Prime Minister Siniora. He has been a good friend of the United States. But he had to sit by while the United States either looked the other way or encouraged, depending on whose story you accept, the continued bombing of Lebanon, which actually undermined his government. 
   So we have a condition in Lebanon that really has been going on now for over 25 years, with Lebanon having only tenuous control of their own affairs, with the interference of so many outside governments.  
   We should be doing everything we can to strengthen a process of dialogue in Lebanon. I don't believe that this resolution accomplishes that. I think it accomplishes the opposite. 
   Again, I'm in support of whatever we can do to stabilize Lebanon. I just have my doubts that this resolution will accomplish that. I appreciate the concern of the sponsors. I think we need to have more of a discussion----

   Mr. KUCINICH. I agree with you, and I appreciate your correcting the record in that he wasn't for it, that's for sure. But I'm suggesting to you that the fact that we had someone who was supporting us, and yet we continued as a government, our government did nothing to discourage the continued bombing of Lebanon during that period after the 6 days that Israel thought they basically had accomplished their objectives. 
   I was in southern Lebanon. I saw the devastation. And I talked to people both on the Israeli side and on the Lebanese side, and I see that there was a desire to stop but it continued. We undermined the Siniora government. What I'm suggesting is that it's the United States interference in Lebanon that does not serve the country's purpose of peace well. I don't see our purpose there as being benign, to my good friend, and I say this having talked to all sides. Let Lebanon be for Lebanon. Let the United States and all the other nations of the world provide some support when asked for it, but we have to be very careful about injecting ourselves in a way that we try to determine the outcome for that country. We do not do well when we try to determine the outcome of who should govern another country. It always, in the last few years, has been very difficult for us to do that. 
   I appreciate, though, the dedication that my good friend has to peace in Lebanon. We both agree on the necessity of civility there. We may have differences as to how that would be achieved. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. KUCINICH. I'm maintaining that our government, the United States, has really not been for dialogue so as to try to bring all the parties together. We have pursued a path that has been quite narrow and that, in effect, keeps the conflict going. So I have concerns about that. 
   I would agree that Mr. Siniora is trying to do everything he can, but I also think that he's limited to what he can do because of the parameters that he has to work within in order to keep the confidence of the administration in Washington, DC. And that's my concern. 
   So this resolution, I don't think, really addresses the much deeper need for dialogue within Lebanon by the Lebanese instead of the United States injecting its point of view and its mandate onto Lebanon.

   Mr. KUCINICH. My concern is this: that you had an assistant Secretary of  State for the U.S., David Welch, who went to Lebanon, and he went there to basically make sure that the government took a hard-line position and that it would forestall the possibility of any dialogue. And then one of the clients of the United States, or so-called clients, basically escalated the situation by taking on the issue of disarmament of Hezbollah, which really ought to be done within the parameters of the Lebanese discussion.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Americans are now looking at $4 a gallon for gasoline. Is it going up to $5 a gallon? 
   This is having a severe impact on family budgets. It's kind of a regressive tax on the poor and working people of this country, hitting those hardest who are least able to pay. And low-wage workers who commute are finding an increasingly difficult time being able to survive. It's having a devastating impact on our manufacturing economy. 
   It's time for a new energy policy. It's time for a massive investment by Detroit in fuel efficiency and retooling and hybrids. It's time to end our reliance on oil. It's time to invest in alternative energy, like wind and solar. It's time to stop wars for resources. It's time to stop aggression in the Middle East. It's time to cooperate internationally to protect the environment. It's time to end NAFTA to make environmental quality principles part of our energy policy. It's time to regain control over America's economy and America's future.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, we suffer in our remembrance of 9/11, because of the terrible loss of innocent lives on that grim day. We also suffer because 9/11 was seized as an opportunity to run a political agenda, which has set America on a course of the destruction of another nation and the destruction of our own Constitution. And we have become less secure as a result of the warped practice of pursuing peace through the exercise of pre-emptive military strength. 
   It is not simply 9/11 that needs to be remembered. We also need to remember the politicization of 9/11 and the polarizing narrative which followed, locking us into endless conflict, a war on terror which has wrought further terror worldwide and which has severely damaged our standing worldwide as an honorable, compassionate nation. As we were all victims of 9/11, so we have become victims of the interpretation of 9/11. 
   Our Government's external response to 9/11 was to attack a nation which did not attack us. Indeed on the first anniversary of 9/11, the Bush administration issued a well-publicized stern warning to Iraq which was part of a campaign to induce people to believe Iraq had something to do with 9/11. 
   The deliberate, systematic connection of Iraq with 9/11 has led America into a philosophical and moral cul-de-sac as over 1 million Iraqis and over 4,155 U.S. soldiers have died in a war which will cost over $3 trillion. Additionally, soldiers from 23 other countries have died in the Iraq war. 
   Last year, I voted against a similar resolution to the one before us today because it ignored the reality of the administration's use of 9/11 as a false justification for war. This year, I will vote for the resolution because I have renewed hope that the day will come when September 11 will no longer symbolize the false justification for an unjustified and unprovoked war. 
   Over two dozen nations, facing peril within and without, deeply divided by politics and war, have traveled down a path of restoring civil society through a formal process of reconciliation. At some point within each of those countries it was understood that the way forward is shown through the light of truth. This process is not without pain because it requires a willingness to study evidence to which eyes had been averted and ears had been closed. But in the process of truth and reconciliation, nations found new strength, new resolve, new commitment. 
   The South African Truth and Reconciliation enabled that nation to come to grips with its past through a public confessional, bringing forward those who committed crimes and having the power to grant amnesty for full disclosure of crimes against the people. Of course, our path may necessarily be different: High U.S. government officials stand accused in impeachment petitions of violating national and international law. Our continued existence as a democracy may depend upon how thoroughly we seek the truth. I will call upon the American people to join me in supporting this effort. 
   The truth can move us forward, as a unified whole, so that we can one day become a re-United States. 9/11 is the day the world changed. It is the day America embraced a metaphor of war. If we are open to truth and reconciliation, we may one day be able, once again, to embrace peace.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, there is an issue of critical importance facing this Congress, and that issue relates to whether or not this Congress should pass legislation to continue to fund the war in Iraq. 
   The legislation contains a particular provision that would lead to the privatization of Iraq's oil, a provision that I'm quite concerned about, because I think that if we take that position, it will make it very difficult for us to ever be able to end the war. 
   So today I'm going to lay out the case as to why this provision that's in the bill would advance privatization and as to what the options are for this Congress. 
   As many know, the administration has set forth several benchmarks for the Iraqi Government, including the passage of a hydrocarbon law by the Iraqi Parliament. The administration has emphasized only a small part of this law, what they call the ``fair distribution,'' that's in quotes, of oil revenues. 
   I want this House to consider the fact that this Iraqi hydrocarbon law contains a mere three sentences that generally discusses the so-called fair distribution of oil. Except for three scant lines, the entire 33-page hydrocarbon law is about creating a complex legal structure to facilitate the privatization of Iraqi oil. As such, it is imperative that Members of Congress read the Iraqi Parliament's bill, because passage of any legislation that includes insisting that the Iraq Government push the passage of a hydrocarbon act puts this Congress on record to promote privatizing Iraq's oil. 
   Now, I have maintained from the beginning that the war has been about oil. We must not be a party to any attempt to set the stage for multinational oil companies to take over Iraq's oil resources. 
   There have been several benchmarks set by the administration for the Iraqi Government, including passage of a so-called hydrocarbon law by the Iraqi Parliament. Many inside the Beltway are contemplating linking funding for the war in Iraq to the completion of these benchmarks, including passage of the hydrocarbon law by the Parliament. 
   This administration has led Congress into thinking that this bill is about fair distribution of oil revenues. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, except for three scant lines, the entire 33-page hydrocarbon law creates a structure to facilitate the privatization of Iraq oil. 
   Now, the war in Iraq is a stain on American history. Let us not further besmirch our Nation by participating in an outrageous exploitation of a nation which is in shambles due to the U.S. intervention. 
   Let me provide this House with an analysis of the underlying bill in the Iraqi Legislature, which this administration is trying to get Congress to pass to pressure the Iraqi Government to accept privatization. And this analysis that I'm offering at this moment is a version that passed the Iraqi Cabinet and was referred to the Iraqi Parliament. 
   The legislation contains only three sentences in regards to the fair distribution of oil, but does not resolve any of the issues facing this challenge. The legislation simply requires that future legislation be submitted for approval; thus this legislation does not even meet the benchmark of the administration. 
   The legislation ensures that ``chief executives of important related petroleum companies,'' follow that now, ``chief executives of important related petroleum companies'' are represented on a Federal Oil and Gas Council, which approves oil and gas contracts. This is akin to foreign oil companies approving their own contracts. 
   This legislation ensures that the Iraqi National Oil Company, which is the oil company of the people of Iraq,  has no exclusive rights for the exploration, development, production, transportation and marketing. The Iraq National Oil Company must compete against foreign oil companies with rules that benefit the foreign oil companies. This is for their own oil. 
   The legislation gives the Iraqi National Oil Company some control of developed oil fields and rights to participate in undeveloped oil fields in the Annex I and II of the legislation, but these annexes have never been made public, so we don't know for sure. 
   The legislation gives the Iraq National Oil Company temporary control of the oil pipelines and export terminals, but then it directs the Federal Oil and Gas Council, which is run by chief executives of oil companies, it directs them to turn these assets over to any entity with no further instructions. The opportunity for a foreign oil company to have control over the Iraqi oil pipeline and export terminals would give that company enormous control of the Iraqi oil market. 
   The legislation demands that contracts, and this is a quote, ``must guarantee the best level of coordination'' with the Oil Ministry, Iraqi National Oil Company, the regions and oil companies. The legislation mandates that undeveloped oil fields be developed quickly, and oil companies are given explicit authority to collaborate. 
   The legislation does not require contracts to be published for public review for up to 2 months after approval. The legislation provides for up to 35 years of exclusive control over oil fields for foreign oil companies. The legislation provides for a preference to Iraqis for jobs and services, but only if these benefits do not place extra costs or inconveniences on the foreign oil companies. The legislation states that disputes between the State of Iraq and any foreign investors shall be submitted for arbitration to an international court and will not be decided upon by an Iraqi court. 
   This legislation has four appendices whose contents remain secret. Annex I, which is secret, regards to present producing fields allocated to the Iraqi National Oil Company; Annex II, discovered or undeveloped fields allocated to the National Iraqi Oil Company; Annex III, discovered undeveloped fields outside the operations of the Iraqi National Oil Company; and Annex IV, exploration areas. These appendices will effectively make clear which old fields will be controlled by the Iraq National Oil Company and which are open to foreign control of oil companies. 
   And I might add that when you look at this, out of about 98 oil fields, Iraq will have control of approximately 80, 81 of those oil fields. Excuse me. The foreign oil companies will have control of about 80, 81 of those oil fields, or over 80 percent of Iraqi oil under this agreement will be controlled by foreign oil interests. This is an analysis that I'm offering based on facts that are ascertainable. 
   Now, what are others saying about this draft Iraqi oil law and what it will do? Here's a quote from the Christian Science Monitor of May 18, 2007, in an article entitled ``How Will Iraq Share the Oil?'' In the U.S., the demand that Iraq pass an oil law is a benchmark that is becoming a flash point. Here's the quote.     
   `` `The actual law has nothing to do with sharing oil revenue,' says former Iraqi Oil Minister, Issam Al Chalabi, in a phone interview from Amman, Jordan. The law aims to set a framework for investment by outside oil companies, including favorable production sharing agreements that are typically used to reward companies for taking on risk, he says. 
   `` `We know the oil is there. Geological studies have been made for decades on these oil fields; so why would we let them,' '' that is, the international oil companies, `` `have a share of the oil?' he adds. `Iraqis will say this is solid proof that Americans have staged the war ..... because of this law.' '' 
   The next quote comes from the Dow Jones Newswires of March 4, 2007, the headline: ``Iraq Oil Law Details Untouched Fields, Blocks--Document.'' And the text says: 
   ``Iraq's draft hydrocarbon law, the centerpiece in the development of the country's shaky oil industry, details dozens of untouched oil fields loaded with proven reserves and scores of exploration blocks that may prove a magnet to international oil companies, according to a document seen by Dow Jones Newswires.'' 
   In an article from the Dow Jones Newswires again, on March 10, 2007, the headline: ``Some Iraqi Politicians Urge Rejection of Draft Oil Law.'' Here's the text: 
   ``The law, if passed, is expected to open the country's billions of barrels of proven oil reserves, the world's third largest, to foreign investors.'' 
   From an article from the American Lawyer, April 25, 2007, ``Our Man in Iraq.'' Here is the text: 
   ``Under the new law, the Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control of only about 17 of Iraq's approximately 80 known oil fields.'' So that number, then, is 17 of Iraq's approximately 80 known oil fields. ``The law would also allow the government to negotiate different kinds of exploration and production contracts with foreign oil companies, including production sharing agreements, or PSAs. Energy lawyers favor these because they allow oil companies to secure long-term deals and book oil reserves as assets on their company balance sheets. Under the proposed law, foreign companies would not have to invest their earnings in Iraq, hire Iraqi workers, or partner with Iraqi companies.'' 
   Next, from the U.S. Morning Star Online, January 28, 2007, headline: ``Iraqi Officials Insist Oil Law Won't Favor U.S.'' 
   ``The proposal would provide for production sharing agreements that would give international firms 70 percent of the oil revenues to recover their initial investments and subsequently allow 20 percent of the profits without any tax or restrictions on transferring the funds abroad.'' 
   This from CommonDreams.org, April 18, 2007, entitled ``Time to Do the Math in Iraq'': 
   ``The most notable feature of the law is a revival of exploitive type of contact widely used prior to the rise of Arab nationalism in the 1960s, known as a production sharing agreement. Although the Oil Law uses an alternative term, `exploration and production contract,' the effect is identical. The new arrangement would allow the bulk of Iraq's reserves to be controlled by outside oil companies, privatizing what until now has been a nationalized resource under the auspices of the Iraq National Oil Company. It specifies the royalty that will be paid to Iraq: `12.5 percent of gross production, measured at the entry flange to the main pipeline.' And as if the rest of the law were not already explicit enough, article 35(A) reiterates: `Holders of exploration and production rights may transfer any net profits from petroleum operations to outside Iraq after paying taxes and fees owed.' '' 
   This, from a publication called PLATFORM in 2005, entitled ``Crude Designs: The Rip-Off of Iraq's Oil Wealth,'' by Greg Muttitt: 
   ``At an oil price of $40 per barrel,'' and keep in mind that the price of oil is about $65 a barrel right now, heading towards $70 a barrel, but at a ``price of $40 a barrel, Iraq stands to lose between $74 billion and $194 billion over the lifetime of the proposed contracts. 
   ``Under the likely terms of the contracts, oil company rates of returns from investing in Iraq would range from 42 to 162 percent, far in excess of the usual industry minimum target of around 12 percent return on investments.'' 
   Next, on March 13, 2007, Antonia Juhasz, an oil industry analyst in an op-ed contribution, asks: ``Whose Oil is it, Anyway?'' Here is what Antonia Juhasz writes: 
   ``Today more than three-quarters of the world's oil is owned and controlled by governments. It wasn't always this way. Until about 35 years ago, the world's oil was largely in the hands of seven corporations based in the United States and Europe. Those seven have since merged into four: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP. They are among the world's largest and most powerful financial empires. But ever since they lost their exclusive control of the oil to the governments, the companies have been trying to get it back. Iraq's oil reserves, thought to be the second largest in the world, have always been high on the corporate wish list. In 1998 Kenneth Derr, then chief  executive of Chevron, told a San Francisco audience, `Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas, reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to.' 
   ``A new oil law set to go before the Iraqi Parliament this month would, if passed, go a long way toward helping the oil companies achieve their goal. The Iraq hydrocarbon law would take the majority of Iraq's oil out of the exclusive hands of the Iraqi Government and open it to international oil companies for a generation or more. 
   ``In March, 2001,'' continuing to quote from this article, ``the National Energy Policy Development Group, better known as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which included executives of America's largest energy companies, recommended that the United States Government support initiatives by Middle Eastern countries `to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment.' One invasion and a great deal of political engineering .....'' later, this is exactly what the Iraq oil law would achieve. It does so to the benefit of oil companies but to the great detriment of Iraq's economy, democracy, and sovereignty. 
   ``Since the invasion of Iraq, the administration has been aggressive in shepherding the oil law toward passage. It is one of the administration's benchmarks for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a fact that'' the administration officials ``are publicly emphasizing with increasing urgency.'' And, that is that these are the benchmarks of the administration. 
   ``The administration has highlighted the law's revenue sharing plan, under which the central government would distribute oil revenues throughout the nation on a per capita basis. But the benefits of this excellent proposal are radically undercut by the law's many other provisions. These allow much, if not most, of Iraq's oil revenues to flow out of the country and into the pockets of international oil companies.'' 
   Continuing quoting from the article: 
   ``The law would transform Iraq's oil industry from a nationalized model closed to American oil companies, except for limited although highly lucrative marketing contracts, into a commercial industry.'' 
   So, again, the nationalized model is now closed to American companies except for limited marketing contracts. It would transform that into a commercial industry, all but privatized, that is fully open to international companies. 
   ``The Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control of 17 of Iraq's 80 known oil fields, leaving two-thirds of known and as of yet undiscovered oil fields open to foreign control. 
   ``The foreign companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies, hire Iraqi workers, or share new technologies. They could even ride out Iraq's current `instability' by signing contracts now, while the Iraqi Government is at its weakest, and then wait at least 2 years before even setting foot in the country. The vast majority of Iraq's oil would then be left underground for at least 2 years rather than being used for the country's economic development. 
   ``The international oil companies could also be offered some of the most corporate-friendly contracts in the world, including what are called production sharing agreements. These agreements are the oil industry's preferred model but are roundly rejected by all the top oil producing countries in the Middle East because they grant long-term contracts, 20 to 35 years in the case of Iraq's draft law, and greater control, ownership, and profits to the companies than other models. In fact,'' this kind of contract is ``used for only approximately 12 percent of the world's oil. 
   ``Iraq's neighbors Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia maintain nationalized oil systems and have outlawed foreign control over oil development. They all hire international oil companies as contractors to provide specific services, as needed, for a limited duration and without giving the foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced. 
   ``Iraqis may very well choose to use the expertise and experience of international oil companies. They are most likely to do so in a manner that best serves their needs if they are freed from the tremendous external pressure being exercised by the administration, the oil corporations, and the presence of 140,000 members of the American military. 
   ``Iraq's five trade union federations, representing hundreds of thousands of workers, released a statement opposing the law and rejecting `the handing of control over oil to foreign companies, which would undermine the sovereignty of the state and the dignity of the Iraqi people.' They ask for more time, less pressure, and a chance at the democracy they have been promised.'' 
   Let me share with this House some basic facts about Iraqi oil because, over the past several months, we have had many different news agencies citing diverse reports about how much oil Iraq has. 
   From the Petroleum Economist Magazine, they estimate that Iraq has 200 billion barrels of oil. The Federation of American Scientists' estimate is 215 billion barrels of oil. The Council on Foreign Relations estimates Iraq has 220 billion barrels of oil. And the Center for Global Energy Studies estimates 300 billion barrels of oil. These figures, by the way, from a report from the Brookings Institution dated May 12, 2003. 
   Now, for the sake of discussion, let's take this figure of 300 billion barrels of oil so we can see how much money we are talking about here. As I mentioned earlier, the price of oil, somewhere around $65 a barrel right now and moving up quickly, as American consumers are finding out. It is not unusual to predict at this moment that the price of oil could go to $70 a barrel. Now, if it does go to $70 a barrel, we are looking here at a potential value of Iraqi oil at being about $21 trillion. Now, if the foreign oil companies have control over 80 percent or more, you start to get an idea of the kind of money that is at stake here and why there is such pressure being put on the Iraqi Government to privatize their oil. 
   Now, I would like to turn to a quote further talking about the Iraq oil, a basic fact. This from the Global Policy Forum called ``Oil in Iraq: the Heart of the Crisis,'' December, 2002: 
   ``According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Western oil companies estimate that they can produce a barrel of Iraqi oil for less than a $1.50 and possibly as little as $1, including all exploration, oil field development and production costs and including a 15 percent return.     
   This is similar to production costs in Saudi Arabia, and lower than virtually any country. So again, the desirability of a private corporation having Iraq's oil is that their production costs would be very low. 
   A word about the history of oil exploitation in Iraq. Following World War I, the British assumed control of Iraq from the Ottoman Empire. In 1925, a 75-year concession contract was granted to American, French and British oil companies. By 1930, the consortium was in complete control of all Iraqi oil. The oil companies controlled the oil fields and reaped almost all the profits. It was not until the overthrow of the British-installed monarchy in 1958 that the foreign control of oil was challenged. In 1961, the consortium's rights were limited to current production. And beginning in 1972, Iraq oil resources were nationalized, a process that was finalized in 1975. 
   Now, here is a statement issued by the Iraqi Labor Union Leadership at a seminar held in December of 2006 to discuss this draft Iraqi oil law: ``Iraq is rich in national wealth, foremost among which is its oil wealth, the essence of the economic life for Iraq and the world, which has been a focus of attention of the large, industrialized countries in particular. 
   ``The British and American oil companies were the first to obtain concessions to extract and invest in Iraqi oil nearly 80 years ago. After Iraq got rid of this octopus network, these foreign oil companies had again attempted to dominate this important oil wealth under numerous pretexts and invalid excuses.'' 
   Indeed, Iraqi oil unions have objected to the Hydrocarbon Act. In an open letter to the U.S. Congress dated May 13, 2007, just a little more than a week ago, here are some excerpts: 
   ``Peace be unto you and greetings to all. 
   ``We wish to clarify certain matters relating to events in Iraq for our  friends among the Members of the U.S. Congress. It is common knowledge that the occupation spared neither the young nor the old, and that Iraq is passing through the most difficult of times because all and sundry are hounding it and covet a share of its riches. We see no good reason for linking the passing of the feeble Iraq oil law to the withdrawal of the occupation troops from Iraq. 
   ``Everyone knows that the oil law does not serve the Iraqi people, and that it serves the administration, its supporters and the foreign oil companies at the expense of the Iraqi people, who have been wronged and deprived of their right to their oil, despite enduring all difficulties. 
   ``We ask our friends not to link withdrawal with the oil law, especially since the USA claimed that it came to Iraq as a liberator and not in order to control Iraq's resources. 
   ``The general public in Iraq is totally convinced that the administration wants to rush the promulgation of the oil law so as to be leaving Iraq with a victory of sorts. 
   ``We wish to see you take a true stance for the children of Iraq. And we always say that history will remember those who advance peace over war. 
   ``With my regards, Hassan Jum'a Awwad, Head of the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions.'' 
   This now from the Oil union leader's speech on oil law. This is a speech of the head of the Federation of Oil Unions in Basra on Tuesday, February 6, 2007: 
   ``Recently, the Constitution of Iraq, on which the Iraq people voted in the most dire and difficult of conditions, notes in clause 111 that oil and gas are the property of the Iraqi people. But, alas, this clause in the Constitution will remain but ink on paper if the oil law and oil investment law being presented to the Parliament are ratified, laws which permit production-sharing agreements, laws without parallel in many oil producers, especially the neighboring countries. Why should Iraqis want to introduce such contracts in Iraq, given that applying such laws will rob the Iraqi Government of the most important thing it owns?'' 
   ``We send a message to all of the members of the Iraqi Parliament, when debating the oil and investment law, to bear the Iraqis in mind, to protect the national wealth, and to look at the neighboring countries. Have they introduced such laws even when their relations with foreign companies are closer than in Iraq?'' 
   Now, there is a question that's being raised. Are these oil companies just trying to help Iraq gain its wealth? What if Iraq doesn't have the ability or the money to be able to get its own oil industry on its feet? Does Iraq have to privatize in order to tap its oil wealth? Well, the fact of the matter is that Iraq has options beyond privatization to develop its own oil capacity. 
   According to the Middle East Economic Survey, volume 49, number 2, dated March 19, 2007, entitled ``Iraq Open Letter from Iraqi Oil Experts to Parliament'': 
   ``We anticipate that the motive behind the issuance of this law is based on the increase of production capacity through the attraction of foreign investments. In this regard, we feel and recommend to plan the increase of the capacity gradually, starting with the rehabilitation of currently producing fields by national effort, Iraqi National Oil Company, followed by the development of the giant discovered, but not developed or partially developed, fields, and to schedule the priority of their development according to their capacities and development costs, irrespective of their geographical locations.'' And it goes on to say that there ought to be an avoidance of long-term contracts with foreign companies at the present time. 
   This is a statement issued by the Iraqi Union Leadership in a seminar. And another statement in a seminar in December 2006 in Amman, Jordan: 
   ``Whereas oil and gas are greatly important for the Iraqi economy and whereas the building of the state and its institutions are dependent on it as the main source of national income, it is therefore the right of the Iraqi people to read the draft oil law under consideration. The Iraqi people refuse to allow the future of their oil to be decided behind closed doors.'' 
   In an article by Michael Schwartz called ``The Prize of Iraqi Oil,'' ``None of these conditions apply in Iraq. Huge reservoirs of easily accessible oil are already proven to exist, with more equally accessible fields likely to be discovered at little expense. That's why none of Iraq's neighbors emphasize production-sharing agreements. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and the United Arab Emirates all pay the multinationals a fixed rate to explore and develop their fields, and all the profits become state revenues.'' 
   Christian Science Monitor, May 18, 2007: ``How Will Iraq Share the Oil?'' ``In New York, oil industry analyst, Fidel Geit of Oppenheimer Company, Incorporated, has reviewed both the official Arabic version of the draft law and the unofficial English translation and say they are ambiguous and seem to be written in haste.'' Quote, ``Why shouldn't Iraq use Iraqi nationals to decide how contracts will be awarded? They have oil engineers. Use the best brains in the country and hopefully they will do what is in the best interest of the country,'' he says, ``otherwise there is an impression that American companies are telling Iraqis what to do.'' 
   Now, I have stated many times on this floor that I believe that the war against Iraq was about oil. Now let me provide you with some quotes that may reflect on my thinking on this. 
   Mr. Dick Cheney, CEO of Halliburton, in a speech at the Institute of Petroleum in 1999, said, ``By 2010, we will need on the order of an additional 50 million barrels a day. So where is the oil going to come from? Governments and national oil companies are obviously controlling about 90 percent of the assets. Oil remains fundamentally a government business. While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East, with two-thirds of the world's oil and lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies. Even though companies are anxious for greater access there, progress continues to be slow.'' 
   In an article from Platform, November 2005, called ``Crude Designs: The Rip-Off of Iraq's Oil Wealth.'' Chapter four, ``Planning Iraq's Oil Future. Preinvasion Planning.'' And when you listen to this, it's pretty astonishing to see how all these facts have been available for people to be able to gain, and perhaps only now people are reflecting on the real meaning of this. 
   This is what Greg Muttitt writes: ``Prior to the 2003 invasion, the principal vehicle for planning the new postwar Iraq was the U.S. State Department's Future of Iraq project. This initiative, commencing as early as April 2002, involved meetings in Washington and London of 17 working groups, each composed of 10 to 20 Iraqi exiles and international experts selected by the State Department. 
   ``The `Oil and Energy' working group met four times between December 2002 and April 2003. Although full membership of the group has never been revealed, it is known that Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, the current Iraqi Oil Minister, was a member. The 15-strong oil working group concluded that Iraq, quote, `should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war,' and that, quote, `the country should establish a conducive business environment to attract investment of oil and gas resources.' 
   ``The subgroup went on to recommend production-sharing agreements as their favorite model for attracting foreign investment. Comments by the hand-picked participants revealed that `many of the group favored production-sharing agreements with oil companies.' Another representative commented, `Everybody keeps coming back to production-sharing agreements.' 
   ``The reasons for this choice were explained in the formal policy recommendations of the working group, published in April 2003,'' and I quote from this article from Platform: 
   ``Key attractions of production-sharing agreements to private oil companies are that, although the reserves are owned by the state, accounting procedures permit the companies to book the reserves in their accounts, but, other things being equal, the important feature from the perspective of private oil companies is that the government intake is defined in terms of the production-sharing agreement, and the oil companies are therefore protected under a production-sharing agreement from future adverse legislation,'' which means it would be very  tough to be able to have a government, once it gives up its oil wealth, to be able to get it back. 
   ``The group also made it clear that in order to maximize investments, the specific terms of the production-sharing agreements should be favorable to foreign investors: `PSAs can induce many billions of dollars of direct foreign investment in Iraq, but only with the right terms, conditions, regulatory framework laws, oil industry structure and perceived attitude toward foreign participation.' 
   ``Recognizing the importance of this announcement, The Financial Times noted: `Production-sharing deals allow oil companies a favorable profit margin and, unlike royalty schemes, insulates them from losses incurred when the oil price drops. For years, big oil companies have been fighting for such agreements without success in countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.' 
   ``The article concluded that: `The move could spell a windfall for big oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf.' '' 
   Now, this article goes on to talk about what has been done to try to shape the new Iraq with respect to oil. 
   ``The U.S. and the U.K. have worked hard to ensure that the future path for oil development chosen by the first elected Iraqi Government will closely match their interests. So far it appears they have been highly successful. Production-sharing agreements, which were first proposed by the U.S. State Department group, have emerged as the model of oil development favored by the postinvasion phases of Iraqi Government. 
   ``Phase one: Coalition Provisional Authority and Iraqi Governing Council. During the first 14 months following the invasion, occupation forces had direct control of Iraq through the Coalition Provisional Authority. Stopping short of privatizing oil itself, this Coalition Provisional Authority began setting up a framework for a longer-term oil policy. 
   ``The Coalition Provisional Authority appointed former senior executives from oil companies to begin this process. The first advisers were appointed in January 2003, before the invasion even started, and they were stationed in Kuwait, ready to move in. First, there were Phillip Carroll, formerly of Shell, and Gary Vogler of ExxonMobil, backed up by three employees of the U.S. Department of Energy and one of the Australian Government. Carroll described his role as not only to address short-term fuel needs and the initial repair of production facilities, but also,'' point, `` `begin planning for the restructuring of the Ministry of Oil to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.' '' Another point: `` `Begin thinking through Iraq's strategy options for significantly increasing its production capacity.' 
   ``In October 2003, Carroll and Vogler were replaced by Mob McKee of ConocoPhillips and Terry Adams of BP, and finally in 2004, by Mike Stinson of ConocoPhillips and Bob Morgan of BP. The 147,000 pound cost of two British advisers, Adams and Morgan, was met by the U.K. Government. Following the handover to the Iraq Interim Government in June 2004, Stinson became an adviser to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.'' 
   Again, from Platform, On the 13th of July, 2003, ``In the first move towards Iraqi self-government, the Coalition Provisional Authority's Administrator Paul Bremer appointed the quasi-autonomous, but virtually powerless, Iraqi Governing Council. On the same day Mr. Bremer appointed Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, who had been a member of the U.S. State Department oil working group, as Minister for Oil.''     
   Within months of his appointment, Bahr al-Uloum announced he was preparing plans for the privatization of Iraq's oil sector, but that no decision would be taken until after the election scheduled for 2005. Speaking to the Financial Times, Bahr al-Uloum, a U.S.-trained petroleum engineer, said the Iraqi oil sector needs privatization, but it is a cultural issue, noting the difficulty of persuading the Iraqi people of any such policy. He then proceeded to announce that he personally supported production sharing agreements for upstream development, giving priority to U.S. oil companies and European companies, probably. 
   The second phase, the Iraq interim government. In June 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority handed over Iraq's sovereignty to an interim government headed by Prime Minister Allawi. The position of Minister of Oil, was handed to Thamir al-Ghadban, a U.K.-trained petroleum engineer and former senior adviser to Bahr al-Uloum. In an interview in Shell Oil Company's in-house magazine, al-Ghadban announced that 2005 would be the ``year of dialogue'' with multinational oil companies. 
   ``About 3 months after taking power, Allawi issued a set of guidelines to the Supreme Council for Oil Policy from which the Council was to develop a full petroleum policy. Preempting both the Iraqi elections and drafting of a new constitution, Allawi's guidelines specified that while Iraq's currently producing fields should be developed by the Iraq National Oil Company, all other fields should be developed by private companies, through the contractual mechanism of production sharing agreements. 
   ``Iraq has about 80 known oil fields, only 17 of which are currently in production. Thus the Allawi guidelines would grant the other 63 to private oil companies.'' 
   The third phase, the transitional government and writing the constitution: ``The interim government was replaced in 2005 by the election of Iraq's new National Assembly, which led to the formation of the new government with Ibrahim al-Ja'afari as Prime Minister. In a move which no doubt assisted policy continuity from the period of U.S. control, Ibrihim Bahr al-Uloum was reappointed to the position of Minister for Oil. 
   ``Meanwhile, Ahmad Chalabi, the Pentagon's former favorite to run Iraq, was appointed chair of the Energy Council, which replaced the Supreme Council for Oil Policy as the key overseer of energy and oil policy. Back in 2002, Chalabi had famously promised that `U.S. companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil.' 
   ``By June 2005, government sources reported that a Petroleum Law had been drafted, ready to be enacted after the December elections. According to sources, although some details are still being debated, the draft of the Law specifies that while Iraq's currently producing fields should be developed by Iraqi National Oil Company, new fields should be developed by private companies.'' 
   Now, this again comes from an article, Foreign Policy in Focus. The title, ``When It Comes to Oil, the U.S. Administration is Bypassing Democracy in Iraq,'' an article ``Oil Pressure'' by Greg Muttitt, August 28, 2006. It goes on to say: Since the new Iraqi Government was formed in 2006, the U.S. Government has dramatically scaled up its efforts to provide ``advice.'' Last month, the administration and major oil companies reviewed and commented on the new law governing Iraq's crucial oil sector before it had even been seen by the Iraqi Parliament. 
   ``Violating the very notions of freedom and democracy'' the administration invokes in nearly every speech, ``the U.S. Government has actively intervened in the restructuring of Iraq's oil industry since at least 2002. 
   In December 2002, the State Department established a working group on oil and energy as part of its ``Future of Iraq'' project. The project brought together influential exiled Iraqis with U.S. Government officials and international consultants. Later, some members of the group became part of the Iraqi Government. The result of the project's work was a draft framework for Iraq's oil policy. Despite Iraq being rich in oil and technical expertise, the group recommended a major role for foreign companies through long-term contracts, an approach that would set Iraq at odds with the rest of the Middle East where major oil producers keep their oil in the public sector. 
   ``In March 2003, the wheels started to turn as the Coalition Provisional Authority appointed the former head of Shell USA as a senior oil adviser, in direct contact with the Iraq Ministry of Oil. He was joined by an executive from ExxonMobil, and after 6 months, the post was rotated to former managers of ConocoPhillips and BP. 
   ``In December 2003, the framework was set out in more detail when USAID commissioned a report by the privatization specialists BearingPoint,'' is  the name of the company, entitled `Options for Developing a Sustainable Long-Term Iraqi Oil Industry.' The report reinforced the `Future of Iraq's' report, recommending long-term contracts with foreign companies. 
   ``Pointing to the success, as they call it, of this model, BearingPoint used Azerbaijan's privatization model as an example. The report commented approvingly that Azerbaijan's high corruption and lack of democracy had not impeded investment; the government had simply given away a higher share of revenues in order to attract companies. The implication was that Iraq, which has a nascent democracy and chronic corruption, might follow the same approach. 
   ``After the handover to the interim government in June 2004, senior oil advisers, now based within the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office in the U.S. Embassy worked closely with the Iraq Oil Ministry in shaping policy. Post holders included executives from ChevronTexaco and Unocal. 
   ``In 2006, these efforts intensified. In February, the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office advisers accompanied eight senior officials from the Oil Ministry on a trip to the U.S., sponsored by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. On the trip, they met oil company 
   representatives to discuss the future structure of the Iraq oil industry. 
   ``The same month, at the request of the State Department, USAID provided an adviser to the Oil Ministry, again from BearingPoint,'' the privatization specialist, ``to work directly on a new oil law providing `legal and regulatory advice and drafting the framework of petroleum and other energy-related legislation, including foreign investment.' '' 
   ``The U.S. campaign on the fledgling Iraqi Government has been successful. Following his appointment in May, new Oil Minister Husayn al-Shahristani announced that one of his top priorities would be writing of an oil law to allow Iraq to sign contracts with `the largest companies.' '' 
   ``This would be the first time in more than 30 years that foreign companies would receive a major stake in Iraq's oil. Oil was brought into public ownership and control in Iraq in 1975. 
   ``With the ink not yet on the paper, the U.S. has maintained its pressure. On his visit to Baghdad in 2006,'' the U.S. Energy Secretary ``insisted that the Iraqi government must `pass a hydrocarbon law under which foreign companies can invest.' But the work to make this case had already been done: `We got every indication they were willing and also felt a necessity to open up this sector,' he commented after a meeting with the Oil Minister and Iraqi officials. 
   The Energy Secretary did not stop at reviewing the draft law himself in Baghdad. He also arranged for Dr. Al-Shahristani, the new Oil Minister, to meet with nine major oil companies, including Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips, for them to comment on the draft as well, during the Minister's trip to Washington, D.C. the following week. 
   ``Given the pressures involved, perhaps the Minister felt he did not have much choice. His promise to pass the law through Parliament by the end of 2006 was set in Iraq's agreement with the International Monetary Fund last December. According to that agreement, IMF officials would also review and comment on a draft in September. 
   ``And still, the draft law had not been seen by the Iraqi Parliament. Meanwhile, an official from the Oil Ministry had stated that Iraqi civil society and the general public will not be consulted at all. 
   ``These issues could hardly be more important for Iraq. Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of government revenue, is the main driver of Iraq's economy. And decisions made in the coming months will not be reversible--once contracts are signed, they will have a major bearing on Iraq's economy and politics for decades to come.'' 
   There is much that has been written, an article in the Associated Press on March 13, 2007, about how Iraqi leaders fear ouster over oil money. Continued White House support for Iraq depended on positive action and all the benchmarks, especially the oil law and sectarian reconciliation, by the close of this parliamentary session. June 30. 
   In an article in the Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2007, Iraqis resist U.S. pressure to enact oil law. Foreign investment and Shiite control are primary concerns. Here is a quote. ``I did make it clear that we believe it is very important to move on the issues before us in a timely fashion and any undue delay would be difficult to explain.'' That is a quote from Vice President Cheney, who recently visited Iraq to urge the passage of the Hydrocarbon Act, among other matters. 
   ``The U.S. Energy Secretary calls on Iraq to open up its oil sector to foreign investment.'' This is an article from the 21st of July, 2006, saying that U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman has urged Iraq to establish a legal framework that would be instrumental in attracting foreign investment. 
   Other articles. From a Department of Energy press release, July 26, 2006: Secretary Bodman hosts Iraqi Ministers of Oil and Electricity. Energy leaders sign memorandum of understanding to further promote electricity cooperation. 
   From Agence France-Presse, U.S. wants new Iraq oil law so foreign firms can take part. July 18, 2006. The United States on Tuesday urged Iraq to adopt a new hydrocarbon law that would enable U.S. and other foreign companies to invest in the war-torn country's oil sector. 
   We all know that the Iraq Study Group, in one of its major recommendations, Recommendation 63, said the United States should encourage investment in Iraq's oil sector by the international community and international energy companies; that the United States should assist Iraqi leaders to reorganize the national oil industry as a commercial enterprise; that the United States should ensure the World Bank's efforts to assure that best practices are used in contracting. 
   Mr. Speaker, the last 50 minutes that I have spent talking about the effort to try to privatize Iraq's oil, if you go to one of the search engines, you can find perhaps 1 million different citations relating to this. So it is impossible to cover this kind of a subject, even in a period of an hour. But it needs to be said that this administration has pushed the Congress to put language in funding bills for Iraq that would set the stage for the privatization of Iraq's oil. 
   I am going to quote from the first war supplemental, that the President shall make and transmit to Congress a determination, No. 2, whether the Government of Iraq is making substantial progress in meeting its commitment to pursue reconciliation initiatives, including enactment of a hydrocarbon law. Then under subsection (b), it says if the President fails to make this determination, the Secretary of Defense shall commence the redeployment of our Armed Forces from Iraq. 
   In other words, privatize your oil, or we are leaving you without having a security and peacekeeping force to replace the United States Army.     
   In the second supplemental, the administration language promoted the President transmitting to Congress a report in classified and unclassified form, article 2, whether the Government of Iraq has enacted a broadly accepted hydrocarbon law that equitably shares revenues among all Iraqis. 
   Now again, they don't talk about what the real purpose of the Hydrocarbon Act has been. It is not about sharing revenues equitably; it is about a complex restructuring of Iraq's oil industry for the purpose of turning Iraq's oil over to private oil companies. 
   Finally, in the third supplemental that is before this Congress this week, there is an article from the Senate side that relates to Iraq oil, and I quote: ``The United States strategy in Iraq shall hereafter be conditioned on the Iraqi Government meeting certain benchmarks.'' And one such benchmark, ``enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people of Iraq.'' And it goes on to pay homage to the issues of equity and ethnicity. 
   Madam Speaker, it is clear that the people of Iraq are under enormous pressure to give up control of their oil. When you consider that there was no cause to go to war against Iraq, that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, that Iraq had nothing to do with al Qaeda's role in 9/11, that the administration kept changing the reason  why we went into Iraq, and here we are, years later, we are still in Iraq, and enormous pressure is being put on the Iraqi Government to privatize their oil. 
   I am here to say that there is another path that can be taken, and that path is part of H.R. 1234, a bill that I have written that would enable the war to end by Congress determining that no more money will go for this war, telling the administration that it must open up diplomatic relations with Syria and Iran, and moving in a direction where we put together an international peacekeeping and security force that would move in as our troops leave. And then we set the stage for real reconciliation that cannot come with the U.S. serving as an occupying army. 
   We have a moral responsibility to the Iraqi people whose country we have ravaged with war to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars of damage, whose people may have experienced the loss of perhaps as many as a million Iraqis during this conflict, innocent people, whose social bonds have been torn asunder. We have a moral responsibility to work to bring about a program of reconciliation between the Sunnis, Shiites and the Kurds which can only come when we end the occupation. We have a moral responsibility to bring about an honest reconstruction program, absent the U.S. contractors who have been gouging the Iraqi people, and gouging the American taxpayers as well, but we have to make sure that the Iraqi people have control of their oil. 
   I would like to believe that this war has not been about oil. I would like to believe that there was some kind of a righteous cause connected to what we did; but I know better, and the proof is in this Hydrocarbon Act. 
   This Congress has an opportunity to finally take a stand and reject this Hydrocarbon Act. We can strip out this provision forcing Iraq to privatize its oil. We can strip that out of the legislation. Or we can simply defeat the legislation because that is in there, and then go back to the boards and tell the President, look, Mr. President, we are not going to give you any more money for this war, which is what I believe we should do. Tell the President, this war is over, Mr. President, and use the money that is in the pipeline to bring the troops home. Let's go and reach out to the international community. With the end of the occupation and the closing of bases, we will have people who will start listening to us internationally, and we will have some credibility. 
   But the morality which this country rests on, our heart and soul of who we are as Americans, is not reflected by this obscene attempt to steal the oil resources of Iraq. That is why I have chosen to take this time to come before the Congress, to lay these facts out for Members of Congress and for the American people so that you can see without question the relationship between war and this oil and the relationship between the pressure that is being put on the Iraq Government right now and privatization and the continuation of the war. 
   Let's end this war. Let's end the attempt to control Iraq's oil. Let's challenge the oil companies in this country as this House has done this morning. Let's take a stand for truth and justice. Let's take a stand for what is right. Let us not be seduced by this idea that somehow we have the military might, and we can, therefore, grab other people's resources. That is not what America is about. 
   America has a higher calling in the world. It is time we began a process of truth and reconciliation in our own country, in reaching out and creating the healing of America. But we must first begin with the truth, and the truth is what I have told this Congress today. 
   Madam Speaker, thank you. 
   Members of Congress, thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq War supplemental on the floor tomorrow will in no way pressure the President to end the war in Iraq, despite the fact that voters gave our majority last November the responsibility to do that, end the war. 
   The benchmarks in the war supplemental force the Iraqis to privatize, or turn over to multinational oil interests, their oil industry by demanding passage of the Iraqi Hydrocarbon Act. I spoke on the House floor today for an hour documenting the evidence. 
   But if the Iraqis refuse to turn over the oil resources, the terms of the bill are blackmail. The war supplemental demands passage of the Iraqi bill by blocking over $1 billion in reconstruction funds if the Iraqis refuse to comply. 
   We need to send a message to the voters that we do not support privatizing Iraqi oil by force, nor do we support the continued funding of this war. 
   It is not credible to maintain that one opposes the war and yet continues to fund it. Continuing to fund the war is not a plan. It would represent the continuation of a disaster. A better approach is the 12-point plan established in H.R. 1234.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   Today we're being told that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street, yet this bailout plan will fail to keep families in their homes. Treasury will own troubled assets without any control. Terms of bad mortgages cannot be changed absent controlling share of underlying securities. 
   If you support this legislation because you think it will keep people in their homes, think again. In fact, Treasury will not be able to change the terms of bad mortgages because the act does not require Treasury to purchase a controlling share in the underlying mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.     
   The Secretary will be powerless to make any real and substantive change in the terms of mortgages. The Secretary will have no power to avoid foreclosures and keep families in their homes. 
   Last night, I received a letter from Frank Alexander, a professor of law at Emory University. He has testified before my subcommittee on domestic policy, on targeting Federal assistance to help neighborhoods affected by the foreclosure crisis. He is an expert on housing law. 
   I would like to put his letter in the Record. 
   Professor Alexander clearly demonstrates that the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will not fulfill its stated goal of preserving homeownership. Unless the Secretary of the Treasury is required to prioritize assets that will give the Treasury a controlling share in the underlying home mortgage, the Secretary will hold bad assets with no power to make them solid again. So much for the homeowners. 
   If we had a plan which focused on saving families' homes, it would actually do more for the economy than this bill. Economist Nouriel Roubini has written that the lack of debt relief to distressed households is behind the financial crisis and the deepening recession. With $700 billion directed towards helping or towards trying to save homes, we could really stimulate the economy and could give real economic security to millions on Main Street, but that's not what this bill is about. It's about Wall Street. What is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street? Not today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment directs FEMA to conduct a comprehensive study of the increase in demand for FEMA's emergency response and disaster relief services as a result of weather-related disasters associated with global warming. 
   It will tell us what FEMA can expect 5, 10, and 20 years from now. The assessment will include an analysis of the budgetary material and manpower implications of meeting such increased demand for FEMA services. We have been warned. We have been warned that we should expect to see more extreme weather, like severe rain storms and snowstorms that can come in an El Nino season. 
   We have been warned that we will see stronger hurricanes and hurricanes with more total rainfall. We have been warned to expect heat waves. We have been told to expect melting glaciers, rising sea levels swallowing low-lying land in places like Bangladesh, Florida, the gulf coast and Manhattan. 
   We have been warned that rising temperatures will force infectious diseases to move north or upwards in elevation to expose previously unexposed and, therefore, defenseless populations. We have been warned that droughts will intensify and lengthen, straining already strained water supplies and bring crop failures. Droughts also place those areas at greater risk for wildfires. 
   These warnings come from the most respected, most credible, most well-studied scientists this world has to offer. This was most recently affirmed by the Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Turns out, they were right. 
   The 11 hottest years on record have occurred since 1994. Two of the three last hurricane seasons have broken records. The polar ice cap is melting even faster than our previous best estimates. Greenland's ice is melting. Permafrost in Alaska is thawing, causing homes to crumble. Residents of low-lying nations like Tuvalu have applied for entry into other countries as climate refugees and have been denied. 
   West Nile virus from Africa has taken a toehold in the U.S. The European heat wave of 2003 killed well over 15,000 people. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are at levels scientists say have not occurred in 400,000 years. 
   These effects are directly in line with the warnings we received from the scientific community. Even though it is difficult to attribute all of these effects directly to climate change, some have been able to. A 2006 article in the journal Nature blames half of the risk associated with the European heat on human-induced warming. 
   The World Health Organization has estimated that 150,000 deaths every year can already be attributed to climate change.     
   Hurricane Katrina gave us another grim warning, telling us not only what we should expect, but showing us what happens if we're not prepared. 
   Katrina showed us that when disasters hit, the most vulnerable among us become even more vulnerable because they lack the resources and access to cope. That was made clear as image  after image of those hit the hardest were people of modest means and people of color. 
   In fact, in the Chicago heat wave of 1995, African Americans were twice as likely to die as Caucasians. The elderly, many of whom could not afford air conditioning, made up most of the victims. 
   Katrina showed us that disasters are expensive. We have so far spent about $77 billion on disaster assistance for Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita alone. Insurance companies whose very existence rely on their predictive abilities have seen enough to make them drop certain coverage and to conduct campaigns to try to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Reinsurance companies in particular, like Swiss Re, have taken a leadership role in promoting action on climate change. 
   Katrina has showed us that an unprepared FEMA costs time, money and ultimately lives. If past is prologue, we have an obligation to look at the future in order to prepare. We have to allow FEMA to take into account the realities of the challenges that await them. 
   At this moment we can still choose among policy options. We can deal with the effects of climate change in one of two ways. We can acknowledge the extraordinary challenges before us and prepare for them voluntarily and aggressively, but steadily, predictably and controllably, or we can continue to create policy as if there's no problem and wait for the severe weather to control our pace of adaptation. The choice is ours. 
   Let FEMA prepare for the task ahead. Vote ``yes'' on the Kucinich amendment.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, today the House will pass a budget which will fund the war in Iraq far into 2009. The budget includes an extra $195 billion mostly for military operations in Iraq. Anyone who thinks this Congress is trying to end the war had better think again, because this budget signals we will be in Iraq for another 2 years or more, even though Congress has led the American people and the media to believe otherwise. 
   Congress recently engaged in a dubious debate about a nonbinding surge resolution. Even though Congress had and still has the authority to end the war now, we instead give it new life with last week's vote. 
   Now, $195 billion on top of last week's supplemental means close to $300 billion in a week approved to continue the war. 
   This war has sacrificed the lives of our troops and innocent civilians. It has advanced the interests of oil companies and contractors in the manner of a criminal enterprise. It has besmirched our national honor and alienated America from friends around the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to the amendment and in support of the underlying bill, Mr. Rahall's bill, to restore the prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros. 
   A lot of people bet on horses. Today, the horses are betting on us. They are betting that we remember something essential about the America of long ago to which these wild horses and burros connect us, betting that we do not misuse our power to cause these horses, these wild animals to be subject to slaughter. They are betting that we have the sense to put together policies that can provide for the protection of the wild horses and burros. 
   Now, it is the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management to enforce the laws on public lands that related to the bill that Congress passed 36 years ago that established as national policy that wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be protected from capture, branding, harassment, and death. And this Bureau of Land Management has not done the job. They haven't properly managed their responsibilities,  they haven't enforced the law. Why should we permit the wild horses to be further victimized by the Bureau of Land Management? 
   This legislation exposes part of the spirit of America to an attack because of the ineffectiveness and inefficiency and indeed the callous disregard of those at the Bureau of Land Management. Rather than pass a law which opens up wild horses to commercial sale and slaughter, we should be looking at a dramatic revision of the Bureau of Land Management's responsibilities here. We should be looking at that agency which took the responsibility by law in 1971 to make sure that these horses were protected, because they haven't done that. And now we are having Members advocate that we continue a condition where these horses are subjected to slaughter. 
   I think that occasionally we reconnect to our greatness as a country when we remember where we came from, when we remember our connection with the land, when we remember our connection with Native Americans, when we remember our connection with the sky, when we remember our connection with the water, and when we remember our connection with God's creatures who still, through the grace of God, freely roam the plains of this country as wild horses and burros. 
   Support the Rahall bill.

   H.R. 137 would make engaging in animal fighting a felony. This legislation will ensure that those who choose to fight animals illegally will be met with the appropriate penalty when they disregard the law. 
   Despite the fact that the vast majority of states have banned this atrocious and deplorable act, animal fighting continues to plague our communities. Animals such as dogs and chickens are fought to the death in the name of sport. This is unhealthy, violent behavior on the part of humans and is inhumane and merciless to the animals. 
   I commend both local and state officials for stepping up raids on animal fighting rings. Now it is time for this body of Congress to do our part by making these offenses a felony under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to join me and vote in favor of the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, H.R. 137.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this act. Having great familiarity with the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands and with Native Hawaiians, I understand their concerns that we should have codified a stronger statement of what their rights are as indigenous peoples. 
   This is really about making sure that language and culture and history are preserved. It also is consistent with the law which created the admission of Hawaii to this Union. I think the date, Mr. Abercrombie could correct me if I am wrong, it was August 21, 1959. That was an important date for this Nation, because it is a day that we embraced not only Hawaii but Alaska. It was a day that we embraced the potential of this country to extend its reach and embrace peoples of many different cultures. 
   This act is an act that needs to be passed so that we can keep unfolding the real purpose and quality of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise in opposition. What we see here at work is the Bush administration's flawed national security doctrine. They are staging an attack on Iran. Their Navy is in the gulf. There have been overflights. There are covert operations and assassinations. The administration recently sent weapons to Israel which can be used for an attack on Iran: 1,000 so-called smart bombs, the GBU 39s, which could be used to attack the nuclear power sites that would produce a catastrophe, according to the Physicians for Social Responsibility report. 
   I believe it is adverse to the security of Israel to continue to follow the United States' current national security doctrine. And it's also adverse to continue to insist that nuclear power is to be equated with nuclear weapons. 
   Now, if we want diplomacy, and we should, we should be listening to five former Secretaries of State who have said that diplomacy is what we should pursue. 
   I would like to enter their names into the Record.     
   Sanctions are not to be confused with diplomacy, any more than war is to be confused with diplomacy. Nuclear power, I want to repeat, does not equate with a nuclear weapons program. 
   I want to cite our own CRS report which was given to the Congress on August 11, 2008, just a little more than a month ago, which cites the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, that says according to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, and that is from December of 2007, ``Iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons'' until fall 2003, but then halted its nuclear weapons program ``primarily in response to international pressure.'' 
   I would like to enter the CRS report into the Record. 
   Furthermore, the International Atomic Energy Agency has recently released a report which states very clearly, and this report is 4 days ago, September 22, 2008, by the Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, with respect to the implementation of safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran, ``The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material in Iran.'' It goes on to say, ``I note that the agency has not detected the usual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have information apart from uranium metal document on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon.'' 
   I would like to include this in the Record. 
   I would also like to include in the Record a quote from a piece by historian William Polk, who has said, ``Ironically the U.S. has three times actually helped Iran move towards nuclear weapons. Under the Shah, the Nixon administration gave Iran a big push in that direction. Then 6 years ago in Operation Merlin, the CIA provided Iran with plans for the central explosive charge for a nuclear weapon. The idea was to mislead the Persians into working on an unworkable model for the bomb, but the ploy was so crude that Iran probably profited from it. Finally, it turns out the U.S. Department of Energy has been subsidizing Russian organizations that have been helping Iran's nuclear program.'' 
   Now, one of my many concerns with this legislation is it sanctions the Central Bank of Iran. In doing that, I raise a question with regard to our current liquidity problems on Wall Street, whether or not the sanctioning of Iran's Central Bank will be a problem for our own economy, as well as the sanctions here on oil transactions, which could affect the price of energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   As with many Members of this House, I am a strong supporter of India. I have had the opportunity to visit the country, meet with leaders, meet with people, and I think we could say we have a lot in common. 
   India's the world's largest democracy. Someone whose life I have admired, the life of Mahatma Gandhi, is synonymous with peace. 
   India is a strong ally in the quest for nuclear disarmament. It was the first nation to call for a ban on testing back in 1954. 
   Regretfully, I rise in opposition to this bill because I believe it threatens security in India and the Asian subcontinent and in the world. The U.S. should work with India on initiatives to eliminate all nuclear weapons for the safety of the global community and for the safety of every man, woman, and child. 
   The contradictory policies of this administration with respect to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty are obvious. The administration has repeatedly cited Iran for minor breaches of the nonproliferation treaty and has used these breaches to rally support for a military attack on Iran. 
   Yet the administration is undercutting the nonproliferation treaty by seeking to build new nuclear weapons, a major violation of the NPT, which states that nuclear weapon states should be seeking to phase out nuclear weapons. 
   Now the administration would like this body to approve a civilian nuclear agreement with India, despite India's refusal to join the NPT or sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
   India has nuclear weapons. It has no intention of limiting its nuclear weapons cache or production capability. The United States should be leading in nonproliferation and towards nuclear abolition. 
   This legislation undermines global nonproliferation efforts by endorsing India's refusal to sign the NPT. We are also extending a more favorable civil nuclear trade policy to Indian than that which is extended to countries in substantial compliance with the nonproliferation treaty. 
   Furthermore, by ensuring a foreign supply of uranium fuel to India for use in the civilian sector, India will be able to use more of its own limited uranium reserves to produce nuclear weapons. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank my friend, Mr. Lantos. 
   I rise as a proud cosponsor of this bill emphasizing the importance of water. Despite the availability of advanced and inexpensive water treatment technologies and despite an aggregate level of wealth that should preclude injustice, one in six people in the world still lack access to safe drinking water. Global warming is expected to worsen the situation. 
   At the same time, privatization of our scarce water supplies is also proliferating. It drives up the price of a life-giving resource under the guise of making it cheaper. In its most egregious form, bottled water companies overpump a valuable water supply, restricting access to only those who can afford to pay more for water than for gas. 
   I represent an area of Cleveland that, like many nearby cities, relies on Lake Erie for drinking water. During negotiations by Great Lakes States over the conditions under which water could be withdrawn from Lake Erie and the surrounding Great Lakes, the bottled water industry slipped in their own language; it allowed exclusive, unlimited access to Great Lakes water by their industry. By weakening the agreement in this way, it also paved the way for any corporation to have full access to the lakes, even at the expense of the public water supply. This is happening at a time when both water quality and quantity are expected to decline as a result of global warming. 
   In Nottingham and Barrington, two small New Hampshire towns, a company called USA Springs is attempting to pump 310,000 gallons a day in an area populated with homes that get their water from small, private, household wells. The community is concerned about loss of their water supply, loss of water quality, degradation of nearby wetlands, but USA Springs is using their substantial resources to overwhelm the community. The result is that this company, USA Springs, is now dangerously close to winning this battle it started in 2001. Similar battles are being fought in communities all over the country. 
   The basic building blocks of life, like water, must be accessible by people before corporations and must be managed as a public trust, not reduced to a commodity.

   I am urging Members to support H.R. 676, the Conyers-Kucinich bill, which establishes a universal, not-for-profit health care system, which provides full and comprehensive mental health care. 
   Second, support H.R. 808, a bill establishing a Department of Peace and Nonviolence, which directly addresses the issues of domestic violence, gang violence, and violence in the schools which is reflected in our current homicide rates. 
   And third, the 33 deaths at Blacksburg constitute a national tragedy. So, too, does the fact that an average of 32 people each and every day in the United States perish in handgun-related incidents. Accordingly, I am drafting a bill to ban the purchase, sale, transfer or possession of handguns by civilians. A gun buy-back provision will be provided in the bill. 
   It's time for us to rescue this Nation from the violence which is engulfing it, and I have just articulated a three-point plan to do so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 185. I commend this body for recognizing the rights of Jewish refugees displaced from Arab countries. I agree that a resolution that addresses the legitimate rights of all refugees is inherent to establishing enduring peace in the Middle East. 
   The resolution draws its strength by including all refugees in the Middle East, including Jews, Christians, minority communities, Iraqis, and Palestinians. A lasting peace in the Middle East must abate feelings of hostility throughout all refugee populations. As the resolution suggests, this includes recognition of Jewish, Palestinian, and Christian refugee populations but must also encompass all Middle East refugee populations ``numbering in the hundreds of thousands and comprised of peoples from many ethnic, religious, and national backgrounds.'' 
   As such, I urge this body to continue to be mindful of and work toward peaceful, enduring solutions for all refugee populations in the Middle East. Currently the two largest refugee populations in the world are Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. The United Nations has estimated that there are approximately 2,000,000 Iraqi refugees currently displaced from their homes (and another 2,200,000 internally displaced). These Iraqi refugees endure deprivation of food, shelter, and medical care. The United States must be mindful of the role of our foreign policy in the creation of this refugee population and our continuing role in addressing this humanitarian crisis. 
   United Nations-recognized Palestinian refugees currently constitute an approximate 3,700,000-person population. According to the United Nations Relief and Work Agency, UNRWA, of these refugees, approximately 1,300,000 Palestinian refugees continue to live in 58 recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Moreover, ongoing Israeli policies like settlement expansion, which contravene the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as the basis of Palestinian-Israeli peace agreements, create new refugee populations today. 
   I support H. Res. 185 for recognizing the displacement, human rights, suffering and loss of all refugees. I encourage this body to do so in a way that brings us closer to establishing a just and long-lasting Arab-Israeli peace. To make this dream a reality we must truly rise to become the ``honest broker'' of peace in the Middle East.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 310: Expressing support for a national day of remembrance for Harriet Ross Tubman. I wish to thank Representative CUMMINGS for sponsoring this important legislation. 
   Harriet Tubman was a remarkable woman, whose courage, struggle and dedication inspires respect and awe. It is appropriate that the Episcopal Church honors her as a saint. 
   Born into slavery, Harriet Ross did not know her exact date of birth. At the age of 12 years she refused to help a white overseer bind a recaptured slave. For her refusal she was hit in the head with a heavy rock; this injury was severe and its effects would plague her for the rest of her life. At the age of 30 Harriet Tubman would make her escape from slavery to  Canada by way of Philadelphia where she met William Stills and learned about the workings of the Underground Railroad. Tubman would go on to free hundreds from slavery and became known as ``Moses'' for her incredible bravery and sacrifice as she led the way to freedom as a ``conductor'' on the Underground Railroad. Harriet was a dedicated and outspoken member of the abolitionist movement. 
   During the Civil War she provided services as a nurse, cook, scout and spy for the Union Army, but was refused payment for her wartime service. She became an active member of the women's suffrage movement and went on to establish the Harriet Tubman Home for the Sick and Aged in Auburn, NY, in 1908. She worked to maintain this home, the only one of its kind outside of New York City, dedicated to the care and sanctuary of African-Americans in New York. 
   Harriet Tubman was a true heroine. I encourage the designation of a national day of remembrance to celebrate her life. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Con. Res. 310.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. 
   Over the past 9 years, as the price of food has increased and the cost of housing swelled beyond the reach of many workers, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has fallen to its lowest level in 51 years. 
   Since 1997, the Federal minimum wage has been stalled at $5.15 an hour without an increase or adjustment. This stagnation of the minimum wage has left families with no guarantee that a full-time job will enable their most basic needs to be met. 
   At the current minimum wage, a worker spending 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year on the job, earns less than $11,000 a year, leaving them more than $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. That is shameful. 
   The passage of the bill today will directly help those families. 
   It is estimated that 5.6 million workers will receive an increase in their hourly wage if the minimum wage were raised to just $7.25 an hour. An additional 7.4 million workers earning up to a dollar above the new minimum wage would also benefit. In total, 13 million workers will be aided by this necessary legislation. 
   The passage of this bill is a first step towards the greater goal of a living wage for every American worker because, even as it goes to $7.25 an hour, there are many families who are still going to find themselves within the circumference of poverty. There are people who are looking forward to the action of this Congress. 
   But let it be said that the long-term objective, to ensure that workers are able to afford adequate housing and support their families, cannot be forgotten by this Congress.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the administration is preparing to escalate the conflict. They intend to increase troop numbers to unprecedented levels, without establishing an ending date. It is important for Congress to oppose the troop surge. But that is not enough. We must respond powerfully to take steps to end the occupation, close U.S. bases in Iraq and bring our troops home. These steps are necessary preconditions to the U.S. extricating itself from Iraq through the establishment of an international security and peacekeeping force. 
   That is what the Kucinich plan which I am presenting Members of Congress today is all about. Congress as a co-equal branch of government has an urgent responsibility here. Congress under article I, section 8, has the war-making power. Congress appropriates funds for the war. Congress does not dispense with its obligation to the American people simply by opposing a troop surge in Iraq. It is simply not credible to maintain that one opposes the war and yet continues to fund it. If you oppose the war, then don't vote to fund it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, as the first person on either side of my family to be able to have the opportunity to graduate from college, I understand what it is like for members of American families to have this dream of higher education and to have to work full-time, sometimes two jobs, and to go to school and to try to balance all that and see tuition keep climbing and climbing and the reach of a higher education starting to elude one's grasp. 
   Millions of Americans are facing this. This is why the College Student Relief Act is so important. Last year, over the strong objections of students and many Members of Congress, Congress cut approximately $12 billion  from the Federal student aid program. But at the same time the price of a college diploma at a public university has continued to grow at a rate that far outpaces inflation. Since 2001, tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation. 
   Now, are students suddenly finding themselves in a market where they are making 41 percent more? Not a chance. They are lucky to have a job at all. Are their parents making more money? No. Most of their parents are maxed out on their credit cards. This bill is critical when we consider what the needs are. 
   We have to encourage innovation and talent of our youth and ensure that every American is given the skills and training necessary to reach their fullest potential. This Congress must work together to help ensure that every American, regardless of their income level, has the opportunity to continue their education. 
   Our Nation benefits from an educated and skilled workforce. We must not hesitate to invest in education for our students. The passage of this bill is a vital step in our efforts to increase access to college. With the passage of this bill, we can take the first step towards increasing access to college and ensuring that students graduating from college are not weighed down for life with debt.  
   I rise in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. 
   Last year, over the strong objections of students and many Members of this body, Congress cut approximately $12 billion from Federal student aid programs. 
   However, the price tag on a college diploma at a public university has continued to grow at a rate far outpacing inflation. Since 2001, tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation. 
   The prior Congress cut student aid, as the costs of attending a public university continued to rise. 
   Therefore it is no surprise that over the next decade financial barriers will prevent 2 million high school graduates from continuing on to post-secondary education, even at a local community college. 
   Furthermore, as Federal student aid programs have faced funding cutbacks, students have increasingly been forced to rely on loans as their primary source of support. 
   It is outrageous that easy access to a college education be restricted to the wealthy while students from less advantageous circumstances must either do without or be saddled with a paralyzing debt. 
   These plights make the passage of H.R. 5 all the more necessary. Cutting these interest rates is a first step towards ensuring the rising cost of tuition does not continue to place a college education beyond the means of many Americans. 
   Today, with the passage of this bill, this House can take the first step toward increasing access to college and ensuring that students graduating from college are not weighed down for life with debt. 
   When the interest rate reduction in this legislation is fully phased in the average borrower will save approximately $4,400 over the life of their loan. This action will cut the cost of college for over 5 million students. 
   This Congress must work together to help ensure every American, regardless of their income level, has the opportunity to continue their education. 
   The benefits of expanded access to college are not limited to the individuals continuing their education, but extend to society as a whole. 
   We must encourage the innovation and talent of our youth and ensure that every American is given the skills and training necessary to reach their fullest potential. 
   Our Nation benefits from an educated and skilled workforce and we must not hesitate to invest in the education of our students. 
   The passage of H.R. 5 is a vital first step in our efforts to increase access to college and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (THE KUCINICH PLAN FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, Congress is beginning to focus on the necessity to take a new direction with respect to Iraq. There are some in the administration who are saying well, there is no plan. What can we do? We have to stay the course. We have to send more troops. We have to make a renewed effort. 
   Once again I am offering for the attention of this Congress a plan that I put together that meets the requirements of being able to bring our troops home and create stability in Iraq and reunite the United States with the world community in the cause of peace and security. 
   Here are the elements of the Kucinich plan: 
   First, the U.S. announces it will end the occupation, close military bases and withdraw. 
   The insurgency has been fueled by the occupation and the prospect of a long-term presence, as indicated by the building of permanent bases. A U.S. declaration of intention to withdraw troops and close bases will help dampen the insurgency which has been inspired to resist colonization and fight invaders and those who have supported U.S. policy. Furthermore, this will provide an opening for parties in Iraq and in the region to set the stage toward negotiations and peaceful settlement. 
   Second, the U.S. announces it will use existing funds to bring the troops and the necessary equipment home. 
   Congress appropriated $70 billion in bridge funds on October 1 for the war. Money from this and other DOD accounts can be used to fund the troops in the field over the next few months and to pay for the cost of the return of the troops, which has been estimated at between 5 and $7 billion while a political settlement is being negotiated and preparations are made for a transition to an international security and peacekeeping force. 
   Number three, order a simultaneous return of all U.S. contractors to the United States and turn over all contracting work to the Iraqi government. 
   The contracting process has been rife with corruption with contractors stealing from the U.S. Government and cheating the Iraqi people, taking large contracts and giving a few percentages to Iraqi subcontractors. Reconstruction activities must be reorganized and closely monitored in Iraq by the Iraqi government with the assistance of the international community. The massive corruption as it relates to the U.S. contractors should be investigated by congressional committees and Federal grand juries. The lack of tangible benefits, the lack of accountability for billions of dollars while millions of Iraqis do not have a means of financial support, nor substantive employment, cries out for justice. It is noteworthy that after the first Gulf War, Iraqis reestablish electricity within 3 months despite sanctions. Four years into the U.S. occupation, there is no water or reliable electricity in Baghdad despite massive funding from the U.S. and the Madrid Conference. The greatest mystery involves the activities of private security companies who function as mercenaries. Reports of false flag operations must be investigated by an international tribunal.  
   Fourth, convene a regional conference for the purposes of developing a security and stabilization force in Iraq. 
   The focus should be on a process which solves the problem of Iraq. The U.S. has told the international community, ``This is our policy and we want you to come and help us implement it.'' The international community may have an interest in helping Iraq, but it has no interest in participating in the implementation of failed U.S. policy. 
   A shift in U.S. policy away from unilateralism and toward cooperation will provide new opportunities for exploring common concerns about the plight of Iraq. The U.N. is the appropriate place to convene, through the Office of the Secretary General, all countries that have interests, concerns and influence, including the five permanent members of the Security Council and the European Community, and all Arab nations.     
   The end of the U.S. occupation and the closing of military bases are necessary preconditions for such a conference. When the U.S. creates a shift of policy and announces it will focus on the concerns of the people of Iraq, it will provide a powerful incentive for nations to participate. 
   It is well known that while some nations may see the instability in Iraq as an opportunity, there is also an ever-present danger the civil war in Iraq threatens the stability of nations throughout the region. The impending end of the occupation will provide a breakthrough for cooperation between the U.S. and the U.N. and the U.N. and the countries of the region. The regional conference must include Iran, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. 
   The fifth point in the Kucinich plan is to prepare an international security and peacekeeping force to move in, replacing U.S. troops who then return home. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a 12-point plan, and I will be presenting more features of it in future sessions.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, although my colleagues have worked hard to provide meaningful reform, this bill maintains agriculture policies that are driving several underlying problems. For example, the single biggest share of subsidies under this bill goes to corn, which drives up food prices through corn based ethanol incentives and which contributes to obesity and diabetes through the overproduction of High Fructose Corn Syrup. 
   The bill short-changes conservation programs that can reduce global warming pollution. It continues to encourage factory farms where our antibiotics are rendered weak or useless because of overuse on cattle, where cattle are treated inhumanely, where toxic runoff contributes to contaminated drinking water, and where employees suffer the highest rates of workplace injuries of almost any other industry. 
   Finally, this Farm Bill maintains massive giveaways to corporate agribusiness instead of helping the vanishing family farmer. 
   The president has declared his intent to veto this bill because it does not contain adequate reform. Instead, he asserts that Congress should pass a one year extension of the status quo and come back with a farm bill containing more meaningful reform. I agree that the bill falls far short. In voting against the previous version of the Farm Bill, my hope was that Congress would take the last remaining opportunity to construct a farm bill that did not exacerbate the obesity and diabetes epidemics, that was good for the environment, and that favored family farmers over corporate agribusiness. 
   However, there are now no other opportunities to improve the bill in the near future. At the same time, this Farm Bill contains provisions that give immediate relief from hunger caused by rising food costs. Northeast Ohio, where the situation is particularly urgent, simply cannot wait another year for relief. 
   Portions of my district, including Lakewood, Fairview Park and Parma, have experienced a 74% increase in participation in the Food Stamp Program between 2002 and 2007. Participation in the food stamp program has increased over the last several years, with an additional 1.3 million people participating in the program in the last year alone. 
   An unprecedented $10.4 billion over 10 years has been included in the Nutrition Title of the Farm Bill. Proper nutrition is vital to human life and a basic human right. Funding for the Nutrition Title will have an important impact on preventing domestic hunger by increasing the Food Stamp Program's minimum monthly benefit and The Emergency Food Assistance Program's mandatory funding level. 
   There are over 35 million people in our nation who face hunger, 12.5 million of whom are children. Hunger centers in Cleveland, Ohio and around the nation report that demand for food assistance has risen by 15 to 20 percent over the last year. Increasingly, middle-class families are turning to food banks to meet their basic nutritional needs. In a recent survey, 83 percent of food banks reported that they are experiencing difficulty in meeting the needs of their communities. The bill increases assistance to food banks by $1.25 billion. This is an important step to curbing hunger in our nation and upholding the dignity of our citizens. 
   I will continue to work with my colleagues to achieve the necessary reform to make certain that our citizens have access to wholesome and nutritious foods while preserving our family farms, improving public health and protecting our environment. But the immediate needs of the people of Northeast Ohio, combined with the lack of opportunity to craft a more sustainable alternative, leave me no choice but to vote for this Farm Bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Thank you, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Lewis and all Members of Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, as we honor Dr. King's legacy, let's remember it is a living legacy. We are not talking about cold prose and someone who is so distant from this moment. His ideas are so alive today and so needed today; that is why a month from now, I will be introducing legislation to create a Cabinet level Department of Peace, which takes Dr. King's vision of an America which organizes around principles of nonviolence and brings it to life in addressing the issues of domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, violence in the schools, racial violence, violence against gays, police, community relations conflicts, and provides the resources so that we can deal with these as a living testimony to the love that we are showing today for Dr. King. 
   But he also was a visionary on the matter of war. He spoke many times warning this country about the danger of what happened in Vietnam. He spoke about the price that was being paid for the people of two nations in a speech at Riverside Church nearly 40 years ago. At Ebenezer Baptist Church he spoke about the interrelationship of all people, but how all people are one. It was that understanding of oneness that drove him to take a stand for peace. 
   Let us celebrate not only his life, but let the principles of his life continue to guide us as Americans. This is the moment to take a stand as we grapple with the question of Iraq. 
   I met with representatives of over 1,000 soldiers today who say it is time to get out of Iraq. Let us protect Dr. King's memory by standing for peace. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to put into the RECORD Dr. King's speech from Ebenezer Baptist Church and part of his speech from Riverside Church, which need to be read today. I would also like to put in the RECORD a speech that I gave recently called ``Out of Iraq and Back to the American City,'' which shows that only when we take a stand for peace are we able to get the resources that we need to provide jobs and health care and education and retirement security and housing for the American people. 
   Make Dr. King's legacy a living legacy.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, today I received a petition, an appeal for redress from over 1,000 active duty members of the armed services. Many of these honorable soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have served in Iraq. They did not challenge their orders, they did not challenge their duty to serve, they do assert their constitutional rights and their military code rights to speak with Members of Congress. 
   Article 3.5.7, Department of Defense directive 1325.6 provides the right of servicemembers to request redress and grievances against the actions of their commanders. The action taken and presented to me by individual servicemembers is an appeal for redress to end the war in Iraq. 
   Troops are risking their careers to present this message to Congress. They have all individually signed the following statement: 
   As a patriotic American proud to serve the Nation in uniform, I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq. Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price. It is time for U.S. troops to come home.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (12-POINT PLAN FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House of Representatives, last week the President of the United States gave a speech to this Nation that he intends to escalate the war against Iraq. Compounding his speech was the point-by-point recitation of his intention to continue to escalate tensions between the United States and the sovereign nation of Iran. 
   At this moment, when this Congress has honored the memory of Dr. King, it bears reflection as to whether or not we in this Nation have the capacity to begin to pursue a path of nonviolence in our relations with other countries. 
   Our President is intent on escalating a war against Iraq. He is intent on precipitating a war against Iran. Whatever happened to the science of human relations? Whatever happened to using our head in dealing with people so that war is not an acceptable option, but that peace becomes inevitable because we pursue talking to one another? 
   If we had taken the case for Iraq to the U.N., we would not have gotten approval for an attack against Iraq. How much better it would have been if this Nation had not decided to attack Iraq, because Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, did not have the intention or capability of attacking the United States, was not trying to get uranium from Niger, did not, in effect, constitute a threat to the United States of America. 
   And yet, we attacked a nation which did not attack us, at tremendous consequence, the death of over 3,000 American men and women who served this country valiantly, the deaths of over 650,000 innocent Iraqis, according to the Lancet Report, during the conduct of the war; complete annihilation of so much of the cities of Iraq. 
   What are we doing? What do we stand for as a nation? Does this really represent what America is all about? Or does America have a higher destiny? Is it our destiny to rule the world with our military might? Or is it our destiny to hold up our values of peace and justice, and to live them in our own  Nation, and to nourish them abroad through following international law? 
   It is a critical moment for America, Mr. Speaker. This Congress must stand up. We must not just set aside the escalation, we must set aside the occupation. We must not simply challenge this President and his buildup to war in Iran. We must let this President know that any action he takes against Iran will have constitutional consequences. 
   We are at a moment when we need to defend our Constitution. We need to stand up for the American way, which is not the way of war. It is not the way of aggressive war. It is not the way of preemption, unilateralism and first strike. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is really time for America to take a new direction in the world, and that direction is to work with the nations of the world. 
   I put forth a 12-point plan for Iraq. It called for America to announce the end of the occupation, the closing of the bases, withdrawal of our troops. But we cannot do that unless, simultaneously, we let the nations of the world know that we are going to take a new direction in world affairs. We need to ask the world community to help us, to mobilize a peacekeeping and security force that will move in as our troops move out so that the people of Iraq can be secure. When we do that we can build a basis for a reconciliation in Iraq between the Kurds, the Shiites, the Sunnis. When we do that we can have a legitimate program for reconstruction and reparations for the Iraqi people. We can help safeguard their oil wealth for the people of Iraq, not for private American oil companies. 
   Iraq should be a turning point for this Nation. It should be a turning point away from war as an instrument of policy. It should be a turning point where we address the needs of the people of the United States, the real human needs, for health care, education and jobs. And that is what my 12-point program leads to.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   D.C. residents shoulder the burden of a colossal injustice. They live within a system of governance that extracts the full range of taxes paid by all other U.S. citizens without the benefit of voting representation in the United States Congress. 
   The history of D.C. is the history of democracy denied. Its citizens have given the full measure of their allegiance to the United States. They fought in wars for the United States. They have paid taxes. They have provided labor, resources, and space to the United States Government. Yet for 200 years District residents have been bystanders in the governance of their Nation and city. 
   ``Taxation without representation'' is not just a good slogan. It is a plight that sparked revolution. We attempt to create democracies around the globe, but to deny democracy in the shadow of the U.S. capital, it is now time to end that. 
   Voting rights, civil rights, human rights are all one. Support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Let's speak of the consequences of a ``yes'' vote on the Iraq supplemental. 
   A ``yes'' vote would keep the war going through the end of President Bush's term. It would provide money to fuel an attack on Iran. It would force the privatization of Iraqi oil. It would escalate the insurgency. A ``yes'' vote would increase the number of troop casualties in the middle of a civil war. It would increase the number of civilian casualties. It would create a demand for more troops. It would force a cutback in the agenda of many in Congress because money that could be used for schools, health care, seniors and the environment would continue to be spent for war. It would force the destabilization of the Middle East and would erode the public's confidence in Congress. 
   It is time to end the war; to bring the troops home; to use the money that is in the pipeline to bring the troops home; to set in place a parallel process to stabilize Iraq. That is what House Resolution 1234 is about. I urge its consideration and support of Members of Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, in a few short days the Congress of the United States will have an opportunity to end the war in Iraq if it so pleases, or we will vote to approve the supplemental and give the President of the United States the money that he is asking for to continue the war possibly through the end of his term. 
   In the next 5 minutes, I would like to discuss the implications of Congress's action and a plan that would enable us to take a new direction in Iraq, to bring our troops home, to stabilize Iraq, to close our bases, to end the occupation, and to end the war. 
   Last week, I submitted to this Congress such a plan embodied in H.R. 1234. H.R. 1234 is a plan to end the war, and it contains a number of elements which were arrived at with the help of people who have long experience at the U.N. in peacekeeping missions and security missions, experts in international relations, and military experts. 
   Two days ago, the administration said that it has no plan B for Iraq. As a matter of fact, a senior general said, ``Plan B is plan A,'' which means that the administration is committed to a course of action which would keep our troops in Iraq through the end of its term. That is simply not acceptable. 
   In November, the American people voted for a new direction. In November, the American people changed the leadership of the Congress, voted to turn both the House and the Senate from Republican control to Democratic control, and I submit the issue was the war. 
   All across this country there is a great concern about the rising number of casualties; about that even when our troops serve and they come home after being injured, they are not being cared for; about the costs of the war, how we are seeing our budgets for housing and health care, for education, for seniors services, and, indeed, for veterans affairs reduced.  
   America is losing not only the lives of our soldiers, not only are we going into a great financial debt borrowing money from Beijing to fight a war in Baghdad, but we are losing our moral position in the world, continuing to prosecute a war that is simply based on lies. Let's face it, every assertion made that took us into Iraq has been ripped away as being a lie. 
   So what are we to do? H.R. 1234 does the following: It is predicated on Congress taking action to end the war, stop the funding. At that point, the administration will go to the world community and say, ``Look, the money is no longer here for the war. We are going to close our bases, we are going to end the occupation, we are going to bring our troops home.'' Only by asserting that we will end the occupation will we be in a position to be able to get help from the world community, which really doesn't want anything to do with this war absent the United States taking a new direction. 
   The insurgency is fueled by the occupation. It is well understood. So we end the occupation. But then that is not enough. We need the international community to help us build a peacekeeping and security force that would move in as our troops move out. 
   The elements of the plan embodied in H.R. 1234 are the following: Not only do we end the occupation and bring our troops home and get the international community involved, but we also create the context for a program of reconciliation between the Shiites, the Sunnis, and the Kurds. Right now there is no movement towards reconciliation, because with the U.S. occupying, the Shiites don't have any incentive at all to do that. We need to move out so that we can set in place a program of reconciliation and a program of honest reconstruction. No more theft from the American taxpayers or the Iraqi people by these contractors whose performance has been absolutely abominable, who have stolen billions of dollars. Give the Iraqi people a chance to have their own reconstruction program, with the jobs going to the people of Iraq so they can feed their families. In an economy with 50 percent of the people unemployed, we need to take a new approach and end the reconstruction program as it exists and start a new one. 
   In future presentations to this Congress, I intend to lay out the rest of H.R. 1234, which is the plan to end the war, bring our troops home, stabilize Iraq, and take a new chapter in America's relationship with the world.

   Unless Congress cuts off funds and brings our troops home, we will be in Iraq for years to come. And for what? 
   I have introduced H.R. 1234, a bill to bring our troops home and stabilize Iraq. 
   Congress must take the first step and stop funding the war. Support the troops. Bring them home. Support H.R. 1234

   Mr. KUCINICH. Yesterday, the value of shares on the Lisbon stock market dropped amid rumors of a military attack on Iran's nuclear research facilities. 
   The Bush administration has been mindlessly threatening the use of nuclear bunker busters on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Physicians for Social Responsibility have analyzed the effect of such an attack: ``Within 48 hours, fallout would cover much of Iran, most of Afghanistan, and spread into Pakistan and India. Fallout from the use of a burrowing weapon such as the B61-11 would be worse than from a surface or air-burst weapon due to the extra radioactive dust and debris ejected from the blast site. In the immediate area of the two attacks, our calculations show that, within 48 hours, an estimated 2.6 million people would die; over 10.5 million people would be exposed to significant radiation from fallout.'' 
   Do we really believe the best way to deal with Iran's nuclear facilities is to blow them up? Where are our spiritual values? our moral sensibilities? Is diplomacy more dangerous?

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Waters and all of the members of the Out of Iraq Caucus for keeping the awareness in this Congress on the need for America to take a new direction in the world because we are not just speaking about opposition to a war which should be opposed as illegal, but we are talking about the need for America to take a new role in the world, one where our country does not engage in preemption or unilateralism or first strike, one where America cooperates with the world community on matters of international security. 
   Remember, before 9/11, the felicity that America was held with in so many parts of the world. Remember, right after 9/11, how the world community opened its heart to the United States. 
   But over at the White House, just off the Oval Office, at a meeting of the National Security Council, Donald Rumsfeld and people in the administration were plotting the attack on Iraq the day after 9/11. 
   Yesterday the President mentioned 9/11 again. How many times does he have to mention 9/11 when he talks about Iraq? Why does he keep mentioning 9/11 when he talks about Iraq? Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. This is the big lie. And it is this big lie that the whole policy is based on. The Bible says, that which is crooked cannot be made straight. That becomes prophecy when you are talking about Iraq because everything about what the President is doing in Iraq is crooked. 
   Let us look at his speech last night. Why did he spend so much time talking about Iran? Let us think about this. We know that in the last year, this administration has taken steps to try to move within the soft circumference of war against Iran. Our Air Force selecting bombing targets, moving in place 24 bunker busters with nuclear tips into the region. Last night talking about moving an aircraft carrier into the region, talking about Patriot missiles into the region, rattling sabers for war. He appears to be setting the stage for a wider war in the region. He has blamed Iran for attacks on America. He is saying that he is going to disrupt Iran. He is going to add this aircraft carrier. Isn't one war enough for this President? Isn't one misguided war enough for this President? 
   You know, it is time that the media and the Congress, as Mr. Conyers pointed out, started to pay attention to what this President is saying and to what he does. It is imperative that Congress exercise its constitutional responsibility. And I think we are finally starting to see that. I think we are seeing people on both sides of the aisle realizing that there is a threat to our very democracy here; that our country is in peril by a Commander in Chief who has run amuck; who is without control; who stands by while Lebanon is basically annihilated south of the Litani River and 
   actually, we found out later, was encouraging it; who is letting a civil war grow and fester in Iraq because he is going to send more troops and pour them into it. Or, Members of Congress, is the talk about a 21,000 troop increase in Iraq for the purposes of dealing with problems in Baghdad? Is that just a pretext? Since very few things are on the level with this administration, will some of those troops instead be sent to the border with Iran to provoke a conflict? 
   These are questions we have to be asking because nothing this administration has said has been the truth. They don't have the capacity to tell a straight story to the American people, and they have spun the people of this country so much that people have become disoriented, but they are finally waking up, and they woke up in November. You want to talk about a surge? There was a surge in November. There was a surge to the voting booth, and that surge accomplished a new Congress. And the issue was Iraq, and our leadership told us that before the election. Three issues, they said, will guide this election: Iraq, Iraq, Iraq. And so was created a new Congress. And so it is imperative that Congress step up to its obligation. 
   We have to say that we are not going to give this President any more money for the war, but we have to use the money that is in the pipeline right now to bring the troops home and, Mr. Speaker, to set in motion a process, because we understand; we don't want to abandon the people of Iraq. But we know that the only way that we can get our troops out is to establish an international process, and we are not going to establish an international process until such time that we give up the occupation, that we remove our troops and close our bases because that is what is fueling the insurgency. So we can turn this around. 
   But this President and administration, which has such a talent for war, is determined to wreak chaos throughout the region. That is what they want. More chaos, more war, more control, as America moves towards fascism. Let's call it what it is. We are losing our democracy here. What do we stand for? What are those troops out there for? They believe in this country. They love this country. And if we love this country and the troops, we have to bring them home. But, instead, we have got an administration that is prepared to do something else because, in Iraq, his new plan is a plan for more door-to-door fighting. It is a plan for more war, more civilian casualties, more troop deaths, more wasted money, more destabilization in the region and more separation from the world community. This President wants to send more troops to Baghdad in the middle of a civil war. This President wants to continue a war that everyone knows in Iraq the situation cannot be won militarily. 
   Does anyone in this administration have any sense at all? Does anyone in this administration have any heart, that we can send our troops into this miasma and cause not only their deaths but the deaths of innocent civilians when the President talks about taking the restrictions off our troops? What does that mean? Is that licensing wholesale slaughter of civilians and then a counter reaction which results in our troops getting slaughtered? This whole thing is wrong. This is not what America should be about. And everyone knows that. 
   And yet the President last night had the nerve to talk about the Iraqi oil again. He can never talk about Iraq without talking about oil. They want to privatize Iraq's oil. Big surprise. Our troops were sent into Iraq. What was the first thing the administration had them do? Go to the oil ministry. They didn't have them go to protect antiquity, protect children. No. Protect oil.  Do you know the Baker Report pointed out that 500,000 barrels of oil are being stolen every day? With 140,000 to 150,000 American troops there, how in the world can we have all that oil being stolen? How can that happen?     
   Do you know what the market value of that oil is? If you run the numbers, about $62.25 a barrel. That is over $11 billion worth of oil a year stolen. The patrimony of Iraq is just being stolen. 
   How are we going to have peace if the U.S. is sitting on top of oil, talking about privatizing the oil for the President and all of his buddies in the oil industry? We are going to have peace in that region? Those people are going to step back and let that happen? No way. 
   That is why we have to get out of Iraq, end the occupation, bring our troops home, close the bases and give the Iraqi people control of their oil once again and begin a process of reconciliation. 
   We need to create a new context where the international community helps us, because we are on our way out of there. The international community is not going to help the United States as long as we are occupiers. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, this President wants to expand the war and the American people should be very concerned because it is not just the sons and daughters who are over there, but it is more who will be sent through an expansion of the war. It is the jeopardy of an escalation. 
   Have we not learned anything from the experience in Vietnam? Have we not learned that this march of folly we are on has been duplicated in the past? Have we not learned that the attempt to use raw military power is doomed to failure in a world that is interdependent and interconnected? Don't we know that we have a capacity to evolve? Isn't the American Revolution really a series of evolutions of our upward march into something better than we are? Aren't we prepared to take that? I think we are. 
   I think the American people know it is time for us to take this new direction, to reconnect and reunite with the world community. And we will begin that when this Congress takes a stand and says no more money for war; when this Congress takes a stand and says use the money that is there to bring the troops home; when this Congress takes a stand and says close those bases, don't privatize the oil. When we become actually a co-equal branch of government, which was the intention of our Founders in drawing up the Constitution and in ratifying the Constitution of the United States. 
   That is what America was always supposed to be about, not about an imperial Presidency. We rejected kings. We rejected autocracy when this country was founded. We didn't come through this long constitutional experience to the administration of George Bush just to turn our back on everything America is about, turn our back on what our real purpose as a Nation is. It is about taking care of our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (END THE OCCUPATION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I began to circulate a plan among Members of Congress to establish a path towards the United States exiting Iraq. 
   As we know, the administration is prepared to escalate the conflict. They intend to increase troop levels to an unprecedented number without establishing an ending date. 
   It is important for Congress to oppose the troop surge, but that is not enough. We must respond powerfully to take steps to end the occupation, close U.S. bases in Iraq and bring our troops home. These steps are necessary preconditions to the U.S. extricating itself from Iraq through the establishment of an international security and peacekeeping force.  
   Congress, as a coequal branch of government, has a responsibility here. Congress, under Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, has the war-making power. Congress appropriates funds for the war. Congress does not dispense with its obligation to the American people simply by opposing a troop surge in Iraq. 
   It is simply not credible to maintain that one opposes the war and yet continues to fund it. And this contradiction runs as a deep fault line through our politics, undermining public trust in the political process and in those elected to represent the people. 
   If you oppose the war, then don't vote to fund it. If you have money which can be used to bring the troops home or to prosecute the war, do not say you want to bring the troops home while appropriating money to keep them fighting a war in Iraq that cannot be won militarily. 
   That is why the administration should be notified now that Congress will not approve of the appropriations request of up to $160 billion in the spring for the purposes of continuing the occupation and the war. Continuing to fund the war is not a plan. It would represent a continuation of a disaster. 
   In addition to halting funding of the war, a parallel process is needed, and I have offered such a comprehensive plan to this Congress. And I am asking Members of Congress for their thoughtful consideration. 
   I would like to review some of the aspects of that plan. First and foremost, the United States must announce that it will end the occupation, close military bases and withdraw. The insurgency has been fueled by the occupation and the prospect of long-term presence as indicated by the building of permanent bases. A U.S. declaration of an intent to withdraw the troops and close bases will dampen the insurgency which has been inspired to resist colonization and fight invaders and those who help support U.S. policy. 
   Furthermore, this will provide an opening where parties within Iraq and in the region can set the stage for negotiations towards peaceful settlement. 
   Now, it is urgent that Congress take a stand now to take a new direction. The President last night articulated a plan for more war. He will have our troops fighting door to door with greater intensity. We will be in Iraq longer. 
   But there is another thing the President did, and this is another reason why it is urgent for us to act. This President, and I want everyone here to listen very carefully to this: This President is setting the stage for a war against Iran. We all know this. It is not a secret. He is talking about moving an aircraft carrier into the region, giving Patriot missiles to our allies in the region. He has rattled the saber with respect to Iran. He doesn't want to talk to their government; doesn't want to deal with Syria. 
   This President has only one talent, and that is the talent to make war and an illegal war at that, I might add. 
   Congress has to assume its power again to defend the American people, to defend the international community.     
   This administration is on the rampage. That the President, at the delicate condition of things in Iraq, would rattle the saber against Iran shows you the extent to which the administration has no intention of working to achieve peace. That is why Congress has to push now for the administration to end the occupation, close military bases and withdraw. 
   We have to announce that we are going to use the existing funds to bring the troops home and bring the equipment home. We have to order a simultaneous return of all U.S. contractors to the United States and turn over all contracting work to the Iraqi Government. 
   When we do that, when we take those steps, then the world community can be inspired that there is a new America that they will cooperate with. But until we do that, we are on our own, and our troops are on our own, caught in the middle of a civil war. 
   I will continue this in the next hour with Congresswoman Waters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, with this House on the threshold of granting the President $183 billion to continue the war in Iraq long past his term, it's an appropriate time to ask why are we still in Iraq, especially since the Democratic leadership promised the American people, 2 years ago, that if they voted Democrat, we'd move to end the war. Why are we still in Iraq? 
   Why are we still in Iraq? Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, with al Qaeda's role in 9/11. Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Why have we lost 4,000 of our finest troops? Why have we seen tens of thousands of Americans injured? Why have we seen over a million innocent Iraqis killed? 
   The war is based on lies. The Bible says, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. We need to start telling the truth here on this floor about the war in Iraq. And we need to end the war, end the occupation, close the bases, bring our troops home. Why are we still in Iraq? 
   This is a wake-up call for the American people. This is a wake-up call for the Congress. This is a wake-up call to stand for the truth.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, as my colleague Mr. LaTourette points out, our offices are getting deluged with requests and complaints from constituents who are suffering under this backlog that has been created, and some of the action that has been taken by our Federal Government is only going to compound it. So the amendment is aimed at being constituent-sensitive and also sensible with respect to the border crossings, particularly at Canada. 
   I think that Members realize, and all of us are here as legislators, but another important part of our responsibility is constituent service. And every one of us knows that we have been swamped. 
   So this amendment that I am proud to work with Mr. LaTourette on is aimed at not just deferring a problem, but at really taking a sound and sensible approach to what has become a nightmare in terms of our constituents not being able to get the kind of responsiveness they have the right to expect on these issues that relate to visas and passports. 
   So thank you very much, Mr. LaTourette, for your work on this, and I am very grateful that I have a chance to work with you on it.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, environmental awareness has created an awareness of the urgency of collective action to save our planet. We need a similar commitment to dealing with violence in America. Would that the tragic events in Blacksburg, Virginia, which took 33 lives, be an isolated example of the effects of gun violence in America. 
   In fact, about 32 people perish each and every day in America in handgun-related incidents. The level of violence in our society constitutes a national emergency. I am offering the following approach to change America's direction, away from death and disintegration and towards life and social cohesiveness. First, passage of legislation to create a Cabinet level Department of Peace and Nonviolence, H.R. 808; second, passage of H.R. 676 to create Medicare for all, not-for-profit health care system focusing on mental health care issues; and, third, a ban on handguns, legislation which I am currently drafting. 
   America is being engulfed in violence every day. Let's show that we have the wisdom and the courage to come from our hearts to meet this challenge.

Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues from the Commonwealth of Virginia in consideration of H.R. 5631, which names a postal facility in Charlottesville, Virginia, after Corporal Bradley T. Arms, a distinguished and heroic American serviceman. 
   H.R. 5631 was introduced by Representative Goode of Virginia on March 13, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on April 9 by a voice vote. The measure has the support of the entire congressional delegation from Virginia, and provides us with another opportunity to pay tribute to a member of our country's Armed Forces. 
   A 20-year-old University of Georgia student from Charlottesville, Virginia, Corporal Bradley T. Arms was assigned to the 4th Combat Engineer Battalion, 4th Marine Division, Marine Corps Reserve, out of Baltimore, Maryland.     
   Corporal Arms left college the summer before his junior year to enlist in the United States Marine Corps where he would later serve a tour of duty in Iraq until his tragic death on November 19, 2004. Corporal Arms was killed in action in the Anbar province of Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice made by Corporal Arms and pass H.R. 5631.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution. I am from Cleveland, Ohio, and all of us know in any community we are from, we come into contact with funeral directors and morticians. Funeral directors make it possible for families to be able to find a way to come to grips with a passing. Those transitions in life are very important moments for the survivors because we need help in being able to deal with a situation when we lose a loved one, and funeral directors perform a very valuable service. 
   I know as someone who represents the people of Cleveland that when I go to pay my respects to someone who has passed, I have the opportunity not only to meet the families that are grieving and comfort them, but also to see the work that is being done by those who are directing the funeral. It is something that is easy to lose sight of when you are moving into territory that is laden with grief. But it is also something that is appropriate for us at this  moment to pay tribute to because everyone who is involved in that work really has to achieve a level of sensitivity and compassion and caring so that they can help families deal with what for many is one of the most serious moments of their lives involving the passing of a loved one. 
   I want to thank Representative Wilson for his choice of career and his family's commitment to providing that kind of compassionate service to people, and also my colleague, Representative Foxx, for supporting this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for her expression of support for the resolution. I am also going to support the resolution. I just want to add one note of observation so that all those who are enjoying watermelons in this country also keep in mind the people who do the work, who pick those watermelons. It is hard work. 
   Today we have other bills under suspension that will give us a chance to celebrate the work of laborers. I think that it is important that we are grateful for those who pick the watermelons, and we have to recognize in this market where there are increasing restrictions on migrant workers, making it very difficult for farmers to get the kind of labor that they used to get. We are also seeing that many farmers are beginning to turn to prison labor. This should be a concern to us, all of us who want to make sure that all of those people out of jobs right now in this country who would like to work on farms would have the chance to get that work. 
   There is an article from the Christian Science Monitor that refers to this problem. I would like to include that in the Record. There also is an article about a settlement that was reached with workers regarding the attempt by a major agricultural company to circumvent Department of Labor rules and also circumvent the H-2A program that resulted actually in a settlement of a very prominent lawsuit about a month ago. I would like to include that article from the Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid.  
   U.S. FARMERS USING PRISON LABOR 
   With tightening restrictions on migrant workers, some farmers are turning to the incarcerated. 
   For labor-rights activists, federal immigration reform is the only viable solution to worker shortages. 
   Marc Grossman, spokesman for the United Farm Workers of America, says inmate labor undermines what unionized farm workers have wanted for years: to be paid based on skill and experience. ``It's rather insulting that the state [Arizona] would look so poorly on farm workers that they would attempt to use inmates,'' Grossman says. There is also the food-safety aspect, he says: Experienced workers understand sanitary harvesting. 
   ``Agriculture does not have a reliable workforce, and the answer does not lie with prison labor,'' says Paul Simonds of the Western Growers Association, a trade association representing California and Arizona. ``This just underscores the need for legislation to be passed to provide a legal, stable workforce.'' A prison lockdown would be disastrous, he points out, with perishable crops awaiting harvest. Other crops, like asparagus and broccoli, require skilled workers. 
   Although the ADC is considering innovative solutions--including satellite prisons--to fulfill companies' requests for inmate labor, prison officials agree that, in the end, the demand is too high. ``To go into a state where agriculture is worth $9.2 billion and expect to meet a workforce need is impossible,'' says Katie Decker, spokeswoman for ADC. At any given time only about 3,300 prisoners statewide (out of a prison population of about 37,000) are cleared to work outside. 
   ACI provides inmates to nine private agriculture companies in Arizona, ranging from a hydroponics greenhouse tomato plant to a green chile cannery. Unlike other sectors where federal regulations require that inmate workers be paid a prevailing wage and receive worker compensation, agriculture companies can hire state inmates on a contract basis. They must be paid a minimum of $2 per hour. Thirty percent of their wages go to room and board in prison. The rest goes to court-ordered restitution for victims, any child support, and a mandatory savings account. Private companies are required to pay for transportation from the prison to the worksite and for prison guards. 
   For Reyna, his work on farms over the past couple of years has added $9,000 in his savings account and given him a renewed respect for his Mexican father's lifetime of stoop labor. 
   At Dixon's farm, it's 103 degrees F. The inmate crews, wearing orange jumpsuits, work in a rhythmic line, calling out the number of the watermelons, and alongside the trailer. Just a few yards away, Mexican workers also work in a line. The inmates will quit at 4 p.m., while the immigrant laborers may work 13-hour days. ``We go back, they stay out there,'' Reyna says. ``It really isn't the same.'' 
   In the farm's office, watermelons line the counter, and photos of migrant workers hang in dusty frames. When asked why he doesn't sell the farm, Dixon says, ``the inmates, the migrants, these people are part of the family--that's why I keep this darn place.'' 
   Dixon says he supports the idea of a reformed, guest-worker program that would employ migrant workers during the harvest and return them to Mexico in the winter. But until that happens, he's willing to fight for the workers he's shared the land with for most of his life. 
   ``People are crossing the border because they are starving to death,'' Dixon says, ``I don't care what their status is. If they are hungry and thirsty, I am going to feed them. 
   ``I could sell this and quit,'' he continues, ``But I believe in supporting the American farming industry.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, all those of us who chose to be in elected office realize that we can't do our jobs unless there is a vast array of people who are in every category of employment, doing their jobs. And those workers in many cases, are people who are public employees. 
   Public employees may be people who are working in the streets. They may be people who pick up the garbage; they may be people who are working desk jobs. There are people who perform so many different functions. 
   At a Federal level, public employees are involved in providing direct service to people, whether it's making sure that people get their Social Security checks, their Medicare benefits, making sure that people have the opportunity to be able to have access to important government services. 
   Public service is a worthy profession. It's one that we ought to be encouraging young people to be involved in. It's one that needs to achieve more appreciation, not less. In this era where people try to attack government, they're actually attacking the people who do the work of government. We need to lift up the position of government workers. This resolution of Public Service Recognition Week is certainly one way to do it. And it allows us to demonstrate the involvement of public employees in the daily life surrounding our communities and, in turn, we're reminded that we live in the United States of America, relying on each other to ensure the stability and greatness of our country. 
   This is an important moment when we can recognize, through this resolution, everyone who serves. Each person who serves is worthy of respect. There is no level of service which is not worthy of respect. Dr. King pointed that out in some of his speeches when he talked about the street sweeper, how that street sweeper should sweep streets in a way that would reflect a great virtuoso performance. 
   We need to have that kind of awareness that those who perform the daily work of government, at a local, county, State and Federal level, and also at regional levels, are people who love their country, love their community and ought to be honored. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Having served in municipal government for many years, I understand how important the daily work of a city is. And I know that its people who repair the streets, who pick up the garbage, who make sure that the lights are repaired, who make sure the traffic signals work, who answer calls for fire or police protection, I know that all of those individuals love their community and they deserve to be appreciated. 
   Also, on a county level, in Cuyahoga County, you have many workers who are unsung for their service as clerks, people who work in recording deeds, people who work in collecting taxes, people who work in seeing that welfare services are given, case workers and others, they're all public servants and all public employees. This resolution is a fitting way to honor those individuals. 
   And I just wanted to cite specifically Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, because, having been involved with that constituency for so long, I understand the workers who make possible the work of those various governmental jurisdictions.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in support of H. Res. 49, which seeks to commemorate our Nation's postal carriers for their dedication and hard work. 
   By consistently delivering the mail in a timely and congenial fashion for over hundreds of years, mail carriers have become an irreplaceable component, not only to the economy of America, but to the culture and livelihood of our country. 
   I believe we have a tendency to forget how important the every day service is. Yet, if we were to go 1 day without the United States Postal Service, over 2,300 pieces of mail per carrier would go undelivered. 
   It is our mail carriers who help preserve the concept of universal service that is so integral to the work of the United States Postal Service.

Mr. Speaker, I'm hopeful that when this resolution passes, as I'm sure it will, that the United States Postal Service will post a copy of it in every post office in the country so that our letter carriers will be able to see that Members of Congress appreciate the work that they do. 
   Day in and day out our letter carriers are there. We rely on them to move the commerce of the country. Many of us are aware that the United States Postal Service is the third largest employer in America; that they employ over 700,000 career letter carriers, and 98,000 noncareer employees; that they move about 44 percent of the world's mail volume. They have an extraordinarily important work to do in providing for communication in this country, in making sure that people here from one another in carrying messages that are so important to our commerce. 
   The United States Postal Service employees, these letter carriers that we're honoring today, deserve our constant appreciation for the work that they do. I'm so glad that this House is involved in paying attention to the people that do the everyday work of our Nation that aren't often recognized. 
   We who are in these exalted positions always need to remember that the work of the government is done in so many ways, and when somebody, step by step, moves through his or her appointed rounds, every day, out there delivering the mail, they deserve just as much respect as those of us who are holding high public office. And so it's with a great deal of appreciation for the letter carriers that I stand in support of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I agree with my colleague from Wisconsin that this debate is a red herring, that it is an effort to perpetuate the abuse of the public trust by holing up the usual straw man to divert attention from the fact that our airwaves are being abused and our democracy is being eroded. It's an effort to fire up a base. 
   An informed electorate is essential to a strong democracy. One of the things that I would like to say to my colleagues, there is a conflation here where they are talking about freedom of the press. In the Constitution, freedom of the press relates to freedom that newspapers have. 
   The electronic media is governed by the FCC, and the 1934 act says that electronic media has to serve in the public interest, convenience and necessity. Just for the sake of keeping the record straight, you can talk about the freedom of the press and you may mean newspapers, radio and TV. 
   But it is a fact that the electronic media is governed by the FCC. Under the laws of the FCC, 1934, we are supposed to be operating a public interest, convenience and necessity. 
   Now, the proponents of this amendment and of right-wing corporate radio and TV are saying that they are threatened by this fairness doctrine because they think, incorrectly, it will require corporate radio and TV to be actually fair and balanced. I think they are probably threatened by such a prospect because they know that this particular type of radio and TV communication is not. 
   Now, any proposal to address the real issue here, restoring genuinely productive public debate, would need to restore accountability to those who use the publicly owned airwaves. The first step would be to reverse the extreme concentration of media ownership. Let's have this debate out in the open, not when some are trying to use a red herring to try to prevent reinstatement of a rule that this administration would never reinstate, never, not a way. 
   As Mr. Obey said, what's this debate about? It's a debate about something that's not going to happen under this administration, but it may happen under a future administration.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. 
   This legislation is a commendable improvement over the irresponsible Protect America  Act passed by this body in August. I am thankful that this new bill does not include retroactive immunity for telecommunication companies. However, the bill still falls short of ensuring the protection of the fourth amendment rights of U.S. citizens. 
   Blanket warrants, institutionalized by the Protect America Act, will continue with the enactment of the FISA Amendments Act. There is a legitimate concern that surveillance of persons abroad can potentially infringe on the fourth amendment rights of U.S. citizens. 
   These blanket wiretaps make it impossible to know whose calls are being intercepted by the National Security Agency, which increase the likelihood that the civil liberties of innocent U.S. citizens will be violated. 
   Specifically, in Section 101(702)(i) appears to include a review process of ``Certifications and Procedures'' but these procedures are of a broad nature, make no connection to specific individuals, provide for no showing of wrongdoing and contain no explanation of how collection procedures will actually work. Consequently, the bill fails to uphold standard fourth amendment judicial involvement. 
   Section 101 (702)(g)(3) states that ``a certification made under this subsection is not required to identify the specific facilities, places, premises, or property at which the acquisition authorized under subsection (a) will be directed or conducted.'' 
   Our county's fourth amendment provides that targets of search and seizure should be stated with particularity. The particularity requirement limits the scope of the search by assuring U.S. citizens whose property is subject to a search is, according to the Congressional Research Service, ``being searched of the lawful authority of the executing officer and of the limits of his power to search. It follows, therefore, that the warrant itself must describe with particularity the items to be seized, or that such itemization must appear in documents incorporated by reference in the warrant and actually shown to the person whose property is to be searched.'' 
   Under current law, reviews conducted by the FISA court do not receive names of targets or organizations which already places some limitation on particularity. But this bill appears to allow the Government to go even further by applying for very broad, year-long authority to issue directives to companies to comply with Government searches as they see fit. This broad authority is reminiscent of the current administration's secret spying program. 
   Furthermore, Section 101(702)(g)(2)(v) states that a requirement of certification for the targeting of certain persons outside of the United States is that ``a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information.'' FISA warrants already have a lower threshold of ``probable cause'' than criminal ``probable cause'' because the targets are assumed to be terrorist. The language in this section of the bill eliminates the need to find any wrongdoing whatsoever. Because, in the words of the Congressional Research Service, ``[t]he concept of ``probable cause'' is central to the meaning of the warrant clause'' of the fourth amendment, there are grave concerns about the erosion of our civil liberties. 
   In sum total, allowing the administration to run a surveillance program of such a broad and undefined nature qualifies as ``unreasonable'' under the fourth amendment. Although the purpose of the bill is to target foreigners abroad, by picking up calls coming into and out of the U.S., the program is not targeted at individual terrorists and individualized court orders are not required. The bill ensures that all targeted international communications are not covered by the fourth amendment even if a U.S. citizen is involved. The rights guaranteed by the fourth amendment dictate that the Government must have cause to spy on U.S. citizens. But the language in this bill ensures that the Government can spy on U.S. citizens who participate in international communications if there is no cause. If we permit our constitutional rights to be watered down out of fear, we have given up our democracy. Congress must stand firm and defend the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman for his generosity with the time, and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of S. 3197, which will help those who served this country save their home and save what they work a lifetime for. 
   It is very poignant that we could come to this bill at this moment, when we understand the importance of helping those who have served this country save their homes.     
   Because, actually, it does lead to that larger question because we are all in tune now with the fact that millions of Americans--including those who serve this country--through no fault of their own are finding their homes at risk, millions of Americans. And unfortunately, despite the best efforts of people on both sides of the aisle, the House will have delivered to it a bill from the Senate that does not directly address that question. Because unless this country takes a controlling interest, unless the Secretary of the Treasury would take a controlling interest in these mortgage-backed securities so they can negotiate on behalf of the homeowners to reduce their exposure to losing their home, this bill will be for naught. 
   Let's keep in mind that a central premise of the American Dream is owning a home. We understand that for our soldiers, and we should do something here. And we also need to understand that all over this country there are people who are watching these debates and wondering, are we going to do something to help them save their home? Because that's what we ought to be doing. And the way that we can do it, Mr. Chairman, is that instead of taking a strategy that assumes that the trickle is going to get down from the top by giving $700 billion to Wall Street, we instead focus on creating a solution for the homeowners and know that then the money will begin to percolate up to the banks and back to Wall Street instead of assuming the government gives the money to Wall Street, goes to the banks, and it gets to the people. Not under the bill that the Senate is sending over here. 
   So, while we want to do everything we can for our soldiers--and we should--we need to understand that looming here is one of the biggest challenges we've seen in American history to the concept of homeownership: Home is core, home is central, home relates to everything that we're all about. But home is in jeopardy here in the United States of America. Millions of mortgages are headed towards default. Millions of Americans are in danger of losing their home. And this Wall Street bailout, unfortunately, does not address it. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I sent a letter over to our Speaker yesterday pointing this out to her, telling her that we need to create a change that will enable the Secretary of the Treasury to focus in on this and to give him the ability to get a controlling interest in these mortgage-backed securities because, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, we don't have that right now. And unless you address that, all this is going to be for naught. You might see the market go up for a day if the House passes the bill, but you know what's going to happen: You're still going to see millions of Americans losing their homes.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Taking back my time, the bill has language which might be discretionary, but we in the House understand the difference between something that's discretionary and mandatory. And we also know that the way the bill is structured, unless you have a controlling interest in these mortgage pools, there's no way you can do anything because then you have to talk with 20, 30 other interests in order to be able to come to resolution. That's not going to happen. 
   So we need to be real about this; and, unfortunately, that isn't always the case in our Congress. And when we get real about it and connect to people's aspirations to save their homes with a real solid legislative structure to deliver on that, then the American people and then our economy can celebrate the wisdom of the Congress. Right now, that jury is still out. 
   I yield to my friend.

And the language of the legislation does not permit him to be able to have an effective role in saving people's homes. It talks about encouraging, it talks about ``may do,'' but it is not mandatory. And he doesn't have the additional power because there is no mechanism in there to give us a controlling interest so that we can actually create a fix.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Reclaiming my time, and thanking the gentlelady and the gentleman, I would say that the legislation doesn't fix the problem; that is the central point. It doesn't empower the Secretary to be able to get controlling interest of the mortgage-backed  securities. And that is the central flaw of the policies that we're pursuing. And millions of Americans who are in danger of losing their homes are not going to be helped. 
   I want to conclude by thanking Mr. Cannon for his service to the United States Congress.

   Mr. KUCINICH. And that's all I need. 
   When you look at the difference in the debate here, hear these words, ``we may save the world ``or ``we shall save the world''; ``we may save people's homes'' or ``we shall save their homes.'' I want a bill that says ``we shall save their homes.'' And that's not what the bill is that we're being sent by the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. If someone sticks up a bank, they get a jail sentence. Wall Street sticks up the Nation, they get a $700 billion bailout. The free market doesn't mean Wall Street should be free to steal from the American taxpayer. It's a free market, not a spree market. 
   The American values of fairness, frugality, and faith are being sacrificed to greed. The Senate took a dreadful bill that failed on the House floor and made no substantive changes to help homeowners and to enact substantive regulatory protections for investors, and instead attached tax provisions that have absolutely nothing to do with the underlying financial crisis. 
   Among the tax credits are tax credits for banks; we're borrowing money from banks to give money to banks, and we take toxic assets in return. The problem is people can't pay for their mortgages and their homes are endangered. You have to remember this: if this bill passes, it doesn't address the underlying crisis. People can't pay for their mortgages. The market may go up temporarily, but people will still be losing their homes, and what will we have accomplished? Wake up, America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (AN ANALYSIS OF THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, tomorrow this House of Representatives will take a momentous vote. It is a vote which will determine whether or not this House will be able to meet the needs of millions of homeowners who are facing foreclosure or whether or not we are simply going to go along with a $700 billion bailout to America's banks and to Wall Street, which has searched that somehow these benefits are going to trickle down. 
   We know that the Senate took action to pass its own version of the bill, and we in turn will have the opportunity to vote on that Senate version. I want to share with my colleagues an analysis of the Senate bill so that when we come to vote on it, we know exactly what this bill will not do. 
   In the bill that will be presented to the Congress, there are no stronger protections for homeowners and no changes in the language to ensure that the Secretary has the authority to compel mortgage services to modify the terms of mortgages. Now, this is significant because, as many economists agree, the central focus of the unraveling of the economy has been with people not being able to pay their mortgages for a variety of reasons. And when that happens in millions of homes, that has a percolating effect. It affects the banks and it affects Wall Street. You would think that given the fact that this is the underlying problem that we would be considering a bill that would directly address dealing with the terms of the mortgages. But this bill doesn't do that. 
   Let me tell you why this becomes very significant. I come from Cleveland, Ohio, a city which has been at the epicenter of the subprime mortgage crisis. But as we know, with the subprime mortgage crisis comes an entire range of bankruptcies, but also other properties start to get pulled under in terms of their value. 
   There is a neighborhood in my district called Forest City Park, Mr. Speaker. It is an area that I'm quite familiar with because my political career, which goes back 41 years, has had a lot to do with Forest City Park. It's a community where they had a very long-lasting civic association that came together in support of each other keeping up their community and in property. People met to improve playgrounds, to improve streets, to improve parks and properties. And people came together in a kind of sense of joy that people in communities have when they share a common goal and a common interest. And Forest City Park was one of those neighborhoods, like many neighborhoods across this country, where people took pride in their property, where people spent their whole lives trying to improve their property, and their property was their biggest investment. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you were to come with me to the Forest City Park area, there are still homes that are being kept up. There are still people who sweep their doorstep every morning and who even clean the streets on their own. But the good part of the neighborhood has been inundated and caught up in this subprime mortgage crisis. House after house after house has gone into foreclosure. House after house after house is being boarded up. Fires are starting in neighborhoods, taking up some of these properties that were once the pride of the community. 
   Now, we know how this subprime mortgage crisis started. We know it started with speculation on Wall Street where they created derivatives that came from groups of mortgage-backed securities. We know that property values were inflated deliberately, that people desperate for a home were told that they can get their home without any documentation, just sign on the dotted line. The value of it was inflated so Wall Street firms could have inflated assets on their books and then keep trading and trading and trading them, and then when property values started to drop, when there was an economic slowdown, people couldn't pay their mortgages, everything became unraveled. How many people's dreams were destroyed? Well, in Forest City Park there were many dreams destroyed. There were many people who saw a life's work disappear because of the lack of regulation. 
   And today they and millions of Americans like them look to Washington to try to say what are we going to do to help people who, through no fault of their own, are caught up in a colossal economic machine which has ground to a halt, putting its full physical pressure on the people at the great margins of our society and people in the middle as well? Millions of homeowners are looking to us. And yet we come up with a bailout that doesn't offer the homeowners anything. Over 300 pages of tax cuts and tax breaks that have absolutely nothing to do with the housing crisis at the center of this financial 
   storm. 
   My colleague Mr. Poe earlier in the day outlined some of the tax breaks: tax breaks for litigants in the Exxon Valdez incident, wooden arrows used by school children, tax breaks and earmarks for auto racing tracks, wool research, the Virgin Islands and rum. Now, maybe we could argue that some of those breaks in and of themselves ought to be considered. But why would they be in a bailout bill? The Senate expects us to consider and pass a bill we have already defeated merely because they have added millions of dollars of tax breaks that will strain the Federal budget even more. 
   So let me recap. We are coming back with a bill that has no stronger protection for homeowners, no changes in the language to ensure that the Secretary has the authority to compel mortgage servicers to modify the terms of mortgages, over 300 pages of tax cuts and tax breaks that have absolutely nothing to do with the housing crisis at the center of the storm, and, get this, no stronger regulatory changes to fix the circumstances that allowed this to happen. 
   How did it come to be that we could see this condition occur where speculation ran wild on Wall Street and yet the very agencies that ought to be watching it have had nothing to do with stopping it? The cop at the Securities and Exchange Commission walked off the beat, did not restrain firms that they knew were speculating with derivatives to a factor of 30 and 40 times. How could this happen? How could the Federal Reserve, knowing that banks were up to their ears in these financial instruments, not look to see how that might threaten the underlying financial stability of a bank? They walked off the beat. And so it comes to this Congress to decide what to do. 
   The thing about this that I think is the most vexing is this condition: that our government, which is already trillions of dollars in debt, in effect is going to have to borrow $700 billion from the banks, with interest, to give the banks a $700 billion bailout. Where are we going to get the money? We're not cutting $700 billion out of the budget; we're going to borrow the money. And when we borrow the money to give to the banks, the banks in return will give us their toxic debts. 
   We are being told this is the only way we can solve this financial crisis. Whom are we solving this crisis for? Are we solving it for homeowners? Obviously not. We're solving it for speculators. We're solving it for foreign investors because what we find out is that, as Brad Sherman has pointed out, hundreds of billions of dollars in this bailout will be used to buy toxic assets currently held by foreign investors. How did we get to this situation? 
   Under this bill the administration can buy any asset from any financial institution for any price. For those of you who are thinking this is going to bail out U.S. businesses, think again. We can have banks from all over the world scouring, scouring their financial ledgers, looking at their worst debts, and then they're going to send them over to the United States, and then the taxpayers of the United States are going to pay for them. 
   This bill should have had a provision saying that the Treasury can only buy assets proven to come from an American investor. That way it's about America. This bill should have something about taking care of America first.     
   We are not even taking care of America's investors first. We are not even taking care of America's speculators first. We are not taking care of America's homeowners first. This is about foreign investors. Is our economy so weak that we can't stand up, solve our problems here at home, or is it that we are so heavily leveraged, that foreign markets have such control over us, that they can force this Congress to pass a bill to help bail them out? 
   Foreclosures are devastating our communities. People are losing their jobs. The price of necessities is skyrocketing. This legislation, just like the one that we defeated a few days ago, will do nothing to solve the problems plaguing American families or help them to get out from under the oppressive debt that they have been forced to take on. 
   We have demanded language in the legislation that would empower the Treasury to compel mortgage servicers to rework the terms of mortgage loans so homeowners could avoid foreclosure. Owning a home is at the center of the American Dream. The American Dream is threatened here. The American Dream is under attack. The American Dream needs to be protected. The American Dream needs to be restored. The American Dream needs to get some life in it from this House of Representatives. Yet, the American Dream is going to have to wait another day. 
   We are told that if this passes, the market may go up. The market went up 485 points a day after we defeated it. But we are told that if this passes, the market may go up. 
   Let me tell you what is not going to go up. The hopes of America's homeowners. Because nothing is done for them in this bill. So who's going to tell the widow whose husband may have worked a lifetime to assure them a piece of property, which got into trouble because maybe she did a reverse mortgage, who's going to tell her that there's nothing in this bill for her? 
   Who's going to tell the laborer, who has worked day in and day out, working himself and his fingers to the bone, and where he is behind in his mortgage payments, and the bank is telling him, No, you can't give me $500. I want the whole $1,200 or we are going to go into foreclosure. Who's going to tell them that there's nothing for him in this bill? 
   This is a sad day in our Republic when we see the most pressing needs of the American people sacrificed to the speculators on Wall Street. And, of course, there is another dimension to this debate, and that other dimension deals with the free-market economy. What in the world are we doing here, where we are basically interfering in the market with a $700 billion investment, and suddenly we are telling all these speculators, Don't worry about it. The government is going to use the American tax dollars to ensure your risk. 
   The whole basis of the market, as all of us know, has to do with risk. You invest; it is a risk. There's nothing guaranteed. And so we are telling people who are in the market, particularly those who are in the market for billions of dollars, Go ahead and take a risk. Uncle Sam will back you up. Well, if we can tell that to the speculators, why can't we tell that to America's homeowners when they are not betting. 
   If someone goes to Las Vegas and bets the ranch, and loses the ranch, the casino didn't give them a new ranch. Speculators bet the ranch. And we are going to help restore their position with this legislation. 
   We are told there's a crisis in liquidity. We have been told by Bill Isaac, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that it's not the liquidity problem that is said to exist. That in fact banks don't want to loan to each other because of this psychology that is going on in the marketplace. They are afraid that other banks are going to go down. This is the United States of America. We should have the power to deal with this. 
   Ireland. Ireland. Ireland, the historic home of my mother's side of the family. Ireland figured out that they put the full faith and credit of Ireland behind the bank deposits, and they stabilized their economy. No one is losing any money. 
   We need innovative approaches here. We don't have them. What we have is a reward for speculation. The free-market economy, that whole idea is being shredded with this hand of the government moving in. 
   Now, people will say, Well, what is your plan? My plan is this. Number one. That we must have legislation that has an approach of dealing with the problem at its base. Helping the millions of homeowners. You help the many and the few will benefit. You help the few and the many will not benefit. We all know this. Trickle never gets down. 
   We also know this. If we can introduce a bill that can say that we can give Treasury or the FHA the ability to buy a controlling interest in these mortgage-backed securities, and work out something for the homeowners, we can have a whole new condition where the government goes to work for the homeowners of America. 
   Franklin Roosevelt understood the importance of coming forward with the New Deal plan that helped resurrect this country's economy. We can solve this problem of the homeowners. It could be that we create a new Homeownership Loan Corporation. But whatever it is, we have the ability to do it. 
   I am here to offer what I call a recovery plan for Main Street. And here's how we can prime the pump of this economy. We can prime the pump of the economy, number one, with health care for all. Insurance companies make money not providing health care. As the coauthor of H.R. 676, a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit health care system, Medicare for All, I understand that millions of Americans want health care that is accessible and affordable. Medicare for All will help businesses, large and small; will create jobs, as well as save the jobs of thousands of people, including those of doctors, nurses, and health care workers, who are currently leaving medicine because it is run by insurance companies. 
   One dollar out of every $3 of the $2.4 trillion spent annually in America for health care goes to the insurance companies. If we take that money, $800 billion in unproductive, wasteful spending, and put it directly into care, we will have enough money to cover everyone. We are already paying for Medicare for all, but not receiving it. 
   This is the way you get an economy going. This is the way you move money in the economy. Not only help people restore their homes, but also help people get the health care that they need. 
   Another way that you start to move money in the economy is through a prescription benefit for seniors. H.R. 6800 is the MEDS Act, which provides a fully paid prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors. I wrote this bill to help alleviate the economic pressure that comes from the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   We can pay for it by letting the government negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies the same way that they do with the Veterans' Administration. We can also do it--pay for it with reimportation. 
   The third thing we can do that can help the American economy is to stop the oil companies from price gouging. I was one of the first ones to step up and challenge the corrupt price gouging and market speculation of the oil 
   companies by proposing a windfall profits tax on oil and natural gas companies, with revenues put into tax credits for the purchase of fuel-efficient American-made cars. 
   However, it may be that nationalization is the only way to put an end to the oil companies' sharp practices. I mean, after all, we are nationalizing one of the largest insurance companies, with AIG. We are helping to nationalize the stock market and a lot of banks. Why don't we go for the gold, where the big money is, and nationalize the oil companies and then take the profits and give it back to the people so we can take a whole new direction in energy and not be strapped any more by these oil companies. 
   The fourth policy that I believe will help with the Main Street recovery plan deals with protecting the American homestead. As chairman of the Domestic Policy Oversight Subcommittee, I am working to protect people's basic right to have a roof over their head, whether as an owner or renter. It was my subcommittee which investigated and exposed the manipulation of mortgage markets. I am working to craft a new Federal policy so that neighborhoods with the highest  number of foreclosures can get the most help. 
   The fifth thing we can do to restore our economy is to have a program of Jobs for All. We know what Franklin Roosevelt did, the old New Deal economics, jobs for all, a new WPA program. That Jobs for All program, with the cosponsorship of Congressman LaTourette is a bipartisan New Deal-type jobs program that rebuilds America's infrastructure. It would create millions of good-paying new jobs, rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, and sewer systems. 
   The sixth thing in a plan to restore the American economy--there's an alternative to this bailout--is to have an American manufacturing policy. I am drafting legislation calling for an American Manufacturing Policy Act that, for the first time, will state that the maintenance of steel, automotive, and aerospace, is vital to our national economic security, and must be maintained through an integrated public-private rebuilding of our roads, bridges, and water systems. 
   I am calling for a new plan for Main Street under a Works Green Administration. It's the WGA turned into an environmental program where we focus on restoring the planet. This is one in which the government creates millions of jobs by incentivizing the design, the engineering, manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance of millions of wind and solar microtechnologies for millions of homes and businesses, dramatically lowering energy cost and reducing our dependence on oil. 
   We need a new trade policy, and that is the eighth plank in a plan that restores Main Street. And that is what we should be talking about here. But that is not what the bailout does. A plan that restores Main Street says we have to have fair trade. It must mean the end of NAFTA. This country has lost millions of good-paying jobs, and more jobs have been outsourced. 
   We must have education for all. That is the ninth plank. That is why I introduced H.R. 4060, a universal prekindergarten program to ensure that all children ages 3 to 5 have access to full quality day care. 
   We have to protect pensions. I am working to change bankruptcy laws so pensioners' claims will be first ahead of the banks, and that corporate executives who misuse pension workers' funds are subject to criminal penalties. We have to strengthen the Pension Benefit Guarantee Board. 
   Before I give the final six points in this, Mr. Speaker, and yield to my friend, Mr. Sherman, I'd like to ask the Speaker how much time is left.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I am going to yield 5 more minutes to myself, and then go to my good friend, Mr. Sherman, for as much time as he may consume.     
   Let it be said that there are other options here to stimulating the American economy. I just named 10 different points, and I am going to name an 11th. 
   We have to protect Social Security. From my first moments in Congress when I exposed Wall Street's efforts to privatize Social Security and attacked it in our own Democratic Caucus when privatization was being proposed, I have watched this effort at times to privatize Social Security. 
   Imagine if we had privatized Social Security. Imagine what happens when the market goes down and people begin to lose the only guarantee in some cases anyone has. We have to protect Social Security. It is rock solid through the year 2032 without any changes whatsoever. Protecting Social Security must be part of a plan to keep Main Street solid. 
   We have to protect bank deposits. It is a positive development that now people are talking about insuring a quarter of a million dollars of bank deposits through the FDIC. But the fact of the matter is, you can do that without being in a bailout bill. 
   Protecting investors. We need to bring back strong regulation to Wall Street. As chairman of domestic policy, I challenge the Wall Street hedge fund speculators who have been a threat to all investors, and I intend to keep active watch on the machinations of Wall Street. 
   We need a new national security policy called ``Strength Through Peace.'' I helped lead the effort against the Iraq war. We forget about the Iraq war in this debate often, but the truth of the matter is that war is going to cost the American people anywhere between $3 trillion and $5 trillion and as many lives as have been lost by our soldiers and as many lives as have been lost by innocent Iraqis. 
   We need a new direction in America. We have to end the war and bring our troops home. We must engage in diplomacy. We have to reduce the military budget and stop these outrageous cost overruns by firms like Halliburton. 
   We have to work so there is safety in America, safe neighborhoods, safe homes. I introduced a bill, H.R. 808, which creates a comprehensive plan to deal with the issues of violence in American society; domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, violence in the school, racial violence, gang violence, gun violence, that exact a social and economic toll on America. 
   We can work our way through these dilemmas. This is America. We have unlimited ability to solve our problems and to meet challenges. But we have to realize that what we have here is not simply an economic challenge, it is a spiritual challenge. 
   Today we are being challenged by greed. Greed will bring down our Nation if we don't stand up for those whose prime values have been fairness, frugality and faithfulness. 
   We must remember who we are as Americans. We can begin to strengthen ourselves by defeating this bill. Where people are being threatened, let us rise up with courage. Where people are being told that there is no other path, let us provide alternatives. And let us reclaim the Nation that we love. 
   Standing above us, rising above us is an American eagle, a beautiful American eagle at the canopy of this House. This eagle, which spreads itself over the fullness of this Congress, has a left wing and a right wing. That American eagle needs two wings to fly. That American eagle was able to soar a few days ago, and hopefully it will soar again tomorrow. 
   The motto under that eagle, E. Pluribus Unum, out of many we are one. Let us be one for the mass of Americans. Let us be one for the homeowners. Let us be one for those who want jobs. Let us be one for those who want health care. Let us be one for those who want a country they can call their own, the people of the United States of America.  
   1. Health Care for All: Insurance companies make money not providing health care. As the co-author of H.R. 676, a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit health care system, Medicare for All, I understand millions of Americans want health care that is accessible and affordable. 
   Medicare for All will help businesses large and small, create jobs as well as save the jobs of thousands of people including those of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who are currently leaving medicine because it is run by the insurance companies. $1 in every 3 dollars of the $2.4 trillion spent annually in America for health care goes to the insurance companies. If we take that money ($800 billion in unproductive wasteful spending) and put it directly into care, we will have enough money to cover everyone. We are already paying for Medicare for all, but not receiving it. H.R. 676 changes that. 
   2. Prescription Drug Benefit for Seniors: H.R. 6800 is the MEDS Act, which provides a fully paid prescription drug benefit, under Medicare, for all seniors. I wrote this bill to help alleviate the economic pressure that comes from the high cost of prescription drugs. We can pay for it by letting the government negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies as well as by permitting re-importation. 
   3. Stop the Oil Companies' Price Gouging: As you know, I was the first one to step up to challenge of the corrupt price gouging and market speculation of the oil companies by proposing a windfall profits tax, on oil and natural gas companies. with revenues put into tax credits for the purchase of fuel-efficient American-made cars, However, it may be that nationalization is the only way to put an end to the oil companies' sharp practices. 
   4. Protecting the American Homestead: As Chairman of the Domestic Policy Oversight Subcommittee, I am working to protect your basic right to have a roof over your head, whether as an owner or renter. I have Investigated and helped to expose the manipulation of mortgage markets, and I am crafting a new federal policy so that neighborhoods with the highest number of foreclosures get the most help. 
   5. Jobs for All: Congressman LATOURETTE and I have co-authored the bi-partisan New  Deal-type jobs program, H.R. 3400, ``Rebuilding America's Infrastructure.'' It will create millions of good-paying new jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems and sewer systems. 
   6. American Manufacturing Policy: I am drafting the American Manufacturing Policy Act, which for the first time, will state that the maintenance of U.S. steel, automotive, and aerospace industries are vital to our national economic security and must be maintained through integrated public-private cooperation, new trade policies, and investment. 
   7. Works Green Administration: I am also drafting plans for a green New Deal jobs program, in which the govemment creates millions of jobs by incentivizing the design, engineering, manufacturing, distribution and maintenance of millions of wind and solar micro-technologies for millions of homes and businesses, dramatically lowering energy costs and reducing our dependence on oil. 
   8. Fair Trade: The U.S. has lost millions of good-paying jobs, and more jobs have been out-sourced. As you know, I have helped to lead the way in opposition to trade giveaways. I strongly urge repeal of NAFTA. We must include workers' rights, human rights and environmental quality principles in all trade pacts. We must also protect the Great Lakes' water resources from the reach of multi-national corporations. 
   9. Education for All: I know families need help with the rising cost of day care. That is why I introduced H.R. 4060. a universal pre-kindergarten program to ensure that all children ages 3-5 have access to full-day, quality day care. 
   10. Protecting Pensions: I am working to change bankruptcy laws so pensioners' claims will be first, ahead of banks, and that corporate executives who misuse workers' pension funds are subject to criminal penalties. I want to fully fund the Pension Benefit Guarantee Board. 
   11. Social Security: From my first moments in Congress, I have exposed Wall Street's efforts to privatize Social Security and attacked it in the Democratic Caucus when it was being proposed. Can you imagine where seniors would be today if Social Security had been turned over to the stock market? Social Security is solid through 2032 without any changes. 
   12. Protect Bank Deposits: I will work to make sure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, has sufficient funds to provide for insurance of deposits up to $200,000 at all banks and savings and loans. This is an urgent matter since so many banks are said to be vulnerable. 
   13. Protect Investors: Bring back strong regulation to Wall Street. As Chairman of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, I challenged the Wall Street hedge fund speculators as a threat to small Investors. I intend to keep active watch over the machinations on Wall Street. 
   14. Strength through Peace: You'll remember when I led the effort against the ill-conceived Iraq war, which has now cost more than 4.100 U.S. soldiers' lives, cost U.S. taxpayers between $3 trillion and $5 trillion, and resulted in the deaths of more than a million Iraqis. We must bring our troops home and end the war. We must engage in diplomacy. We must reduce the military budget, and we must stop outrageous cost overruns by the likes of Halliburton. 
   16. Safety in America: I am proud of my work for peace. In July 2001, I introduced a bill, which today is H.R. 808, that for the first time creates a comprehensive plan to deal with the issues of violence in American society, particularly domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, gang violence, gun violence, racial violence, and violence against gays by establishing a Cabinet-level Department of Peace and Restorative Justice. This proposal has sparked a national movement and when implemented will save taxpayers millions of dollars. 
   16. Monetary Policy: It is long past the time that we looked at the implications of our debt based monetary system, the privatization of money created by the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. the banks fractional reserve system and our debt-based economic system. Unless we have dramatic reform of monetary policy, the entire economic system will continue to accelerate wealth upwards. I am currently working on drafting legislation for an `American Monetary Act' to address these and other issues in order to protect the economic well-being of America.  
   I yield to my friend from California, who has done such a wonderful job in organizing what is called the Skeptics Caucus, at a time where skepticism is called for. Through enlightened articulation of facts, he has come forward, as has my good friend and colleague from Ohio, Representative MARCY KAPTUR, who has courageously stood here day in and day out challenging this corrupt bailout. 
   I yield to my friends, and I thank you for your service to America and for your service to your communities.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, today's news indicates the Iraqis are beginning to be upset that the Bush administration, with the unfortunate help of this Congress, is trying to force the sovereign Government of Iraq to pass a hydrocarbon act which will give the U.S. oil companies control of $6 trillion worth of Iraqi oil assets. 
   Now, the wealth of Iraq, the oil wells, ought to be decided by an Iraq Government not under U.S. occupation. But yet, in the bill that was vetoed yesterday, there was a provision that would have forced Iraq to have privatized its oil assets or the U.S. would pull our troops without having an international security and peacekeeping force in its place. That is nothing but extortion. 
   As Congress comes together to put a plan to get us out of Iraq, let's stop trying to steal Iraq's oil. Let's bring our troops home. Let's have an international peacekeeping and security force that can come in as our troops leave. It is time to take a new direction, and that is exactly what H.R. 1234 is about.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, because our Nation is one.  
   I rise today in support of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Crime, violent crime in particular, has repercussions beyond the individual perpetrator and victim. It impacts family and friends and the surrounding community. 
   Hate crimes, whether motivated by the race, creed, or sexual orientation of an individual, terrorize a community. In 2005, 7,163 hate crimes were reported to the FBI. Over half of those hate crimes were motivated by race-related bias. Seventeen percent were crimes based on religion. One in six hate crimes is motivated by the victim's sexual orientation. The purpose and intention of these crimes extends beyond the crime itself. They serve to instill fear in others sharing that trait. 
   This legislation does not punish thoughts or speech; it punishes crimes motivated by bias against the race, religion, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation of the victim. It gives law enforcement additional tools to punish violent crimes. 
   Hate crimes are inherently divisive. Regardless of the group targeted, hate crimes undermine our collective ability to look past our differences and find common ground. If we as a Nation seek the eradication of acts of violence, we must address the underlying causes of that violence. We must uncover and address the hatred and discrimination that motivates these crimes. 
   This legislation is step towards that goal. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1592.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. The President's veto will stand, but now what will we stand for? 
   We say we want the war to end, but will we give the President the money to continue the war? We say we want our troops home, but will we continue to support the occupation? We know that U.S. contractors have been stealing from U.S. taxpayers and the Iraqi  government, but will we leave our troops in Iraq to protect them? We know oil has had a lot to do with this war, but will we let this President get away with attempting to privatize Iraq's oil wealth in the name of reconciliation? 
   We can still change course. We can deny the administration funds to continue the war. We can bring our troops home. We can stabilize Iraq with an international security force once we end the occupation. That is exactly what H.R. 1234 is about, and it is time that we started to look for alternatives which reflect this Nation's highest aspirations.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, today Congress is considering a long-term continuing appropriations bill to fund large portions of the Federal Government through the end of fiscal year 2007. This legislation is necessary because Congress did not complete the appropriations process last year. 
   There are many reasons to support this bill. For example, the bill increases Pell Grant funding to make college more affordable, IDEA funding by $200 million to help our neediest students, and Head Start funding by $100 million to give our youngest kids the opportunity to learn. Funding for housing opportunities is increased by $1.4 billion. Without the increase HUD would be forced to deny approximately 220,000 voucher renewals. 
   The bill also boosts funding for local law enforcement by increasing funding for both the COPS program and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants which directly impact funding for local law enforcement efforts. 
   NASA aeronautics funding, vital to the Cleveland economy, was increased by $166 million over the president's budget request. Furthermore, the bill contained an extension of the layoff ban, and prevents the NASA Administrator from gutting NASA Glenn. 
   I also support the $3.6 billion increase in veterans healthcare funding that provides service for an anticipated increase of at least 325,000 patients and to meet rising healthcare costs. In the same vein, Defense Health Programs are increased by $1.2 billion to provide care for service members and their families--including treating service members wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Our Nation is facing a crisis in healthcare. The bill provides necessary relief for the Community Health Center to finance over 300 new  or expanded health centers, serving an estimated 1.2 million new patients. The bill boosts funding for the Ryan White CARE Grants, the National Institutes of Health and the Indian Health Service. 
   The bill adds $1.3 billion to expand efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and TB. At the same time, $248 million was added to the Agency for International Development Malaria Programs to expand its bilateral global malaria initiative activities. 
   The bill adds considerable funding for the protection of the environment by adding $197.1 million for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. The revolving fund is distributed by formula and will fund additional water and wastewater infrastructure projects in every state, including Ohio. 
   The bill adds $100 million to cover operational shortfalls for parks, refuges, forests and other public lands; including facilities in northeastern Ohio. 
   The bill adds $1.5 billion for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources program to accelerate research and development activities for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. 
   Finally, the bill forces greater transparency in the activities of the World Bank, requiring them to report public disclosure of loan agreements between World Bank and its borrowers. This sunshine rule will help ensure the World Bank loans are not destructive to third world nations. 
   Unfortunately, this bill includes over $6 billion in nuclear weapons funding that I oppose. I have voted against the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which contains funding for nuclear weapons, since 2002. I cannot bring myself to vote for any legislation that further endangers the world. I regret not being able to vote for all the positive aspects of this bill, but my conscience and my concerns about the threat which nuclear weapons pose to the world matter more. 
   Furthermore, I am concerned about the potential loss of jobs in Cleveland relating to the BRAC process. I appreciate that the bill contains additional funds for the BRAC process. I urge the Committee on Appropriations to fully fund the BRAC process as soon as possible to ensure the additional DFAS jobs can be transferred to Cleveland as previously scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady. 
   As a cosponsor, I rise in support of H.R. 6460, the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act. This bill will reauthorize and expand a highly successful program designed to help address the issue of contamination in the Great Lakes. The lakes hold 20 percent of the world's fresh water and are an irreplaceable economic engine and drinking water source for our region. 
   As a Member of Congress representing Ohio and particularly the Cleveland area, we pride ourselves on our access to that fresh water and we know it is not only important for today, but it is also part of our future as well. So the program created by the Great Lakes Legacy Act is focused on cleaning up areas of concern, sites that are known to be contaminated with toxic chemicals. These chemicals can cause damage to the entire ecosystem as well as damage to human health. For example, in the past research has linked consumption of Great Lakes fish by pregnant women to irreversible health problems in the child. So it becomes obvious that this program which will help to clean up contamination that remains in the Great Lakes will have an appreciable impact on improving human health and will also give people confidence in the fish that they consume from the Great Lakes. 
   We can do better to protect our precious Great Lakes. This bill is an important step, and I urge my colleagues to support the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the United States illegally attacked and invaded Iraq in a war based on lies. Now those same lies are being used to tell the American people we must escalate and continue to fund the war in the name of the troops. Now, where does this logic end? 
   The war could go on endlessly as we profess our support for the troops. It is time to stop using the troops as pawns. It is time to stop using the presence of the troops in Iraq as a reason to keep funding the war. It is time to use the money we have now to bring the troops home. And when they come home, it is time to take care of our veterans. 
   I have presented this Congress with a 12-point plan to bring our troops home, end the occupation, and stabilize Iraq. Yes, we should stop the escalation, but we should also end the occupation by ending funding for the war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentlelady. 
   When I look at this Chamber this evening, there are so many Members of Congress here, each who wants to pay tribute to her. I'm going to keep my remarks brief, not in any way reflecting the depth of grief that I feel over Stephanie's passing. 
   We shared not only districts--because my district is mostly on the West side of the Cuyahoga River and hers 
   is mostly on the east side of the Cuyahoga River--but we shared political careers, having worked with each other for the better part of three decades. And the Stephanie that we saw here in the Congress, the one of the 100-megawatt smile, the boundless energy, the telling sense of humor, the challenging approach when you may not agree with her, that was the Stephanie that I knew for 30 years. 
   But we also shared a friendship about family. And she went through it in the last years of her life with the loss of loved ones close to her, her father, her husband. And when we would have major events in our lives, like we do with close friends--and she was a close friend to many of us--we would share many of these things. And there was a lot of sadness to share. But there was also a moment when, for me, I had one of the biggest things happen in my life, and Stephanie was the first person I wanted to share it with. 
   More than 3 years ago, I met a woman who walked into my office as part of a meeting for policy, and even though I had a very brief conversation with her, I knew something had happened at that moment. And I just knew at that moment that this was somebody I was going to marry, and I didn't even have a discussion with her about anything except for policy for more than about half a minute. And I ran down to the floor to tell my friend Stephanie, because that's the kind of friend she was. You would want to tell her when you thought something big was happening in your life. 
   And so I said, ``Stephanie, I met her.'' And she looked at me and her eyes widened, and she gave her big smile, and she went, ``Shut up!'' And she had that kind of way of assessing things brilliantly and quickly in a manner and a tone and a language that was Stephanie. 
   And she really brought the wisdom of a keen legal mind and melded it with a  street sense into this political persona that touched people all over this country and, indeed, in other countries as well. She had that magic. 
   Her presence is so powerful that I know I speak for other Members when I say that even at this moment, weeks later after her passing, we still can't believe it. That's how powerful a presence she was personally. And when she engaged you, you knew you were in a conversation and it was real. 
   When Members of Congress arrived to pay respects at the Bethany Church, we saw the sidewalks lined with her constituents. We saw a line to get into Bethany Church that was more than a block long. Hundreds of people waiting in line. 
   I had the chance to talk to some of them. You could see--you have to look into people's eyes, look at their faces, and you see the faces of people who are struggling with life, who are dealing with the kinds of problems that Stephanie came to Congress to address: trying to save their homes, trying to save their jobs, trying to keep their families together. And their eyes are searching today because they know they have lost a champion, and it puts such a great responsibility on all of us, a greater responsibility on all of us to uphold those things that she came to Congress for, the basic rights of people. 
   This was a loss for women who have strived for recognition in this body. This is a loss for African Americans who saw in her a champion, the first African American woman elected to Congress from the State of Ohio. 
   But what Stephanie did, her genius and her magic was she just broke all of the barriers. She went beyond gender and beyond race and emerged to a whole different political element. That's why she can't be replaced. And that's why, long after many of us have left this Chamber, people will still be talking about Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Stephanie, we love you, and we will remember you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago this Congress passed H. Con. Res. 469, which condemned the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and expressed the concern of the United States regarding the continuing decades-long delay in the resolution of the case. I voted for that resolution because I believe that justice deferred is justice denied, and all those who are responsible certainly must be brought to justice. 
   I joined my colleagues in saying that we don't condone terrorist actions or military posturing by any nation, nor have I seen any evidence that suggests that those who have been accused are innocent. 
   But responsible foreign policy means thoughtful and insightful discussion between nations that reflects a desire for both peace and security here at home, in the Middle East, and around the world. 
   In the 110th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed several bills calling into question the actions of either the country of Iran or the leaders of Iran with respect to their foreign or domestic policy. Today, this Congress has brought up, under suspension of the rules, an additional three bills designed with the same intent. 
   This continuous renewal of U.S. objections to Iran's and foreign domestic policy can easily have the effect, intended or not, to beat the drum for war against Iran. I mean, isn't this very familiar?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important legislation that will reauthorize a competitive grant program administered by the Department of Education to research, display, interpret and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad.  
   During one of the darkest eras of American history, a group of courageous Americans, both black and white as well as free and enslaved, bound together to form what would be known as the Underground Railroad. For example, the Father of our Nation, George Washington, complained in 1786 about how one of his runaway slaves was helped by a society of Quakers formed for such purposes. 
   The Underground Railroad was a decentralized network of people who helped fugitive slaves escape to the North. The railroad consisted of many individuals who knew only of the local efforts to aid fugitives, and none of the overall operation. Amazingly, the railroad effectively moved hundreds of slaves northward each year. According to one estimate, the South lost 100,000 slaves between 1810 and 1850. 
   This racially integrated movement to bring about social change has familiar heroes, such as Harriet Tubman, John Rankin and Susan B. Anthony; but there are thousands more who risked their lives to help others escape the clutches of slavery as they fled to the North. 
   For the slave, escaping to the North was anything but easy. The first step was to escape from the slaveholder. For many slaves, this meant taking great risks while relying on his or her own resources. The fugitives would move at night and travel between 10 and 20 miles to the next station, where they would rest and eat, hiding in barns and other out-of-the-way places. The journey was difficult, but the determination to gain freedom was immense. 
   The Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program Act of 2007 would provide competitive grants to nonprofit organizations around the United States to shed light on one of the most important and courageous social movements in our history, while preserving and interpreting artifacts found from this critical era. 
   Moreover, this important legislation would ensure a strong public/private partnership exists to supplement and leverage Federal resources along with funds collected at the State and local levels. Since 1999, over $15 million has been appropriated to seven different institutions. For example, in my home State of Ohio, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center has delivered highly interactive learning experiences for over 130,000 school children from around the country. This is an important effort to educate citizens across the country and around the world about the Underground Railroad movement in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, yes, we're looking at an anniversary of Iraq here. But let's talk about things that the American people can relate to immediately. Cost of eggs going up 35 percent in the last year, cost of milk going up about 23 percent, bread going up about 16 percent. 
   Now we know that Americans going to the gas pump are paying near $4 a gallon in many areas. 
   What does this all have to do with Iraq? 
   Well, we're in Iraq for oil. The oil companies are running our domestic energy policy. It's having an impact on the price of food. It's causing a great transfer of wealth upwards away from the working people and the middle class of this country into the hands of a few wealthy oil company owners. 
   We need to get out of Iraq. We need to end the occupation, close the bases, bring the troops home. We need to set in motion an international security and peacekeeping force that can stabilize Iraq as our troops leave. 
   We need to start taking care of things here at home. Americans are losing their homes, they're losing their jobs, they're losing their health care, they're losing their retirement security. It's time we started to take care of things here at home and get out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (OUR WORSENING HEALTH CARE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to work with Mr. Conyers on this important bill. Years ago, when we were having those meetings where the legislation was being crafted, we both knew what an important moment it would be for the people of the United States to be able to have a health care system they could call their own. So I want to take this opportunity, as I begin my remarks, to salute the work of you, Chairman Conyers, and all that you have done and your dedication in working to make sure that the American people have a national health care system, a not-for-profit system. That's been your dedication. It has been an honor to work alongside of you in this endeavor. 
   As we speak today about covering the uninsured, we speak to the American people who are worried about whether loved ones are going to be able to get the care that they need. There is nothing that is more troubling to a family than to have a family member who is ill and yet cannot get the medical care that would be necessary to bring them back to health. There are 50 million Americans who are uninsured. This means that when they see others able to get the care they need, they recognize in their own families that they cannot sustain the health of loved ones or themselves. 
   Why is it that people are uninsured? Well, there are many reasons, but the principal reason is they simply cannot afford health insurance. 
   You know and I know, Mr. Chairman, that there are so many families that are called upon to spend $1,000 or more a month for health insurance. The price of gasoline going up to more than $4 a gallon, the cost of bread going up, milk, eggs, meat, all basic staples of an American diet, costs going up, up, up. People are finding that the costs of health insurance is becoming prohibitive. And so they simply can't afford it. So they remain uninsured, thereby leaving their entire family health open to a challenge. 
   How many of us would be able to survive financially being uninsured? Very few, because what happens is that if you're uninsured and you have health care bills, you're going to have to pay those bills. And you know that the greatest cause of bankruptcy in the United States relates to people not being able to pay their hospital or their doctor bills. That's a fact of life. There is no other issue which touches the American family and touches all of us so uniquely as this issue of health insurance. People can't afford it. 
   This is a tragic problem, and it's getting worse. About 22,000 people die every year because they're not insured; this, according to the updated Institute of Medicine Statistic. But we cannot talk about the uninsured without talking about the underinsured as well. 
   There are another 50 million Americans who are underinsured. Now think about it. 50 million uninsured, 50 million underinsured. 100 million Americans. One out of every three Americans is touched by this dilemma, and that means virtually every American family is either uninsured or underinsured. If you're underinsured, premiums are expensive, you may not be able to pay the premium to get the coverage you need, Co-pays and deductibles go higher and higher and higher. The American family is owned by the health insurance companies. 
   What kind of a country are we becoming where the people of this country can't get the care they need because almost $1 out of every $3 is taken off the top by the for-profit insurance companies for advertising, marketing, the cost of paperwork, corporate profits, stock options, executive salaries, all of those necessary things that Mr. Conyers has talked about in the past. $700 billion a year goes for expenses that are totally unrelated to the cost of health care. $700 billion a year. Meanwhile, you have 50 million uninsured and another 50 million underinsured. The insurance companies own us. We don't own our own health care system. 
   And the insurance industry is the reason for the underinsurance problem and all that goes with it. Half of all bankruptcies are tied to medical bills. And of those medical bankruptcies, listen to this, three-quarters of those had insurance before they got sick. So even with insurance, people are going bankrupt because they can't handle the co-pays and the deductibles. 
   Of all of the medical bankruptcies in the United States, three of every four people had some kind of insurance before they got sick. They fell victim to insurance companies whose only way to make money is to deny care. How do these insurance companies make so much money? They make money by not providing health care. They make money telling people, We're not going to pay that claim. You're not going to be covered. The more people they can exclude, the more money they will make. It is a racket. Health care is a racket. Health insurance, rather, is a racket. 
   It is time we took America in a new direction, which is what the Conyers' bill, that I am proud to be a co-author of, is all about. H.R. 676 is to provide for a universal, single payer, not-for-profit health care system. It finally puts health care back in the hands of the doctors and the patients. It eliminates the insurance companies as middle persons, middlemen, who are able to skim almost $1 out of $3 off the top while 50 million Americans are uninsured and another 50 are underinsured. 
   We need to make a clear distinction between ``health care'' and ``health insurance.'' The two are very different.  Doctors and nurses are not the same as health insurance CEOs. Doctors and nurses provide care. Insurance companies' CEOs, they deny it. There's a difference between health care and health insurance. If you have insurance, it doesn't mean you have health care. There are increasingly creative and complex ways to deny health care: co-pays, deductibles, premiums, limits on daily coverage, caps on annual amount spent, failing to cover certain medical conditions, failing to cover certain accidents, failing to cover certain drugs, failing to cover certain total spending amounts, like the privatized Medicare Part D donut hole, failing to cover hospital stays, or minimizing the coverage. 
   What has this hunt for profitability in health insurance cost us? Well, it's cost us a lot of money. It's driving up health care costs beyond the reach of most Americans. Listen to this statistic: between 1970 and 1998, the number of doctors and other clinical personnel increased by 2.5-fold. During the same time, the number of health administrators increased more than 24-fold. There's an explosion of the number of people in the health care system who do not provide care. They instead are told to deny care. 
   It boils down to this: The insurance industry is the problem. It is not the solution. The only way to truly cover everyone is to guarantee access, not to force working men and women to subsidize the insurance industry whose very presence forces people to pay out of pocket to keep the industry alive. We need health care run by doctors and their patients, not insurance companies. Health care is a basic human right. 
   So Mr. Conyers, I just want to express to you my appreciation for the work that you have done to bring this issue before the American people. To have had the opportunity over many of the last few Congresses to work with you on this has really been an honor. 
   And when we remember when we go back home, you to Detroit and me to Cleveland, and we see people who need care, our hearts break when we realize that they can't get it because insurance has just ended up being a big business and they don't care about people anymore. It's all about making money. All about profit. 
   So Mr. Conyers and I know that H.R. 676 stands alone in an increasingly crowded field of ideas that are going to provide health care for people. And this proposal addresses the accessibility problem. 
   Employer-based insurance requires people to continue to work in order to keep their insurance even if it worsens their health. Now, I know Mr. Conyers worked with the UAW for years and years before coming into Congress. What happens if you lose your job? People end up, after their COBRA benefits are gone, they lose their health insurance. Our proposal says if you lose your job, you're still insured. If you don't have money, you're still insured. If you have a pre-existing condition, you're still insured. This covers dental care, vision care, mental health, long-term care, prescription drugs. It's all covered. 
   Mr. Conyers, thank you. Thank you for your dedication to the American people. Thank you for your willingness to lead the way, and I'm just so grateful that I have the opportunity to work with you.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, you mentioned, Mr. Conyers, that many doctors support this. When I first ran for Congress in 1972, doctors generally opposed this idea. But there is a new survey that just came out published in the Annals of Internal Medicine that states that of the physicians that were contacted in this survey, thousands of them, 59 percent of the physicians now support a national health care plan, which is why I believe when you have the physicians supporting it, the patients support it, all we need is to keep adding to the numbers in the House of Representatives; and with Mr. Conyers' leadership, we're on our way to creating a national health care system. 
   Once again, I want to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to share some time with you here. And again, the people of the United States owe you a debt of gratitude for your relentlessness and your dedication on this, and I intend to keep working at your side as we move forward to create a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit health care system. H.R. 676, the Conyers bill, is the way to go.

   Mr. KUCINICH. As the Chairman is always able to do, you bring up another point that I think would be helpful to amplify, and that is that people will say, Well, how are you going to pay for this? Well, guess what? We're already paying for a universal standard of care; we're just not getting it. $2.3 trillion a year goes for health care in the United States. $2.3 trillion. 
   And when you consider the fact that the for-profit insurance companies take almost $1 out of every $3 or almost $700 billion a year, you take that $700 billion--am I right, Mr. Chairman--you put that money into care and you suddenly have enough money to cover all Americans, the underinsured and the uninsured are covered. So how we pay for it is using the money that's already in the system, and that's how much profit is in health care insurance or health insurance these days.     
   Mr. Speaker, once again, thank you for bringing out that point about the fact that it is able to be covered without any current change in our system, although we have a funding formula that you've helped to develop that will guarantee that all Americans will be covered far into the future. 
   So again, Mr. Chairman, I'm grateful the people of Detroit are fortunate to have you representing them in the United States Congress.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, just prior to the invasion of Iraq on March 17, 2003, the price of a barrel of oil was $30.01, and the price of a gallon of gas was $1.77, the average. 
   On July 29, 2008, the price of a barrel of oil was $122.21, and the average gallon of gas, $3.96. 
   The invasion of Iraq was about oil, but it didn't result in more oil or cheaper gas. It resulted in war profiteering by oil companies who benefited by keeping Iraq oil off the market. Remember the secret meetings between the administration and the oil company executives before the war? 
   Well, today, I'm going to introduce a bill which prevents U.S.-based oil companies from development of and investment in the petroleum resources of Iraq. This will discourage U.S. oil companies from profiting from the war and will stop the further theft of Iraq's oil resources by the very interests who have profited from the war for oil, the U.S. oil companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, the Paycheck Fairness Act is an important step in eliminating the gap that exists between the compensation of men and women, a gap that has existed for decades and persists to this day despite the gains made by women. 
   Among other things, the bill will close a loophole that some employers exploit to avoid compensation discrimination lawsuits, and will put gender discrimination on a par with other types of discrimination. 
   Men and women are equally important to the health and vitality of the American economy, and it is high time that compensation reflect this fact. 
   Women who work full time continue to make roughly 25 percent less for equal work and with equal qualifications to their male counterparts. 
   This means that a woman makes significantly less money based on one single factor: Her sex. This is sexist, unconscionable and discriminatory. 
   This discrimination impacts women in their struggle for economic independence, and their ability to care for their families and themselves. It continues to promote the backward thinking that undervalues and devalues women in the United States and around the world. 
   I support H.R. 1338 because I believe it moves us in a direction that closes the discriminatory wage gap. It is long overdue. 
   I look forward to the day when everyone in the labor force is treated equally. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   Mr. KUCINICH. This House cannot avoid its constitutionally authorized responsibility to restrain the abuse of executive power. The administration has been preparing for an aggressive war against Iran. There is no solid, direct evidence that Iran has the intention of attacking the United States or its allies. The U.S. is a signatory to the U.N. Charter, a constituent treaty among the nations of the world. Article II, section 4, of the U.N. charter states, ``All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.'' Even the threat of a war of aggression is illegal. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution makes such treaties the supreme law of the land. This administration has openly threatened aggression against Iran in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the U.N. Charter. 
   This week, the House Appropriations Committee removed language from the Iraq war funding bill requiring the administration under Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution to seek permission before it launched an attack against Iran. Since war with Iran is an option of this administration and such war is patently illegal, then  impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against Iran.

   I believe the best way to honor the memory of those who died on September 11 is to tell the truth of what the Administration did in the wake of September 11. The Bush Administration launched a war against Iraq, conflating the true tragedy of September 11 with lies about weapons of mass destruction. 
   On this, the sixth anniversary of September 11, it is important that Congress wake up to the truth and exercise its obligation under the Constitution to save our nation from being destroyed from the lies that took us into Iraq, the lies that keep us there, the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home. The September 11 resolution that Congress considers today should have made reference to those matters. It does not, so I cannot support it. 
   This Administration long ago politicized the September 11 attacks, distorted it, and dishonored it. If Congress really wanted to honor the memory of those who died on September 11, we would cause the full truth to be told to the American people. If Congress really supported our troops we would bring them home and not provide more funding for the war.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, elections are the bedrock of our republic. Our capacity to function as a tripartite government of co-equal branches rests in the public's assurance that those of us entrusted to administer and legislate assumed our offices through free, fair and open elections. 
   I laud Congressman Rush Holt and his efforts to ensure the integrity and accuracy of our voting system. However, today I must rise in opposition to H.R. 5036, the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008. 
   H.R. 5036 acknowledges that problems exist in our system of voting, and that without action now these problems will grow. For this reason the legislation has merit. While H.R. 5036 includes a provision to reimburse jurisdictions that convert their paperless voting system to one that includes a paper trail, it may also include optical scan technology. I have serious concerns with optical scan technology and its susceptibility to hacks and security breaches. Recent tests and research have demonstrated the ease with which a person can manipulate the configuration files to change votes. What's more, most of the equipment necessary to accomplish this can be purchased off-the-shelf at most technology stores. 
   Indeed, our voting system needs improvement, but replacing one flawed technology with another will do little to garner public faith in the electoral process. Let us make comprehensive electoral system reform a priority, and let us enact a policy that ensures system integrity, system security, and that each and every vote is counted.

   As some of my colleagues are aware, on July 19, 2006, I introduced legislation to this Congress calling on the President to appeal to all sides in the crisis in the Middle East for an immediate cessation of violence and to commit the United States diplomats to multiparty negotiations with no preconditions. This resolution specifically related to the events that brought violence to Lebanon and to Israel as well. 
   I want to say from the start that I took that position because I believe that Israel has a right to survive and Israel is entitled to its security and so, too, the people of Lebanon have a right to survive and were entitled to their security. 
   I think that it is regrettable that our government did not become immediately involved in diplomatic relations so that we could have been able to forestall the disaster that was visited upon south Lebanon where tens of thousands of structures were leveled. 
   I am not speaking about this theoretically, Madam Speaker, because my wife and I went to south Lebanon and surveyed the damage, and it was utter destruction. 
   I would refer my colleagues to Amnesty International's report regarding the destruction in south Lebanon.

   Furthermore, under this bill Federal employees can use up to 8 additional weeks of accrued sick leave in connection with the birth or adoption of a child. 
   Paid parental leave benefits have many beneficial aspects for our workforce. Perhaps the most important aspect of paid parental leave is that it gives parents the ability to take care of the vital needs of their child without incurring the financial hardships associated with unpaid leave. Working families employed by the Federal Government should not have to choose between their child's well-being and their financial stability. 
   Paid parental leave has also been shown to provide increased productivity and employee morale. Additionally, it will have the important effect of helping to recruit and maintain the highest quality workforce. 
   Copious research confirms what common sense tells us: it is important for parents to have time to bond with and attend to the health and development of their children. Our families and communities are better off when parents are able to have this critical time with their children.

   Mr. KUCINICH. I regret that I'm going to have to oppose this bill. And let's look at the numbers: $161.8 billion for the war it keeps going, a war that we all know now was based on untruths. It keeps going a war that has cost the lives of over 4,000 of our brave men and women, tens of thousands of injuries to our troops and over 1 million innocent Iraqis killed as a result of the war. The costs of the war will run to $3 trillion. And here instead of keeping a commitment that we made back in 2006 to end the war, we're continuing it into the term of the next President, and $161.8 billion of this bill will go for the war. 
   That's actually, of the total bill, 86 percent is going to go for the war, $24.7 billion in domestic spending. How much of this is going for unemployment? Well, $12.5 billion or about half of it over a period of 2 years. How much is going to the veterans? Less than $1 billion over 2 years. So we're using the veterans here and unemployed persons to put forth a war bill that is going to cost $161.8 billion. 
   We have to establish what our priorities should be in this country. Yes. Getting people back to work should be a priority. Imagine if we put $100 billion into that. Yes. Giving veterans better benefits ought to be a priority. Imagine if we put $100 billion into that. But no. We're putting $161 billion into a war that we know is based on untruths. 
   It's time that Congress take back its real authority here. And its real authority under article 1, section 8 is to declare war. This administration led us into a war based on lies. It is time for us to regain our ability to create an effective checks and balances, to reclaim our position as a coequal branch of government. You do not do that by continuing to fund this war.

Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, but Iraq did have one thing that is very valuable, and that is oil. The administration helped create the war. They created the Coalition Provisional Authority, and they helped to create the Maliki government. Now they are withholding information and classifying previously unclassified information. Again, no WMDs in Iraq, but oil. 
   I maintain that has all been about oil. The administration looks the other way on corruption, putting great pressure on the Maliki government at this very moment to privatize 20 to $30 trillion worth of Iraqi oil assets. Now, they can classify all they want over at the White House. But this is still about oil. It can't classify nearly 3,800 deaths of our soldiers. They can't classify 1 million deaths of innocent Iraqis. They can't classify that the war will cost up to $2 trillion. They can't classify that they are borrowing money from China to fight a war against Iraq. This war has been based on lies. We agree we should all abide by the rules of the House.

   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentlelady for her kindness. 
   I rise in opposition, regretfully, to the rule and to the underlying bill. If we really wanted to protect the taxpayers, we wouldn't be paying cash for trash, $700 billion in taxpayers' funds which turns our beloved U.S. Treasury into a toxic landfill. 
   This plan is a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street speculators, bankers, lenders who operated for years without the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the oversight of the Federal Reserve. 
   This legislation doesn't do anything to punish the speculators. It rewards them by having taxpayers bail them out. It has no additional controls of speculation, no strengthening of oversight, no mention even of the implications of the Financial Modernization Act, which took down Glass-Steagall, which provided those post-depression era protections so we wouldn't be in this situation that we're in right now. 
   And I would predict, Mr. Speaker, that we will be right back here in a few months with the same kinds of problems because we're not solving the underlying matter here, which is a distortion of the economy because of speculation run wild on Wall Street. 
   Now, we've been given a plan, we haven't been given alternatives. Alternatives would have required Wall Street to pay for its own bailout. This plan doesn't suspend dividends, it doesn't force shareholders or creditors to directly contribute to the bailout. This plan rejected a .25 percent stock transfer tax that would have raised $100 billion from Wall Street. 
   This is legislation that is further proof that our government has been turned into an engine that accelerates the wealth upwards, taking money from the pockets of the people of this country and putting it into the hands of the few.     
   That is what our tax policy does. It accelerates the wealth of America upwards. That is what the war does. It accelerates the wealth of America upwards. That is what our energy policy does. It accelerates the wealth upwards into the hands of the oil companies. That is what our financial policies do. And that is what our national debt has done. It has doubled in the past 8 years, $700 billion that taxpayers are being put on the hook. 
   When Wall Street makes a profit, it is their profit. When Wall Street loses money, our people lose money. Seven hundred billion dollars. Why aren't we bailing out those millions of Americans who are losing their homes? Why aren't we addressing the fact that 50 million Americans don't have any health care? It is absolutely astonishing that we are talking about giving $700 billion in taxpayers' money which comes in the failure of the Fed through a quadrupling of public and private debt during the time of Mr. Greenspan, up to $43 trillion, and we have no discussion at all about the underlying monetary policy.

   Mr. KUCINICH. A very simple proposition is facing this House; do we keep the war in Iraq going or do we end it? Do we use the money to bring the troops home or do we use the money to keep them in Iraq? 
   The lives of our troops are on the line. The war cannot be won militarily. Why do we stay? Why do we tell our troops to keep fighting? Who is going to explain to the families of the troops the consequences of Congress' decision? And why isn't our Democratic Party taking the leadership to immediately end the war? We can do it. We don't have to give the administration another $120 billion to keep the war going. We don't have to let more troops die and have more civilian casualties. 
   My bill, H.R. 1234, provides a path to bringing our troops home, ending the occupation, closing our bases and stops the occupation of Iraq. We do not have to keep funding this war. The money is in the pipeline to bring the troops home. Let's end the war, bring the troops home, and bring in international peacekeepers to stabilize Iraq. We can do it once we end the occupation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. The great amount of borrowing this country is doing from nations like China, Japan and Korea is weakening our dollar. Many of us know that we're borrowing money from China to prosecute a war in Iraq. 
   So with a weakened dollar, we're seeing a contribution here to the increased cost of crude oil. The weaker the dollar, the higher the price of crude oil. Today, the price of crude oil is about $130 a barrel. We're looking at gasoline this summer perhaps as much as $5 a gallon. 
   We need to change our economic direction. We need to strengthen our dollar. We need to change our monetary policy and stop borrowing. We need to go after these oil companies, not only in international courts with antitrust action, but we need a windfall profits tax. And if that fails, we need to have an honest discussion in this country about why we let the oil companies control the economy anyway. 
   Why don't we start looking at ways to take back the power of the people so that we can have control of our own destiny?

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5658, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   The United States military is unmatched. I therefore maintain that the defense-industrial complex follows a misguided strategy of buying weapons that provide Americans with no increased safety. 
   We need to provide for the traditional sense of security by first ensuring economic security, health security, and job security for all. The roots of terrorism begin not in hatred, but in desperation. All people, no matter their ethnicity, seek the basic necessities such as food, clothes, shelter, good health, and the ability to earn a decent living. If you can level this playing field, there is no desperation that may potentially evolve into radical hatred. 
   I will support a defense budget that matches real threats to our security with appropriate defensive measures. Our foreign policy should promote economic stability worldwide, thereby eliminating the roots of terrorism, which stem from desperation. This bill does the opposite by continuing policies of fear and aggression. 
   The advocates of advanced weapons systems fail to understand these new systems do not match up an effective defense capability with the terrorist threats. Only a new approach to foreign policy can effectively mitigate the terrorist threat. 
   The ever-rising cost of our military is not financially sustainable. Since 2001 this body has appropriated over $700 billion for all war-related expenses. This bill will provide an additional $70 billion in emergency funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as we know, the Administration is asking for hundreds of billions of additional funds that this body is expected to consider in the near future. 
   Now more than ever it is clear that this Administration's occupation and reconstruction of Iraq has failed. The war, waged under false pretenses, has decimated Iraq. Destruction has permeated most of the country. War has taken a very heavy, very real toll. There is increasing concern that militias in Iraq are arising to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. I have urged this body to stop this illegal war. We must honor our troops by bringing them home. I cannot support any measure that continues the illegal occupation of Iraq and continues to undercut our nation's credibility. 
   The greatest tragedy of this war is the 4,080 American soldiers that have been killed. Tens of thousands more have been injured. Estimates conclude that 1,000,000 innocent Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion. 
   Furthermore, the claimed ballistic missile threat is grossly exaggerated. Terrorists do not possess ballistic missiles and the few nation states that do have such missiles have no desire to face the retaliation of our ballistic missiles. 
   Accordingly, I thank the Committee for undercutting the President's request of $954 million for the European Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD) program. However, this bill still authorizes $582 million for the European GMD despite a lack of assurance that the system will work or make our national more safe. Funding for the European GMD should be removed entirely. 
   The Administration claims the system is necessary to defend the U.S. from a long-range ballistic missile attack from Iran. However, Iran is unlikely to pose such a threat to the United States in the foreseeable future due to the immense technical difficulties that Iran would have to overcome to create a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. 
   In fact, it is conceivable that the U.S. will have its own technical difficulties to overcome before such a system can be proven viable. The Test and Evaluation department of the Pentagon cautions that many more tests under realistic conditions would be needed before conceding our capability to shoot down an offensive missile. 
   The citizens of the Czech Republic and Poland clearly reject the proposed agreement. Public opinion polls in the Czech Republic and Poland reflect strong opposition to the placement of the radar and interceptors in their respective countries and strained their relations with Russia. The GMD proposal has by some accounts exacerbated U.S.-Russia relations. The U.S. has shared information but not meaningfully cooperated with Russia in these negotiations. Because the Czech Republic and Poland fall within the boundaries of former Russian influence, U.S. action with regard to the GMD have been perceived by Russia as an intrusion. There can be no doubt that U.S. efforts to impose the GMD are perceived as an obstruction to the diplomatic ties between our nations. 
   A total of $9.3 billion will go to the Department of Energy for nuclear weapons activities, $1.455 billion of these funds will wisely go to Nonproliferation programs and I thank my colleagues for their work to increase these programs by $208 million above the President's request. However, this still leaves roughly $7.9 billion that supports and maintains nuclear stockpiles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. This afternoon I will move to refer an Article of Impeachment to the Judiciary Committee. 
   People ask me, don't we have more important things to do? Think about this. This war has cost us our constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties. Is there something more important? 
   The Iraq war will eventually cost between two and $3 trillion, meaning every American family will pay upwards of $30,000 for this war. The war has contributed substantially to higher gas prices. Is there something more important? 
   Over 4,100 of our troops have died, and as many as 1 million innocent Iraqis have perished. Is there something more important? 
   There was never any proof that Iraq constituted an imminent threat to our national security, or that Iraq had the capability or intention of attacking the United States. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 or al Qaeda's role in 9/11. Yet Congress was led to believe otherwise. 
   The Bible says, ``You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.'' Congress must know the truth in order for our Nation to remain free. In a free Nation nothing is more important than the truth.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (CONDEMNING 1994 ATTACK ON ARGENTINE JEWISH CENTER -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in condemning the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July of 1994. Those responsible for the destruction and loss of human life that resulted from this attack must be held accountable. I believe that anyone who acts to destroy innocent life, regardless of their position in society or the country they are from should be subject to international scrutiny for their actions, and that includes our own officials. 
   In the past I have voted in favor of similar resolutions that condemned the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center and sought to hold accountable those responsible for this deplorable and heinous act. Accordingly, today I once again support all aspects of this resolution that calls for justice on behalf of the 85 people murdered and 300 wounded. 
   However, H. Con. Res. 385 is not without problems in its current form. First, the final ``Whereas'' clause of the resolution contains information that is speculative rather than factual. The resolution appears to draw this clause from an ABC News report from June 19, 2008, which provides no hard evidence to support the stated claims. Second, the resolution claims in the penultimate ``Whereas'' clause that Iran ``in recent years'' has opened ``nearly a dozen embassies in Latin America.'' In recent years, Iran has opened two embassies in Latin America, one in Colombia in 2007 and one in Nicaragua in 2007. These events brought the total of Iranian embassies in Latin America to eight. According to experts at the Congressional Research Service, CRS, the  other six Iranian Embassies in Latin America have been around for a long time and include those in Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. 
   As such, I do not agree with the decision by the U.S. House of Representatives to treat this resolution as noncontroversial. The bill could unwittingly place this Congress in the position of promoting an attack on the country of Iran through its attempt to draw parallels between Iran and those responsible for the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center. Instead of using speculative and factually inaccurate information which is clearly included in this bill, the resolution should be redrafted and kept to readily ascertainable facts about the unconscionable attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in 1994. 
   This body must not allow an attack on innocent people be used as a pretext for an attack on more innocent people. Indeed, we have done this once with disastrous results. I believe this House is better served by demanding sensible and responsible diplomatic foreign policy initiatives. This body should demand that the administration engage Iran immediately in high-level diplomatic negotiations without preconditions. By neglecting this duty and employing tactics that maintain an ongoing condemnation of Iran, without opening diplomatic channels, this body is systematically destroying every available route to restoring peace and security in the Middle East, which could have devastating consequences for Israel, as well as our troops in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I want to thank the gentlelady from Ohio, my long-time friend and colleague, Representative MARCY KAPTUR, for organizing this special order and for her continued commitment to addressing the foreclosure crisis, which is ravaging communities like Toledo and Cleveland and cities across this country. 
   I would also like to thank Chairwoman MAXINE WATERs for her persistence in addressing the foreclosure crisis and the subprime crisis. It has been an honor for me to work with Congresswoman Kaptur and Congresswoman Waters on this very important matter. 
   My subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Domestic Policy of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, a subcommittee of which I am chair, has held five hearings over the past 2 years regarding the foreclosure crisis, predatory lending, lasting effects. 
   What we have found is that neighborhoods are totally blameless victims of the foreclosure crisis. When homes are lost to foreclosure, property values of the surrounding homes plummet, and owners lose equity in their homes. 
   When you go into a neighborhood like Slavic Village in Cleveland where I am from, and you look how certain people built a community there, an older ethnic community, where people would take pride in their property, in keeping it immaculate, and then you see foreclosures in the community. Suddenly, someone who has had a property that they have kept up for 40 or 50 years, sees their property values decline because of the foreclosures around them and sees their property actually at risk, the fire hazards and safety hazards because of the foreclosures around them. 
   We are seeing people who, for their family, their home is their biggest investment in their life. That's the way it is for most Americans, seeing their investments threatened because of the sharp practices in subprime lending, and in the foreclosure scandal that has hit this country that Congresswoman Kaptur has been one of the primary spokespersons on in terms of exposing. 
   We see these demands for services, municipal services. They increase as the foreclosures run wild, more police and firemen needed where there are a lot of foreclosed homes, increased social services and code enforcement. When you think of a foreclosed home, the cost of the foreclosed house goes far beyond the cost of the house itself. 
   Unfortunately, the State of Ohio and the City of Cleveland have been at the center of this crisis for some time now. According to RealtyTrac, which is an independent group that gathers information on foreclosure, four Ohio cities are in the top 20 metropolitan areas affected by foreclosures. Moreover, the Cleveland metropolitan area ranks sixth in the Nation for percentage of houses in foreclosure, which is a staggering statistic, considering our city's modest property values and the cost of living, which in Cleveland is relatively inexpensive.

   Mr. KUCINICH. If I may, what the gentlelady points out, you can look at the research that uses foreclosure and lending data. In Cleveland, the parts of the city where the depository banks made very few prime loans, they also saw the highest percentage of subprime loans and subsequently, or consequently, the highest number of foreclosures. 
   So it should not be the least bit surprising to anyone, then, that the pattern of foreclosures mirrors almost exactly the established patterns of low-prime loans and high numbers of subprime loans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. No question about it, to my good friend MARCY KAPTUR. 
   If we dug a little bit deeper, and we saw some patterns that reflected exactly what you have said, the patterns coincide with some cases with African-American neighborhoods because look what happened, for years, people in African-American neighborhoods couldn't get any loans at all. Then what happened, the Community Reinvestment Act passed, and we were supposed to have access to, finally, to credit. 
   But banks found a way to go around that. Instead of offering prime loans to people of color, they came up with these subprime packages, no document, low-document loans, didn't tell people exactly what was going on. As a result, people got in over their heads, and they ended up losing their homes. 
   Now, some people will say well, they should have known. But let me tell you something. One of the most significant challenges in this country is a issue of financial literacy. It's not a color issue, because the fact of the matter is that working-class people are and people who are poor people, often have a problem with the issues of the financial literacy. It's called reading the fine print, looking at the bottom line. 
   So you rely, and you trust people, you think that the banks are going to be fair to you. You think they are going to tell you the whole story. You think that you are going to be given an opportunity to have an even break. Not so, you look at the filings.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Exactly. 
   So what they did is they started in African American neighborhoods, but when the subprime financial machine started to churn and Wall Street looked at it as a tremendous opportunity for growth and the hedge funds looked at it as an even greater opportunity for the unregulated massing of capital, then what you had is the reach from the African American communities, which are primarily located in cities, into the suburbs. So you have this foreclosure pattern spreading. 
   We're also seeing increases in high-cost loans and vacant properties in the outer suburbs and, guess what, in the outlying counties where the more recent data is analyzed further. Where previously the phenomenon was in the African American census tracts in eastern Cuyahoga County, we see the problem spreading west of the census tracts where there are larger Hispanic and Arab populations as well as our seeing the problem spreading into every direction it can spread in Cleveland--east, south and now west.

   Mr. KUCINICH. There has been no accountability here. The Federal Reserve was supposed to be monitoring the practices of the banks. They didn't do that. The Securities and Exchange Commission was supposed to be watching the movement on Wall Street as this juggernaut of subprime loans moved along, and it was supposed to be providing a measure of discipline or regulation. They didn't do that. 
   The Justice Department was supposed to be watching these mergers that were occurring that were really driven by the desire of not just capital formation but by the desire to get their hands on these newly packaged instruments that were beyond the reach of regulators, and the Justice Department didn't do anything. 
   When the hedge funds began to accelerate with the help of the subprime loan packages, no one was thinking that there was a bubble that was growing. All the danger signs were there. The regulators looked the other way. 
   Now, what does this mean? What it means is that somewhere in America there is a family who had a dream for a home, and that dream was the most important dream in their lives, just to have a place they could call their own, and they weren't able to get credit up front for a while. 
   Finally, they went to an institution that said, ``Okay, We'll give you a subprime loan. Here are the terms.'' They accepted those terms. Then they found themselves unable to meet the terms and found they really didn't understand what they were getting into. Then, 
   suddenly, people who had worked their whole lives to have just a little bit of the American dream found it gone in a flash. 
   This is not right. This cannot be what America is about. America can't be a place where it's all about the government's being an engine for accelerating the wealth of America upwards, because that's what it has been about. It has been about that in the financial markets to the detriment of the small investors. It has been about that in the banking industry as we've seen a lot of the smaller banks just destroyed. In the insurance industry, the wealth accelerates to the top and in the utilities industry. 
   You can take every single industry in this country, and the wealth has been accelerated to the top. Essentially, you take what you have without the regulation, and you have the destruction of the American dream. 
   I want to thank my colleague Marcy Kaptur for giving me this brief moment to have this colloquy with her. 
   We're very fortunate to be joined by a woman who has equally been a champion for the people from Los Angeles. Before I leave, I want to once again acknowledge what an honor it has been to work with my dear friend Maxine  Waters, who, with Congresswoman Kaptur, came to Cleveland, Ohio, and you heard the testimony of the people from Cleveland. 
   I come from one of America's great cities, and it is getting overrun, not only by the subprime lenders, but by the secondary market that has come up as continuing the predatory conduct. It is going after people who have lost their properties, and it is seeking to drive the properties down further, selling homes for a few hundred dollars even or for under $10,000 if you can imagine that in this day and age. 
   So thank you, Marcy Kaptur. Thank you, Maxine Waters. Let's stay on this because we need to make sure there is justice on behalf of those who aspire to own homes, and we need to help fulfill the American dream for people who work hard and who pay their bills to have the chance to be able to have a piece of that dream without getting cheated by these so-called lending institutions that are all about grabbing whatever money they can, whether they have any scruples or not. 
   So thank you, Marcy Kaptur and Maxine Waters.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Before I leave here, I just want to make one other point, and this could be the basis of further discussion. Congresswoman Kaptur earlier today mentioned it in a meeting among the Democrats in our meeting. 
   We are looking at a debt-based financial system, at a debt-based monetary system where money equals debt, and we are at the beginning of the end of a democracy when we see this system causing the wealth to go upwards. 
   So I want to thank you for mentioning that. I just wanted to mention that because we really need to look at how money is created. How does it end up that we have so many people in debt and that we have a few who are rolling in dough? 
   This debt-based financial system is something that needs to be explored more thoroughly. The fractional reserve needs to be explored more thoroughly, and the role of the Federal Reserve in facilitating these heists has to be made known. 
   So I thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to spend some time with you.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (PREDATORY LENDING -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, American families are hardworking, good people and deserve financial security. American families do not deserve to have their physical, emotional and financial security compromised by predatory lending practices engaged in by the subprime mortgage industry. 
   Subprime mortgage lending includes a wide range of loan products. What these loans have in common is they are marketed to hardworking people made vulnerable by credit scores that disqualify them from traditional loans, or who have limited credit history, thereby limiting their borrowing power. 
   Subprime lending is associated with significantly higher levels of foreclosure than prime lending. Subprime lenders make excessive mortgage loans of up to $1 million, and often the borrower can obtain ``cash out'' refinancing. Additionally, subprime lenders offer 100 percent financing to those with poor or limited credit. 
   Subprime lenders are known for their forceful marketing techniques which have included ``stated income'' loans in which the borrower is not required to provide documentation. This places American families in danger of borrowing a substantially greater amount that what is reasonably affordable and places them in danger of being unable to meet their mortgage payments. 
   These predatory lending practices are forcing large numbers of American families into foreclosure. Said another way, American families are losing their homes, homes they worked hard for. They are enduring undue stress and emotional instability when confronted with this prospect. 
   In 2002, approximately 2.2 million American families who had borrowed money from a subprime lender had either lost their home to foreclosure or were thought to be in danger of foreclosure. The Center for Responsible Lending conducted a study in which they found that millions of American households will lose their homes and as much as $164 billion due to foreclosures in the subprime market. 
   In Ohio, my home State, Ohio leads the Nation in the rate of foreclosure.  Ohio's foreclosure rate is roughly three times the national rate, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
   Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, my hometown, had 11,000 foreclosures in 2005, more than triple the number a decade earlier. In Cleveland in 1995, local depositories held about 60 percent of the market share of mortgages. By 2005, that number dropped to 20 percent. What has happened to my city in the past decade is a story that is reflected nationwide. 
   Furthermore, foreclosure has a detrimental effect on the greater community. Neighborhoods with foreclosed properties are likely to experience declining property values. These lower property values and the corresponding decline in owner equity can contribute to additional incidents of foreclosure. Foreclosed homes are often left vacant for extended periods of time and can subsequently attract crime to neighborhoods. 
   I began my political career as a representative in the inner city. Later I became the mayor of Cleveland, and during my tenure, Cleveland became the first city to sign the Community Reinvestment Act agreement pursuant to the newly enacted CRA of 1977. The Community Reinvestment Act was passed to prevent lending institutions from withholding home loans or insurance from communities labeled as economically risky. The act was intended to expand credit and depository services to low- and middle-income communities. 
   The CRA extends and clarifies the longstanding expectation by hardworking Americans that financial institutions will serve the convenience and needs of their local communities. The CRA established a regulatory regime to monitor the lending, investment and services offered by banks in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and has resulted in significant benefits. 
   Lenders and community organizations have signed 428 CRA agreements totaling $4.1 trillion in reinvestment dollars between the CRA's enactment in 1977 and the beginning of 2005. The CRA has also facilitated a surge of home loans to low-income and minority households. 
   Despite these positive gains, significant financial problems continue to exist in low- and moderate-income communities. 
   When you look at a map of Cleveland, a pattern begins to emerge that is not unlike that being experienced by other communities. The pattern is this: In geographical areas where the number of subprime mortgage loans is the highest, the number of foreclosures for the same geographical area will also be high, while the number of prime loans made by depository banks will be relatively few. 
   Looking at the same geographical area, we find that neighborhoods experiencing these trends are predominantly African American neighborhoods. Lack of access to prime loans, a high frequency of subprime loans and a high rate of foreclosures are by no means specific to any racial group, but the pattern certainly carries an overtone of America's historic denial of equal rights based on race. 
   A recently published report entitled ``Paying More for the American Dream'' found that Citigroup, Countrywide, GMAC, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo all originated a substantial volume of both higher-cost subprime and lower-cost prime loans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that I am proud to join my colleagues, including my friend and colleague from Cleveland, Mrs. Tubbs Jones, and I thank her for the work she has done on this issue.  
   American families are hard-working, good people who deserve financial security. American families do not deserve to have their physical, emotional and financial security compromised by predatory lending practices engaged in by the subprime mortgage industry. 
   Subprime mortgage lending includes a wide range of loan products; what these loans have in common is that they are marketed to hardworking people made vulnerable by credit scores that disqualifies them from traditional loans or who have a limited credit history thereby limiting their borrowing power. 
   Subprime lending is associated with significantly higher levels of foreclosure than prime lending. 
   Subprime lenders make accessible mortgage loans of up to $1 million and often the borrower will be able to obtain ``cash out'' refinancing. Additionally, subprime lenders offer 100 percent financing to those who have poor or limited credit. 
   Subprime lenders are known for their forceful marketing techniques which include ``stated income'' loans in which the barrower is not required to provide documentation supporting claims of income. 
   This places American families in danger of borrowing a substantially greater amount than what is reasonably affordable and places them in danger of being unable to meet their mortgage payments. 
   These predatory lending practices are forcing large numbers of American families into foreclosure. Said another way--American families are loosing their homes; homes that they have worked hard for. They are enduring undue stress and emotional instability when confronted with this prospect. 
   As 2006 came to an end, approximately 2.2 million American families who had borrowed money from a subprime lender had either lost their home to foreclosure or are thought to be in danger of foreclosure at some point in the near future. 
   The Center for Responsible Lending conducted a study in which they found that ``millions of American households will lose their homes and as much as $164 billion due to foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market.'' 
   My home state of Ohio leads the nation in the rate of foreclosure. Ohio's foreclosure rate (3.3 percent) is roughly three times the national rate, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

   The report also found that for these seven lenders, the percentage of total home purchase loans to African Americans that were higher-cost was six times greater than the percentage of higher cost home purchase loans to whites. (41.1 percents vs. 6.9 percent). 
   Loans to Latinos that were higher-cost loans were 4.8 times greater than the percentage of higher cost home purchase loans to whites (32.8 percents vs. 6.9 percent). 
   In each of the cities examined, the seven lenders combined showed larger African American/white and Latino/white disparities than those exhibited in the overall lending market. 
   Foreclosure and discrimination in lending practices are serious problems for America's cities. We are now on the brink of a massive wave of foreclosures in this country. 
   Although there are a significant number of individuals and organizations working to reverse existing problems in the lending system and create viable alternatives to foreclosure and subprime mortgages, the tide will not be turned because the magnitude of the problem outstrips even the best of their abilities and efforts. 
   To turn the tide of foreclosure in America's cities, leadership at the federal government level is necessary as well. We must examine the problem and the steps that can be taken before it becomes bigger and beyond us all.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, today I join my colleagues in Congress in celebrating Israel's accomplishments over the past 60 years. I am happy to be co-sponsor of this congratulatory resolution. However, like many Israelis and Palestinians, I have concerns about Israel's future, its stability, its security and the prospect for peaceful coexistence for both Palestinians and Israelis. One of those concerns relates to the ongoing lack of resolution on the dispossession of Palestinian property and the dislocation of Palestinians after Independence. It must be remembered that about 700,000 Palestinians became exiled. Much Arab property was appropriated. And about 500 Arab villages were destroyed. On December 11, 1948, the United Nations passed Resolution 194, affording Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homes in Israel, or to compensation for their property should they choose not to return. To this day, the mandate of U.N. Resolution 194 has not been fulfilled. Unfortunately, this failure remains as one of the most significant barriers to the realization of a two-state negotiated solution. 
   I am also concerned for those Palestinians who did not flee and who became Israeli citizens after Independence. According to the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, today there exist 20 Israeli laws which explicitly discriminate against the Palestinian minority in Israel, who constitute 20 percent of its population. In its 2005 Annual Report, the U.S. State Department said that ``[There is] institutionalized legal and societal discrimination against Israel's [Arab] Christian, Muslim and Druze citizens. The government does not provide Israeli Arabs with the same quality of education, housing, employment and social services as Jews.'' 
   Finally, Israel has a right to security and a right to defend itself. Accordingly, I am concerned that the 40 year military occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem has been and continues to be brutal and unjust and undermines the security of Israel. It is a fact that the government of Israel continues to support the construction of settlements on Palestinian land, perpetuating the consequences of dispossession and exile. Additionally, I am concerned that the government of Israel has increased the number of checkpoints which destroy a viable Palestinian economy and a vibrant civil society. I am concerned that the Israeli government has erected a wall, often on Palestinian land, that divides Palestinians from Palestinians, rather than divide Israel from the West Bank. As stated by Judge Elaraby of the International Court of Justice in his 2004 Advisory Opinion on the legality of Israel's separation barrier, ``The fact that occupation is met by armed resistance cannot be used as a pretext to disregard fundamental human rights in the occupied territory.'' This conundrum of a dialectic of conflict further separates Israelis and Palestinians alike from hopes for peace. 
   H. Con. Res. 322 eloquently states the many reasons why I celebrate Israel's accomplishments and I sincerely wish it a bright future. I only wish to add that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many Israelis and Palestinians as well, Israel's future will be bright only if it includes an open dialogue with Palestinians, a respect for human rights and international law, and a society built on coexistence and tolerance. Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live in peace with justice and I encourage the United States government to help Israel achieve that so the joy of future anniversaries will be unalloyed. 
   I support the resolution in the spirit of reconciliation to which we must all inevitably turn, to achieve peace and justice with our brothers and sisters from whom we may be estranged.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I'd like to follow up on the comments of my good friend from Illinois. The high cost of gasoline is troubling all Americans. $3.50 a gallon, approaching $120 a barrel. Now I just would respectfully suggest that the administration has a lot to do with this. This administration, which has a great familiarity with the oil industry, has pursued policies, including the war in Iraq, that has led to the price of oil being driven up. Even the threats on attacking Iran have at one time or another helped to increase the cost of the price of a barrel of oil. 
   There is one thing that this Congress can do immediately to start to gain the American public some relief, and that is to bring a windfall profits tax forward. Enforce some discipline in the marketplace. Bring these oil companies to heel by using the power of Congress to tax the excess profits and take  that money and put it into a fund that would enable Americans to get tax breaks for the purchase of energy efficient vehicles. This is the approach we ought to be taking.

   Mr. KUCINICH. The President's threat of the use of military force against Iran is an impeachable offense. When our Commander in Chief says all options are on the table, it is unmistakable. That means a military strike, even the use of nuclear weapons. Instead of inviting calamity upon himself, our Nation and the world, President Bush should reopen serious diplomatic negotiations with Iran to de-escalate tensions and resolve all issues, including Iran's use of nuclear power. 
   We must reject the idea that war is inevitable and that war is diplomacy by another means and work to remove the barriers of misunderstanding between Iran and the U.S. and Iran and the region. 
   Instead of making statements or passing resolutions which sets the stage for conflict with Iran, Members of Congress should convene to seek a way to avert military conflict with Iran. 
   I will be contacting my colleagues to discuss how we can create a course of action which creates peace through integrating Iran with the world community and addresses all issues which are at the core of the conflict.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, yesterday a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives that gives  the promise of transforming our country and the world. H.R. 808 creates a Department of Peace and Nonviolence. It is now supported by 52 Members of the House of Representatives, and it is supported by groups who yesterday came to Washington representing 45 States. Last night, nearly 1,000 people came to the George Washington University campus to hear about the Department of Peace and the hope that it brings for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you were to look at this clerk's desk, just around the corner you will see engraved right into the desk of the clerk of the House of Representatives the word ``peace.'' Peace is a foundational principle of this Congress and of this country, and the bill gives it a chance to have an animating power in our civic life by addressing the issues of domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, violence in the schools, racial violence, all of those concerns we have both domestically and internationally.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, there is a compelling need for a new direction in Iraq, one that recognizes the plight of the people of Iraq, the false and illegal basis of the United States' war against Iraq, the realities on the ground which make a military resolution of the conflict unrealistic, and the urgent responsibility of the United States to use the process of diplomacy and international law to achieve stability in Iraq. 
   Today, I am presenting to Congress what is called the Kucinich Plan for Exit from Iraq. These are some of the elements: 
   1. The U.S. announces it will end the occupation, close military bases and withdraw. 
   2. The U.S. announces it will use existing funds to bring the troops and necessary equipment home. 
   3. Order a simultaneous return of all U.S. contractors to the U.S. and turn over all contracting work to the Iraqi government. 
   4. Convene a regional conference for the purpose of developing a security and stabilization force for Iraq. 
   5. Prepare an international security and peacekeeping force to move in, replacing U.S. troops who then return home. 
   6. Develop and fund a process of national reconciliation. 
   7. Reconstruction and jobs. 
   8. Reparations. 
   9. Political sovereignty. 
   10. Dealing with the Iraq economy. 
   11. Economic sovereignty for Iraq. 
   12. A process of international truth and reconciliation between the people of the United States and the people of Iraq. 
   It is time for a new direction, and the Kucinich plan offers that direction.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the Associated Press reports that the latest Iraq supplemental funding plan incredibly will tie an increase in the minimum wage to funding the war through October. If this is true, and I hope it is not, it tells American workers that the only way they will get an increase in wages is to continue funding a war which is taking the lives of their sons and daughters. First, blood for oil; now a minimum wage for maximum blood? Aren't the American people giving enough blood for this war without having to give more to have a wage increase? What's happened to our country? We are losing our moral compass. We are losing our sense of justice. We are losing touch with the difference between right and wrong. 
   We do not have to fund this war. We must leave Iraq now. Support our troops. Bring them home. H.R. 1234 is a plan to end the war and stabilize Iraq and give Iraqis control of their oil. We must take a new path. We must take a path of truth and justice.

Madam Speaker, the Defense bill contained a request for millions of dollars to retrofit B-2 Stealth bombers so they can carry 30,000-pound bombs, bunker busters, which would be germane to the administration's intention of attacking Iran. Imagine for a moment 30,000-pound bombs dropped on nuclear research labs in Natanz and in Bushehr, and you have a humanitarian and ecological disaster on your hands. 
   Now, the case for war against Iran is being built on lies, just as the case for war against Iraq was built on lies. Nearly 4,000 troops dead; nearly a million innocent Iraqis perished in the conflict; borrowing money from China to fight a war against Baghdad.

   Some Democrats are worried that President Bush's funding request to enable B-2 ``stealth'' bombers to carry a new 30,000-pound ``bunker buster'' bomb is a sign of plans for an attack on Iran. 
   Buried in the $196.4 billion supplemental war spending proposal that Bush submitted to Congress on Oct. 22 is a request for $88 million to modify B-2 bombers so they can drop a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, a conventional bomb still in development that is the most powerful weapon designed to destroy targets deep underground.

All over this country there are communities that are in coastal areas and flood plains, in hurricane alleys; and they are all looking at this legislation, realizing that the insurance companies are just withdrawing from areas where there's a high number of claims. They don't want to take the risk anymore, even though people, many of whom have been paying premiums, have never filed a claim. 
   So it is appropriate for this legislation to be passed. I have to say that the occasion of this legislation raises even deeper questions about the insurance industry across this country as to their practices, as to a new form of environmental redlining. And what we are looking at is we also have to see the interplay between environmental and energy policies and weather and climate patterns. 
   We are at a moment of transition here. Certainly this legislation ought to be supported.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Progressive Caucus budget because it includes home foreclosure relief. The foreclosure crisis is at the epicenter of our economic slowdown, and northeast Ohio is among the hardest hit in the Nation. 
   Hardworking American families deserve financial security. Foreclosure undermines the physical, emotional, and financial security of America's families, has a detrimental effect on the greater community. Neighborhoods with foreclosed properties are likely to experience declining property values. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, my hometown, had 11,000 foreclosures in 2005, more than triple the number a decade earlier. 
   My home State of Ohio has the ninth highest rate of foreclosures, and fourth nationwide for the number of preforeclosure and foreclosure filings. So I'm urging my colleagues to support this budget for that reason. But there's another reason, too. 
   We can talk about the transfer of wealth, which is a lot of the discussions that go on. This whole government is an engine to transfer the wealth of the country upwards. We have to recognize it. If there is one engine that's transferring the wealth upwards with great acceleration it's the war. Because this war would be as if every American family took out a checkbook and wrote out a check already for $16,000 and handed it over to the government. Already it has cost each family in this country $16,000. And if we continue this war, if you read Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist, the war is going to cost $3  trillion, and by the time we get over it, it will be upwards of $5 trillion. 
   Let's talk about how this budget is being used to accelerate the wealth of the Nation. Now, portend, it's the Progressive budget which offers an alternative which says, end the war, stop funding the war, stop funding wasteful military spending. We want a secure Nation, but we cannot secure our Nation on lies. The war is based on lies. We're on the fifth anniversary of this war. We went into war based on lies at a cost of $3 trillion now, 4,000 of our troops, a million innocent Iraqis, the morality of the United States, our position in the world all under attack because the truth wasn't told. 
   This budget is the truth. This budget gives the American people an opportunity to finally have their basic needs met. And those needs are going to continue to be neglected as long as we stay riveted to a war that is based on lies. 
   Bring those troops home. The Progressive budget does it. Stop the war. The Progressive budget does it. Take a new direction with our international policy. The Progressive budget does it. Take care of things here at home. The Progressive budget does it. Vote for the Progressive budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I just want to point out something here, Madam Speaker, as this House proceeds on this track. There are some of us here who feel that this country has drifted towards a version of a national security state. When the House begins to meet in secret on matters that relate to security prior to legislative acts, it raises questions about the Constitution of the United States. I know I am familiar with my friends' awareness that the Constitution gives the Congress the ability to make its own rules. I also understand from the first amendment that Congress wouldn't restrict any establishment of free speech. This is the citadel of free speech. This is the only place in America that someone can stand and say anything they want at any time and be free from any kind of a legal attack. 
   Once we close that up, we're changing the nature of it at a time when this country's at war, when there have been questions raised about secret meetings and what was told with respect to torture, about secret meetings and what was told with respect to rendition, about secret meetings and what was told with respect to private corporations doing wiretapping. 
   I just want the Members of this House to incorporate that in their reflections when we proceed to approve an agreement for a secret meeting. 
   I'd also like to state this, to just share my experience, and that is without referring to any content of any secret meeting I have been in, and I have been in a few at the beginning of my term in the House, I have found from my own experience, from my own experience, that secret meetings end up being occasions for the communication of information of, at least at best, dubious value. And I am not in any way impugning the motives of my good friends who are asking for a secret meeting in this case. But I am sharing with you my experience prior to this moment that secret meetings have been the occasion to communicate information that hasn't been particularly forthright or true. 
   Now, I could point to individuals, at least one individual who is sitting in this Chamber right now, who, when we had a secret meeting right after 9/11, walked right down that aisle and uttered a famous barnyard expletive after we were being briefed in a secret meeting by a member of the administration. Some of you who were there at the time remember. So I'm just communicating a concern here about the path we're going down, and I can only do that. 
   I will not attend that meeting. I will withdraw my reservation of objection. But I want to have my friends here know that we ought to be proceeding with the utmost caution in going in this direction. I am not going to be attending such a session. I believe that it violates the spirit of this House, but I will withdraw my reservation of objection since my good friend feels that this is the path that he has to go.

   Mr. KUCINICH. This reflects on what our distinguished majority leader said, Congresswoman Jackson-Lee. In the House under rule XVII, clause 9, it is true that any Member could ask for a secret session, claim they have information. That is a privilege. Furthermore, under rule X, clause 11, and then a subparagraph, the Select Committee  on Intelligence may move to hold a secret session to determine whether classified information held by the committee should be made public. 
   Now, we haven't seen our distinguished colleague ask for such a secret session, although our other distinguished colleague is requesting it. Now obviously since this has only been done five times in 182 years, five times in 182 years of this institution, it would seem to me that a very high bar has been reached here. 
   Now my question would be, hypothetically, since any Member has the ability to call for a secret session, if a secret session is requested and the bar that one would assume that we would need to clear to achieve a secret session has in fact not been met, that in fact a secret session was called for reasons for something that was not really all that secret, or not evidence that was probative and weighty, but instead that one person may have felt. And I am not impugning my friend here because he may have some information. 
   But generally speaking, under the rule, we can all ask for it. But, Mr. Hoyer, I think since you are our senior Member here who is our majority leader, or maybe the Parliamentarian knows, if a secret session is called for and the bar isn't reached, what then? What happens then with that secret session?

Mr. Speaker, industrial capitalism can finally be destroyed as we finish hollowing out our economy by substituting casino socialism, where the only real product is debt, where hard work in shaping raw materials into a product for a profit becomes ``so yesterday'' and we lead  Americans to the gaming tables. Work becomes denigrated and wagering becomes the road to wealth. 
   As Steve Zarlenga of the American Monetary Institute observed, ``You only have to make a fortune once.'' The top hedge manager in 2006 made $1.7 billion, and in 2007 some $3.7 billion. Both paid a lower tax rate for much of their earnings than people who clean the bedpans of the sick. And, of course, with that nasty ``death tax'' under attack by working families because almost 5 out of every 1,000 Americans pay it, that wealth can go on forever, just like the landed families of England and America maintain their economic status for hundreds of years. 
   Precious money needed to bring national health care, reindustrialization of America, the repair of our infrastructure and wider available of quality education becomes secondary to keeping this artificial real estate bubble going. Speculators are winning, and this is the system we are saving.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1069 condemns the use of television programming by Hamas to incite hatred in Palestinian youth and encourage violence. Violence and hatred will not bring a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I do not condone the use of television programming to promote such acts; rather I strongly object to it. Similarly, I condemn an ongoing policy that seeks to punish a civilian population in an effort to undermine its political leadership. 
   Hamas is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States because they engage in violence that undermines the Arab-Israeli peace process. Hamas is a sanctioned terrorist entity by the U.S. and the international community. As such, our condemnation of all egregious and objectionable activities by Hamas is clear. Condemnation of their television programming does not make this more clear nor does it bring us closer to a viable peace. 
   U.S. foreign policy must promote viable solutions to the violence and hatred. It is obvious that the promotion of peaceful solutions begins with ensuring the security and basic human rights of all people. The ongoing atrocities caused by the suffering of 1.5 million people in Gaza who are subject to escalating poverty, inadequate health care and insufficient access to clean water is a clear violation of security and human rights. 
   The blockade of Gaza has resulted in a near total collapse of the private sector, causing an almost 80 percent unemployment rate. More than 80 percent of all Gazans now rely on emergency food aid provided by the United Nations as their primary food source. The lack of basic goods has severely deteriorated Gaza's health, economy, and social fabric. 
   Imposition of the blockade in response to Hamas's attacks has amounted to collective punishment. While the current crisis may be exacerbated, instigated, even perpetuated by Hamas, the responsibility for ending the humanitarian crisis does not rest solely with Hamas. 
   Israel has a legal duty to provide Gazans with food, clean water, electricity, and medical care. The United States enjoys a close relationship with Israel. They are one of our strongest allies. I urge this body to exert our diplomatic influence with Israel to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and ensure the health, safety, and security for Palestinians and Israelis. This new condition would obviate the perceived need for condemnation.

But I think we need to reflect on the last few years, and that is, the United States went into Iraq for one reason and one reason only, oil. And when we did that, the price of oil didn't go down, it went up. 
   That the oil companies are running our energy policy is not a secret in this country. They have kept oil off the market while they jacked up the price. They have helped to restrain the supply while the price has skyrocketed and the American families paid for that. So to give the oil companies more drilling rights is simply a guarantee that we are going to pay more for oil, not less. Wake up, America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Chairman, my amendment will allow the public to know if a State or local government receiving funds from this act has been successful in its efforts to identify the source of the pathogenic pollution. 
   The problems created by contaminated surface waters are real. The health risks of swimming in water contaminated with biological pathogens are now well studied. Several studies on surfers, for example, show that the closer the swimming spot is to a sewer or storm water outfall, the higher the risk for walking away with gastroenteritis, respiratory infection, ear infection, salmonellosis, dysentery, skin rashes and pink eye. 
   The risks are economic as well. Many coastal communities rely heavily on tourism for their local economies. Swimming, boating and fishing all generate significant revenues. Great Lakes boaters spend more than $2 billion per year. Fishing brought in $4.5 billion in 2002. Lake Erie alone generates $2.5 billion annually in tourism revenue. 
   With the discharges that cause elevated pathogen levels come more than just pathogens. Raw sewage also contains a host of other chemicals, like lead and unmetabolized prescription drugs. 
   When sewage makes its way into our waterways, it can affect us directly. Lake Erie provides drinking water for approximately 11 million people. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the samples taken at Cuyahoga County beaches on Lake Erie in 2006 exceeded standards between 7 percent and 50 percent of the time. 
   When the Government Accountability Office examined the implementation of the Beach Act of 2000 last year, they identified an important weakness. They found that the causes for the contamination are usually unidentified. The GAO said, ``Local officials at 67 percent of Great Lakes beaches reported that when results of water quality testing indicated contamination, they did not know the source of the contamination. Only 14 percent reported that they had taken actions to address the source of contamination.''     
   Worse, they also found that State and local governments, as BEACH Act grantees, were not able to use their funds to get to the source of the problem. They weren't able to allow the funds to track down the source of the pathogenic contamination. 
   The Beach Protection Act under consideration today corrects that omission but stops when the pollution source is found. My amendment would spur action by letting the public know when a State or local government is able to identify the polluter. Since grantees are already required to notify the public when contamination is detected, the relevant infrastructure is already in place. 
   Communities deserve to know about the health risks that exist in their own backyard. With this information they not only avoid exposure to the hazard, but they can also bring pressure to bear to prevent the pollution from occurring. 
   Citizens should know where and when the contamination occurs so they can avoid it. They should also know where it is coming from so they can work to prevent it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Kucinich amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. With the passing of the war supplemental, our creation, the Iraqi Government, must meet certain benchmarks of performance, including turning over most of their oil assets worth as much as $21 trillion to international oil companies. 
   The administration blows up Iraq, is responsible for the deaths of perhaps as many as a million Iraqi citizens; the administration triggers a civil war, takes $10 billion in Iraq oil proceeds, which disappear, and now tells the Iraqis they better start behaving or the U.S. won't give them more support. 
   This isn't politics; this is pathology. Instead of passing legislation to continue the war, we should instead deny funds for the war and begin documenting war crimes. 
   It is time this Congress took responsibility to bring the troops home, to end this war, to restore our Constitution and reconnect our country to the highest values of truth and justice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. When the leadership of this House said back in October of 2006 that impeachment is off the table, what they did is they set the stage for the administration ignoring the subpoenas of the Congress for information. Once the administration understood that they did not have to comply with the law and that Congress essentially took away the one power that Congress has to compel the administration to respect Congress as a coequal branch of government, once that was taken away, the administration basically just decided it wasn't going to appear in front of Congress to answer questions, they wouldn't produce documents or papers that were relevant to congressional investigations. 
   Congress is a coequal branch of government. It is urgent that we reestablish our coequality, that we create conditions of a check and balance of administrative abuse of power. This isn't a Republican matter, it is not a Democratic matter, it is a matter for our country. We need to have the Congress be strong. We need to hold this administration accountable.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, a State of the Union Address is an opportunity for the Nation to take stock of where it is at this exact moment. 
   It is obvious that the entire domestic agenda has been swallowed up by the war in Iraq. With over 3,000 U.S. soldiers killed in action; with over 650,000 innocent Iraqi civilians dead in the war; with this Nation's having spent over $400 billion in the war and, according to Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stieglitz, will spend up to $2 trillion for the war in Iraq, we have seen the hopes and the aspirations of the American people for more jobs, for better housing, for decent health care, for education for their children just swept aside as the administration focuses intently not only on the war, but escalating the war. 
   I think all across this country people are hopeful that America will have a new agenda, one which will recognize that we must focus on America's basic needs. It is time for America to come home. Come home and start taking care of the needs of our people here for decent housing, the needs of our people for health care. Over 100 million Americans either have no health insurance or lack access to adequate health insurance, and yet we are about destroying the health of the people of Iraq instead of focusing on the needs of our people here back home. 
   Martin Luther King said it years ago in his speech at Riverside Church in New York. He said that the hopes and the aspirations of people of two countries were being set aside. He was speaking of Vietnam and the United States. Today the hopes and the aspirations of people of two countries, of Iraq and the United States, are being set aside in this head-long rush to escalation of a war. 
   Now, what should be our policies, and what steps should we take? First of all, this isn't just about opposing escalation. I would say that is pretty easy to do based on the record of this administration's conduct of the war. But we should be taking a strong stand against the occupation. We should be demanding that the United States end the occupation, that we bring our troops home, that we close our bases. That then will set the precondition that is necessary for the world community to come together and support a peacekeeping and security mission in Iraq. That then sets the stage for the Iraqi people to reach a moment of possibility for reconciliation between the Shiites, the Kurds, and the Sunnis. It is absolutely imperative that the United States announce that it is going to end the occupation because it is the occupation which is fueling the insurgency. 
   Tonight the Nation is waiting for a new direction. It is not looking for more war. It is not looking for more casualties. It is not looking for a continued destruction of our domestic agenda. So we are here to state that there is a plan, and I have submitted it. 
   The Kucinich 12-point plan is the plan that sets the stage for America to take a new direction. That direction is out of Iraq, but it is also a direction of reconciling with the world community because the way this administration responded to 9/11 separated us from the world community. At a moment when the whole world was ready to embrace the United States in its suffering and  to work with us to meet the challenges of security, we set ourselves apart with strategies of unilateralism, first strike, and preemption. We need to replace that with strategies of embracing the world community, of working together, of recognizing that the world is interdependent, interconnected. And because of that, we understand the common fate which we all have on this planet to work together, to put together structures of peace internationally. 
   And the United States must take that direction. We must engage with Iran and Syria. We must reach out to the region and look for a solution and find that solution which will enable us to bring our troops home. We can have our troops home in 3 months if we can come up with an agreement and a new direction, and we should be about that work. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want health care. The American people want jobs. The American people want education for their children. The American people want retirement security. And our whole domestic agenda is sacrificed for this war. 
   It is time for a new direction. It is time for a State of the Union which celebrates what we have in America that needs to be improved, which restates the American vision of a Nation for all, and which takes us away from policies of endless war.

The President will come to our country tonight, and he will give us more war, 21,500 troops sent to escalate the war in Iraq, a war that has cost the lives of 650,000 innocent Iraqi civilians. 
   We need our President to realize that it is time to take a new direction, and that direction is out of Iraq. It is time to end the occupation, to withdraw our troops, to close the bases. It is time for us to work with the international community in an overall peace plan, which I presented to this Congress. The Kucinich plan calls for not only ending the occupation, withdrawing troops, closing the bases, but also an international peace plan that enables the Iraqi people to have the security they need through reconciliations, through reparations, and through paying for reconstruction. 
   The United States must lead the way with the international community in a plan for peace. The President must take a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of those who serve our country through the gathering of intelligence for the protection of the American people. I appreciate their dedication and their attention to the gathering facts for deliberations related to our national security. 
   Regrettably, the current administration has destroyed the credibility of the Intelligence Community through the fabrication of intelligence. The Bush administration continues a relentless pursuit of a self-serving agenda rather than an agenda that serves the best interests of the American people. 
   No single example can more clearly illustrate this point than the administration's falsification and cherry-picking of intelligence to build a phony case for the war in Iraq. Through the manipulation of intelligence, the administration sold a war to the American public based on false statements that included a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, Iraq and 9/11, as well as false claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and intentions to attack the U.S. 
   As long as President Bush remains in office the intelligence budget will continue to be at risk for being used to support subversive intelligence and provide license to the administration to engage in criminal activity by shaping intelligence to fit corrupt policies. 
   Under the Bush administration there have emerged several high-profile classified leaks to the media that have reemphasized the need for reform within our intelligence agencies. From these media leaks, we not only became aware of the efforts to manipulate intelligence and to falsify a cause for war against Iraq but we also became aware of the illegal NSA domestic wiretapping program without a court order. We became aware of the rumored CIA detention centers in Eastern Europe, and the CIA's extraordinary rendition program, used to transport suspects to other nations with less restrictive torture policies. It is regrettable that intelligence is often reshaped to fit doctrine instead of doctrine being reshaped in the face of the facts of intelligence. 
   Furthermore, this bill will not stop unilateral covert U.S. intelligence operations aimed at bringing about regime change in Iran. As reported in a recent article in The New Yorker, the Bush administration is already engaged in collecting covert intelligence on Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program instead of engaging Iran in high-level diplomatic negotiations without preconditions. The administration has made clear their thirst for a war with Iran. The opportunity for unscrupulous tactics by this administration with respect to Iran clearly exists as long as this body stands idly by. 
   I strongly oppose this bill.

   Consider the fact that the Iraqi hydrocarbon law contains a mere three sentences that generally discuss the ``fair'' distribution of oil. Except for these three scant lines, the entire 33-page hydrocarbon bill is about creating a complex legal structure to facilitate the privatization of Iraqi oil. As a matter of fact, yesterday, Vice President Cheney was in Baghdad specifically to tell the Iraqi legislature they must stay in session to pass this hydrocarbon bill which hands Iraqi oil over to foreign oil companies. 
   It is imperative that all of us look at this carefully before we cast our vote today.

   We have the power to end the war now. We should not give the President another dime for the war. We should not permit this war to continue to go on. Yet this House passed a $97 billion supplemental which gives the President money to keep the war going through September of 2008, and then a week later approved the President's budget for another $195 billion for Iraq to keep the war going into 2009. And now we are talking about a nonbinding timetable for withdrawal. 
   What is the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on the war? Well, the Republicans do not want any timetables for withdrawal at all, and the Democrats, well, the Democrats want nonbinding timetables for withdrawal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, when you listen to the debate, you can understand that we could be in Iraq for many, many years to come and could expand the war beyond Iraq unless we take a new approach which places diplomacy as the path to peace. 
   Mr. Speaker, our soldiers didn't lose the war. I maintain the war was lost the minute the White House fabricated a cause for war. The Bible says that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and our adventure in Iraq will prove the Bible was right. 
   On the one hand, some of my friends do not believe in any timetable to withdraw from Iraq, which means we could stay in Iraq indefinitely; on the other hand, some of my friends believe in timetables, even nonbinding timetables, which means we could stay in Iraq indefinitely. 
   I believe we are being presented with an insufficient choice. Congress is under no obligation to appropriate any more money for this war, yet we give the President $100 billion. We are under no obligation to give him any money to continue the war. We can best support the troops by using money that is in the pipeline to bring the troops home. I believe that is what the American people want. 
   Congress recently approved $97 billion in the supplemental. That could keep the war going well into next summer. Congress approved a budget a week later that would keep the war going into 2009. 
   Nearly 200 people died in the carnage in Baghdad yesterday. We understand that the occupation is fueling the insurgency. Our troop casualties are mounting towards 3,300. Last night, I spoke to the sister of one of those casualties who was a young Marine from my district. She raised the plea, what can we do to end this war? 
   Innocent civilian casualties are rising. The conservative estimate in June 2006 of the Lancet Report set at 650,000 the number of innocent civilian casualties. It is quite possible that at this time those casualties could be approaching 1 million. The cost of the war is upwards of $800 billion into 2008. We are borrowing money from China to wage a war in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Murtha's account of the disaster to our military does not need to be added to. But what should be said right now is that we are facing limited choices, and that is why, Mr. Speaker, I have proposed H.R. 1234, a plan to end the war, which begins with Congress not funding the war, pulling the plug on funding and moving forward with a plan that reaches out to the international community to get out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gentlelady. I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill. 
   The underlying proposition is this: Should the United States have an auto manufacturing industry? That is really what we are deciding here. Because if this rule and/or bill goes down, we are faced with an untenable condition which will lead to the collapse of our automotive making capacity, and, according to some economic policy analysts, the elimination of over 3.3 million jobs across the economy, jobs that are affected directly and indirectly by the automotive industry. 
   I think it is important for us to step back and look at the context of this. Are we intending to stay a great nation, a world power, or are suddenly we retreating from the world stage? Because an America without an automobile industry is also going to be an America without a steel industry. We are already seeing our aerospace and our shipping industry affected. 
   It is time for us to have a national economic policy which says that the maintenance of automotive, steel, aerospace and shipping is vital to our national security; not just to our economy, but our security. 
   Sixty-seven years ago, when the United States was attacked, it was those industries which enabled us to be able to defend ourselves. Now, I am a person who stands for peace, but I also believe in preparedness. To me, it is unthinkable that a United States which was able to mobilize its productive capacity would suddenly throw it away. 
   We have to remember that our ability to make things is vital to being a great nation, and we have to remember that this is a moment that we should be able to rise to this occasion. It is a tragedy just that we have to debate something that is a proposition about whether or not we remain a strong Nation.

   You are actually talking about only 2 percent of the amount of money given for the Wall Street bailout, which I spoke against and voted against. This is an altogether different proposition. We cannot totally reject industrial capitalism and remain a great nation. 
   There are a lot of questions about finance capitalism which the $700 billion bailout has brought out. But we have to have the ability to make things. And we cannot ask auto workers to work for nothing. We have to have the ability to make things, and we also have to have the ability to see automotive in the scheme of a broader industrial policy. 
   Let's remember who we are as a nation. With all of our troubles, trials and tribulations, this is still the greatest nation in the world. What keeps us there? Our ability to make things; to make cars, to make steel, to make planes, to create ships. That is what helps to make America great. Let's not give that up. Let's not let this moment pass and decide, well, this is just a trivial matter of $14 billion or $15 billion. This is a question of who we are as a nation. Let's be strong. Let's vote for this bill.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the President's fiscal year 2008 budget requests funding for the Iraq war through 2009. The Democratic budget accepts that timeline. It includes $145.2 billion  for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as requested by the President for fiscal year 2008. It requests $50 billion for fiscal year 2009. That is in addition to the $510 billion we have already spent on the war and another $97 billion pending in the supplemental, according to the CRS. The total, if approved, would be over $800 billion for war, while our schools, our health care and the quality of our environment are in decline. The budget should reflect the mandate Democrats were given in November, yet we are mirroring the President's plan for the war and his budget request to fund the war. 
   The supplemental calls for withdrawal by August 2008. Why does the budget encourage the war to continue into 2009? If we were serious about trying to stop the war, the budget should not contradict the supplemental language. 
   This budget does not end the war, it continues it through the end of President Bush's term. The American people want the war to end now, not in 2008, not in 2009, but the people want the war to end now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the vote to override the President's veto of SCHIP. I do so because the President's objections to government health insurance for low income children are outrageous. 
   That said, I still believe, the bill's failure to provide coverage for legal immigrants is reprehensible. All children deserve health care coverage. Health care is a right, not a privilege. The denial of a lifesaving service based on an arbitrary length of citizenship is simply wrong. 
   It is the responsibility of Congress to address the main difficulties that prevent legal immigrant children from gaining access to health care. This bill does exactly the opposite. Thus I felt compelled to vote against the bill after the Senate negotiators refused to provide health benefits to legal immigrant children. Negotiating away health care for 400,000-600,000 children as a political compromise is not acceptable. 
   The President has vetoed the bill because he calls it a step toward socialized medicine. This perennial straw-man is trotted out when meritorious arguments are lacking. In fact, SCHIP uses private doctors and private health care plans. More importantly, however, the President is fond of ignoring the volumes of literature showing that government-run health insurance programs that use private hospitals and doctors like Medicare and Medicaid, deliver higher quality care at lower costs with higher rates of satisfaction than private insurance plans. According to a 2007 article in the journal, Health Affairs, administrative costs of private plans were about twice as much as those for Medicaid. Medicare's overhead costs are approximately 3 percent while those of the private sector are closer to 31 percent. 
   That is one of the main reasons that H.R. 676, the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, is the best cure for our health care ills. It captures the enormous savings to be had if Americans had health care provided through Medicare and uses them to cover everyone for all medically necessary services with no copayments, no deductibles and now premiums. That is how wasteful private insurance is. Providing cheaper coverage through the private sector simply leaves Americans with dangerously weak coverage. About 50 percent of all bankruptcies in the U.S. are related to medical bills. Of those with medically related bankruptcies, about 75 percent had insurance before they got sick. Their so-called ``coverage'' did not cover them. They were, in fact, underinsured. The President chose to ignore this crisis by vetoing a bill that would have not only covered uninsured children but provided better coverage for many who are one illness away from losing their money and their home. 
   The provisions in the bill would make substantial and crucial progress in providing health care for all American children. It would provide coverage for 3.8 million more children than are covered now and preserve coverage for 6.6 million more. It would help ensure Ohio can expand its program to include an additional 20,000 children. It targets the lowest-income uninsured children for outreach and enrollment, ensures dental coverage and mental health parity. 
   The President was fundamentally wrong to veto the SCHIP bill. He needs to understand the economic and moral realities behind SCHIP. I cast my vote to express that.

   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask unanimous consent to include a New York Times translation of the text of President Ahmadinejad's speech, a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute of his speech, articles relating to an analysis of the speech, and the words that were used by Virginia Tilley of Johannesburg, South Africa and by Erash Narsi written on the 18th of January 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this is not my translation. This is a translation from the New York Times Tehran Bureau of this speech, and that is what I wanted to submit in the Record, because this debate, even if unintentional, could be used as still another cause for a U.S. attack on Iran, and because the International Atomic Energy Agency has not established that Iran is developing nuclear weapons and because we went to war against Iraq on the basis of misinformation, disinformation, and because I stand for peaceful resolution of all international disputes in the Middle East, in the region, and because I do share the concern that Israel would be in peril, which is why I did the research. I did the research. That is the basis of my wanting to submit a translation. 
   Now, there is an old saying ``much is lost in translation,'' and if there is so much riding on this resolution, it would appear to me that the prudent approach to take would be to read a translation from Farsi to English. And I have two such translations to offer this Congress if anyone is interested.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. I am going to proceed specifically with the comments, if I may. Everything that I have relates to this resolution, my good friend. And I am going to proceed now, and then I will yield again, certainly. I just want to make sure we can continue this. 
   I want to proceed with quotes from this resolution. I am just going to stay very closely to this resolution because this is what we are debating, a resolution before the House that calls on the Security Council to charge Iranian President Ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the United Nations Charter because of his calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, something that I obviously would find abhorrent and repugnant if he said that. And I started to do research on this, and I am just calling it to your attention. 
   With respect to the quote that he said that Israel should be wiped off the map, that is what the quote was, I have seen, from translations in the New York Times and the Middle East Research Institute that this speech that Ahmadinejad gave on October 26, 2005, does not call for Israel to be wiped off the map. 
   Now, H. Con. Res. 21 states that he has called for Israel to be wiped off the map. But according to the Middle East Research Institute, it is more correctly  translated as ``eliminated from the pages of history.'' And when taken in full context, here is what the quote says: ``This regime that is occupying Qods,'' or Jerusalem, ``must be eliminated from the pages of history.'' He is talking about the regime. 
   Now, H. Con. Resolution 21 accuses President Ahmadinejad of saying that Israel, and these are awful quotes if he said it, it is horrible, that Israel is a ``disgraceful blot on the face of the Islamic world.'' However, the New York Times translates this section of the speech as saying, ``Our dear Imam targeted the heart of the world oppressor in his struggle, meaning the occupying regime. I have no doubt that the new wave that has started in Palestine, and we witness it in the Islamic world too, will eliminate this disgraceful stain from the Islamic world.'' 
   Now, I object to anyone's putting the word ``disgraceful'' in connection with Israel. However, he did not say, he wasn't talking about the people of Israel, the nation, he was talking about the regime. 
   Here again is the quote that is included in this resolution: ``Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.'' 
   Look, I recognize Israel and I am not interested in that kind of condemnation. But H. Con. Res. 21 accuses President Ahmadinejad of declaring that anybody who recognized Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nations' fury. However, in two separate translations, it is clear that Ahmadinejad is referring to the Israeli regime. 
   The New York Times translation: ``Anyone who recognizes this regime because of the pressure of the world oppressor, or because of naivete or selfishness, will be eternally disgraced and will burn in the fury of the Islamic nations.'' 
   The Middle East Media Research Institute translation reads: If someone is under the pressure of hegemonic power,'' the West, ``and understands that something is wrong, or he is naive, or he is an egotist and his hedonism leads him to recognize the Zionist regime, he should know that he will burn in the fire of Islamic Ummah,'' nation ..... 
   So what he is calling for is regime change, according to these translations. According to these translations, he is calling for regime change. He is not calling for the destruction of Israel. Now, I am just going on the basis of a New York Times translation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, to respond to my friend, if that is what he meant, then we have cause for great concern. However, in one of the articles I wanted to submit so that Congress could see it, it says, and I quote, ``What did Ahmadinejad actually say? To quote his exact words in Farsi,'' and then they give the quote, ``that passage will mean nothing to most people but one word might ring a bell: `regime.' It is the word `regime' pronounced just like the English word with an extra e-h sound at the end. Ahmadinejad did not refer to Israel the country or Israel the land mass but the Israeli regime. That is a vastly significant distinction as one cannot wipe a regime off the map.''

   Mr. KUCINICH. If, in fact, that's what he said, then of course the U.N. should look into it. But I think we should look into whether or not he said that. And again, I offered to submit, but was denied a unanimous consent, the text of his speech, and a translation by Nazila Fathi in the New York Times Tehran Bureau of the speech. This is from the New York Times. And they certainly have never been accused of any kind of propaganda against Israel. 
   So I would say that it is important for us to look at this. And I don't think it is an unreasonable request that we should look at exactly what this person said so we will know what the appropriate course of action is to take. 
   I stand for peace. I stood before this Congress and challenged the war against Iraq when very few people were willing to do that because I questioned whether or not Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction. I am questioning whether or not this person is trying to destroy Israel. If he is, then I certainly support my friend's concerns.

   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, Congress has the power to end the war in Iraq simply by refusing to pass any legislation to continue to fund it. The money is in the pipeline there right now to bring the troops home. 
   H.R. 1234 provides a plan for bringing the troops home, ending the occupation and stabilizing Iraq. This war will never end if Congress advances administration plans to privatize Iraq's oil through insisting on the passage of a so-called hydrocarbon act by the Iraqi legislature. 
   Today I will be distributing to Members of Congress a detailed report that explains how the legislation that we are advancing moves to privatize Iraq's oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, on one hand we hear from the opposition that this bill will not save seniors money. But then we hear that Medicare's negotiation of prices is tantamount to price controls. To make that argument, one has to assume money will be saved. Which is it? Will it save money or won't it? The answer is that of course it will save money. 
   It's particularly interesting that Pharma's response is to threaten to reduce innovative new drug research by withholding research funding. Pharma will not reduce their lobbying army that outnumbers Members of Congress. They will not reduce their profits which average almost $5 billion dollars among the top 8 Pharma companies in 2006 alone. They will not reduce their army of salespeople dedicated to influencing the prescribing habits of doctors. They will not stop paying scientists to influence clinical trial data that is supposed to be the basis for impartial judgment of a drug's efficacy and safety. No, they are threatening to cut research funds, which they claim will affect innovation. But they will not tell you that the number of truly innovative drugs they are producing has been declining since 1999 according to the Government Accountability Office. Why? Because they are instead spending their money on making minor changes to existing drugs in order to extend their highly profitable patent life. And by asking us to reject negotiation of prices for Medicare, they are asking us to fund not only their sub-par research agenda but their entire influence industry. I'm not buying it.

   Mr. KUCINICH. I rise in opposition to the bill. 
   We've lost over 3,600 of our brave service men and women; 1 million innocent Iraqis have perished in the war. We're now telling Iraqis, whose country the U.S. destroyed, whose reconstruction funds the U.S. mishandled, whose social networks have been shredded, stand on your own feet, while we try to steal their oil under the cover of occupation. 
   This bill will not end the war. This bill will not end the occupation. It doesn't take a vote to end this war. We must inform the administration that the $97 billion appropriated last month is the end of the financing for the war. Use the money that is in the pipeline through October 1st to bring the troops home. Compel the President to put together an international peacekeeping security force which would move in as our troops leave. 
   We could have our troops home by October 1. The question is whether we're ready to take a stand to do that, or whether or not we're going to vote on resolutions that give the American people the appearance that we want to end the war, without actually addressing the central issue that will end the war: Stop the funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (BUSH LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR ATTACK ON IRAN -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, rather than announce a diplomatic initiative similar to North Korea to resolve the stalemate over Iran's nuclear ambitions, yesterday the President said that the Iranian Government is supplying deadly weapons to fighters in Iraq, even though he cannot prove the orders came from the highest levels in Tehran. 
   Why is he maintaining this? I believe he is maintaining it to satisfy section 2C of the 1973 War Powers Resolution which reads in part: ``The constitutional powers of the President as Commander in Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances and are exercised pursuant to a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions or its Armed Forces.'' 
   So what is going on here is that the administration is seeking a justification for a military conflict with Iran. That is why the administration is changing its emphasis. Its justification now is to protect U.S. troops in Iraq. Very significantly this justification could relieve the President of needing congressional authorization  
   Contrary to his assertion, the President has been provoking Iran. The President has given U.S. military the authority to kill or capture Iranian operatives inside Iraq, but fails to present credible evidence that explosives used in Iraq have come from Iran. 
   He is laying the groundwork for an attack on Iran and appears to be preparing to bypass congressional authorization for a military strike against Iran. 
   In light of the House of Representatives' action to disapprove of the President's escalation in Iraq and the mounting opposition to the war in Iraq, the President has advanced a new justification that could be used to bypass congressional approval for a military conflict of war. 
   President Bush was able to exercise new flexibility to reach an agreement with North Korea to shut down its nuclear facility. This offers proof that he could negotiate with Iran as well regarding their alleged nuclear weapons program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. In the face of rising demand for help with home energy costs, the Ohio Department of Development reports that it has $17 million less than last year to help low-income households pay energy bills. Cuyahoga County was forced to cut assistance checks this summer from $175 to $100. 
   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds have helped millions of Americans stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter. However, LIHEAP dollars have been stretched to the breaking point as more and more people find it impossible to pay their energy bills. It's outrageous that the most vulnerable Americans--children, the disabled, and elderly--go hungry and develop long-term health problems as the profits of oil and other energy companies skyrocket. 
   I support a second stimulus package that includes $3.12 billion for the LIHEAP program. But I believe we must also redouble our efforts to address the economic policies that create and perpetuate energy insecurity. 
   Support a second stimulus package for these Americans who rely on the LIHEAP program.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1092 and urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution. 
   The Administration would like to force this Congress to take up the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, FTA, before August. 
   This resolution will allow Congress, not the Administration, to decide if and when this body should take legislative action on the U.S.-Colombia FTA. 
   I strongly oppose the U.S.-Colombia FTA. This is yet another flawed, NAFTA-style, trade deal that harms workers in the United States and in Colombia. 
   Our workers and our communities have been devastated by our flawed trade policies. Since 2001, over three million valuable manufacturing jobs have been lost due to the NAFTA model of trade, now being perpetuated in the U.S.-Colombia FTA. 
   In Ohio, where we have lost more than 236,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs, we know the realities of these failed trade policies all too well. 
   The actual number is much higher because we have not included job loss in the service sector and supply chain that we cannot account for. Excluded are local businesses, such as restaurants, just down the road from closed manufacturing facilities that are forced to close their doors. The ripple effect includes a loss of health care and college educations. 
   Trade agreements should be responsible. The U.S.-Colombia FTA continues the destructive trade policies that spur the exodus of well paying jobs and undermine the ability of working people to protect their living standards. That is not a responsible trade deal. 
   Trade agreements that fail to enforce worker rights are irresponsible. Approximately 2,300 labor organizers, labor leaders and union members have been murdered in Colombia since 1991. Today, Colombia is still the most dangerous country in the world for union members. 
   In February, an AFL-CIO delegation met with leaders of the major Colombian labor federations. According to the AFL-CIO ``[l]eaders of the major Colombian Labor federations told the delegation they oppose any free trade deal  between the United States and Colombia until the government takes strong action to stop the violence against trade union members and ends assaults on union rights.''

<DOCNO>Mr. KUCINICH. (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act, is designed to help communities with current or impending water shortages. I support the bill. 
   We know that such shortages can have many causes. For example, global warming is likely to cause or exacerbate water shortages in the U.S., especially in the Southwest. Under those conditions, alternative water sources will be more important than ever, but communities all over the United States are also fighting to protect their water supplies from overpumping by bottled water companies, who are making billions of dollars from this public resource. My amendment would remove from consideration for these Federal subsidies those areas where bottled water companies are contributing to the demise of the water supply. 
   According to the International Bottled Water Association, the volume of water privatized has increased between 8 and 12 percent every year since 2001. In 2006, bottled water companies enjoyed $11 billion in revenue from the United States alone. It is estimated that about 25 percent of the bottled water consumed in the United States comes from municipal water supplies. 
   The effects of the excessive influence of the bottled water industry can go beyond the regional confines of water source depletion and environmental destruction. It codifies a preference for corporate access to water over public access. 
   I represent the Cleveland area, that, like many cities nearby, relies on Lake Erie for drinking water. A few years ago, there were two instances in which a company received a permit to privatize Great Lakes water in bulk. 
   In both instances, the projects were abandoned because of the public outcry. In response, the Great Lakes States, with assistance from Canadian Premiers and other stakeholders, attempted to negotiate the conditions under which water could be withdrawn from the lake. 
   As the negotiations closed, bottled water companies managed to wedge their language into the final agreement. The language also allowed virtually unlimited withdrawals for bottled water companies, while attempting to protect against other privatization attempts. 
   Such unprecedented favoritism can actually represent a giant step backwards for the notion of water as a public trust. The loophole leaves the entire agreement open to commerce clause challenge or to a challenge in the World Trade Organization. If such a challenge were successful, there would be no limits to privatization of Great Lakes water. It would open the water of the Great Lakes to use by the growing and increasingly thirsty regions where they are having water shortages and where water shortages make it financially viable to pipe water across several States. We would not just be back to square one; we would take a giant step backwards. 
   This is a classic example, Mr. Chairman, in which greed of the bottled water companies is garnering profits at the expense of the public. I have not even talked about the overeffect of pumping, like the increased cost of finding a replacement source, the loss of connected streams, lakes and rivers, the land subsidence, the salt water intrusion near coasts that render the water undrinkable, and the loss of wildlife habitat. 
   Another example is emblematic of conflicts between communities and bottled water companies all over the United States. In two small towns in New Hampshire, Nottingham and Barrington, a company called USA Springs is attempting to drill wells that would pump 310,000 gallons a day in an area populated with homes that get their water from small private household wells. The community is worried about a loss of water supply, loss of water quality, and degradation of nearby wetlands. 
   A very conservative estimate said that USA Springs is looking at about $303 million per year in revenue from this site alone. With that kind of revenue potential, it can be expected they will spend big to make this project happen. This is exactly what they are doing. The result is that USA Springs  is now dangerously close to winning a battle that started in 2001. 
   The basic building blocks of life, like water, must be accessible by people before corporations, period. When access to the essentials is threatened by outside excessive private gain, I will stand firmly in defense of the public every time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I intend to explore this issue deeply as Chair of the Domestic Policy Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I ask the chairman, my good friend from Minnesota, to work with me as Chair of Transportation and Infrastructure on the broader issue of water privatization and its effects on quality and access. 
   I yield to Mr. Oberstar.
