<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are able to consider this legislation today. H.R. 6545, the National Energy Security Act is an important proposal to ensure that policymakers get a comprehensive analysis of the way our national security and energy security are affected by rising energy costs. 
   I applaud the gentleman from Louisiana for introducing this bill, and believe that is the right way to address this proposal. Last week, the ranking member of my committee proposed this idea. But his motion made it clear that this was just a tactic to de-rail the intelligence authorization bill. I said that this report was a good idea, and that we deserve to know the information that this bill requires. But I could not agree to the form of his request then because it would have sent the bill back through the committee process, effectively killing this bill, and would have denied critical funds that the men and women in the intelligence community need to uncover and disrupt terrorist plots--funds that he agreed were crucial to our national security. 
   I hope that the House will pass this proposal now. It is important for us to understand the energy security implications of rising prices. I would note that the intelligence community has already done some work in this area. Last March, the intelligence community produced an unclassified report called, ``Energy Security Dynamics Transforming International Politics'', which covered some of the issues in this bill, but that report was not at the same level of rigor and coordination as the assessment required by this bill. 
   This National Intelligence Assessment will provide a short-term and long-term assessment of the outlook for prices, supply, and demand for key forms of energy. The intelligence community can help us understand the plans for production and supply of energy sources from key energy-producing and exporting nations. It can also help us understand how potential adversaries who are energy suppliers will use dollar diplomacy or energy supply as leverage to achieve their goals. We also need to understand whether increased energy prices are going to fund terrorists. The format of this report will allow the intelligence community to consult with the best minds in industry and academia. 
   I would also note that this assessment is similar to one on the national security implications of global climate change that was included in last year's House-passed version of the intelligence authorization bill. We received that report last month, and the intelligence community management subcommittee held  an excellent hearing on it. Both energy security and global climate change have serious implications for national security. But both energy security and global climate change require solutions that cannot be solved by our military or intelligence community. The next President will have to deal with these challenges, and deserves the best judgment of our intelligence community. 
   This bill ensures that the next President will have that advice. I urge my colleagues to adopt the resolution.

   The bill would authorize the National Park Service to continue its successful relationship with Caneel Bay Resort, ensure that park resources are protected, and allow the resort to undertake needed maintenance and improvement programs that will benefit visitors to Virgin Islands National Park and the Caneel Bay Resort well into the future. 
   Congresswoman Christensen deserves our thanks for her work in ensuring that visitor services at Virgin Islands National Park are available and that resources are protected. 
   I fully support passage of the pending bill and urge its adoption by the House today.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, this week we lost another four soldiers from Fort Bliss to an IED attack in Iraq. That makes a total of 35 troops from El Paso who went to Iraq and didn't come home. 
   Remember, 35 is not just a number. It's not an abstract concept. Thirty-five is the number of families suffering--aunts and uncles, grandparents, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, children. There are friends, classmates, teachers, coaches, fellow soldiers, colleagues, and so many others who are connected to the lives of our lost heroes. 
   The cost of this war has been too high not just in terms of lives lost and warriors wounded. We have poured taxpayers' money into Iraq. We have spent 500 billion--half a trillion!--dollars to that country. And as we have increased our investment in Iraq, we have less and less to show for it. Rather than progress, our billions of dollars have produced civil war. 
   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the Iraq War, my colleagues know two things about me. One, I opposed this war from the beginning. It was a mistake. Two, since the Iraq War began, I have been committed to our troops and to supporting the best possible outcome. 
   As a Vietnam veteran I know what combat is about. I have visited Iraq seven times. I have been to Afghanistan many times. I know what our troops require. I have worked out of the spotlight behind the closed doors of the Intelligence Committee and in the Armed Services Committee. My focus has been providing our soldiers with the tools they need to complete their mission and return home safely--body and vehicle armor, IED jammers, and timely, accurate intelligence. 
   And I'm proud of that work. I'm saddened that our troops didn't have the protection they needed right off the bat, and I'm ashamed we went to war with bad intelligence, but I'm proud of the work we've done in committee to set things right when we could. 
   But today we send a strong message, that it is long overdue for the Iraqis to stand up for their country, for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their security and for their political decisions. 
   If Iraq is to become a democracy--and we're willing to stay and help them with training, other support functions--but after four years it's time that they accept responsibility for their own future. And that's what this legislation is about. 
   More importantly, this bill takes care of our troops. It brings them home. And once our troops are home, this bill commits our government to caring for our troops and veterans in  a fashion that reflects the sacrifices they have made for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've been listening to the arguments of my colleagues on the other side. One thing I'm struck by is how similar the arguments I'm hearing today are to what they've been saying for the past four years. Every step of the way, my colleagues on the other side have been wrong on our policy in Iraq. Yet they pony up the same rhetoric, the same rationale for the same policies that have gotten us nowhere but into the middle of a civil war. 
   For four long years, our troops have made immeasurable sacrifices in Iraq, and now it is time for the Iraqis to step up and take responsibility for their own security.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (HONORING COACH DON HASKINS -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of the greatest figures in American sports history, a coach who shattered racial barriers and forever changed the game of basketball. He led an all-African American starting lineup to victory against an all-white powerhouse team in the 1966 NCAA Basketball Championship. 
   Coach Don Haskins, better known to us as The Bear, passed away on Sunday, September 7, in El Paso, Texas at the age of 78. I had the privilege of calling Coach Haskins a friend, and I join all of El Paso and his many fans across the Nation in mourning his passing. 
   Although he never saw it or intended to be one of the greatest civil rights pioneers in sports, his commitment to playing the most talented athletes regardless of skin color in the 1966 championship was a major turning point in American sports and the civil rights movement. 
   The landmark game between Texas Western College--which is now proudly known as the University of Texas at El Paso--and the University of Kentucky at that time is often regarded as one of the greatest moments in sports history and the most important game in college basketball. 
   For those of us from El Paso, Don Haskins was more than just a coach. He was a community icon that put a little known west Texas town in the national spotlight. He was fiercely a loyal supporter and has always been a diehard fan of the University of Texas at El Paso and could be seen often in the stands cheering on his beloved Minors.  
   Coach Haskins arrived at Texas Western College in 1961 and retired in 1999 after 38 seasons with a record of 719 wins and 353 losses. He led our Minors to seven Western Athletic Conference Championships, 14 NCAA Tournament appearances, and seven appearances in the National Invitational tournament. Couch Haskins also served as an assistant coach in the 1972 U.S. Olympic team. 
   On September 29, 1997, Coach Haskins was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ten years later, the entire 1966 Texas Western team joined their coach in this honor, becoming just the sixth team in the history of basketball to do so. 
   Though known for his ferocity on the court, off the court Coach Haskins was humble, compassionate, and witty. He never relished in celebrity, even after his story and that of the 1966 Texas Western team made it to the big screen in the 2006 Disney production of Glory Road. 
   He touched many lives, and never hesitated to help any person in need. He was known for visiting coffee shops around our town--many of them in poor areas--and would order a single cup of coffee, but leave a $20 tip. He never once bragged or boasted about what he did for others. 
   At Coach Haskins' memorial service, the University of Southern California basketball coach, Tim Floyd, a former UTEP assistant coach under Coach Haskins, shared a very moving story that demonstrates the kinds of deeds that Coach Haskins did for people often in need. It is told that one day Coach Haskins was driving to El Paso from Van Horn, Texas--which is approximately 120 miles from El Paso. He was driving, as all of us that knew and loved him, in his signature white pick-up truck. While driving, he noticed that a station wagon had broken down and was stranded on the side of the road; it was a single mom with four children.     
   Coach Haskins, typically, pulled over, and he asked the mother if she needed help. She told Coach Haskins that she was trying to get to Los Angeles, but her car had broken down. Coach Haskins squeezed all of the four children and the mom inside the cab of his pickup and drove them to El Paso. He put the family up in a hotel, arranged for their car to be towed and repaired, and he gave the mother $1,000 to help her get to Los Angeles. 
   Coach Haskins never mentioned this to anyone, including to his wife. It wasn't until the mayor of Van Horn called the coach's office and the now Coach Tim Floyd answered the phone that he found out what had occurred. Coach Floyd never shared this story while Coach Haskins was alive because he knew that Coach Haskins wouldn't want anyone to know about it. 
   This is but one example of the hundreds of stories that people tell about our legendary coach. 
   Mr. Speaker, when reflecting on his decision to start five African American players, Coach Haskins simply said, ``I just played my five best players.''

   Mr. REYES. I thank my friend from California. 
   Coach Haskins never sought or wanted credit for changing college basketball, and he would always say, ``I just wanted to win the game.'' 
   Like many of history's greatest role models, it was the humility and unassuming personality after achieving unprecedented success that, today, he inspires us all. 
   He is survived by his lovely wife, Mary, and was the proud father of Brent, David, Steve, and Mark. Although he is no longer with us, we know that his spirit will always live on at UTEP and that his legend and legendary stories will forever remain an important part of our country's history. 
   God blessed us with Coach Haskins, and now we ask for God's blessing for our coach.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Thank you, Congressman Cardoza and Congressman Ross, for your valuable assistance in crafting this important amendment. 
   I also want to thank our friend, as Congressman Cardoza mentioned, Rub&#233;n Hinojosa, who could not join us here this afternoon. 
   Our amendment stands both for fairness and the integrity of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   In El Paso, which is my district, FEMA is currently in the process of issuing new floodplain maps. Initially, the community didn't think much of this exercise because, simply, many didn't know that they had ever lived in a floodplain and didn't expect any problems with this issue. 
   However, when FEMA asked the Federal agency in charge of flood control, the International Boundary and Water Commission, about the condition of our levees, the answer came back that they were unsatisfactory. The levees were missing a few feet of free board, which is supplemental height and therefore could not be certified, which meant that now members of our community in El Paso were now subject to flood insurance. 
   That is why this amendment is necessary. That's why we're trying to correct an issue and a problem that everyday people need to wrestle with.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support for this important measure which reflects--in dollars and cents--just a small measure of our appreciation for all that men and women in uniform do in defense of our Nation. 
   We have an obligation to provide the housing and other facilities in which our military members and their families live and work. This measure includes the funds required to fully fund the President's budget request for military construction projects. The bill provides $8.2 billion dollars to implement the 2005 BRAC recommendations and $2.9 billion to replace, rehabilitate, and build housing for troops and their families. 
   As the representative of Fort Bliss, Texas I have seen the fruits of military construction spending, and I can assure my colleagues that these funds are being wisely used by the Army and the other military services to greatly improve the quality of life for our military members and their families. From a motorpool that allows a young technician to repair vehicles out of the heat and rain to a childcare center where the children of deployed service members can learn and grow, these facilities are more than bricks and mortar. They are an integral part of every soldier's daily life. 
   This bill provides an unprecedented level of funding for veterans health care which will allow us to begin to address the needs of current veterans who have for years been woefully under-served by the Veterans Administration, VA system. H.R. 2642 will also provide needed funding for men and women returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This measure continues our efforts to improve benefits for our Nation's veterans and provides $43.2 billion for veterans programs--  $6.7 billion more than was allocated last year and $3.8 billion more than the White House requested for VA programs. This additional funding will meet shortfalls in the Veterans Health Administration budget and provide needed funds to better address Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, mental health and substance abuse, homeless veterans, and prosthetic research. 
   These programs and other initiatives funded in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act are critical to our troops and their families and to our veterans who sacrificed so much in defense of our Nation and our American values. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2199, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long Term Support Act of 2007. As a Vietnam combat veteran, I have seen the long term effects that war-related wounds and illnesses can have on the lives of our returning soldiers. 
   As Agent Orange sickness and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) came to typify the Vietnam War, I believe that Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) have become a signature wound of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Advances in body armor and battlefield medicine have allowed our troops to survive head wounds that once would have been fatal. However, the number of identified traumatic brain injuries is alarming. Of the 23,000-plus troops who have been wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, two-thirds reportedly have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. These numbers may even be higher since many cases are often undiagnosed and go untreated. Some reports suggest that 150,000 veterans of the war in Iraq have suffered a traumatic brain injury of some kind. 
   Many of those affected by these devastating injuries are unable to perform the most basic cognitive functions and have great difficulties with the tasks of everyday life. These injured soldiers will require quality care and treatment for the rest of their lives. 
   While it is our obligation to ensure that our military forces have all the necessary arms and equipment to safely carry out their missions, we are also responsible for making sure that our troops know that we will take care of them when they return home. Today we have an opportunity to demonstrate to our wounded veterans our appreciation for their sacrifices and our firm commitment to providing them with the means for living a full and rewarding life. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, in deference to the comments of the last speaker, I think the American people know what's going on here. They know that almost 6 years after 9/11 and over 5 of those years during the time that they controlled this Congress, they couldn't do what we have been able to do with this funding for Homeland Security. They couldn't do it, or they wouldn't do it. 
   But either way, Homeland Security funding is vitally important. 
   Why? It's important because it sends a strong, clear message to all the employees of the Department of Homeland Security, including Customs and Border Protection officers, that serve us, serve us well, valiantly around the clock, that we think their work is important. 
   Last summer, in August, we had a series of hearings. I went to, I think, five or six of those hearings where a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were present as well. 
   They talked about doing everything that was possible to secure our country's borders. They talked about supporting the Customs and Border Protection officers. They talked about providing them the tools and the weapons and the technology, all the kinds of things that sounded really good. 
   Yesterday and today, they're singing a different tune. They're talking about stalling. Every minute that we talk about silly things, we aren't talking about serious problems, that demand serious efforts, serious problems that demand serious solutions. 
   At the very minimum, serious problems that demand serious debate. We don't need Members citing ``Animal Farm,'' which, that's all well and good to make a point, but the American people know that instead of an animal farm, this is a body of a ship of fools here. 
   We don't need cute and silly things like one is one and two is more than one, because it insults the very people that they profess to support, the employees of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. By the way, every minute that we take doing these kinds of silly things here, professing to want to debate seriously, we also take time away from the largest increase ever for veterans funding, which is the next bill that's waiting to be taken up here on the floor of the House. 
   Again, 5 years after 9/11, they couldn't do it, they wouldn't do it. Now they've decided that they're not going to let us follow through on the hollow promises that they had made for 5 1/2 years after 9/11. 
   These are serious issues that we have an obligation seriously to solve, an obligation that we owe, not just the American people, but the employees of the Department of Homeland Security. 
   I spent 26 1/2 years serving this Nation proudly on the border. I know the integrity. I know the hard work. I know the dedication that the employees of the Department of Homeland Security give each and every day. 
   They are, or they should be, respected and are not being respected by the kind of silly debate that has been going on here from Members of the other side of the aisle. I think they deserve better, I think our country deserves better, I think we all deserve better when we reflect that this is the people's House. We deserve better than that kind of silly debate. 
   I believe that it's important that we return to a process, the regular order of continuing to debate this funding for a very important agency 6 years after 9/11. 
   Let's get to the business that we were sent here to do. People put their faith and trust in us. Let's not betray that faith and trust. Let's do our job.

   I think her contribution to Texas gives us a unique insight into who the former First Lady was; a person who used her gifts, her position, her talents and her status to expand the world for everyday people, to make the world better for the inner city residents of D.C., and for the public that was traveling along the interstates of our great country, and, of course, for Texas. 
   She had vision and gave people a reason to be proud of their surroundings, to take ownership of their neighborhoods and communities, and to make them better places to live. This is meaningful and important on so many different levels for all of us that are Texans. In doing this, she was ahead of her time. She helped bring the cause of conservation to the forefront and drew our Nation's attention to the importance of creating and nurturing beauty. 
   I am honored and privileged that I met Mrs. Johnson many years ago when I was a college student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am proud of the legacy that she created and that she leaves with all of us. May she rest in peace among the hills, the streams, and especially the flowers that she so loved in Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support of this resolution. 
   As a representative of the 16th District of Texas, I rise today in honor of a great El Pasoan and a great American. 
   I have on the floor beside me two pictures of paintings by this great American. His name is Tom Lea. He hails from my district of El Paso, Texas, and has left a lasting impression on the Nation as a whole. 
   One of these paintings, ``Rio Grande,'' this one right here, was specifically chosen, as has been stated by my good friend from Connecticut, by President Bush to hang in the Oval Office. As you can see, this is a beautiful representation of the rugged landscape and the environment of our wonderful Southwest. 
   The other is a portrait of Sam Rayburn. It is probably the most familiar to many of you, as it hangs in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office Building. I venture that you would be hard-pressed to find another artist who could so capture the tenacity and formidable nature of this great Texas lawmaker and former Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Lea's legacy extends beyond the paintings that you see here, and I rise today because this month marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of this acclaimed El Pasoan. The 2007 Tom Lea Centennial Celebration, which is a month-long series of events, is currently underway all along our beautiful Southwest. 
   Mr. Lea is a celebrated illustrator, novelist, historian, war correspondent and muralist. His assignment with Life magazine in the 1940s to draw a cavalry trooper at El Paso's Fort Bliss led to his role as an accredited artist correspondent during World War II. Traveling over 100,000 miles through very dangerous and faraway theatres of war, he captured the American forces in the North Atlantic, the South Pacific, China, and Peleliu for the American public and for those of us that appreciate his great artistry today. While overseas, he also painted a portrait of China's Chiang Kai-shek. 
   From painting national and world leaders to his celebrated painting of his wife, Sarah, which includes El Paso's Franklin Mountains as the backdrop; from his critically acclaimed novels to motion pictures based on his written works; from his depictions of the heroism and harrowing circumstances of World War II to his award-winning murals in post offices in El Paso and across the country, Tom Lea has left a lasting impact on our Nation as a whole. 
   Obviously, Tom Lea is a national treasure and a creative genius. I want to thank my 79 colleagues who have signed on as cosponsors to this legislation. 
   So today, Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues to join me in honoring him by passing this resolution. My community of El Paso, Texas, was lucky to be home for such an icon, and the Nation as a whole is a richer, more interesting and more beautiful place because of his vision and his mastery.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman GEORGE MILLER for introducing this important legislation, and the 213 members who have joined me as original co-sponsors. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over two years. 
   As you know, it has been ten years since we last increased the federal minimum wage, and when adjusted for inflation it is currently at its lowest level in 50 years. 
   Every single American who commutes to work has felt the financial pinch of the rising cost of gasoline, and none more so than those making minimum wage. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, when Congress last passed legislation raising the minimum wage, the national average price for gasoline was $1.32 per gallon. Today, the average price of gasoline is $2.39 per gallon, and millions of hard-working Americans are struggling to make ends meet at a wage of $5.15 per hour. The majority of these workers are adults over the age of 20 and over 6 million kids are children of workers who will be helped by this bill. 
   This proposed increase in the minimum wage would directly affect approximately 863,000 employees in Texas and at least 68,000, or more than 30 percent, of the workforce in my district of El Paso. 
   I know of many exceptional businesses in El Paso that have taken the initiative to pay their employees more than the proposed new minimum wage. I applaud them for their leadership, but we can and should do more by passing legislation to set the standard minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, so we can move closer to ensuring that all workers earn a living wage for themselves and their families. 
   I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting our Nation's working families by voting in favor of H.R. 2.

   This fair, well-balanced legislation would open the doors to America's colleges and universities for millions of our sons and daughters who would have otherwise been dissuaded by the high cost of pursuing a higher education. Among those millions will be young men and women who will be the first in their families to attend college. There will be inventors and innovators, businessmen and women, generals, scientists, leaders of all stripes, and, surely, future members of this body. 
   At the University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP, in my district, students entering school in 2007 will save $2,300 on an average debt of $13,800, and students entering in 2011, when the full interest rate cuts take effect, will save over $4,400 on the same amount of debt. 
   These savings would mean the world to my community of El Paso and to Latino communities across the country. This is true because Hispanic students have historically borrowed less on average than other groups, a reluctance that means students are often too busy working for a paycheck to complete their degrees in a timely fashion. The six billion dollars in loan relief we are passing today will mean our kids will have the ability to borrow the money they need to finance their educations and ultimately get the jobs that will allow them prosperous lives. 
   What we are doing today also has broader significance. It is significant to the strength of our economy and the security of our country. If America is to compete economically with countries like China and India and fill key positions in our national security agencies, we need to start by sending more kids to college. Under current policy, financial barriers will prevent 6.4 million high school graduates from attending college and would cost our economy 12 million college-educated workers by the year 2020. This is a crisis, Madam Speaker. We need to recognize right now that the investments in education we make or choose not to make today will determine our economic future--whether or not our grandchildren and great-grandchildren have high-quality jobs. 
   College access is an integral part of our competitiveness and security puzzle, because we will not find the answers to the challenges we face as a Nation without a well-educated and innovative workforce. The bill we are passing today will make our country a safer and a more prosperous place. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue about the importance of education for national competitiveness and security.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 61, a resolution observing and celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., and encouraging the people of the United States to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., and his life and legacy. 
   When Martin Luther King, Jr., articulated his dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial before 200,000 people in the tumultuous August of 1963, I was living and working on my father's farm in Canutillo, Texas, not yet a high school graduate. Though instilled with the values of hard work and education by my parents and grandparents, I first encountered Dr. King's hopeful and empowering words with an unfortunate understanding, one borne from the prejudice of the times. As a Mexican-American, I knew, I would be limited in my pursuit of the celebrated American dream. Dr. King's dream contradicted that understanding. 
   Although Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech addressed the plight of the African American, his commitment to civil rights, equality, and empowerment through education lifted all people. With Dr. King's leadership, through the sheer force of his will and the strength of his arguments, men and women of my generation, Black, White, and Brown, were able to rise and prosper in society on the basis of our hard work and God-given talents. 
   Dr. King's work and influence on society opened doors for me that, as a teenager, I  thought would always be closed. I had a long and successful career in the U.S. Border Patrol, rising from agent to be the agency's first Hispanic sector chief. In 1996, I ran for Congress and became the first Latino to represent El Paso, a city that is 80 percent Hispanic. And just this past year, I was selected as chairman of this body's Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, completing a journey from the farm in Canutillo that I would never have been able to imagine during that August of 1963. 
   I thank my colleagues and urge adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra). Pending that, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the President's veto. This year, for the first time in 3 years, the Congress passed an intelligence authorization act and presented it to the President. This was something that had proved impossible for a Republican-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate. In recent years, while the bill passed the House, it never even got to conference. When I took over as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I made passing an authorization all the way through conference a high priority. It wasn't easy, but I thought it was crucial that we revitalize the oversight process, and I committed to getting an authorization bill not only passed through the House but sent to the President. 
   The intelligence community, by its very nature, presents a very difficult oversight challenge for Congress. This is why the intelligence authorization bill is so critical. It is the culmination of the committee's oversight activities conducted over the previous year. Intelligence funding is one of the few areas where the law requires funds to be both appropriated and authorized. Our constituents, of course, are demanding that we weigh in on all the important intelligence-related challenges that our Nation is facing. 
   This legislation goes a long way towards strengthening oversight of the intelligence community, which the President seems to consistently want to fight. That's why the President vetoed it. He wants the authority to do whatever he wants, in secret, with no oversight or authorization or without any checks and balances. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I don't agree. The Constitution gives us a role in this process. We do have a say, in the name of the United States of America, in what the intelligence community does. That's why we need to override this veto. 
   This legislation enhances oversight in several ways. It requires quarterly reports to Congress on the nuclear weapons programs of Iran and North Korea. We learned a lesson from the experience in Iraq. Congress must be careful and must be part of the process and a consumer of intelligence to avoid being sold a bill of goods. 
   The act requires the CIA inspector general to audit covert activities at least once every 3 years. Covert activities are historically where our intelligence community runs into legal and policy trouble. An independent CIA audit is one way to prevent problems that have embarrassed our Nation and have eroded our moral authority. 
   The authorization act also requires detailed accounting to Congress on the use of intelligence contractors. The use of contractors has grown exponentially, and no one is asking critical management questions about whether this is a good use of taxpayer money. 
   An important substantive provision of the legislation also requires the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community to abide by the same regulations that DOD follows in the context of interrogations. If it's not permissible for soldiers in Iraq, where they face a life-or-death threat daily, it shouldn't be permissible for a CIA officer or contractor. 
   Mr. Speaker, if this veto stands, all of these important oversight provisions will disappear. If we believe in strong oversight, we need to override this veto. 
   In addition to addressing long ignored oversight issues, the legislation is fundamentally the mechanism for authorizing funds for the intelligence community. This legislation authorizes funds for the full range of critical intelligence activities. It authorizes funds to support counterterrorism operations to keep Americans safe today, and it authorizes funds for the strategic intelligence investments to keep Americans safe in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we fail to override this veto, the Intelligence Committee will be silent on these important authorization issues. Once more, we'll have no authorization bill. 
   The bill also addresses some persistent management problems in the intelligence community. It requires steps towards a multi-level security clearance system to recruit more native speakers of critical languages into our intelligence community. It takes important steps towards creating a more diverse workforce to strengthen our ability to collect intelligence all over the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we fail to override this veto, it's business as usual. No new solutions, just the same old intelligence problems. 
   I have visited the patriotic men and women of the intelligence community in the far corners and in the far reaches all over the globe. They deserve our support. They are brave, they are competent, and, in most cases, they are humbled to be doing the job to keep us safe. Many serve our Nation behind the scenes and at great risk, without any expectation of recognition or congratulations. For them, and for all Americans, this is important legislation. 
   The intelligence community came to us for money, they came to us for tools, and they came to us for new authorities. We gave them what they asked for. The President, with his veto, is denying them those very things simply because he wants no limits on his Presidential power. 
   So today, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'm not a lawyer, but I am told by lawyers that every lawyer learns to argue the following way: When the law is against you, they are taught to argue the facts. When the facts are against you, they are taught to argue the law. To a certain extent, that is what is going on here today. 
   We just heard from the distinguished minority leader that he wants the House to go in neutral, put our engine in neutral and just vote on what the Senate has sent over. In other words, we want to rush to rubber-stamp what the administration wants. That's not going to happen. 
   We also heard this morning that somehow my good friend from Washington State says they haven't had enough time to debate these issues, the FISA issue. I would remind my good friend that we had invited our colleagues on the Republican side to work with us, to go through a process, the process of setting up our ability to go to conference, and they refused. They refused to participate. So it is not a failure of getting enough time to participate in the debate; it is a failure of wanting to participate because the rationale is let's rubber-stamp what the administration wants, which is the Senate version. 
   We also heard that somehow we are losing information. Somehow we are at a disadvantage because the Protect America Act expired. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would remind all of the Members that were here last night that I held up two documents, and one of those documents authored by the DNI and the Attorney General gave you the information that refutes that argument. 
   We have done everything that the DNI has asked us to do in this bill. He wants us to give the intelligence community the ability to monitor foreign to foreign. This bill does that. 
   He wants us to give the telecom companies the opportunity to state their case in order to get immunity. This bill does that. 
   The third thing he wanted was to make sure that any time that there is an American involved or an American address or phone involved, that a warrant be secured. This bill requires that. 
   This bill puts the FISA Court back in the process. That's the American way. 
   I will close by saying that I come from a State that reveres the second amendment, our right to bear arms. But I would submit to all of you, my colleagues here, that that amendment would be irrelevant if we were to give the administration exactly what they want, and that is the ability to monitor anyone, any time, for any reason, because a weapon or a gun is not going to do you any good if the government knows your every move. 
   The Senate version is their answer to give the administration exactly what they want. We took a different approach. Instead of being in neutral, we are telling the administration and, with all due respect, we are telling the Senate, let's reconcile our differences. We have given the DNI every single thing that he wants. And simply stated today, that dog is not hunting that would create an atmosphere of fear for America.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am proud to rise today in support of H.R. 3773, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This bill arms our intelligence community with powerful new tools to track and identify terrorist targets outside the United States. At the same time, it restores essential constitutional protections to Americans that were sharply eroded when the President signed the law known as the Protect America Act last August. 
   We have put the security of Americans first and foremost, with close attention to their constitutional rights. We have also included provisions to allow companies that acted lawfully to make that argument to the courts. If they did nothing wrong, as they have said, then they will be immune from any lawsuit. 
   Title I of this bill ensures that the government does not need to get an individualized warrant when it targets communications of targets overseas, the so-called foreign-to-foreign. This is the central problem that the administration cited with FISA in August, and we have fixed it. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, this bill does not require individual warrants for foreign targets before surveillance can begin. It does require the FISA Court to ensure that the procedures that the government uses to identify foreign targets are designed to protect the rights of Americans. This independent front-end review is necessary to ensure that the rights of Americans are being properly protected before any violations occur. However, we also provide a generous emergency provision, at least 30 days, so that the surveillance can begin in an emergency before the government has to go get approval from a court. 
   In title II, we address the issue of the lawsuits filed against the telecom companies who allegedly participated in the President's warrantless surveillance program. This bill allows the courts to carefully safeguard classified information under well-established protocols. This information that the companies may wish to use to defend themselves now gives them that opportunity. This will also allow the companies to defend themselves in a secure effort. If they are innocent, they will face no damage. If they broke the law, they will be held to account. But this issue will be decided by a court, the American way. 
   Title III of this bill establishes a bipartisan national commission to investigate warrantless tapping. I believe that the Nation is deeply concerned about what has gone on for the last 7 years. And I also want to restore some of the trust in the intelligence community. Title III is designed to do just that, by bringing these things into light in a careful and bipartisan manner. The American people deserve to know the truth about what has happened. This provision makes that happen. 
   This is an important step forward, Mr. Speaker. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act of 2007. I would like to give special recognition to our distinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee, Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, for her tireless work over the years on behalf of America's small business owners, many of whom reside in my district of El Paso, Texas. 
   I would also like to commend Congressman Bruce Braley who, in just his first year in Congress and as chairman of the Small Business Contracting Subcommittee, has proven to be an outstanding fighter for small businesses. 
   H.R. 3867 expands opportunities for small businesses owned by veterans. And veterans, and in particular disabled veterans who own businesses, are going to be watching very closely how Members vote on this bill here today. It also expands opportunities for women who will also look at how people support their efforts in the small business community. Minorities are watching very closely who votes for this legislation, and all others who constitute the most critical force for economic growth in our country. 
   While I support this bill as a whole, I today want to speak specifically about the provisions of this bill that modernize and update the 8(a) program at the Small Business Administration. In 1968, Congress established 8(a) to assist small businesses owned by citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged. Over the years, the 8(a) program has helped ten of thousands of businesses grow and prosper by allowing entrepreneurs valuable access to Federal contracts. 
   A large part of the program's success is a provision that makes companies with 8(a) certification eligible for smaller government contracts on a sole-source basis. In 1968, those smaller contracts were defined as contracts not exceeding $3 million in value for services or $5 million in value for manufacturing. Unfortunately, in the nearly 40 years since, these limits have barely risen, leaving our small businesses an ever-shrinking slice of the Federal contracting pool. 
   Earlier this year I introduced H.R. 1611, the 8(a) Modernization Act, to turn the clock forward for the thousands of small businesses that we have unfortunately left behind. This bill does two things: one, it increases the allowable net worth for 8(a) participants; and, two, it increases the limit on sole-source contracts for 8(a) companies. 
   H.R. 3867 includes both of these essential changes which are important not only to many small businesses in my district, but to countless American entrepreneurs around the country, including our veterans. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it, and I urge all of my colleagues to give it their full support. Again I thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for the time to speak here today and for her untiring leadership on behalf of small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with Chairman Gordon. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in order to request the attention of the distinguished chairman in addressing an important concern relating to the section in H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act of 2007, that amends the National Science Foundation Noyce Scholarship Program. 
   As you know, the core purpose of H.R. 362 is to increase the number of STEM teachers with strong content knowledge and teaching expertise serving in America's schools. In particular, the bill authorizes a large expansion of the Noyce program, which gives scholarships to students to become highly qualified teachers in exchange for their service in a public school. 
   I want to commend the chairman for crafting this very important legislation. It is an essential step in achieving our national goals of promoting innovative behavior and ensuring continued American strength and competitiveness. 
   If we are to expand the STEM pipeline, however, and if our investments in innovation and competitiveness are to pay large dividends, we must work to correct the large gaps in math and science test performance that exist today between underrepresented minority groups, which are concentrated in high need areas and the rest of the population. The first step in improving the participation of underrepresented groups is to prepare them to compete academically in STEM. 
   I am sure that the gentleman will agree that one of the most effective methods for resolving these disparities is by augmenting the number of quality, highly trained teachers serving in high-need areas. This is a job practically tailored for the Noyce Scholarship Program. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for his recognition of this need and for his willingness to work with me on this important issue, and I would like to yield to the gentleman at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last week was a remarkable week in the intelligence community. It was the best of times and the worst of times. 
   First, the good news. The week began with a release of a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. That estimate was a careful, meaningful review of the intelligence on Iran, which many of us hope will bring about a significant change in our approach to Iran, which is still a significant concern to all of us. 
   Then came the bad news. We ended the week with the revelation that the Central Intelligence Agency destroyed videotapes of interrogations. This is also a subject of great concern to all of us in this House. The committee had a briefing on it just yesterday, and we will continue to investigate the issue thoroughly. 
   Both the good news and the bad news have one thing in common. They show that careful oversight of the Intelligence Community is absolutely essential and absolutely critical. The authorization process is where we do much of our oversight and it's where we can address problem areas. 
   Madam Speaker, today, for the first time in 3 years, the House will vote on a conference report on an intelligence authorization bill. I am proud of it, and I hope my colleagues are too. This is the largest intelligence authorization in the history of our country. It is the result of 11 months of work done by our committee. 
   The conference process was a challenge. The Senate bill and the House bill were substantially different, but we worked hard to arrive at a middle ground. In conference, we further improved the bill. The conference adopted amendments offered by Members from both Chambers and both parties. This includes an amendment by the distinguished ranking member of the intelligence committee. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill that will strengthen our intelligence community and our Nation's security. It adds significant funds to most of the Nation's satellite architecture. It reduces funding for nonperforming intelligence activities in Iraq, while robustly funding activities against al Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan and around the globe. 
   I am particularly proud of the fact that it also includes funding for counterterrorism, human intelligence collection, analysis, training and languages. We have carefully tailored provisions to enhance the diversity of the intelligence community, which is a critical investment for the future of the intelligence community. 
   In another investment for the future, we've added significant funding for advanced research and development. This will also maintain our technical edge over our adversaries. We have also provided money to repair and replace aging infrastructure and to train and equip linguists and intelligence collectors, so vital and important in the global war on terrorism. 
   This bill promotes accountability within the intelligence community, and it puts the intelligence committee back in the business of oversight. It requires reporting to Congress on several issues of major concern to all of us, including a report on compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and related provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 regarding detentions and interrogations, as well as Justice Department legal opinions related to all of these activities. It includes provisions to strengthen oversight by the Inspector General in the intelligence community, including a provision establishing a confirmed communitywide Inspector General armed with essential authorities. 
   The conference report also provides for Senate confirmation of the Directors of the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. For agencies with such significant budgets and acquisition authority and the potential to impact American privacy rights, we think the Congress ought to have a say in their Directors through Senate confirmation. 
   In short, Madam Speaker, the conference report is a result of a bipartisan, bicameral effort to strengthen both the intelligence community and congressional oversight. I will be proud to vote for it, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As I said in my opening comments, this is the first time in 3 years that we've had an authorization bill. It's not a perfect bill and I think all of us acknowledge that, but the concept of democracy is that we work together. There are provisions in this bill by both Democrats and Republicans, and just because you don't like every aspect of it, you don't gather up your marbles and go home. It's about protecting our country. That's what we are trying to do. And I urge all Members to support this bill.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand that the gentleman and others are concerned about the presence of earmarks in this conference report. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could take them seriously with those concerns. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have now ``seen the light'' on earmarks, now that they are in the minority. But we all know that the most heavily earmarked bills in history were passed in the last few Congresses, when my colleagues controlled the Chamber.  
   The fact of the matter is that never, never in the history of this institution have we had the kind of process and transparency on earmarks that we have had in this bill, in this Congress. We have validated every single earmark in this bill to ensure that we believe that it is a good use of the taxpayer money. We take that seriously, and as something that will help the intelligence community. These earmarks have been vetted through the intelligence community. 
   In terms of the arguments about the motion to recommit, there has never been an intelligence authorization bill with this level of earmark process, with this level of transparency, and with this level of accountability. Every earmark in this bill has been vetted, as I mentioned, to make certain that the activity that the earmark proposes and the funds going to that activity are ones that make our country safer. Each earmark has been fully disclosed with the name of the requesting Member, the purpose, the amount. In previous Congresses, no such disclosures were ever required. For each earmark, a public record has been established, which is available for review; and they have been reviewed. 
   As chairman, along with my colleague, the distinguished ranking member, I have personally reviewed each and every earmark. These earmarks improve the bill and will help our intelligence community to keep this country safe. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, if there is a motion to recommit on this bill, as the gentleman has indicated, it will kill this bill. It will also kill this bipartisan process. It will kill our oversight, and it will kill our funding so desperately needed to keep our country safe and to provide the resources to our brave intelligence professionals. I urge my colleagues to oppose such a motion to recommit. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides the aisle who have spoken in favor of this conference report. As I said at the outset, I am proud of this conference report. A lot of hard work has gone into this process on a bipartisan basis, and I want to thank the staff on a bipartisan basis as well. It is a bipartisan, bicameral product. It strengthens the intelligence community and congressional oversight. 
   I would just remind every Member that this authorization is above the President's budget request for human intelligence funding. No authorization bill is perfect. No one gets everything that they want in this legislative process. But at the end of the day, this conference report reflects a bipartisan process that will make our country safer, that will give our intelligence professionals the resources and the tools that they need to keep us safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to approve the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 322, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirming the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. 
   Israel sets the example for the nations of the Middle East, as the only true democracy in that region. For the past 60 years, Israel has been a sanctuary of democracy and pluralism in a region dominated by authoritarian regimes. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with free elections, a free press, freedom of religion, protection for minority rights and other safeguards typical of a free society. 
   Like the United States, Israel is a country founded by immigrants. Since its founding, the tiny state has absorbed more than three million immigrants from more than 100 countries, including Jews from the former Soviet Union and those forced to flee from Arab countries. A haven for Jewish refugees from around the world, Israel has also reached out to assist Jews wherever they suffer from persecution and has made the successful absorption of new immigrants in society a top priority. 
   The United States and Israel have formed a unique strategic partnership to meet the growing dangers in one of the world's most volatile regions. To support the U.S. war on tenor since September 11, 2001, the U.S. and Israel share vital intelligence on terrorism, weapons proliferation and other threats, at a level of sensitivity almost unparalleled among American allies. Thousands of U.S. armed forces personnel have utilized Israeli training facilities, and Israeli officials have shared ``lessons learned'' from their extensive combat experience with their counter-parts at the Department of Defense. 
   With U.S. help, Israel is able to maintain its qualitative military edge for deterring aggression by its potential enemies. By collaborating with Israel, the U.S. has a reliable, democratic and technologically advanced partner in securing American strategic interests. This partnership includes: bilateral strategic agreements on military planning; ballistic missile defense and counter-terrorism; joint development of weapons and technologies; intelligence sharing; and combined military exercises. The U.S. and Israel have established a cost-effective partnership in the research and development of military technologies and know-how, and in identifying solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems facing both countries' military planners. 
   Despite its small size, Israel is recognized as a world leader in the quality of its indigenously developed military technology. As such, the U.S. has incorporated Israeli equipment and technology into its armed forces. 
   It is also important to note that the ties between Israel and the Jewish Community in the Sixteenth Congressional District of Texas remain strong. Through many community based programs, the Jewish Federation of El Paso strives to strengthen this connection through education, through scholarships for trips to Israel, and through financial and spiritual support for their Israeli family. The Federation's upcoming celebration of Israel's independence (Yom Ha'atzmaut) will be a unifying experience that will also help teach our younger generation about the incredible story of Israel. 
   With my support of House Concurrent Resolution 322, I recognize the historic significance of the 60th anniversary of the reestablishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, and I extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to the State of Israel and the Israeli people for a peaceful, prosperous, and successful future.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   A few weeks ago I had a conversation with my good friend and colleague, the former chairman, who is now our ranking member. At the time, he was supportive of this panel. I recognize we all have the right to change our minds, but part of this process is starting to build a bridge that gives us an opportunity on the authorizing side to be able to do a better job for this country. 
   Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H. Res. 35, which would implement a core recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Madam Speaker, 2 1/2 years ago, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, five Democrats and five Republicans, unanimously made 45 recommendations to prevent another attack on United States soil. Tragically, the President and previous Congress earned dismal grades for failing to enact these recommendations. One of these recommendations, indeed the one the commission called the most difficult and the most important, was to reform the way Congress oversees the intelligence activities of the United States. 
   Intelligence is the tip of the spear in the war against violent extremists and in the efforts to counter weapons of mass destruction. Yet despite the importance of this mission, congressional oversight of intelligence has largely been dysfunctional. 
   Most significantly, the committee responsible for overseeing the intelligence community, the House Intelligence Committee, has had little role in deciding how the Nation's intelligence budget is spent. H. Res. 35 is a critical starting point for fixing our broken oversight system. Today, we are creating a special panel within the Appropriations Committee to recommend funding levels for intelligence activities. This panel will be comprised of appropriators and authorizers, both Democrats and Republicans, with its own dedicated staff to review intelligence community activities. 
   As the chairman of the authorizing committee, the House Intelligence Committee, I welcome this change because it gives authorizers, those of us who review the intelligence programs and set overall funding levels, a real seat at the table in deciding how the money is being spent. In the past, our committee has had no real voice in the appropriations process. Today, with the passage of H. Res. 35, those who control the policy and those who control the purse will become unified. 
   Oversight promotes greater accountability; and accountability results in better intelligence, greater diversity among intelligence officers to penetrate the hardest targets, more sophisticated analysts, and a deeper understanding of the longer term threats that are facing this country. One need only look at the situation in Iraq to understand the perils of faulty intelligence. The best way for Congress to ensure that those days are over is to enact a meaningful reform of the way we oversee the intelligence budget. 
   Madam Speaker, the threats facing our country are real. We have some of the best and brightest on the front lines, often undercover and frequently under fire, trying to gather the intelligence to keep America safe. We owe it to them and to their families to provide the strongest intelligence community that we can support and we can field. H. Res. 35 is an important start to achieving that goal, so today I proudly urge all my colleagues to support the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an incredible turn of events from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are now arguing for undocumented people within the confines of this country. 
   Let me start out by making a flat statement. The RESTORE Act confers no additional rights on undocumented aliens beyond those that they already have under the Constitution or current U.S. law. 
   You know, there is an old lawyer's adage, and I am not a lawyer but I am told by my friends who are, when the facts are not on your side, you are taught to argue the law. When the law is not on your side, you are taught to argue the facts. 
   Well, here on the floor like we have in the past, we have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that are so conflicted as to be humorous if this wasn't such a serious, serious issue for our country and for our national security. 
   When they complain about not having any input, let me just clear the record and for the record state that they filed 12 amendments with our committee, the Intelligence Committee. Yet, when it came time to offer and proffer those amendments, they only had two. One was on immunity which, by the way, we have never been given the documents to review, so we would not have known what we were granting immunity to the telecom companies for. But that one was of their amendments. The second amendment was to substitute the Protect America Act for the RESTORE Act. 
   That gives you a clear indication that, today just as in the previous Congresses, the Congressional Republicans were and are in a rush to rubber-stamp every single thing that the administration wanted. And so now when things have changed and we have checks and balances, we have our colleagues who formerly rushed, rubber-stamped anything and everything that the administration wanted to do, now they are using delaying tactics. And so when it is convenient, they argue the law. When it is convenient, they argue the facts. 
   What is clear, crystal clear, here is that we have to have checks and balances. In order to protect this country, in order to protect our national security, there have to be checks and balances. That's what the RESTORE Act does. 
   And when they complain about the rule, it is a sham argument. When they complain about not having enough input, it is a sham argument. When they argue the facts, it is because the law is not on their side. When they argue the law, it is because the facts are not on their side. So it is not about truth; it is not even about justice. It is about scoring political victories. 
   There is a publication here on the Hill that said FISA is coming back up on the floor and it will determine who can maneuver best. You know what, as an American, I am sick and tired of maneuvering. I am sick and tired of people saying we need to work in a bipartisan manner when they work to undermine the process of checks and balances. The American people are sick and tired. 
   I support this rule. I think we have a great bill here in the RESTORE Act. I think this is something that we need to pass today, take it to conference and start being serious about balancing the tools that our agencies need to protect us with a careful balance of protecting Americans' rights under the Constitution. Vote for this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in support of H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act. I would also like the RECORD to reflect that Congressman BARON HILL intended to be listed as a cosponsor of H.R. 3773, and we are certainly grateful for his support. 
   In early September, at the direction of Speaker Pelosi, the Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee took up the call to improve the Protect America Act, or PAA. Passed in August, the PAA modified FISA and gave sweeping and unprecedented surveillance powers to the executive branch, while requiring minimal oversight and without providing a meaningful judicial check on the President's use of the new powers. 
   While we were charged with undoing the excesses of PAA, we also have the mandate to provide our intelligence professionals the legal authorities required to protect the country from our enemies. Six years after the tragic attacks of 9/11, Osama bin Laden remains at large and America continues to face threats from al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. The war in Iraq continues to act as a recruitment tool for all our enemies. 
   Mindful of these threats, we drafted the RESTORE Act as a bill that we can all support and be proud of. The RESTORE Act arms our intelligence community with powerful new authorities to conduct electronic surveillance of targets outside the United States while maintaining our fundamental liberties. First, it exempts truly foreign-to-foreign communications from any judicial review, even when the communication passes through the United States or the surveillance device is still actually located in the United States. Second, it authorizes the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for all matters of national defense, including information relating to terrorism, espionage, sabotage, and other threats to the national security of our country. 
   Third, the act clarifies that nothing in the act or the amendments to the act shall be construed to prohibit lawful surveillance necessary to prevent Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or any other terrorist organization from attacking the United States or our allies. But these powerful authorities are subject to the checks and the balances required by our Constitution. 
   The RESTORE Act puts the FISA Court back in business where the rights of Americans are at stake. The RESTORE Act tightens overbroad language in the PAA that authorized physical searches of Americans' homes and offices without a warrant. The RESTORE Act restores meaningful, robust, and continuous oversight by the judicial and legislative branches to ensure that the powerful intelligence-gathering tools authorized by the RESTORE Act are being used effectively and within the boundaries set by our Constitution. 
   In sum, the RESTORE Act provides tools to keep the Nation safe and upholds our constitutional liberties. This debate has gone on long enough, I believe, Mr. Speaker. It has been unnecessarily prolonged bipartisan maneuvering from some in this House. I am sure that we will see more of that partisan gamesmanship tonight. But I urge my colleagues to reject partisan politics in favor of sound policy and support this critically important bill. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the RESTORE Act. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this is a sham solution in search of a problem. This language is unnecessary, and it would kill this bill. The bill already states that this act and the amendments made by this act shall not be construed to prohibit the intelligence community from conducting lawful surveillance that is necessary, one, to prevent Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or any other terrorist or terrorist organization from attacking the United States. It also provides the means to protect the United States, any United States person or any ally of the United States from threats posed by weapons of mass destruction or other threats of national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, the answer to the ranking member's question about undocumented aliens, all they have to do is check section 235 and 287 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. This does not confer any additional rights not provided by the Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, we are in times of peril for a great country. All of us I think agree on that. 
   As I listened to the previous debates, the one providing assistance to Minnesota and also the one discussing the resolution prior to us coming on the floor, I was reflecting on the many men and women around the world that right now are putting their lives on the line to keep this country safe. They don't do it for glory; they don't do it for fame. They do it with an inherent trust in us that we will do the right thing to provide them the proper tools to do their jobs and keep us safe. That is what this bill does. 
   Mike McConnell, the Director of the National Intelligence Service, came to us and asked us for three things initially. 
   We gave him those three things. He told us we were at a time of heightened threats. We recognize that; so we worked in a bipartisan manner with the DNI to craft a bill, only to be told that it wasn't everything that he needed, yesterday.     
   We can't afford to leave and go on recess without passing this critical piece of legislation. This piece of legislation that sunsets in 120 days gives him the tools that he needs to keep us safe and to keep the trust with those men and women around the world that expect us to do the right thing.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a minute to respond to my colleague from Michigan. 
   This is a serious issue. We have worked hard for the last 2 weeks in particular, in addition to the hearings that we have had, with the commitment that we are going to do an overall fix of FISA in the fall. But we wanted to give the administration the three things, as my colleague from Florida just mentioned, that they could work with so they could keep this country safe in this urgent hour. Those three things we gave them. Then the goalposts were moved and we were told that there would be additional issues. That has been our experience. 
   The difference here is very simple, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle for 6 years have been only too happy to oblige the administration on whatever they need. You got a bill? Let's rubber-stamp it. Need a supplemental? Let's rubber-stamp it. 
   Well, do you know what? Those days are over. Since we took control of the Congress, we are doing the oversight that was neglected. We are now being part of the process to make sure that not only do we have the tools to keep this country safe, but that we protect the American people and their civil rights. That is the basic fundamental difference. 
   This bill here does the three things that the DNI asked us to do and that the administration wanted us to do. It is not the all-encompassing changes that FISA needs, but we are committed to doing that in the fall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to start off by correcting the distinguished gentleman from Michigan. Director McConnell didn't have 30 years, doesn't have 30 years experience in working in intelligence, he has 40 years experience working in intelligence. The reason I know that is for the last couple of weeks we have been working, trying to work together in a bipartisan way with the Senate and the House on this bill that we have here today. 
   Director McConnell asked us to do three things yesterday, and he sought the very bill that he is rejecting today, three things, and he could support our bill. Those three things were: expand it from relating to terrorism to relating to foreign intelligence; eliminate the requirement that the FISA Court adjudicate how recurring communications into the U.S. from foreign targets would be handled; and, third, allow for foreign targets to be added for the basket warrant after the warrant was approved. We did each and every one of these things. 
   They say, okay, we got a deal. No. After getting on the phone with the White House and the Republican leadership, he said, oh, I have a few other things that we need. 
   Well, you know, when we talk about the security of this country, when we talk about a serious issue like giving our intelligence professionals the tools that they need to keep us safe, it is serious business. 
   Today, we have to decide for ourselves do we want, on a temporary basis for 120 days, to give the Director the tools that he said he needed, the three things that he said he needed included in our bill to keep us safe while we work on the bigger issue, the bigger fix of FISA, or if you vote against this bill, do you make it a political issue? 
   The choice is simple. Are you interested in giving him the tools that are needed and necessary to keep us safe, or do you want it as a political issue? That's the question before us this afternoon. 
   The Director yesterday, in answering to the majority leader's inquiry, said this bill, this bill that we have before us today, significantly enhances America's security, the very bill that, according to the ranking member, he is rejecting. 
   My colleague, the gentlelady from New Mexico, says we didn't show the DNI the bill. We sent that to him. His lawyers dissected it. We were in the same room; and on one occasion, at least one occasion, Mr. Hoekstra was with us as we were talking about the issues, along with the Senate, didn't show it to him. 
   He had a chance to look at it, digest it and make recommendations, like the three issues that I just read, that he agreed to yesterday. Those are important things. Facts matter. The truth matters. Not about obfuscating the truth, it's about doing what's right for our country. 
   This is the right thing to do, to keep us safe for the next 120 days, so we continue to do the work of this committee.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, 6 years after the tragic attacks of 9/11, Osama bin Laden remains at large. The minority whip may make light about ordering pizza, but the reality is we still haven't gotten Osama bin Laden and America faces a continuing threat from al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. 
   Just this week, Admiral Scott Redd, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said that the Iraq war has created a giant recruiting tool for al Qaeda. When asked if we are safer as a result of our invasion of Iraq, Admiral Redd said, ``Tactically, probably not.'' 
   Mindful of this threat, our committees have drafted the RESTORE Act. I wish to thank Chairman Conyers and members of both committees for their great work in drafting this legislation. The RESTORE Act arms our intelligence community with powerful new authorities to conduct electronic surveillance of terrorist targets around the world, but it also restores essential constitutional protections for Americans that were sharply eroded when the President signed the Protect America Act, or PAA, last August. 
   Some on the other side want to extend the PAA permanently. That would be a huge mistake. According to expert testimony we have received in our committee, the PAA authorizes warrantless domestic searches of Americans' homes, mail, computers and medical records, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee observed earlier. 
   Although we don't have any information at this time that the Bush administration is using this authority in this way, we must guard against the possibility of abuse in the future. Our committee heard testimony that the PAA even allows spying without probable cause on our own soldiers deployed overseas talking to their families back home. That, Mr. Speaker, is wrong. 
   The RESTORE Act helps restore the balance between security and liberty. The RESTORE Act puts the FISA Court back in the business of protecting Americans' constitutional rights, after the President and Vice President put the court out of business 6 years ago. 
   Some will try to portray this bill as extending rights to terrorists. We have heard that this morning. That is absolutely false. This bill does not require individual warrants for terrorists such as Osama bin Laden. The bill does not extend fourth amendment rights to foreigners. 
   What the RESTORE Act does is allow ``block surveillance'' of terrorists overseas with speed and agility. And we will never go dark, because the bill includes an emergency provision that allows surveillance to continue for 45 days, even before the court approves the procedures to protect Americans. 
   This legislation will restore accountability and oversight in all three branches. It restores regular audits and reports by the Department of Justice, which will be reviewed by the Congress. It also requires an audit of the President's Domestic Surveillance Program and other warrantless surveillance programs. 
   Perhaps most importantly, it ensures that when an American is the target of surveillance, an individualized warrant is required. 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prefer an approach that would allow the administration to police itself. This simply is unacceptable. If we have learned anything from the past 6 years, it is that unchecked executive power is a recipe for abuse and it has not made us safer.     
   Mr. Speaker, I have served my country as a soldier in combat in Vietnam, as a law enforcement professional on our southern border, and as a Member of Congress for the past decade. I have seen the great strength of our country; and in my view, the source of that great strength is our Constitution. The RESTORE Act provides tools to keep this Nation safe and upholds our Constitution and our laws. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RESTORE Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of issues that have been brought up by the other side regarding this bill. First of all, it's important to keep in mind that what we're trying to do with this legislation is to carefully balance providing the tools to the intelligence professionals that are charged with keeping us safe in this country, and this legislation does that, regardless of what comments the other side has made. 
   Second, and most important, we have to balance it with protecting the civil rights of our citizens. As we talk about protecting this country, we have to keep in mind that this country was founded on the principle of the rule of law. The rule of law protects its citizens. 
   Under the Protect America Act, as we have seen over the course of the last few weeks, many, many concerns have been raised about the authorities that have been given to the government, authorities that would render our citizens not being able to protect and be secure in our homes and in our possessions. 
   The Protect America Act has given so many authorities that people are not safe and secure in their own homes. The government can go in there and search their computers, search their residences, and search literally every possession that Americans have. This legislation corrects those deficiencies. This legislation is a careful balance in keeping our country safe, as well as securing the rights of Americans in their homes.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, the intelligence community has devoted significant resources to collecting and analyzing intelligence on the narcotics trade and on terrorism, but it has not performed an in-depth analysis of the link between the two. 
   In Afghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaeda have benefited from the greater cultivation, refinement, and trade of opium and hashish. The dark world of narcotics has become a funding source for terrorist groups in Afghanistan. 
   This amendment proposes to bring together all of the intelligence agencies to analyze the connection between terrorists and their narcotics-backed funding. I value Mr. Kirk's interest in the narcoterrorist nexus, and therefore I support his amendment.

   Mr. Speaker, I object to the motion to recommit because it simply is intended to kill the bill. Communities all around this country are hurting with $4 gas and all we get from the other side are charades as we've seen here tonight. The whole world watches as we try to do what's right. The whole world heard them say earlier that this was a vital and important piece of legislation that would fund the intelligence community. This is a betrayal of the work that is being done by men and women in the intelligence community that are putting their lives on the line to keep us safe. This is an outrage put forth by the politics, rather than wanting to get things done in this House.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, intelligence is critical to every decision affecting America's national security. Whether the challenge is learning the intentions of our Nation's adversaries or detecting the location of the next roadside IED in Iraq, America needs a well-resourced and well-managed intelligence community.     
   This committee's primary responsibilities are to authorize funds for the intelligence agencies, to conduct vigorous oversight over their operations and to ensure that those operations are effective, legal and an appropriate use of taxpayer money. 
   Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hoekstra, the gentleman from Michigan, for working with me in a bipartisan fashion to bring this bill to the floor. I also want to thank the staffs on both sides of the aisle for the great work that they have done to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   This year, as in years past, I have gone to the front lines to see our courageous intelligence professionals perform their jobs. They do this quietly, often without recognition or praise. Many spend time away from their families, often in very dangerous situations and under very dangerous conditions. This bill is the tangible sign of our support for the women and men of our America's intelligence agencies. 
   We're providing robust funding for our most important priorities including HUMINT, language capabilities and technical capabilities. 
   Our principal concern continues to be that al Qaeda is stronger today than at any time since September 11, 2001. Osama bin Laden and his key deputies remain at large. But al Qaeda is not the only terrorist group that has gained strength. Over the past 7 years, Hezbollah and Hamas have become more capable and even more determined. Dangerous states, including Syria, are pursuing nuclear capabilities. There is the possibility that one of these states, or even a rogue scientist, could transfer fissile material to a terrorist group. This must remain our foremost priority and our top concern. 
   This bill invests in people, our most precious resource. It adds funding to enhance human intelligence collection, not only for counterterrorism, but also for enduring and emerging global security issues, such as challenges that we face in Asia, Africa and Latin America, to name a few. This bill also contains a number of provisions that promote greater accountability, including the creation of a new Inspector General for the intelligence community. 
   Our bill will improve language capabilities in the intelligence community by adding funding for speakers of critical languages and requiring reports to  Congress to evaluate progress in this perennial problem area. The bill also mandates implementation of security clearance reform to make it easier for first and second generation Americans, many of whom have critical language skills, to serve in the intelligence community with proper clearances. 
   I mentioned earlier that one of the responsibilities of this committee is oversight. Yet this administration has repeatedly failed to comply with the National Security Act of 1947, which mandates that our committee be ``fully and currently informed'' of all the intelligence activities from the administration. This bill enhances congressional oversight by ensuring that the committee receives the information that it needs to perform its inherent oversight function. 
   Working on a bipartisan basis, our committee adopted two provisions to enhance reporting on intelligence activities to the full membership of the congressional intelligence committees. One provision would restrict 75 percent of all covert action funds until the full membership of the intelligence committees is briefed on all covert actions in effect as of April 24, 2008. A second provision would restrict the administration's attempts to brief only the chairman and ranking member and clarifies which information must be reported to our full committee. 
   This legislation also authorizes much of the requests for the foundational activities of the cybersecurity initiative, but it also expresses the committee's serious concerns about potential policy, implementation and governance issues. Our committee is also concerned that Congress does not have a comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of human and fiscal intelligence resources that have been devoted to Iraq, possibly at the expense of fighting the war on terror. H.R. 5959 requires a detailed report to our committee on this very topic. 
   The bill also addresses a number of long-term technical challenges in the intelligence community. It does so by adding significant resources to modernize signals intelligence capabilities and integrate them into the global enterprise. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, despite the size of the budget request, the administration did not include funds adequate to keep the U.S. intelligence community competitive in advanced technologies. Research and development funding is our Nation's investment in maintaining our edge in state of the art technologies. Our bill adds funds to four agencies specifically for that purpose. And the committee urges the executive branch to sustain, if not increase, this level of funding in future budgets. 
   In our markup, Mr. Chairman, the committee adopted a number of amendments offered by both the majority and minority members. One of those important amendments, crafted with bipartisan cooperation, will prevent CIA contractors from engaging in interrogations unless the Director of National Intelligence provides a waiver. 
   Our goal is to put this committee back in the authorization business by getting a bill to the President's desk that he can sign. To do that, we can't tackle every single important issue in this one bill. But if we fail to pass this bill, we risk eroding Congress' ability to strengthen and oversee intelligence operations that are vital to American national security. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And I also want to say that this is a good, solid bill. This is the kind of effort that our men and women in the intelligence community serving us proudly throughout the world deserve.  Each and every one of them gives their best effort, and they deserve the respect and the support of every Member of this body and everyone in this country. We thank them for the effort that they put forward, and we appreciate the commitment, the dedication and their professionalism, as well as the sacrifices that their families provide for our great country. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I want to say that it has been a privilege to lead this committee. We have great Members on both sides that care very much about our national security and work very hard on all the issues that are important to our country and our national security.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, the revised Reyes/Murphy manager's amendment does several things. First, it makes clear that the intelligence community may enter into a contract to purchase a generally available fuel that is not an alternative or synthetic fuel or produced from a non conventional petroleum source provided that certain criteria are met. Some members of our committee were interested in addressing this issue, and we, Mr. Chairman, have done our best to handle it within the jurisdiction of our committee. 
   Second, we included an amendment offered by Mr. Welch to require an assessment of the feasibility of employing individuals who have worked for the Federal Government in Iraq or Afghanistan as translators or interpreters. It fits very well with the committee's other reporting requirements on foreign languages. I believe it will be helpful to know whether the intelligence community can benefit from those individuals who have already served our government in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   And finally, Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment makes a technical correction to a report on intelligence resources devoted to Iraq and Afghanistan. This correction is designed to ensure that the report captures both collection and analysis resources. 
   So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.

   The United States should support democratic nations in their efforts against violent terrorist groups such as FARC. We are all proud of the recent rescue of U.S. and Colombian hostages held by the FARC. This operation shows the strength, resourcefulness, and valor of the Colombian military. These qualities were developed through cooperation between the U.S. and Colombia. 
   In the past years, Colombia has made great strides against the FARC and greatly has reduced their strength. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported assistance to Colombia for the past decade. We must continue to do so.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, which incidentally was offered in our committee but which was not agreed to. 
   For years, Members have come to this floor to talk about the need to win the hearts and minds of moderate Muslims. This was one of the central recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   The Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department have issued careful guidance to their employees saying in effect, when you see the term ``jihad'' to describe a violent form of terrorism, you might be alienating those moderate Muslims who want to join us in the fight against terrorism. 
   The government must consider how its words will be interpreted by its audience. If Muslims around the world hear something other than what we want to say, we will simply not achieve our goals. 
   This is sensible guidance, not political correctness. Language is a strategic weapon in the war of ideas. We should, therefore, use it wisely. The administration has obviously realized this and has provided appropriate guidance. 
   Congress should not try to undermine this effort by sending contradictory messages about the use of these terms.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend from Florida for yielding me time on this very important rule. 
   I rise in support of this rule. The terrorist plot that was recently uncovered in New Jersey this past week shows that we cannot let our guard down in the effort to learn the plans and intentions of people who would do us grave harm. 
   The underlying bill, H.R. 2082, provides funding for the brave women and men of our intelligence community. I have visited with them in every corner of the world, and I am constantly amazed by their patriotism, their dedication to mission, and their commitment to doing our Nation's most sensitive and dangerous business, often without public acknowledgement or recognition. 
   Today, the United States faces a dynamic set of threats, challenges, and opportunities. We are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. We face a growing terrorist threat. Countries like Iran and North Korea are working towards a nuclear bomb. And we face a number of other key challenges in Africa, Latin America, and from rising powers like Russia and China. These major challenges require a major effort by our government to collect, to analyze, and to disseminate intelligence, and to do so within the legal bounds of our Constitution and our national values. 
   This bill invests in human intelligence. It invests in analysis and analysts. It funds key counterterrorism operations and sensitive collection programs. And it improves critical oversight in key areas such as the overuse of contractors and the lack of qualified linguists in the intelligence business. 
   This bill was developed on a bipartisan basis. And although there may not be agreement on every single point, there is agreement on all the major points. This rule will allow a full debate on many of the key issues before us, and I, along with my colleagues, should welcome this debate. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just wanted to assure my friend and colleague from Arizona that, being sensitive to the issues that he mentioned about one of our former colleagues that, regrettably, now sits in prison, the Intelligence Committee worked very closely with the Parliamentarians, the Committee on Standards and Official Conduct, and other committees of the House on earmark disclosures. 
   I am at a loss as to who informed the gentleman that there would be no earmarks, but I think the gentleman now knows that the Government Printing Office made an error in omitting the earmarks and that is why the delay in putting them up on their Web site. 
   Be that as it may, this committee followed the requirements of the House for each Member receiving an earmark to certify that neither he or she nor his or her spouse would benefit financially from any kind of action. We complied with all the requirements, all the rules, and all the regulations. 
   As I said, we did this in a very transparent and bipartisan way because we did not want to leave any impressions that things were not done according to the rules that had been set out. Everything that we did with this process followed the rules and the process. Where the glitch came was where the printing was done. There was an error committed by the Government Printing Office, and that is why there was a delay in posting the earmarks.

   Mr. REYES. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Intelligence is our Nation's first line of defense. In a world of asymmetrical threats, it is critical that we detect and disrupt the plans and intentions of those who would do us harm. And it is critical that we conduct intelligence operations in a way that conforms to our laws and to our values as a Nation. 
   This bill was the product of bipartisan work, and I am pleased that the ranking member, Mr. Hoekstra, worked with me over the past several weeks and months to draft this bill. We do not agree on every provision in this bill, but we agree on the larger points, and we agree that intelligence officers in the field deserve our support. 
   Let me address up front one area where I think there has been some confusion, and that is section 407 of the bill, which asks for a national intelligence estimate on the national security impact of climate change. 
   We heeded the advice of 11 former 3- and 4-star admirals and generals who have studied this issue and specifically recommended an NIE. They believe that significant changes in global climate may act as a ``threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of our world.'' 
   The ranking member has argued that this work should not divert resources from higher priority items. Our committee staff has spoken with senior Intelligence Community leaders in the administration, and we have been assured that this will not, I repeat, will not divert resources. 
   The data needed is already available. The administration is already drafting a community assessment on this very issue. And I want to assure the ranking member that we will work with the administration to ensure that nothing will divert resources away from higher priority efforts. 
   But I also want to be clear; targeted discussion on this topic is a distraction from the key points of this bill. This bill provides funding for the men and women in the field. Opposition to this bill sends the wrong signal to them. 
   We are at war, and we face many threats over the horizon. This bill contains robust funding for critical intelligence programs to penetrate the hard targets, such as terrorist networks and countries developing WMD capabilities. 
   We add funds to both CIA and military elements for human intelligence training. We invest in language training for collectors and analysts and in language translation capabilities. We add funding for sending additional analysts overseas, and we strengthen counterintelligence field operations. 
   We have added funds to broaden our view so that we are spending, not just on Iraq, but on some of the other global challenges that we face, such as Iran, Russia, East Africa, Latin America and countries in Asia. 
   We have several provisions that enhance critical oversight. We require quarterly intelligence reports to Congress on the nuclear weapons programs of Iran and North Korea. 
   We also require that the CIA Inspector General conduct an audit of covert activities no less than once every 3 years. And we require the administration to provide the Intelligence Committees with a full list of all special access programs. 
   We also require detailed reports to Congress on the use of contractors in the Intelligence Community because their use has grown without adequate oversight, both by Congress and even by the executive branch. 
   We also require a strategy for implementing a multi-level security clearance system. This will allow patriotic Americans with much needed foreign language skills to serve as translators or linguists in the Intelligence Community. 
   And we also promote diversity in the Intelligence Community by requiring a strategic plan for implementing the recommendations of a highly regarded diversity panel. 
   I am of the strong view that diversity is a major strategic asset of the United States, and we have to leverage that asset to our full advantage. 
   In sum, Madam Chairman, this bill strengthens U.S. intelligence capabilities. This bill, if passed and signed into law, will help the courageous women and men of our Intelligence Community accomplish their mission. They are counting on our support, and tonight I hope we respond. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this critical legislation. 
   With that, Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Chair, I am very proud of this bill, and I am proud of the work we all put into it. I realize there are some political differences. You have heard the minority go from characterizing bugs and bunnies. Well, I think bogeyman politics doesn't work with the American people. It doesn't work with the challenge that we are facing in Iraq, and it is not going to fly with what we are doing with this intelligence bill. 
   This bill does not make cuts. It adds funds to both CIA and military elements for human intelligence training. It adds funding for sending additional analysts overseas. 
   Yes, I agree with the former ranking member, we should be concerned about al Qaeda. The ranking member mentioned the potential attacks against Fort Dix last week. So this is serious business. We know it is. 
   This is an important piece of legislation that I hope everyone knows it is imperative that they support. The men and women of the Intelligence Community don't care about mischaracterizations. They don't care about talking about slam dunking and bugs and bunnies and all of these other rhetorical phrases that the minority likes to engage in. They care about support from Congress. 
   This bill gives the Intelligence Community the support that they need. All you have to do is travel around the world and listen to them. I am proud of this legislation. 
   By strengthening our Nation's Intelligence Community, we will be able to detect and disrupt the plans of those that are threatening our national security. I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation.

   Mr. REYES. Madam Chair, I have tremendous respect for both of my colleagues, and they know that they have my commitment that we will continue to do aggressive oversight, because I do understand the concerns that they have about Office of the DNI and the way that it has grown and become too large. And while I support the goal of the amendment, I don't necessarily think this is the best way to proceed. 
   The amendment, I believe, will have unintended consequences. For example, though the intent of this amendment is to limit the layers of unnecessary bureaucracy, this cap would actually eliminate large numbers of analysts and planners, with the harshest impact falling on the National Counterterrorism Center, which analyzes terrorism information and plans counterterrorism operations. It would also have the unintended consequence that it would eliminate personnel from the National Counterproliferation Center and the Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties. 
   In addition, this amendment would force the DNI to fire anyone hired between May 1 and the date of the enactment of this bill, preventing the DNI from increasing capacity in priority areas. 
   It is important, I believe, to note that this amendment would not cap the number of billets; it would cap the total number of people. Any currently unfilled billets would have to remain unfilled. This could negatively impact the DNI's ability to perform vital functions. 
   Finally, I would ask my colleagues to consider that we do have, as Mr. Rogers said, a new DNI, and he deserves an opportunity to do the kinds of things that he has articulated to our committee. He is reorganizing his office, and I believe that we need to give him the flexibility needed to make those changes, while at the same time aggressively pursuing the oversight that is the responsibility of our committee. 
   So, for those reasons, I reluctantly would oppose this amendment.

   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this motion to recommit because it would cut a program that makes valuable contributions to the war on drugs and to homeland security, first and foremost. 
   This motion is also misleading because the underlying bill provides our intelligence officers everything they need. It adds funds to the CIA and Defense Department for human intelligence training so that our operators can be more effective. It invests in language training for case officers so they can operate effectively overseas. 
   My colleague talks about following the rules. One of the premier rules that we have is we never mention a number in classified programs; $23 million telegraphs our enemies what we are doing. 
   The motion to recommit asks for a study. This program has been studied before. I just want to quote the White House drug czar. When the White House drug czar toured the NDIC in 2003, he said: ``The National Drug Intelligence Center provides us with vital information we need to disrupt the market for illegal drugs in America.'' 
   Also, a White House press release asserted that the drug czar's office uses NDIC-produced intelligence to help guide its ongoing counterdrug policy agenda as outlined in the President's national drug control strategy. NDIC information bulletins every day warn law enforcement officers around our country and intelligence agencies around the world of emerging threats in drug trafficking and trends in use. 
   But the motion to recommit would silence this added and vital voice, a voice that the minority was more than happy to fund when they were in charge of this body. The Republican-led Congress appropriated more than $160 million for NDIC over the past 4 years. It funded the National Drug Intelligence Center with $39 million in fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007, and more than $44 million in 2004. 
   If it was such a good idea then, if it was such a good idea back when you were in charge, why in the heck is it such a bad idea now when we see the trends we are seeing around the country? 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to defeat this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SENIOR BORDER PATROL AGENT LUIS A. AGUILAR -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 954, a resolution honoring the life and career of Senior Border Patrol Agent Luis A. Aguilar who on January 19, 2008 lost his life at the young age of 32 in the line of duty near Yuma, Arizona. 
   A native of my district of El Paso, Texas, Agent Aguilar began his career with the United States Border Patrol on July 21, 2002 after attending the 519th Session of the Border Patrol Academy. Upon graduation, Agent Aguilar was assigned to the Yuma Border Patrol Sector in Arizona. 
   On the day of Aguilar's tragic death, he was trying to deflate the tires of a Hummer being driven by a suspected narcotics smuggler who was attempting to flee back to Mexico across the Imperial Sand Dunes. The suspect accelerated while swerving and struck Agent Aguilar who was unable to move from the path of the vehicle. Injuries sustained by the impact caused the tragic loss of Agent Aguilar. 
   Chief Border Patrol Agent Chief David V. Aguilar posthumously awarded Agent Aguilar the Border Patrol's Purple Cross. This medal is one of the highest honors bestowed on an agent and is awarded to those who have sustained life-threatening injuries or have been killed in the line of duty. 
   I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Erica and his children, Luis and Arianna. I would also like to ask that the House take a moment to morn the loss of Agent Aguilar's mother, Cecilia Silva, who just last week lost her fight with cancer. To his father, Luis Aguilar, your son was a hero in my eyes and the eyes of many across the nation. 
   Agent Aguilar committed his life to his job, and his family showed immense courage in supporting him and his mission. As a former Border Patrol agent myself, I know firsthand the dangers that an agent faces while protecting America's frontlines. Aguilar's dedication to his nation should be acknowledged, and today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Agent Aguilar for his service.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a sponsor of H.R. 6304, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This bill represents the culmination of more than a year's work by the members and staff of the House Intelligence Committee, together with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, to bring to the floor a bill that modernizes our surveillance authorities while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans. 
   I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his efforts to strengthen this bill. As always, I greatly appreciate my good friend's commitment to protecting our country and the principles that we hold so dear. I also want to thank the respective ranking members and all that worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   This bill, Madam Speaker, enjoys wide support inside the Democratic Caucus. It has been endorsed by our Democratic whip, by our Democratic Caucus chair, by the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democratic Caucus and by a number of our colleagues. For that, I want to thank in particular our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for leading the effort towards a bipartisan compromise. This bill is a far better deal than the Protect America Act. And it is far better than the Senate bill that passed earlier this year. 
   Madam Speaker, intelligence is the first line of defense in our Nation's effort to prevent terrorism and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This legislation strengthens the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct lawful surveillance of foreign targets. But this legislation also serves another very important and vital function. It strengthens the constitutional rights of Americans, protects them from unlawful surveillance and it stops this President, or any President, for that matter, from invoking executive power to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans.     
   This bill does more than just retain the original FISA requirements for an individual warrant based upon probable cause for surveillance targeting Americans here in the United States. For the first time ever, this bill requires in statute warrants for Americans anywhere in the world. It also requires the government to establish clear guidelines to ensure that no American is the target of any surveillance without a warrant. It clarifies that FISA and Title 18, the Criminal Code, are the exclusive means by which the government may conduct domestic surveillance. 
   It will prohibit any unlawful, warrantless wiretapping, the kind we saw under this administration. It provides accountability by requiring the inspectors general of various agencies to compile a comprehensive report on the President's surveillance program and that review must be given to Congress. It requires prior court approval of the procedures used to conduct surveillance of foreign targets, except in an emergency, similar to the current FISA law. 
   This legislation, Madam Speaker, also addresses the issue of lawsuits against telecommunications companies that comply with directives from our government. This bill does not grant immunity to any government official who might have violated the law, and this bill does not grant automatic immunity to telecom companies, as the Senate bill would have. 
   Under this legislation, a Federal District Court will review the evidence submitted by the Attorney General and then the court will decide whether to grant civil liability and protection to a company that provided post-9/11 assistance to the government. This bill does not grant immunity. Congress isn't deciding the question of immunity; the District Court will. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, this bill will sunset in 4 1/2 years, ensuring that the next administration will be in a position to assess and review the effectiveness of this legislation. 
   This legislation represents a bipartisan compromise, and, as such, both sides got less than they wanted. But it is a product of a good faith effort by both Republicans and Democrats to give our intelligence agencies the tools necessary to keep America safe, while protecting our Constitution and our civil liberties. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this very important piece of legislation. 
   In addition, Chairman REYES submitted the following views for the RECORD:

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. While I am pleased that we are taking swift action on this important bill, I am woefully disappointed by the circumstances that brought us here. 
   It seems that the efforts to meet the medical treatment needs of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines were as poorly planned and executed by this administration as the military operations. 
   There is no doubt that our troops are getting outstanding military care from the time that they are wounded until they leave inpatient care. 
   But it is the aftermath where we are failing our Nation's heroes. Things such as: 
   Obtaining treatment for conditions like PTSD that develop after a soldier has left the combat zone. 
   Coordination of medical care for soldiers who have left the military hospital but still require rehabilitation and outpatient treatment. 
   A smooth transition from the military to the Veterans Administration health care system. 
   The bill under consideration today makes critical and desperately needed improvements in our current military and veterans health care systems. 
   It responds to the need to better coordinate care so that our wounded warriors never fall through the cracks, by improving the training of case managers and limiting their workload to a manageable number of soldiers; by creating a new patient advocate program so that each injured service member has a government employee fighting for his or her needs; and by establishing a toll-free number where families can report deficiencies and receive quick action to resolve problems. 
   The bill would also address the transition of troops from military medical treatment to civilian life and the Veterans Administration health care system by beginning to reform the disability evaluation system; by appointing independent medical professionals to support wounded service members during the medical evaluation board process; and by formalizing the process of transitioning military patients and all of their medical records to the Veterans Administration. 
   The bill would also improve training for the medical professionals and counselors who work with service members and their families and would create new Wounded Warrior Battalions at all Army medical centers modeled on the Marine Corps's highly successful program. 
   The bill also includes a provision that I sponsored during consideration of the measure by the House Armed Services Committee. My amendment, as included in bill, addresses the challenges facing the Army in providing needed facilities by directing the Secretary of the Army to report back to Congress on infrastructure requirements for supporting wounded warriors at Army medical facilities and installations. 
   My amendment arose from what I observed at Fort Bliss, in my district of El Paso, Texas, and my visits to other military medical facilities throughout the world. 
   At Fort Bliss, our garrison commander, our medical facility commander, and our military hold unit commander have worked tirelessly to meet the most immediate needs of the over 250 soldiers on medical hold there, but it is clear that we need a more concentrated effort by the Army to identify and fund needed upgrades to facilities for wounded warriors. 
   From adequate numbers of family housing units and barracks rooms that meet accessability standards to sidewalks, our Army posts simply don't have the facilities they need to meet the needs of soldiers recovering from disabling injuries. 
   But the area where I have seen the greatest need is accessability to military hospitals. At Fort Bliss and Army posts around the Nation, just getting in the door is a struggle for wounded soldiers as they face Army Medical Centers where the support facilities simply aren't adequate. 
   At Fort Bliss soldiers seeking treatment at the hospital often find the parking lot completely full, and when they do find a parking space, it's likely in a remote spot which may or may not be served by a volunteer-staffed shuttle. And to make matters worse, more often than not, those shuttles are broken. 
   There is no doubt that our Nation wants to do all that we can to help those who are injured in their military service, and there are thousands of dedicated professionals working hard to give them the medical care that they deserve. But it is clear that we have to do more. We need to provide all the resources that are required, and we must remove legislative and administrative barriers that are keeping our wounded warriors from getting the best possible care. Our military forces make invaluable sacrifices in defense of our Nation, and we owe them nothing less.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It uses existing procedures and an existing resource to promote fairness in subcontracting. It makes a great bill, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act of 2007, I believe even better. Let me describe the problem as it currently exists. 
   For large government contracts, applicants are required to submit small business subcontracting plans during the bidding process detailing their intentions to include small businesses in the work. However, too often prime contractors disregard small business subcontracting plans submitted as part of winning government bids. 
   This is simply, in our eyes, not fair. Small business gets left behind, and prime contractors who keep their word, who are doing the right thing, end up at a competitive disadvantage with the bad actors. 
   This unfortunate practice has particularly adverse effects on the small businesses that are included in small business subcontracting plans but do not actually receive the contract work. When small businesses are included in the small business plans of prime contractors, the small businesses will often make investments on the front end to prepare themselves to do the subcontract work. If the prime does not ultimately subcontract the work to the small business in question, however, that small business will often find itself overextended. Often, the operating margins of small businesses are very small, and unmet subcontract obligations in small business subcontracting plans can force these small firms out of business. 
   Prime contractors receive bids based on their commitment to include small business in the contract, in part, and it is only fair that the primes fulfill their end of the deal. 
   My amendment provides much-needed accountability over small business subcontracting plans by doing two things. One, this amendment takes advantage of an existing online tool, the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System, and existing procedures for reporting on contracts to accumulate and organize information about prime contractors' compliance records with small business subcontracting plans. ESRS will be developed to prepare easily comparable reports for tracking prime contractors and their compliance through their records. 
   We are not reinventing the wheel. This is a commonsense, efficient way to allow information to be organized in such a way as to provide the necessary accountability over these small business plans. 
   Second, this amendment brings fairness to subcontracting by requiring that agencies, even when evaluating subcontract or contract proposals, take into consideration compliance with small business subcontracting plans of companies competing for Federal contracts, and requiring that within 1 year after the date of the enactment such consideration be reflected in the Federal acquisition regulations.     
   This is simply a matter of making sure that prime contractors are playing by the rules. This is an issue for us and, for small businesses, an issue of fairness. The amendment is fair to small businesses who are included in small business subcontracting plans and who have, in essence, helped prime contractors receive contract awards. The amendment is fair to prime contractors who do play by the rules by making sure that their records of helping small businesses are taken into account. 
   My amendment has the support of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the National Black Chamber of Commerce. With that, I urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007. 
   In addition to restoring integrity to student loan programs, encouraging States and colleges to rein in student costs, bolstering Pell grants and expanding maximum awards, and investing in renewable and efficient campus energy practices, this legislation makes a vital investment in the economic competitiveness of our nation. Included in that investment is a needed focus on improving minority participation in the science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, fields. 
   According to the U.S. Census, 39 percent of the population under the age of 18 is a racial or ethnic minority. That percentage is on a path to pass 50 percent by the year 2050. Yet, in 2000, only 4.4 percent of the science and engineering jobs were held by African Americans and only 3.4 percent by Hispanics. 
   This under-representation of minority groups in the STEM fields is a severe impediment to the formation of an adequate American STEM workforce. The increased education and participation of this segment of the workforce is essential to supplying the American economy with the STEM expertise the country needs to innovate and to improve America's economic standing in the world. 
   One year ago, I joined with several of my colleagues, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Congressman Rub&#233;n Hinojosa, Congressman Mike Honda, and Congressman G.K. Butterfield, to create the House Diversity and Innovation Caucus. The caucus was created on a relatively simple premise: If we want to expand the STEM pipeline, we must broaden our pool of talent. If we are to compete with the rest of the world, we cannot do so with one hand tied behind our back, with the vast majority of certain demographic groups severely under-represented in the fields that drive innovation. 
   This bill includes several provisions that would bolster the participation of under-represented groups in the STEM fields. Specifically, H.R. 4137 would: 
   Establish the YES Partnership grant program for Minority-Serving Institutions to support the participation of under-represented minority youth in STEM through outreach and hands-on experiential-based learning projects; 
   Strengthen and expand the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program; 
   Enact the Minority-Serving Institutions Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity 
   Program; 
   Establish a matching grant program to recruit math, science, and language teachers; 
   Establish a priority in the Graduate Areas of National Need Program for fellowships to develop faculty in math, science, special education, and bilingual education; 
   Expand loan forgiveness in areas of national need; 
   Authorize a grant to examine establishing an organization to ensure women and under-represented minorities on college campuses are not facing subtle biases that discourage them from careers in STEM fields; and 
   Ensure that legal immigrants and part-time students are eligible for the Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants. 
   I am particularly proud that H.R. 4137 includes a bill I authored and introduced in the House, the STEM Promotion Act. In addition to providing young Americans strong educational opportunities in STEM, we must find a way to interest them in pursuing the STEM professions. My generation was inspired by Sputnik to pursue careers in science, engineering, and math, but we cannot sit back and wait for another Sputnik to re-engage our young people in these critical fields. We must tackle the STEM pipeline issue head-on, by methodically attracting Americans to enter STEM. 
   The STEM Promotion Act proposes just that. The bill would require the Secretary of Education to work with marketing professionals, similar to what the military does, to advertise and otherwise market the attractiveness of pursuing opportunities in STEM. Moreover, the Secretary would order marketing research to be conducted to examine how best to appeal to segments of our population that have been under-represented in the STEM fields, such as women, Hispanics, and African-Americans. 
   If America is to achieve its strategic objectives in STEM, the enormous potential of groups that are currently under-represented in the STEM fields must be realized. This bill will expand the STEM pipeline and promote innovation and competitiveness by helping to correct the under-representation of certain groups in the STEM fields.  
   H.R. 4137 also makes broad investments in higher education and college access. In addition to increasing the maximum Pell grant award by over $3,000 and authorizing year-round grants, the bill includes key provisions of the Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act, of which I have been an original cosponsor for the past three Congresses. Included is a new graduate program for those institutions, authorized at $125 million, and an increased authorization for the undergraduate program to $175 million. 
   I am particularly pleased that the Education and Labor Committee has seen fit to strengthen and increase funding for GEAR UP and TRIO, which are critical college access programs for low-income students for which I have advocated since arriving in Congress in 1997. Specifically, the bill increases minimum grant awards for TRIO and HEP-CAMP, increases the authorization for TRIO to $950 million, increases the authorization for GEAR UP to $400 million, and addresses accountability standards to ensure students are completing a rigorous program of study. The bill also promotes college transition and parental involvement in GEAR UP, and encourages GEAR UP and TRIO to promote financial literacy. 
   By passing this bill, we would also ensure that our military veterans have full access to both the Montgomery GI bill and education programs under the Higher Education Act. H.R. 4137 establishes a scholarship program for veteran students and their families and Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success, and ensures fair treatment of veterans benefits in the financial aid need analysis formula. 
   I urge my colleagues to consider this bill's positive impact on competitiveness when deciding how to vote. Please support a strong and prosperous America. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4137.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I  want to congratulate my good friend, Mr. Thompson and Ranking Member King for a great job on this legislation. 
   Prior to coming to Congress, I served proudly in the United States Border Patrol for 26 1/2 years, including 13 years as a sector chief in Texas. As the only Member of Congress with experience in defending our Nation's borders, I have firsthand knowledge about what is needed to keep America safe. 
   As a former law enforcement officer, I have long advocated for better communication between agencies in the field. I am pleased that H.R. 1 establishes a stand-alone interoperability grant program which will allow improved emergency communication capabilities among our Nation's first responders. 
   H.R. 1 also enhances State and local intelligence ``fusion'' centers, places a high priority on border intelligence, and modernizes the Visa Waiver Program, a critical element of our homeland security defense. 
   I was appointed to the Intelligence Committee before the tragic events of 9/11, and today I proudly serve as the committee chairman. H.R. 1 takes a step to close the gap and implement several 9/11 Commission recommendations, including the declassification of the intelligence top-line funding figure. It requires disclosure of the intelligence top-line for fiscal year years 2007 and 2008, but not until 30 days following the end of the respective years. Starting in 2009, the administration may decide not to disclose the amount if it provides a written justification to Congress. 
   As the 9/11 Commission found, such declassification of the overall number would not disclose exactly how we are investing in specific capabilities, would not reveal intelligence sources and methods, and would not advantage our enemies. Instead, it simply provides greater transparency to American taxpayers. 
   The conference report also extends the Public Interest Declassification Board and mandates that CIA declassify to the maximum extent possible the congressionally mandated 9/11 accountability report. These provisions further underscore the high priority supporters of H.R. 1 have placed on striking the proper balance between protecting our most sensitive intelligence secrets and ensuring greater accountability, openness and transparency. 
   Overall, the report reflects thoughtful legislative drafting, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report.

   I rise to express my strong support for our Nation's military and for the resolution before the House today. I am a proud veteran. I know what it is like to say good-bye to loved ones and be gone for a year, or 13 months, as in my case when I served in Vietnam. 
   I voted against authorizing the use of force against Iraq because I did not believe that the evidence provided by the administration, particularly the intelligence data, were sufficient to justify putting our troops in harm's way. Combat should be the last option. I know; I have been there. 
   Over 3,000 American lives later, and tens of thousands suffering debilitating injuries, yet we are no closer to our  goal of a secure and stable Iraq, and the situation there continues to deteriorate. 
   Our military families are paying a high price. There were a couple of articles in today's paper that talked about our inability to find common ground. 
   Well, I disagree. I think we find common ground because we care about not just our troops, but their families, our military families.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYES. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, which will help spur economic development in my district of El Paso, TX. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his vision regarding the need and importance of regional authorities for development in areas of the country with huge economic need. For the past three Congresses, I have introduced my bill, the Southwest Regional Border Authority Act, in an attempt to bring some relief to the United States-Mexico border and my district of El Paso, TX. This year, under the leadership of Chairman Oberstar, my bill has been included into his overall legislation. I would also like to thank many of my colleagues who represent districts along the United States-Mexico border for their support in the creation of the Southwest Regional Border Authority. 
   The Chairman's bill would authorize $1.25 billion over the period of FY 2008 through FY 2012 for five regional commissions one of which will be created in the United States-Mexico border region. The Authorities would be Federal-State partnerships for providing assistance to economically distressed and underdeveloped areas that have experienced high levels of unemployment, poverty, or out-migration. Three of the commissions would be new and would assist areas in the southeastern United States and areas along the Mexican and Canadian borders; two of the commissions would replace existing Authorities in the Delta and northern Great Plains regions. The bill would establish uniform administrative structures and responsibilities for the commissions, and authorize the commissions to provide financial assistance for projects and programs in their respective regions to develop transportation and infrastructure, provide job skills training and support business development. 
   The Southwest border region, as defined in the bill, includes all counties within 150 miles of the United States-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and 7 counties in California, with a combined population of approximately 29 million. 
   According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, 20 percent of the residents in my region live below the poverty level, unemployment rates often reach as high as five times the national average, and a lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities, making it difficult for businesses to start up in the region. Border communities have long endured a depressed economy and low-paying jobs. Our economic challenges partly stem from our position as a border community. 
   Economic development in border communities is difficult to stimulate without assistance from the government, private sector, and community organizations. H.R. 3246 would help foster planning to encourage infrastructure improvements, technology deployment, education and workforce training, and community development through entrepreneurship. 
   Modeled in part after the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Authority and other Authorities would follow four guiding principles: 
   First, the Authorities would fund proposals designed at the local level followed by approval at the State level in order to meet regional economic development goals; 
   Second, projects leading to the creation of a diversified regional economy would be prioritized. Currently, States and counties often are forced to compete against each other for limited funding; 
   Third, the Authorities would be independent agencies. This would prevent them from having to attempt to satisfy another Federal agency's mission requirements when determining which projects to fund; and 
   Finally, the Authorities would be comprised of one Senate-confirmed Federal representative and the governors of the States of jurisdiction. 
   For too long, many areas of our country including the Southwest border region have been ignored, overlooked, and underfunded. We need to recognize the challenges facing these underserved areas and help them make the most of their many assets. I believe the Authorities created in the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 would go a long way toward achieving the goal of economic prosperity in some of the poorest regions of our country. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on this issue and look forward to the implementation of this important legislation.
