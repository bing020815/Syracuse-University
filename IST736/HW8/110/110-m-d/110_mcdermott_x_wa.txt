<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today the people's House will say eloquently and unequivocally that America's interest to exert its moral leadership in the world is back, that all Americans stand united in fighting this global epidemic. 
   As we've done in times of the past in great trial, we set aside our differences and declare that America stands with commitment, compassion and conviction against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
   The Senate has already passed this legislation. And the President has announced that he will sign the legislation, which is one of his top priorities. I give him high credit for that decision. 
   But beyond the money, beyond the $50 billion, is the fact that we are ending the unspoken fear and discrimination in our own country by eliminating the travel ban restriction that has stopped scientists and others infected with HIV/AIDS from crossing our borders to attend medical or educational conferences, or to visit family and friends. 
   I was at the United Nations a few months ago, and Members of Parliaments all over the world said, how can we end the stigma of AIDS if you, in the United States, will not allow someone with AIDS to come in? We know how to treat AIDS, we know how to diagnose it, but the United States is the example: Today, we are making a statement that we want to end the stigma of AIDS. That makes it possible for people to come in and be tested, for people to come forward and receive medication. As long as people have to keep AIDS in the background or hide it, we will not end this epidemic. So this provision alone makes it possible. 
   Representative Granger and I have some legislation in here that ends some of the problems with mother-to-child transmission. These provisions will make it possible for us to prevent AIDS spread and have a generation without AIDS in the future.   
   This legislation will provide the resources policies necessary to take the fight against HIV/AIDS to the next level. An increase in funding to $48 billion over 5 years will provide the resources to sustain the fight on so many fronts in so many countries especially hard hit by the pandemic. 
   Our provisions included in this legislation will provide training and education, integrate services into maternal health care and ensure that women and children have access to early screening and life-saving drug therapies. 
   We know that providing a short regimen of anti-retroviral drugs to the mother and newborn reduces transmission by 50 percent. And now we will have the means to do it. 
   H.R. 5501 also includes my provision to establish two 5-year targets to protect the next generation. The first goal is that 16 percent of those receiving treatment under PEPFAR be children, which is significantly higher than the children receiving treatment under current PEPFAR programs. 
   The second goal is that 80 percent of pregnant women in the most affected countries receive HIV counseling and testing and where necessary, antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother to child transmission. 
   We know how to stop transmission and, over time, we can achieve the goal of a generation born free of HIV/AIDS. 
   This legislation addresses the fatal connection between HIV and TB, which itself has claimed 1.7 million lives directly or through HIV-associated TB. I'm proud that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle is a leader in the fight against TB as it is in reversing other global medical crises. 
   My community rightly swells with pride over the local leadership and resources being devoted to fighting on behalf of all humanity. 
   We have come a long way in a short period of time. H.R. 5501 will build on the systems and success we have had so far by integrating additional services and providing the vital funding needed to train health care professionals and community workers. 
   Trained medical personnel, on the ground in country, are the front line in this fight and this legislation gives us the ability to send in reinforcements to help fight a war against this disease. There is so much to say about what this day means. Above all, it means we are going to save lives. 
   We are going to provide global leadership and real hope. The day will come when medical science will discover a vaccine that will end this scourge once and for all. Until then, let us stand together as one Nation and one world, united in one common goal--in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
   I cast my vote for passage on behalf of every person in Seattle, in Africa, China, India and elsewhere who lives with or is threatened by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the stimulus package before us today is a call to arms for Congress to act on behalf of the American people. The President waited too long and offered too little. While he spent months pretending the economy was just fine, Americans were losing their jobs, their homes, and their confidence. 
   Last week, he apparently woke up, noticed the problem, and, to her credit, Speaker Pelosi negotiated a stimulus package that, for the first time in 7 years, recognized our first responsibility to the middle class and America's vulnerable families. People earning $200,000 a year don't need a rebate to weather the economic storm, but people earning $20,000 do need one. 
   But, for all the stimulus package does, we must recognize it is a work in progress, because there is unfinished business we must address in the coming months. This package falls silent on the plight of Americans who have already lost their jobs in the economy, and this package does not address the reforms needed to our unemployment insurance programs to deal with the reality of the modern-day workforce competing in a global economy. 
   Two-thirds of the people who pay unemployment insurance can't draw benefits. People with part-time jobs can't draw benefits. Spouses whose husbands are transferred elsewhere and lose the second job the family has been depending on can't draw benefits. Those are the kinds of things that need to be done. But there's nothing new today. 
   The gentleman from Indiana was a wonderful counterpoint. In 1935, when we passed the Social Security Act in Congress, during the middle of the Depression, and unemployment insurance was right in the middle of it, the last issue the Republicans fought in the United States Senate at the very end of the bill was whether or not they should have unemployment insurance. The gentleman from Indiana would have fit beautifully in the Republican caucus in the U.S. Senate in 1935. And that is why we got rid of them. 
   This is not a day for a victory lap. It's a day when we begin to restore the faith of the American people in the ability of their government to act as an agent for positive change. This is the first day, but it must not be the last day, or we will fail the American people when they need us most. But I don't want to see unemployment brought out here, married to the war funding, like we had to accept when we had the raise in the minimum wage. This ought to stand on its own. We should stand behind the American workers in their time of need. It shouldn't be mixed with a lot of other things.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (GAS STAMPS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, a barrel of oil is still more than $120 and the price Americans are paying for a gallon of gas is $4.20 a gallon. Add that to the rising food prices and rising unemployment--especially long-term unemployment--and the economic climate feels more like the dead of winter than the middle of summer. 
   Too many Americans are still being forced to choose between food and fuel every day either to get to work or look for work. But we can help those at the bottom of the economic ladder survive by simply passing the Gas Stamps legislation I've introduced. It would provide modest assistance to people who need a helping hand to keep their head above water. It would provide temporary assistance over a relatively short time, a few months, like food stamps, and it would say to the American people that we, in Congress, know the first stimulus package was not enough and we're prepared to act again. 
   Providing those in need with a few hundred dollars a month for a few months is a small price to pay so that vulnerable Americans can continue to put food on the table and gas in their tank to go to work. 
   The American people need and deserve some additional help, and we ought to provide it with gas stamps, not the fraud of drilling on the coast.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (IRAQI CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we now know that the President intends to keep U.S. forces in Iraq throughout the remainder of his term and that he intends for the U.S. to perpetually occupy Iraq via massive and permanent military bases he has ordered built. We have just learned of the staggering loss of life as a result of this war. 
   According to a new and incredible study, the number of civilians killed in Iraq since the war began now exceeds 1 million Iraqi people. The Iraqi civilian death toll exceeds the death toll from the genocide in Rwanda. For years, we and others said we didn't know how bad it was in Rwanda. With this report, that excuse is no longer valid in Iraq. 
   The official death toll in Iraq, fewer than 100,000 is what the official number is, has long been considered fictitious by humanitarian and other international organizations. Now we are forced to confront evidence that puts the death toll above 1 million Iraqis. 
   Opinion Research Business, a respected and mainstream London-based research company that works for major corporations and government clients, including the U.K.'s Conservative Party, conducted the survey in August. I point this out to inoculate my colleagues, the media and the American  people from the venom that will spew from this for those who want to keep the real cost of this war in human lives as far from public view as possible, because no one who knows the truth could stand and let it go on. 
   Joshua Holland, a journalist at AlterNet, broke the news online the other day. I enter his story into the Record, which includes a link directly to the Opinion Research site where people can read the entire research survey online. It was conducted in 15 out of Iraq's 18 provinces during mid August. 
   In his speech last week, the President referred to Anbar Province as a model of success. The research company did not even visit Anbar or Karbala for security reasons. And they were not allowed to conduct their field research in Irbil. 
   While the President is willing to stand up and say that he sees signs of success, the survey found that in Baghdad alone, almost half the houses say they have lost at least one member of their family. That's the reality in the largest Iraqi city, which has the largest concentration of U.S. military forces. Baghdad may have a fortified green zone for U.S. diplomats and Iraqi government officials, but the rest of the people live in a bloody red zone, where the killing has claimed someone from 50 percent of the households. 
   The President cannot claim signs of success in Iraq when his stubborn determination to remain is dissolving Baghdad into a dead zone. The civilian carnage is not isolated in Baghdad. Other major cities also registered dramatic civilian murder rates that would make the world weep at the staggering loss of humanity occurring in Iraq. 
   For a long time, I and other Members have spoken out about the number of U.S. soldiers killed or gravely wounded in Iraq, and we must never forget the sacrifices made by American soldiers and the painful losses suffered by American families across this country. But Congress must not ignore the overwhelming loss of life in Iraq. News that 1 million Iraqi civilians have been killed should compel us to get the U.S. forces out of Iraq immediately. 
   I know and respect many of my Republican colleagues. Our politics may differ, but our principle to protect innocent people does not. How many more Iraqis must die? The carnage will continue as long as Republicans in Congress wear the blinders that the President hands out to enforce allegiance to his blind and bloody armed occupation in Iraq. 
   For the sake of humanity, remove the blinders and speak the truth to power. The Iraq war is a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that exceeds the genocide in Rwanda. We claimed we didn't know about Rwanda. We can't claim that any more about Iraq  
   Iraq Death Toll Rivals Rwanda Genocide, Cambodian Killing Fields  
   A new study estimates that 1.2 million Iraqis have met violent deaths since Bush and Cheney chose to invade. 
   According to a new study, 1.2 million Iraqis have met violent deaths since the 2003 invasion, the highest estimate of war-related fatalities yet. The study was done by the British polling firm ORB, which conducted face-to-face interviews with a sample of over 1,700 Iraqi adults in 15 of Iraq's 18 provinces. Two provinces--al-Anbar and Karbala--were too dangerous to canvas, and officials in a third, Irbil, didn't give the researchers a permit to do their work. The study's margin of error was plus-minus 2.4 percent. Field workers asked residents how many members of their own household had been killed since the invasion. More than one in five respondents said that at least one person in their home had been murdered since March of 2003. One in three Iraqis also said that at least some neighbors ``actually living on [their] street'' had fled the carnage, with around half of those having left the country. 
   In Baghdad, almost half of those interviewed reported at least one violent death in their household. 
   Before the study's release, the highest estimate of Iraqi deaths had been around 650,000 in the landmark Johns Hopkins' study published in the Lancet, a highly respected and peer-reviewed British medical journal. Unlike that study, which measured the difference in deaths from all causes during the first three years of the occupation with the mortality rate that existed prior to the invasion, the ORB poll looked only at deaths due to violence. 
   The poll's findings are in line with the rolling estimate maintained on the Just Foreign Policy website, based on the Johns Hopkins' data, that stands at just over 1 million Iraqis killed as of this writing. 
   These numbers suggest that the invasion and occupation of Iraq rivals the great crimes of the last century--the human toll exceeds the 800,000 to 900,000 believed killed in the Rwandan genocide in 1994, and is approaching the number (1.7 million) who died in Cambodia's infamous ``Killing Fields'' during the Khmer Rouge era of the 1970s. 
   While the stunning figures should play a major role in the debate over continuing the occupation, they probably won't. That's because there are three distinct versions of events in Iraq--the bloody criminal nightmare that the ``reality-based community'' has to grapple with, the picture the commercial media portrays and the war that the occupation's last supporters have conjured up out of thin air. Similarly, American discourse has also developed three different levels of Iraqi casualties. There's the approximately 1 million killed according to the best epidemiological research conducted by one of the world's most prestigious scientific institutions, there's the 75,000-80,000 (based on news reports) the Washington Post and other commercial media allow, and there's the clean and antiseptic blood-free war the administration claims to have fought (recall that they dismissed the Lancet findings out of hand and yet offered no numbers of their own). Here's the troubling thing, and one reason why opposition to the war isn't even more intense than it is: Americans were asked in an AP poll conducted earlier this year how many Iraqi civilians they thought had been killed as a result of the invasion and occupation, and the median answer they gave was 9,890. That's less than a third of the number of civilian deaths confirmed by U.N. monitors in 2006 alone. 
   Most of that disconnect is probably a result of American exceptionalism--the United States is, by definition, the good guy, and good guys don't launch wars of choice that result in over a million people being massacred. Never mind that that's exactly what the data show; acknowledging as much creates intolerable cognitive dissonance for most Americans, so as a nation, we won't.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (HONORING MAHATMA GANDHI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today is a very special day. Today, October 2, marks the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. To honor him, the United Nations approved a resolution that, beginning today, designates October 2 as International Day of Nonviolence. 
   It's a start, one that was inspired by Sonia Gandhi after she successfully led an international conference called ``Peace, Nonviolence and Empowerment--Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st Century.'' There is a yearning for peace, for an end to world hunger and poverty, and a world in which peace and justice for all is not a dream but a reality. 
   Gandhi showed us the way. He said: ``Nonviolence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart, and it must be an inseparable part of our being.'' 
   Gandhi's philosophy is a legacy he left to benefit the whole world. It is up to us to preserve this great gift. And I will do my part. I have introduced House Resolution 653 to express the sense of the Congress that the concept of nonviolence and the teaching of Gandhi remain relevant in this world. 
   As Gandhi himself said: ``Nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (DRUMBEATS OF WAR ARE COMING AGAIN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, out of a sense of duty and a growing fear, I rise to say that I hear the drumbeats of war coming again from this administration. This time, Iran is in the crosshairs. 
   It's ironic that the alarm has sounded today, the birth date of Mahatma Gandhi, and the United Nation's first World Nonviolence Day in honor of Gandhi's commitment to peace. 
   Perhaps the contrast between the man of peace and an administration of war will underscore the need and the urgency for Congress to act before the President orders a military strike. 
   I listened and sounded the alarm in 2002 regarding Iraq. But the President and the Vice President had already set in motion their invasion plan, and those who got in the way were called unpatriotic and uncaring or worse. Back then, too many in the media, the Congress and across the Nation were willing to accept a war without justification or justice. Now, at least the American people overwhelmingly recognize the tragic consequences of the Iraq war and the occupation. 
   At least one development in 2008 may make this time different than 2002. The Internet has grown exponentially. Today, credible and factual information is readily available. The blogosphere is on fire sounding alarm, and we will have no one to blame except ourselves if we let this administration take us to war in Iran. Go to your computer and Google ``Iran war.'' The search yields 74 million hits. Let me read a few of the top search results: 
   Day One: ``The War with Iran.'' 
   ``Iran: The next war,'' in the Rolling Stone. 
   ``America's hidden war with Iran,'' Newsweek. 
   ``Is U.S.-Iran war inevitable?'' Time magazine. 
   ``The Iran plans,'' the New Yorker. 
   And ``The U.S. trains gulf Air Forces for war against Iran.'' 
   Some see the same signs as I do, and they are writing across a broad spectrum of the media, trying to be heard above the beats of war. However, the President and Vice President are using friendly fire from the right-wing media to lull the Americans to sleep, while they lay the groundwork and shop for a Gulf of Tonkin-like provocation to launch a military strike. 
   Journalist Tim Shipman of the Telegraph in London writes ``American diplomats have been ordered to compile a dossier detailing Iran's violations of international law. Some U.S. diplomats believe the exercise will boost calls for military action by neoconservatives inside and outside the administration.'' 
   In the New Yorker, renowned journalist Seymour Hirsh says, ``The revised bombing plan for a possible attack, with its tightened focus on counterterrorism, is gathering support among generals and admirals in the Pentagon. 
   Hirsch adds, ``A Pentagon consultant on counterterrorism told me that, if the bombing campaign took place, it would be accompanied by a series of what are called short, sharp incursions by American special forces into suspected Iranian training camps. Cheney is devoted to this, no question.'' 
   Now, does that sound like a diplomatic solution to you? 
   For at least a year we've been lulled into believing that the administration cannot fool the American people again. But I say this is just the kind of wishful thinking this administration is hoping for. It gives them time to spin the rhetoric and plot the missile tracks into Iran.  
   We stand on the brink of a conflagration in the Middle East, spreading from Iraq to Iran, to Pakistan and Afghanistan and the entire region. The legacy of this administration could be wars without ends and wars without borders. 
   Waiting for the next election may be too late; 475 days is a long time. 
   As a medical doctor, I was trained to listen to the patient. I've been listening to this President, and he's telling us that Iran is his next military target. Congress is all that stands in the way of this President carrying out a bombing strike of how many sources, how many sites we don't know. And I urge the House to act before it is too late. 
   We need a resolution that requires the President to come back to the Congress before any act of war is taken against Iran.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Chairman, I proudly stand today in support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would enable workers to finally reclaim their right to freely form a union and bargain with their employers. It is clear that too many American workers today are under the threat of discrimination, harassment, or termination for simply choosing to bargain collectively for better wages, hours, and working conditions. The current system for forming unions and bargaining is broken, and it is our responsibility to fix it. 
   This bipartisan legislation is an important first step towards leveling the playing field for workers and employers, rebuilding our middle class, improving our economy, and on a larger scale ensuring that more Americans benefit from a growing economy. Today we can set an example for the rest of the world. How can our nation continue to encourage other nations to protect their workers' rights if we do not remedy our own? 
   Critics of this bill simply want to preserve the status quo. That is not a reasonable solution, and these critics clearly do not have our middle class workers' best interests in mind. Research shows that nearly 60 million would form a union tomorrow if given the chance, and that democratic votes would still take place under the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   The bill before us has three major components that would help restore middle class workers' rights to designate and certify bargaining representation, to receive mediation and arbitration concerning a first contract, and to enforce stronger penalties for employee violations. I believe this is the first step towards treating the problems of income inequality, and income immobility that currently confront our nation. 
   Today, the House of Representatives has an opportunity to send hardworking Americans a message. A message that we recognize the fundamental right to organize is essential to maintaining a just economy and a society that values work. Let us send that message loud and clear, by voting in support of H.R. 800.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO CHANGE RHETORIC -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the American people are concerned and the world is very uneasy. Congress must begin to restore what the President and Vice President have shattered: our credibility in the world. 
   Headlines in the U.S. and international news media remove all doubt how the U.S. is viewed today in the world. One said: ``Russian official warns U.S. not to attack Iran.'' 
   ``Use of force on Iran unacceptable,'' says France. 
   ``Trigger-happy U.S. worries Putin.'' 
   The BBC reports that the U.S. Central Command officials have already chosen an extensive list for missile and bomb attacks inside Iran. 
   Another in the Asia Times: ``Three reasons why we should attack Iran,'' and all this comes from yesterday's headlines. 
   The French Foreign Ministry told an Asia news agency that France believes that the use of force to solve the Iranian nuclear issue is both unimaginable and unacceptable; but not in this White House. 
   When the Vice President announced recently that all options are still on the table, our international credibility took another direct hit. We cannot afford that kind of warmongering rhetoric any more, not in dollars, not in soldiers, not in insecurity, and not in international standing. It sounds like 2002 all over again. Like Yogi Berra said, ``deja vu all over again.'' 
   That is a cause for grave concern on this floor and needs congressional action. We must include language in every military appropriation bill that specifically prohibits the administration from unilaterally waging war in Iran except by a vote of the Congress. 
   As it stands, the President and the Vice President are using the same speeches from 2002. They are just replacing the name of the country, Iraq, with Iran; but this time, the world has noticed. 
   The French foreign minister tells his boss before a television audience: ``Predictions that U.S. strikes will be conducted against Iran have become more common, and this causes concern.'' 
   In the Baltimore Chronicle, Robert Perry writes: ``A number of U.S. military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have waged an extraordinary behind-the-scenes resistance to what they fear is a secret plan by George Bush to wage war against Iran.'' 
   The BBC reports that two ``triggers,'' or pretexts, for a U.S. attack have already been chosen. 
   Seymour Hersch writes in The New Yorker that the Pentagon has been ordered by the White House to plan a bombing campaign against Iran ready to go on a day's notice. 
   Michael Klare writing in the Asia Times says that recent remarks by the President seek to instill the same fear as the run-up to the Iraq war.  
   Listen to the President's rhetoric: ``stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges.'' 
   Then there was the line by the President the other day: ``We are also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East.'' 
   And then the President said: ``It is also clear that we face an escalating danger from Shiite extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East.'' He is making a bogey-man out of Iran. 
   People and nations listen to that inflammatory rhetoric from our President and Vice President and worry about a world careening towards another war. There is no doubt that America needs a thoughtful and coherent foreign policy concerning Iran. We ought to talk to them, for starters. 
   We don't need to merely change the rhetoric of the White House. We need to change the administration's perilous world view that America can and will just shoot its way to peace anywhere there is a problem in the world. 
   The first step in restoring America's credibility and global leadership is to let the world know that Congress is a coequal branch of government that will exercise its constitutional duty to ensure that the administration does not run off on its own to go to war. 
   We have to declare that the days of runaway rhetoric by the administration are over. But let us go beyond that. Let Congress take the administration's threat of war off the table and replace it with America's true belief that we view war as unimaginable and unacceptable. 
   Three U.S. Reasons To Attack Iran  
   Some time this spring or summer, barring an unexpected turnaround by Tehran, US President George W Bush is likely to go on national television and announce that he has ordered US ships and aircraft to strike at military targets inside Iran. 
   We must still sit through several months of soap opera at the United Nations in New York and assorted foreign capitals before this comes to pass, and it is always possible that a diplomatic breakthrough will occur--let it be so!--but I am convinced that Bush has already decided an attack is his only option and the rest is a charade he must go through to satisfy his European allies. 
   The proof of this, I believe, lies half-hidden in recent public statements of his, which, if pieced together, provide a casus belli, or formal list of justifications, for going to war. 
   Three of his statements, in particular, contained the essence of this justification: his January 10 televised speech on his plan for a troop ``surge'' in Iraq, his State of the Union address of January 23, and his first televised press conference of the year on February 14. None of these was primarily focused on Iran, but Bush used each of them to warn of the extraordinary dangers that country poses to the United States and to hint at severe US reprisals if the Iranians did not desist from ``harming US troops''. 
   In each, moreover, he laid out various parts of the overall argument he will certainly use to justify an attack on Iran. String these together in one place and you can almost anticipate what Bush's speechwriters will concoct before he addresses the American people from the Oval Office some time this year. Think of them as talking points for the next war. 
   The first of these revealing statements was Bush's January 10 televised address on Iraq. This speech was supposedly intended to rally public and congressional support behind his plan to send 21,500 additional US troops into the Iraqi capital and al-Anbar province, the heartland of the Sunni Insurgency. 
   But his presentation that night was so uninspired, so lacking in conviction, that--according to media commentary and polling data--few, if any, Americans were persuaded by his arguments. Only once that evening did Bush visibly come alive: when he spoke about the threat to Iraq supposedly posed by Iran. 
   ``Succeeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges,'' he declared, which meant, he assured his audience, addressing the problem of Iran. That country, he asserted, ``is providing material support for attacks on American troops''. (This support was later identified as advanced improvised explosive devices--IEDs or roadside bombs--given to anti-American Shi'ite militias.) 
   Then followed an unambiguous warning: ``We will disrupt the attacks on our forces ..... And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.'' 
   Consider this Item 1 in his casus belli: because Iran is aiding and abetting the United States' enemies in Iraq, the US is justified in attacking Iran as a matter of self-defense. 
   Bush put it this way in an interview with Juan Williams of National Public Radio on January 29: ``If Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and/or innocent Iraqi people, we will respond firmly ..... It makes common sense for the commander-in-chief to say to our troops and the Iraqi people--and the Iraqi government that we will help you defend yourself from people that want to sow discord and harm.'' 
   In his January 10 address, Bush went on to fill in a second item in any future casus belli: Iran is seeking nuclear weapons to dominate the Middle East to the detriment of the United States' friends in the region--a goal that it simply cannot be allowed to achieve. 
   In response to such a possibility, Bush declared, ``We're also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East.'' These include deploying a second US aircraft-carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf region, consisting of the USS John C Stennis and a flotilla of cruisers, destroyers and submarines (presumably to provide additional air and missile assets for strikes on Iran), along with additional Patriot anti-missile batteries (presumably to shoot down any Iranian missiles that might be fired in retaliation for an air attack on the country and its nuclear facilities). ``And,'' Bush added, ``we will work with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region.'' 
   Bush added a third item to the casus belli in his State of the Union address on January 23. After years of describing Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda as the greatest threats to U.S. interests in the Middle East, he now introduced a new menace: the resurgent Shi'ite branch of Islam led by Iran. 
   Aside from al-Qaeda and other Sunni extremists, he explained, ``It has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shi'ite extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East.'' Many of these extremists, he noted, ``are known to take direction from the regime in Iran'', including the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. 
   As if to nail down this point, he offered some hair-raising imagery right out of the Left Behind best-selling book series so beloved of Christian evangelicals and their neoconservative allies: ``If American forces step back [from Iraq] before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shi'ite extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists backed by al-Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill across the country, and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict. For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective.'' 
   As refined by Bush speechwriters, this, then, is the third item in his casus belli for attacking Iran: to prevent a ``nightmare scenario'' in which the Shi'ite leaders of Iran might emerge as the grandmasters of regional instability, using such proxies as Hezbollah to imperil Israel and pro-American regimes in Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia--with potentially catastrophic consequences for the safety of Middle Eastern oil supplies. You can be sure of what Bush will say to this in his future address: no U.S. president would ever allow such a scenario to come to pass. 
   Many of these themes were reiterated in Bush's White House Valentine's Day (February 14) press conference. Once again, Iraq was meant to be the main story, but Iran captured all the headlines. 
   Bush's most widely cited comments on Iran focused on claims of Iranian involvement in the delivery of sophisticated versions of the roadside IEDs that have been responsible for many of the U.S. casualties in recent months. Just a few days earlier, unidentified U.S. military officials in Baghdad had declared that elements of the Iranian military--specifically, the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards--were supplying the deadly devices to Shi'ite militias in Iraq, and that high-ranking Iranian government officials were aware of the deliveries. 
   These claims were contested by other U.S. officials and members of Congress who expressed doubt about the reliability of the evidence and the intelligence work behind it, but Bush evinced no such uncertainty: ``What we do know is that the Quds Force was instrumental in providing these deadly IEDs to networks inside of Iraq. We know that. And we also know that the Quds Force is a part of the Iranian government. That's a known.'' 
   What is not known, he continued, is just how high up in the Iranian government went the decision-making that led such IEDs to be delivered to the Shi'ite militias in Iraq. But that doesn't matter, he explained. ``What matters is, is that they're there ..... We know they're there, and we're going to protect our troops.'' As commander-in-chief, he insisted, he would ``do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way''. 
   He then went on to indicate that ``the biggest problem I see is the Iranians' desire to have a nuclear weapon''. He expressed his wish that this problem can be ``dealt with'' in a peaceful way--by the Iranians voluntarily agreeing to cease their program to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels. But he also made it clear that the onus was purely on Tehran to take the necessary action to avoid unspecified harm: ``I would like to be at the ..... have been given a chance for us to explain that we have no desire to harm the Iranian people.'' 
   No reporters at the press conference asked him to explain this odd twist of phrase, delivered in the past tense, about his regret  that he was unable to explain to the Iranian people why he had meant them no harm--presumably after the fact. However, if you view this as the Bush version of a Freudian slip, one obvious conclusion can be drawn: that Bush has already made the decision to begin the countdown for an attack on Iran, and only total capitulation by the Iranians could possibly bring the process to a halt. 
   Further evidence for this conclusion is provided by Bush's repeated reference to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter. On three separate occasions during the press conference he praised Russia, China and the ``EU3''--the United Kingdom, France and Germany--for framing the December 23 UN Security Council resolution condemning Iran's nuclear activities and imposing economic sanctions on Iran in the context of Chapter 7--that is, of ``Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression''. 
   This sets the stage for the international community, under UN leadership, to take such steps as may be deemed necessary ``to maintain or restore international peace and stability'', ranging from mild economic sanctions to fullscale war (steps that are described in Articles 39-51). But the December 23 resolution was specifically framed under Article 41, which entails ``measures not involving the use of armed force'', a stipulation demanded by China and Russia, which have categorically ruled out the use of military force to resolve the nuclear dispute with Iran. 
   One suspects that Bush has Chapter 7 on the brain, because he now intends to ask for a new resolution under Article 42, which allows the use of military force to restore international peace and stability. But it is nearly inconceivable that Russia and China will approve such a resolution. Such approval would also be tantamount to acknowledging U.S. hegemony worldwide, and this is something they are simply unwilling to do. 
   So we can expect several months of fruitless diplomacy at the United Nations in which the United States may achieve slightly more severe economic sanctions under Chapter 41 but not approval for military action under Chapter 42. Bush knows that this is the inevitable outcome, and so I am convinced that, in his various speeches and meetings with reporters, he is already preparing the way for a future address to the nation. 
   In it, he will speak somberly of a tireless U.S. effort to secure a meaningful resolution from the United Nations on Iran with real teeth in it and his deep disappointment that no such resolution has been not forthcoming. He will also point out that, despite the heroic efforts of American diplomats as well as military commanders in Iraq, Iran continues to pose a vital and unchecked threat to U.S. security in Iraq, in the region, and even--via its nuclear program--in the wider world. 
   Further diplomacy, he will insist, appears futile and yet Iran must be stopped. Hence, he will say, ``I have made the unavoidable decision to eliminate this vital threat through direct military action,'' and will announce--in language eerily reminiscent of his address to the nation on March 19, 2003, that a massive air offensive against Iran has already been under way for several hours.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I think this is a wonderful debate. I love to hear the Republican talking points said over and over again. I have counted now the phrase ``8 weeks'' since we passed this bill out of the committee. I have heard it 19 times so far and I expect we will hear it at least nineteen-hundred times before we pass the bill. 
   But the fact is that the ranking member knows he could have voted ``yes'' when it came out of committee. He could have voted ``yes'' when it was on the floor on the 15th of May which is when we voted on this. We already have taken action on it once; and he had a chance yesterday to vote ``yes'' on it, but he said ``no'' again. And I suspect today--well, we'll see what he does. Maybe he will change his mind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume because it is a new day and we woke up with some bad news about the U.S. economy. The Washington Post has the story, ``A new report from the Federal Reserve paints a portrait of the U.S. economy under pressure from almost every sector. Across the board, the U.S. economy is deteriorating, including jobs.'' And here we are again today trying to help the American people by passing the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008. 
   Yesterday, 144 Republican Members ignored the will of the people and instead followed the whim of a lame duck President.     
   If three votes had switched, we would have had enough votes to pass this bill and give the American people the help they need. They didn't, so we're back here today because we're going to make it happen.  
   The economic data paint a compelling case for immediate action. But my Republican colleague stood at the podium yesterday, and did it again today, waving a veto threat from the White House. 
   This is the President who's given us this war that's put us in a terrible mess. He's given us bank problems and every other thing that's going on, gas prices. And now he waves a letter and says, we don't want to do anything for the unemployed who've exhausted their benefits. 
   They hid behind rhetoric that pretends to contend itself with people qualifying for benefits. They served up a real cold red herring for dinner last night for those people that exhausted their benefits, because they simply want to deny American workers unemployment benefits. 
   Remember, this money didn't come out of the tax base. It came from their employers who paid it into a trust fund for exactly this purpose; when they lose their job, they should have access to it. 
   Now, let me be clear. This 20-week rule that we hear yelled about here, that many Republicans want included in the bill, would mean that workers could work for over 10 straight months and be denied extended benefits, depending on the vagaries of the various laws in States across this country. 
   The Department of Labor has estimated that around 10 percent of those who've exhausted their benefits might be excluded from extended benefits if we were to include this 20-week rule. These workers are disproportionately low-wage, part-time, minority and women. 
   In other words, the Republicans propose to solve a problem by creating one. Instead of helping people, the Republicans' alternative is to penalize workers on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. Very typical. Look at the tax cuts. 
   The American people need solutions, and that's what H.R. 5749 is about. It would immediately provide 13 weeks of extended benefits for workers in every State who've exhausted their benefits. It provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits in States with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or higher. 
   This bill is targeted. You hear them say we want a targeted bill. Of course it's targeted. It's targeted to do one thing, to help those people who need it the most. 
   Here's how it works. Anyone a State qualifies for unemployment benefits, and who has exhausted what the State has provided them, would be eligible for extended benefits of the same amount for half as long as the State provided them. So, if you received 26 weeks in your State from the State, and you run out, you get 13 more weeks of extended benefits. If you get 10 weeks from your State, you will get 5 weeks more of extended benefits. 
   The Federal Reserve outlook wasn't the only piece of information we received yesterday. A little while ago the Labor Department announced that initial claims for unemployment benefits jumped more than expected last week. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week increased 384,000 people, in 1 week. And all the Republicans want to do is wave a veto letter from the White House. 
   Helping the American people should not be a partisan issue; but the Republicans and the president are trying to make it just that. 
   Yesterday we had a bipartisan bill. Almost 50 Republicans voted for it. I urge my Republican colleagues to follow their conscience and not their caucus and vote with the Democrats to help the American people. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 is the least we can do for the American people. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I don't know if I walked into the wrong place or not. I thought we were talking about unemployment, but all I hear is a lot of talk about energy. Now, I don't know if the Members on the other side have forgotten what the subject is today or exactly what the problem is, but the fact is that we didn't wait 8 weeks. My ranking member, Mr. Weller, knows better than that. We voted on May 15 on this issue, and it's sitting over in the Senate. The Senate Republicans have got their foot on it. And the White House hasn't said ``boo'' to them. 
   So the Republicans are killing this proposal over there in the Senate. We're going to send it back to them another way. And I think they will have a second chance to think about it. The closer we get to the election, I think the more interested they will get in this issue. 
   But there's one issue here that I think somehow with the straw man that keeps getting put up here for everybody to look at, this person out there somewhere in Oregon or Illinois that worked for two weeks and is going to get unemployment benefits. We're  not talking about somebody on welfare here. We're talking about somebody who worked. 
   Now, my opponents on the other side keep sounding like we're talking about the dregs of the earth, people who are just stealing or somehow sneaking in and maneuvering and somehow getting something they're not entitled to. When they worked, their employer put money into the unemployment trust for their benefit. 
   Some people on the other side believe that we ought to have States' rights. States ought to be able to do stuff. Okay. States write the unemployment laws for their State. And in Illinois, it is true that if you work for two weeks, one week in one quarter and one week in another quarter, and your total wages are $1,600, so that means you worked one week and got $800; and then, just lucky, your next week of work was in another quarter, you got $800, you would be eligible in Illinois for $51 a week for 26 weeks for a grand total of $1,326. That comes from a letter from the Department of Employment Security signed by Joseph Mueller, which I will now insert into the Record.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I have trouble following the logic that you would vote ``no'' because it isn't going to become law. Why don't you vote ``yes'' and put it over there, and maybe the Senate this time will come to their senses and do something with this proposal? It's been over there since May 15. And I think that it really is an issue that we ought to give them one more chance to come to their senses. 
   Now, when you compare the unemployment rate of today with 1996, I really appreciate that because during the Clinton administration there were 20 million new jobs created, and in 1996, they were creating hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. In this administration, over the last 5 months we've lost a quarter of a million jobs. This is a totally different time. 
   There are huge problems out there, and they're not getting any better. And they're not going to get solved here today by, ``let's open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.'' Even if we did that, the oil wouldn't be here for about 4 years, and a lot of people on unemployment would be pretty hungry waiting for that job in the oil industry 4 years from now. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people should only have one question in their minds today: How bad does it have to get before the President and the Republican leadership decide to join the Democrats in extending a helping hand for unemployment benefits? The revised data released by the Labor Department today shows things are even worse than we thought. Now the decision is up to us. 
   I introduced this legislation and invited my friend and colleague, Republican Representative Phil English, to join me because helping the American people to survive during tough economic times should not be a partisan issue. People say it has become a partisan issue here. Well, yeah, the White House has made it a partisan issue. They've said there's no problem, and they will not sign a bill that we craft. They've made their mind up before they even have a chance to look at it. 
   But too many others on the other side have made it just that. The American people woke up this morning to some bad economic news, and our efforts to help them were derailed by the Republican obstructionists. Those headlines, ``Republicans kill extended unemployment benefits,'' you're going to have another set if you're not careful. 
   We talked a lot yesterday and today about unemployment rates exceeding 6 or 7 percent in several parts of the country, and the devastating impact of those rates. Now, I confess I'm not an economist--I know that's no surprise--but let me predict that the unemployment rate among House Republican Members will go a whole lot higher than 7 percent if they continue to refuse to help the American people in this growing economic crisis. 
   It's called the Emergency Extended Unemployment Insurance Act of 2008 because it is an emergency, and the time to act is right now. 
   A vote for H.R. 5749 is a vote to help the American people and the American economy.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, sometimes I am kind of appalled. I didn't think they could write a motion to recommit that would be worse than already their public stance is. But this motion to recommit would deny extended unemployment benefits to long-term jobless workers in 31 States. As you know, Mr. Speaker, some Members may be in their offices. They ought to listen to the list. 
   Alabama gets nothing. Arizona gets nothing. Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland. Massachusetts is gone too. Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico. Why, it goes on and on. North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont. The way they have written this, those States get nothing. They don't even get 13 weeks. Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. None of them get a single benefit from this bill if that amendment is adopted. 
   Now let's just talk for a second here about what we are talking about. New Jersey. Atlantic City has an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent right now. But since they are in the State of New Jersey where the unemployment rate is only 4 percent, in Atlantic City, people are tough out of luck. They aren't going to get a single benefit. Or if they live in Ocean City where it is 6.6 percent, or they live in Vineland, Millville or Bridgeton where it is 7.1 percent, not a single penny goes to those people because they live in a State where it is only 4 percent. 
   Now I would like to see the community meeting that the Members go to when they explain to people that they voted ``no'' on giving extended benefits to people who have unemployment benefits and have exhausted them in these States. This makes it much worse than the bill we have. It clearly confirms that the Republicans really want to give unemployment benefits to no one. 
   Now as to the question of whether or not we have given a reason, we took the 20-week provision out for a very simple reason, because it denies benefits to 10 percent of the people who are presently in our workforce. These are benefits they earned by having money taken out of their paycheck. Their employer said, ``I am not going to give you this. I am going to put this in the unemployment fund.'' That is how it works. 
   So those employees that had that money being put in there and now they lose their benefits because of the fact that they have worked 10 months and they didn't get to the right place in the right time to get their 20 weeks, it is simply a denial of benefits to women, to low-wage workers and to minorities. It is basically people at the bottom of the economic rungs. And the Republicans are pleased to do that. Not only do they take it away from them, but they also take it away from 31 States. 
   I urge the Members to think about the election when they vote ``no'' on this amendment.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, the Bible says, ``By their deeds, you shall know them.'' The Republicans do not want to help unemployed workers in this country. It is as simple as that. If you go back to the debate in 1935 and come forward, the Republicans have always resisted the idea of unemployment benefits because the argument is that people will sit at home and wait for a check and that they will then not go out and look for work. 
   Now, it's clear that's not true and now, today, what they are hanging their hat on is some mythical worker out there who has worked 2 weeks and is going to get full benefits. That simply is misleading in the very plainest form.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. This was put into the law in 1981 when the workforce was entirely different. Women were not such a big part of the workforce, we did not have part-time jobs. When you have this provision in the law you are denying extended benefits to about 10 percent of the people who have exhausted their benefits. Because they did not work full time, they don't get anything, and these objections are simply a reflection of the Republicans, the fact they do not want to give unemployment benefits.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we are coming to a moment of truth in a few hours for every Member of the House of Representatives. The truth is that every congressional district across the country, individuals and groups of people are struggling to find jobs in an economy cut down by a senseless, wasteful war, overwhelming energy prices, rising food prices and just bad business fundamentals. 
   People can't find jobs because there aren't enough of them. The truth is 4 million have exhausted their unemployment benefits already and things could get even worse unless we pass the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008. 
   The truth is the American people elected us to serve them, and the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act will be a test of whether the Members remember who they really work for, the people or Big Oil. We are hours away from a moment of truth.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Chairman Rangel for his leadership on behalf of the American people. 
   Every Member in the House is elected by the people, and today we're going to find out if Members remember who they work for. 
   Before us is H.R. 5749, legislation I introduced because it's time the government work for the people and extend a helping hand to those who need a break. Contrary to what you have just heard, this bill was heard in the committee, was voted on in the committee, and three members of the Republican Party voted to move it out of the Ways and Means Committee. It was contained in the supplemental bill, and everybody in the House has had an opportunity to vote on it and discuss it. We are repassing it for the second time. 
   Now, this legislation should pass without a single vote against it. And that's why it was put on the supplemental on the suspension calendar. No Member who's read a newspaper or spent any time in a congressional district talking to constituents lately could possibly miss the fact that the economy is in serious trouble and so are millions of Americans, and it will just keep getting worse until we act. 
   Last Friday we saw the largest one-month jump in the unemployment rate in 22 years. Now does anyone doubt the gravity of that situation? Across America the unemployment rate is rising. It's over 7 percent in Michigan and above 6 percent in Alaska and a half a dozen other States. 
   Eighteen percent of the unemployed in this country have not been able to find a job for at least 6 months. They have exhausted all of their benefits. And that is what this bill deals with. Everywhere you look, people are worried about their home and their family and their future. And no one feels safe no matter where they are. 
   The economy has been claimed by the Iraq war. This wasteful, needless war has undermined our economy and put it on a deep, steep downward slide. Devastating energy and food prices have made the American people be up against the wall when businesses are shedding jobs to cope. It's been this way for months, and it's time for some relief.     
   The White House has been fighting, and as Mr. Weller says, they've sent down from the administration a letter already saying they're going to veto it. Well, that's the administration. What do you expect out of that place? 
   This bill would provide 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits to all States where people have exhausted their regular unemployment. It gives another 13 weeks in States where the unemployment rate is above 6 percent. 
   The usual UI benefit is less than $300 a week. That's poverty level assistance for a family struggling in an economy when gasoline is $4 a gallon. 
   There is not a congressional district in this country that isn't feeling the effects of this downturn. Every Member in this Chamber has constituents who need help, and they are the workers we are working for, presumably. 
   This bill is a lifeboat to the American people to stay afloat during increasingly tough economic times. Anybody who votes against this bill is voting against reality. They are denying it. 
   Now, sometimes the American people watch this session out of interest, but today, they're watching because there's an urgent need to receive some help. 
   This issue of the 20 weeks is being held up as the reason why I'm going to vote against it. The Labor Department analyzed the fact that that unduly affects low-wage workers and women because they work part-time. 
   We hear that if you work 2 weeks you can get a year's benefits. Are you saying that the Governor of Illinois or the Governor of Michigan or the Governor of Pennsylvania is stupid and he's just throwing money out the window? These are qualified by the State-level people, and you know you can't give me one example of any place--people say Oregon, if you work 2 weeks in Oregon, you somehow are going to get a year's benefits for 2 weeks. There is no State in the Union where that is true. Give me one example. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, it's hard for me to understand why the gentleman from Illinois keeps bringing up his own State as an example of wasting money and he has never brought any legislation to fix what their stupid legislature has done. He is acting as though the people in his own State don't know what they're doing. 
   Now, if somebody works, money is paid into the fund. If they work for a week in one quarter and a week in another quarter, it is possible that they might get $20 or some minimal benefit. To imply that working 2 weeks you get $400 a week, as you do in the State of Washington, for 26 weeks or 52 weeks is simply misleading, and he knows it.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Illinois says that he would go for this bill but for this one provision. If that one provision were there, he would go for it. But the fact is that you have 100 metropolitan areas in this country where people simply have run out of benefits. And it is over 6 percent in those metropolitan areas. The Governors have asked us for this, and the technical thing that my opponent uses is, you know, somewhere out there, there is somebody who paid $40 into the fund, and because of the way it is written, he gets $20 out, and so I can't vote for it. 
   Well there are 1.6 million who already exhausted their benefits, and there are many more. And the national Governors sent this letter to us. They are not the only ones. State legislator, labor unions, everyone is asking for this. You can vote ``no'' if you want. You will have to face your constituency in November.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the Washington Post carried a thoughtful op-ed that I think  we ought to send down to the White House to make sure the President reads. It's called ``Lessons on Iraq from a Founding Father.'' The author, Brian O'Malley, an adjunct professor at Jones College in Jacksonville, Florida, reminds us that the Nation's first President, George Washington, could offer some good insights into what to do in Iraq. 
   In the fall of 1775, before the Declaration of Independence, the fledgling Nation prepared to invade Canada, in what the author calls America's first preemptive war. George Washington had misgivings, and he expressed them in his letters to his commander, Colonel Benedict Arnold. 
   Washington explicitly told Arnold to be sure that the Canadian people wanted America to cross the border. In his words, ``ever bearing in mind that if they are averse to it, and will not cooperate, or at least willingly acquiesce, it must fail of success. In this case you are by no means to prosecute the attempt.'' 
   Washington also understood that the safety of his soldiers depended on how they treated people, and he urged restraint. In his words, ``not only the good of their country and their honor, but their safety depends upon the treatment of these people.'' 
   The first President also worried about treating prisoners properly and with respect. He ordered his commander to restrain his forces, in his words, ``from all acts of cruelty and insult, which will disgrace the American arms, and irritate our fellow subjects against us.'' 
   Washington even warned of consequence against any American found to mistreat a prisoner. And Washington understood the need to respect religion, telling his commander to restrain officers and soldiers from any ridicule or disrespect of religion. 
   The concerns raised by Washington in 1775 are exactly the concerns that should have been raised in 2002 before the Iraq invasion. It might have been prevented Abu Ghraib. It might have prevented the wholesale dismissal and dismantling of the Iraq army that led to the rise of insurgents. It might have prevented an Iraq quagmire that has needlessly claimed American lives, wastefully drained our Treasury, carelessly tainted American leadership in the world and absolutely harmed our economy here at home. That is the Iraq war record. 
   History is replete with lessons, but unless we learn the lessons of history, we are doomed to repeat them. That is what is going on in Iraq today. The latest estimate places the cost of the war at $3 trillion, and that doesn't account for the cost of treating the thousands of U.S. soldiers coming back. 
   Iraq is like quicksand, and America sinks deeper and deeper every single day. Our military is in shambles, the housing market looks more and more like a house of cards, the U.S. dollar is in free fall against other currencies, and the U.S. economy is in recession. 
   The President says he hasn't heard that respected economists are talking about $4 a gallon gasoline next month. He's the only one who's missed the news. Gas is up almost $1 from a year ago. Diesel prices have already climbed to $3.60. But they have a rose garden down at the White House and a President who thinks everything is rosy. And if he says it, then it must be true. 
   What is true is that Americans are using credit cards just to try and stay afloat. What is true is that a record number of Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure. What is true is that a President fixated on waging a perpetual Iraq war ignored the urgent needs of the American people. He has squandered their money and our leadership. The only signs pointing upward for the President are those that proclaim more bad news--another house foreclosed, another family bankruptcy. Instead of gazing out the window at the rose garden, the President ought to try walking down Main Street and talking to a few people. He is out of touch and America is out of time.  
   Lessons on Iraq From a Founding Father  
   What would George Washington do about Iraq? In a December Outlook essay, historian Joseph J. Ellis argued that it's not possible to theorize exact answers because the ``gap between the founders' time and ours is non-negotiable, and any direct linkage between them and now is intellectually problematic.'' But Ellis also conceded that this position is ``unacceptable to many of us, because it suggests that the past is an eternally lost world that has nothing to teach us.'' 
   History does hold lessons about today's issues, and this is clear when considering Iraq and U.S. conduct in the war against terrorism. Consider the 1775-76 invasion of Canada, America's first preemptive war, which ended just days before Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence. 
   On Sept. 14, 1775, Washington wrote two letters to Col. Benedict Arnold, who led an American force into Canada. Five of Washington's points for invasion merit particular attention. 
   First, if the citizens don't want us there, don't go. Washington told Arnold, ``You are by every means in your power to endeavor to discover the real sentiments of the Canadians towards our cause, and particularly as to this expedition; ever bearing in mind that if they are averse to it, and will not co-operate, or at least willingly acquiesce, it must fail of success. In this case you are by no means to prosecute the attempt.'' 
   The expense of starting the mission and the disappointment of not completing it, Washington wrote, ``are not to be put in competition with the dangerous consequences which may ensue from irritating them against us.'' 
   Second, the safety of American personnel depended on how they treated people. Washington wanted Arnold to ``conciliate the affections'' of the Canadian settlers and Indians and ordered Arnold to teach the soldiers and officers under his command ``that not only the Good of their Country and their Honour, but their Safety depends upon the Treatment of these People.'' 
    Third, proper treatment of prisoners was necessary. The prominent British parliamentarian William Pitt, who championed American grievances, had a son serving in Canada. John Pitt was never taken into American custody, but in the event that Pitt was captured, Washington warned Arnold, ``You cannot err in paying too much Honour to the Son of so illustrious a Character, and so true a Friend to America.'' 
   This insistence on kind treatment extended beyond Pitt. Washington wrote, ``Any other Prisoners who may fall into your Hands, you will treat with as much Humanity and kindness, as may be consistent with your own Safety and the publick Interest.'' 
   Washington told Arnold to restrain the Continental troops and their Indian allies ``from all Acts of Cruelty and Insult, which will disgrace the American Arms, and irritate our Fellow Subjects against us.'' 
   Fourth, any Americans who mistreated Canadians should be punished. ``Should any American Soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any Canadian or Indian, in his Person or Property,'' Washington wrote, ``I do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary Punishment as the Enormity of the Crime may require.'' In an accompanying letter Washington added, ``Should it extend to Death itself it will not be disproportional to its Guilt, at such a Time and in such a Cause.'' 
   Fifth, respect the people's religion. ``As the Contempt of the Religion of a Country by ridiculing any of its Ceremonies or affronting its Ministers or Votaries, has ever been deeply resented, you are to be particularly careful to restrain every Officer and Soldier from such Imprudence and Folly and to punish every Instance of it.'' 
   American ideals won immediate support from the Canadians, but American misconduct squandered it. Contrary to Washington's orders, some American commanders disrespected Canadians' religion, property and liberty. 
   Lamenting this American misconduct, Washington wrote to Gen. Philip Schuyler on April 19, 1776, ``I am afraid proper measures have not been taken to conciliate their affections, but rather that they have been insulted and injured, than which nothing could have a greater tendency to ruin our cause in that country; for human nature is such that it will adhere to the side from whence the best treatment is received.'' 
   George Washington is still first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen. It's too bad he couldn't have been the first person we asked about how to proceed in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the economy has been one of the casualties of the Iraq war. And this administration has consistently refused to be interested in dealing with the problems of the unemployed. 
   We tried to get this introduced when we had the stimulus package some months ago. The administration didn't want to do anything with the unemployed. Long-term unemployment in this country is up to 17.9 percent. Now, you would think they would care, but they still aren't asking for it. 
   They have never changed their tune from 1935. They never thought we should have unemployment insurance in the Social Security Act of 1935 because they said if you give people unemployment insurance, they won't want to go to work, they will just want to sit home and get a check. That comes from people who have never been unemployed. That comes from people who don't know anybody who has ever been unemployed. It is simply nonsense. 
   We need to put the money into the economy. We need to give it to the workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. And this administration still sits there and says, no, we're not going to extend unemployment benefits. 
   There are 26 weeks in here; 13 for everybody, and 13 weeks for those States that are over 6 percent.  
   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. economy is one of the casualties of the Iraq war, and passing an extension of unemployment benefits is nothing less than battlefield triage for innocent American workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 
   When I first introduced legislation several months ago to extend unemployment benefits, I had hoped the White House would declare a cease fire so that we could act quickly and on a bipartisan basis to help the American people and U.S. economy. 
   Instead, months went by while the administration pretended the gathering economic storm was nothing to worry about. And matters just kept getting worse. 
   Long-term unemployment--the percentage of unemployed workers who have not been able to find a job for at least 6 months--now stands at 17.8 percent. That is something to worry about. And act on. 
   My bipartisan unemployment extension bill will extend benefits in every State for an additional 13 weeks, and in States where the overall unemployment rate exceeds 6 percent, there is another 13-week extension. 
   We are going to help the American people weather this storm. And at the same time, we're going to lessen the economic blow to the U.S. economy. 
   We know people spend their unemployment benefits quickly, and we know a dollar in benefits yields $1.73 in positive economic impact as the money ripples through the economy. 
   Governors, mayors, State legislators, economists, advocates for working families, and the faith community are all asking for this extension of unemployment benefits. 
   Only those on the far right are opposed. 
   They say that unemployment benefits keep people from going out and looking for a job, but they are both out of line and out of touch. 
   Across America the average unemployment benefit is less than $300 a week--below the poverty-level for an American family. 
   What we're doing today is throwing a lifeline to the American people. Enough damage has already been done to the U.S. economy because of all the money spent on the endless Iraq war. 
   It's time for Congress to tend to the economic casualties at home. 
   Vote for extending unemployment benefits because it is a vote for helping the American people.   
   National Governors Association,

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (WARTIME AND OUR SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, a lot of political figures, myself included, have talked about the Iraq war. Tonight I want to share the words expressed by people in this and other wars. They come from a new book called ``Voices in Wartime.'' It contains profoundly moving and often poetic thoughts from brave U.S. soldiers, loved ones and Iraqis. 
   This is from John Henry Parker, a Marine Corps veteran and Executive Director of Veterans and Families. ``My son is a sergeant in the 10th Mountain Division. He was a squad leader, and his job was to go into the border towns and into the different mountain areas around the Pakistan border to seek out and find the enemy, the Taliban, al Qaeda, and whoever else might be hiding in the hills resisting. 
   ``He had been witnessing a lot of really horrific things, and his main concern was, can I come back and just get past all of this and be a dad, a husband, and just a family guy? How do you do that?'' 
   Dr. Enas Mohamed is an Iraqi doctor now living in Seattle, my Congressional district. She lived in Baghdad during the First Gulf War and said this in the book: ``The children were really scared and kept yelling. It was winter, and so, at 5 a.m., there wasn't much sunlight. It was dark, and the bombing continued. Everybody felt a deep fear in their bones. 
   ``You can't imagine the amount of disease that has spread since the war. One of the largest issues is polluted water. It causes dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and there's a deficiency of water, so we don't have enough water to wash our hands every time they get dirty. 
   ``Children play together all the time, and they don't take the precautions like adults do. Plus, they have weaker immune systems and malnutrition or not enough food to fill their needs as growing kids. 
   ``With the low level of hygiene and the high level of malnutrition, any infection will start to grow and transmit very quickly. 
   ``One of the victims was a very, very hard case for me. He was 10 or 11 years  old. I talked to his mom and learned his history. He left school to support his family, so he was on his way to sell some cigarettes near the street where a car bomb exploded. This little child got broken hands and broken legs. 
   ``The doctor told me they might have to amputate one of his legs, and I can't imagine what it means for a 10-year-old boy to live with one limb. He didn't even get enough time to finish school or to play soccer or to do all the activities like little boys do. 
   ``I think it's time to stop it and do something really positive for these innocent people. If we think about the new generation, starting with the boy I mentioned before, you can imagine a whole generation of disabled people. They have and been punished for doing nothing. They're innocent civilians who are just hoping to live like any other human being on earth.'' 
   Sheila Sebron is a disabled African American Air Force veteran. She wrote this. ``PTSD is not to be taken lightly. It's a devastating illness that robs its victims of free will and imposes a slow death sentence that kills the human spirit. 
   ``I get caught in these loops in my mind and get stuck thinking about part of a thought without being able to finish the thought. Thanks to finally getting the treatment I needed for my PTSD, I can now break the cycle of being trapped in my mind and can communicate verbally.'' 
   She also writes, ``War harms everyone it touches: soldiers, civilians, refugees, family members and friends. No one escapes the trauma.'' 
   Personally, I was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist and a Navy veteran who treated combat soldiers returning from Vietnam. Sheila Sebron is right. No one escapes without trauma. But there is hope, and treatment is available for PTSD. 
   I've never met Sheila Sebron, but I'm very proud of her. She's a brave U.S. soldier who put her life on the line twice for her country, once in uniform, and now in print as she tries to tell others and save them by telling her story. 
   PTSD harmed many serving in Vietnam and in the First Gulf War. But as many as 50,000 soldiers serving in the Iraq war will come home with PTSD. 
   PTSD is a mental wound as real and as serious as a shrapnel wound from an IED. Soldiers need and deserve our help and support. 
   The book is called, Voices in Wartime. I urge every American to pick up a copy and read it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (INTERNET GAMBLING REGULATION AND TAX ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian home that cast a dim view on gambling. I didn't care for it much then, and I don't care for it now. 
   While the Bible never directly uses the word ``gambling,'' there are plenty of references to it in Scripture, and none of them are very kind. 
   Still, from lotteries to casinos, gambling is part of the American scene today. Across the country, governments derive revenue from gambling that flows into public coffers. Whether you call it a sin tax or self-imposed tax, it helps fund good social programs. 
   Today, gambling has migrated online where it is unregulated, off shore and exporting billions of U.S. dollars. Basically, we have a Wild West show with few protections for Americans against fraud, underage gambling and privacy. 
   My colleagues, Barney Frank and Peter King, have introduced legislation to establish some order and law online with licensing and regulation. I am introducing a companion bill today that establishes the process to collect some of the gambling revenue online just as we do in the communities. 
   If we decide as a Nation to enable gambling online, the billions of dollars flowing out of this country should remain here to help us fund schools and bridges and a host of social programs that need more than luck to succeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (BRING THE SOLDIERS HOME -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, they say they care about the soldiers. The President and his administration talk a lot about the soldiers, but in Iraq, the situation keeps getting worse. There are another 18 months left in this administration, and unless the Republicans finally dig in and demand action instead of words, casualties will continue to rise at a horrendous rate. In the 18 months the President remains in office, 1,800 more soldiers will die and 18,000 more U.S. soldiers will be wounded if they keep up at the present rate. 
   We are suffering as mightily as we did in Vietnam, and the results are just as catastrophic and just as preventable. We have a choice, but this President chooses to spend more U.S. lives in Iraq, and he does so with the full support of the Republican Party, which is the only way he can survive. 
   The American people have spoken, the Democratic Party has spoken, we all said the same thing: Set a timetable and get U.S. soldiers out of Iraq's civil war. Even the majority of Iraq's elected Parliament has demanded a timetable for U.S. withdrawal, but the President ignores it all. 
   So far, the Republican Party has sat on its conscience and given the President every blank check he asks for. Too many Republicans in this House and Senate know the truth, but they remain silent and acquiescence and give up their congressional responsibility. 
   The American people have submerged the President's approval rating in an effort to get his attention, but he keeps ignoring the fact, the evidence and the lessons of history. And it is be possible because blind allegiance has become the litmus test of the members of his party. 
   Republicans used to give the President blank checks, now they give him a rubber stamp veto to keep Americans fighting and dying in a war he lost several years ago. U.S. casualties will continue to rise at the President continues to escalate his stay-the-course policy in Iraq. 
   The President's stubbornness has nothing to do with taking new ground in Iraq, but it has everything to do with gaining rights to what's underground in Iraq, the oil wealth of the Iraqi people. That's why the rhetoric is already being planted by the administration with friendly media that September won't really matter when it comes to a progress report. As Frank Rich reported in the Sunday New York Times, the fix is already on. And I will enter this journalism into the Record. 
   [From the New York Times, June 24, 2007] 
   They'll Break the Bad News on 9/11  
   By this late date we should know the fix is in when the White House's top factotums fan out on the Sunday morning talk shows singing the same lyrics, often verbatim, from the same hymnal of spin. The pattern was set way back on Sept. 8, 2002, when in simultaneous appearances three cabinet members and the vice president warned darkly of Saddam's aluminum tubes. ``We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,'' said Condi Rice, in a scripted line. The hard sell of the war in Iraq--the hyping of a (fictional) nuclear threat to America--had officially begun. 
   America wasn't paying close enough attention then. We can't afford to repeat that blunder now. Last weekend the latest custodians of the fiasco, our new commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, and our new ambassador to Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, took to the Sunday shows with two messages we'd be wise to heed. 
   The first was a confirmation of recent White House hints that the long-promised September pivot point for judging the success of the ``surge'' was inoperative. That deadline had been asserted as recently as April 24 by President Bush, who told Charlie Rose that September was when we'd have ``a pretty good feel'' whether his policy ``made sense.'' On Sunday General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker each downgraded September to merely a ``snapshot'' of progress in Iraq. ``Snapshot,'' of course, means ``Never mind!'' 
   The second message was more encoded and more ominous. Again using similar language, the two men said that in September they would explain what Mr. Crocker called ``the consequences'' and General Petraeus ``the implications'' of any alternative ``courses of action'' to their own course in Iraq. What this means in English is that when the September ``snapshot'' of the surge shows little change in the overall picture, the White House will say that ``the consequences'' of winding down the war would be even more disastrous: surrender, defeat, apocalypse now. So we must stay the surge. Like the war's rollout in 2002, the new propaganda offensive to extend and escalate the war will be exquisitely timed to both the anniversary of 9/11 and a high-stakes Congressional vote (the Pentagon appropriations bill). 
   General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker wouldn't be sounding like the Bobbsey Twins and laying out this coordinated rhetorical groundwork were they not already anticipating the surge's failure. Both spoke on Sunday of how (in General Petraeus's variation on the theme) they had to ``show that the Baghdad clock can indeed move a bit faster, so that you can put a bit of time back on the Washington clock.'' The very premise is nonsense. Yes, there is a Washington clock, tied to Republicans' desire to avoid another Democratic surge on Election Day 2008. But there is no Baghdad clock. It was blown up long ago and is being no more successfully reconstructed than anything else in Iraq. 
   When Mr. Bush announced his ``new way forward'' in January, he offered a bouquet of promises, all unfulfilled today. ``Let the Iraqis lead'' was the policy's first bullet point, but in the initial assault on insurgents now playing out so lethally in Diyala Province, Iraqi forces were kept out of the fighting altogether. They were added on Thursday: 500 Iraqis, following 2,500 Americans. The notion that these Shiite troops might ``hold'' this Sunni area once the Americans leave is an opium dream. We're already back fighting in Maysan, a province whose security was officially turned over to Iraqi authorities in April. 
   In his January prime-time speech announcing the surge, Mr. Bush also said that ``America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' More fiction. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's own political adviser, Sadiq al-Rikabi, says it would take ``a miracle'' to pass the legislation America wants. Asked on Monday whether the Iraqi Parliament would stay in Baghdad this summer rather than hightail it to vacation, Tony Snow was stumped. 
   Like Mr. Crocker and General Petraeus, Mr. Snow is on script for trivializing September as judgment day for the surge, saying that by then we'll only ``have a little bit of metric'' to measure success. This administration has a peculiar metric system. On Thursday, Peter Pace, the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the spike in American troop deaths last week the ``wrong metric'' for assessing the surge's progress. No doubt other metrics in official reports this month are worthless too, as far as the non-reality-based White House is concerned. The civilian casualty rate is at an all-time high; the April-May American death toll is a new two-month record; overall violence in Iraq is up; only 146 out of 457 Baghdad neighborhoods are secure; the number of internally displaced Iraqis has quadrupled since January. 
   Last week Iraq rose to No. 2 in Foreign Policy magazine's Failed State Index, barely nosing out Sudan. It might have made No. 1 if the Iraqi health ministry had not stopped providing a count of civilian casualties. Or if the Pentagon were not withholding statistics on the increase of attacks on the Green Zone. Apparently the White House is working overtime to ensure that the September ``snapshot'' of Iraq will be an underexposed blur. David Carr of The Times discovered that the severe Pentagon blackout on images of casualties now extends to memorials for the fallen in Iraq, even when a unit invites press coverage. 
   Americans and Iraqis know the truth anyway. The question now is: What will be the new new way forward? For the administration, the way forward will include, as always, attacks on its critics' patriotism. We got a particularly absurd taste of that this month when Harry Reid was slammed for calling General Pace incompetent and accusing General Petraeus of exaggerating progress on the ground. 
   General Pace's record speaks for itself; the administration declined to go to the mat in the Senate for his reappointment. As for General Petraeus, who recently spoke of ``astonishing signs of normalcy'' in Baghdad, he is nothing if not consistent. He first hyped ``optimism'' and ``momentum'' in Iraq in an op-ed article in September 2004. 
   Come September 2007, Mr. Bush will offer his usual false choices. We must either stay his disastrous course in eternal pursuit of ``victory'' or retreat to the apocalypse of ``precipitous withdrawal.'' But by the latest of the president's ever-shifting definitions of victory, we've already lost. ``Victory will come,'' he says, when Iraq ``is stable enough to be able to be an ally in the war on terror and to govern itself and defend itself.'' The surge, which he advertised as providing ``breathing space'' for the Iraqi ``unity'' government to get its act together, is tipping that government into collapse. As Vali Nasr, author of ``The Shia Revival,'' has said, the new American strategy of arming Sunni tribes is tantamount to saying the Iraqi government is irrelevant.  
   For the Bush White House, the real definition of victory has become ``anything they can get away with without taking blame for defeat,'' said the retired Army Gen. William Odom, a national security official in the Reagan and Carter administrations, when I spoke with him recently. The plan is to run out the Washington clock between now and Jan. 20, 2009, no matter the cost. 
   Precipitous withdrawal is also a chimera, since American manpower, materiel and bases, not to mention our new Vatican City-sized embassy, can't be drawn down overnight. The only real choice, as everyone knows, is an orderly plan for withdrawal that will best serve American interests. The real debate must be over what that plan is. That debate can't happen as long as the White House gets away with falsifying reality, sliming its opponents and sowing hyped fears of Armageddon. The threat that terrorists in civil-war-torn Iraq will follow us home if we leave is as bogus as Saddam's mushroom clouds. The Qaeda that actually attacked us on 9/11 still remains under the tacit protection of our ally, Pakistan. 
   As General Odom says, the endgame will start ``when a senior senator from the president's party says no,'' much as William Fulbright did to L.B.J. during Vietnam. That's why in Washington this fall, eyes will turn once again to John Warner, the senior Republican with the clout to give political cover to other members of his party who want to leave Iraq before they're forced to evacuate Congress. In September, it will be nearly a year since Mr. Warner said that Iraq was ``drifting sideways'' and that action would have to be taken ``if this level of violence is not under control and this government able to function.'' 
   Mr. Warner has also signaled his regret that he was not more outspoken during Vietnam. ``We kept surging in those years,'' he told The Washington Post in January, as the Iraq surge began. ``It didn't work.'' Surely he must recognize that his moment for speaking out about this war is overdue. Without him, the Democrats don't have the votes to force the president's hand. With him, it's a slam dunk. The best way to honor the sixth anniversary of 9/11 will be to at last disarm a president who continues to squander countless lives in the names of those voiceless American dead.  
   The truth about September will be that the President is still losing the Iraq war, but that's not what we will be told, nor will the President tell the American people that he has no plan to treat all the gravely wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Already America has lost over 3,500 soldiers, as many as 53,000 more are gravely wounded. As many as 50,000 more may yet be afflicted with post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury. 
   As the Associated Press reported over the weekend, our government is overwhelmed now in trying to care for our wounded, and the President has this Nation on course to see 20,000 more casualties before he leaves office. That's what will happen unless his own Republican Party finally tells him and the American people the truth about Iraq, and the urgent need to get their soldiers out of harm's way. 
   The Vietnam Memorial in Washington is a place where we commemorate the soldiers who died during the last failed war. Had enough people gotten through to the President back in 1968, there would only be one side of that Memorial because we could have saved at least 25,000 lives. That's why we have to get through to the President today. The American people can't, the Democratic Party can't, even the Iraq Parliament can't. That leaves own the Republican Party to stop the memorial to Iraq's fallen heroes from growing any larger than it already will be. 
   We have a chance today to save U.S. lives by seeing the Iraq war for what it is and what it isn't. It is a civil war created by us, and it isn't in America's interest to be there. 
   Bring the soldiers home, Mr. President.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, the President and his administration would be wise to avoid making Iran the next Iraq. Despite that, the demonizing of Iran has begun as the President tries to divert the attention of the American people away from the Iraq debacle. Instead of advocating diplomacy in the region as recommended by the Iraq Study Group and countless leaders in both political parties, the President is making veiled threats that are becoming increasingly worrisome. The boiling caldron of violence in the Middle East is growing hotter, and to many people, the policies and pronouncements of the President concerning Iran are seen as throwing gasoline on the fire. 
   As the situation worsens in Iraq, the President talks more and more about Iran, as if the attention of the American people and the world can so easily be diverted. That is not going to work this time. The focus of the American people, indeed the focus of the world, is on the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the disastrous war the President continues to wage and escalate. We know he is raising the stakes in Iraq. Many fear Iran is not behind. And we see an irony in that. 
   Leaders in the Middle East I met with recently in Jordan blame Paul Bremer, the President's first administrator in Iraq, believing Bremer, unwittingly or otherwise, handed Iraq to the regime in Iran. He did it with disastrous decisions. 
   First, he dismantled the Iraqi army. That left the border between Iraq and Iran unguarded and open to the infiltration of weapons and insurgents to foment violence in Iraq. 
   Bremer gave the Shi'a effective control by mandating they receive a majority of seats in reconstituting an Iraqi government. 
   These decisions opened the border and at the same time tightened relationships between Iranian Shi'a and Iraqi Shi'a. It set the stage for Iran's influence to grow stronger and stronger inside Iraq and unleashed a torrent of violence, pitting Iraqi against Iraqi with American soldiers caught in the cross fire. Is there any wonder that many Iraqis believe their nation is being handed over to Iran by the U.S.? 
   Now, many believe the President's saber rattling toward Iran has less to do with its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon and more to do with his failure to understand the region and contain Iran from the outset of the war. Thoughtful people in the United States and around the world fear the President is compounding the trouble, not confronting the problems in a troubled region. Where does all this saber rattling go? History shows us the way. 
   In less than one generation, we have done what we vowed never to do again: We have allowed a President to stampede the Nation into a hopeless war, not because we had to but because he wanted to. This President believed he could have victory by saying it was so. We have seen the tragic consequences of that. 
   There are so many parallels between the Iraq debacle and Vietnam; it is unbelievable. The President and many  people in America forgot the lessons of history when a blank check was given to a President in Iraq. There are still some lessons to learn. 
   The Vietnam War was going badly, so much so that an earlier President did not merely escalate the war, he expanded it into Laos and Cambodia, secret bombing that did not shorten the Vietnam War or offer a path to resolution. 
   My fear is that we will forget all the lessons of the Vietnam War. It is time to ask the question: Is Iran the next Laos or Cambodia? 
   With things going badly in Iraq, will the President continue to ignore the lessons of history and order the American military not merely to escalate but to expand the war beyond Iraq? I wish a question like this did not have to be asked, but we cannot watch Iraq, consider Vietnam, and not worry that a President who refuses to learn from history or admit mistakes is not doomed to repeating the same mistakes. 
   Military action is not the answer in Iraq, in Iran or Gaza, or any other flash point in the Middle East. We need to dispatch an army all right, an army of diplomats armed not with bullets but with ideas, with resolve and with a book of American history in every briefcase. 
   The way out of Iraq must begin here on Capitol Hill, because down the street at the White House, they are only talking about more ways in and, we fear, other places to go. This war must end now, and there should be a binding resolution to indicate that to the President and to the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, 4 years after the banner was unfurled, these are the missions that have been accomplished by the President: 
   America is more divided than at any time since the Vietnam War. The Iraq Government has before it a sweetheart deal that benefits Big Oil that the U.S. brokered behind the scenes. Read Josh Holland's investigative piece on alternet.com; 
   America is increasingly isolated in the Arab world, and countries that looked up to America now look out or look the other way. Read Rami Khouri's commentary published in the April 19 issue of the Daily Star in Lebanon; 
   The number of Pentagon contractors in Iraq who are profiting in the spoils of war, raking in vast sums of U.S. taxpayer money, nearly equals the number of U.S. soldiers. Read ``Iraq War: a Nice Little Earner'' in the Asia Times newspaper dated April 19; 
   Americans are so fed up with the President's state of denial that they returned Democratic majorities to the House and Senate last November. Read the April 26 editorial in my hometown newspaper, the Seattle PI: ``Iraq: Keep Speaking Out.'' 
   Missions accomplished? All but the most important one: getting U.S. soldiers out of Iraq. 
   That is the will of the American people and the mission of the new Congress.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today we are going to discuss energy and a new direction. 
   The Speaker has set a vision to get us off our oil addiction. And in order to do that, we have got to find some money to begin to develop alternative energy sources. 
   Now, the newspapers today are filled with stories about why we are still in Iraq. We are trying to get a law passed over there that puts in production sharing agreements with the big oil companies of this country. We are trying to get a hold of the Iraqis' oil. We want to take 70 percent of the profits at the beginning. 
   Now, no Iraqi who has any nationalist feelings is going to sign that, and that is why we are still there 4 years later. We are till trying to get a hold of their oil and control it. 
   This country has to take the beginning step today, with H.R. 6, to get us off this oil addiction. Alternative energy, whether you are talking solar or wind or biomass or bio diesel, all these are ways that Americans can use for energy and we don't have to live off the rest of the world. We get 3 percent of our oil from the United States. All the rest comes from outside. We are totally dependent on it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (SEED DEMOCRACY IN CUBA -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, there is one nation in the world where seeding democracy right now might take root. It is Cuba. It is only 90 miles away from our shores, but we are using the same sort of wrong-headed thinking regarding Cuba that we are using in international affairs around the world with equally dismal results. 
   Today the Bush administration has draconian travel restrictions in place for any American trying to visit family members in Cuba. It is their idea of promoting democracy by punishing the people we are trying to befriend. It makes no difference if a relative is well, sick or dying in Cuba. You get one chance every 3 years to visit Cuba legally. If an American visits a relative in Cuba and that relative is stricken by a heart attack the day after you leave, you cannot go back for 3 years. 
   The administration thinks that by cutting off families in Cuba from loved ones in the United States, they will encourage the overthrow of Castro. 
   When will we ever learn? This policy plays right into the hands of those who want to portray the United States as an arrogant bully willing to use innocent people as a wedge against a regime we don't like. 
   Our policy regarding Cuba is hurting innocent people here and there, not the government we have been trying to overthrow for a generation. It has hurt one of my constituents, an Iraq war hero, who came to the United States from Cuba 15 years ago risking his life coming on a raft floating in the ocean. 
   Sergeant Carlos Lazo made national headlines last year when he tried to get to Cuba to visit his teenage sons. Carlos is a man who joined the Washington National Guard to give service to his new country. 
   As a combat medic in Iraq, he risked his life to save others, and for his heroism he was awarded the Bronze Star. I had the honor to pin that medal on him in a ceremony in Seattle last year. 
   Carlos is an American citizen, a decorated war hero, and he is barred from boarding a flight to visit his family in Cuba. That is not how you promote democracy in Cuba or anywhere else for that matter. And the fact is, there are countless stories just like Carlos. It makes no diplomatic or strategic sense. We hurt U.S. interests by hurting U.S. citizens who reach out to family in Cuba. 
   Who could possibly be a better ambassador representing the United States than the blood relative of someone living in Cuba? The most powerful statement we could ever make to the people of Cuba is to let them interact with Americans who are related by blood or marriage. 
   Are the Cubans more likely to listen to U.S. propaganda or to a son or to a daughter? The answer is obvious, and it should be just as obvious that the U.S. needs to revise its travel ban to Cuba. 
   As it stands now, we are separating families. Instead, we should be reuniting loved ones. We don't promote freedom by denying it to innocent civilians, and we don't make new friends anywhere when an American citizen is denied the ability to visit a dying mother in Cuba. Imagine the propaganda of a press release, Americans barred from visiting mother on death bed in Cuba. A story like that can and will be used against us all over the world. 
   We don't gain from a policy that forces separate families, and it is time  to change. We don't have to lift the embargo against Cuba to restore family relations among Cubans and their relatives who live in America. We have a real opportunity to make progress promoting democracy in Cuba, and we ought to take it. 
   We need to revise the U.S. travel policy to Cuba to recognize that the American people are the best ambassadors we could ever deploy. Every visit by an American citizen to a loved one in Cuba will do more to promote freedom and democracy than all the leaflets and all the broadcasts and all the saber rattling that we have tried unsuccessfully in the last half century. We don't need to tear down a wall, we do need to tear up a policy and start over, and we should do it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   We are here to take one small and bipartisan step toward making clean renewable energy a reality in America. And imagine my surprise, Big Oil doesn't think it is a good idea. But let's set the stage for this debate. 
   Two years ago, Big Oil muscled their way into a corporate tax break they had never earned and didn't need. They are siphoning off $1 billion a year right out of the pockets of U.S. taxpayers, and they want it to last forever, right along with $10 billion in quarterly profits that they have been reporting. 
   Their answer to everything is more drilling and more money. The President completely agrees. He thinks it is unfair of us to expect Big Oil to actually earn money. He would actually just give it to them. That is what they think; that is what the American people face. 
   According to a report by the Department of Energy, it is expected that 86 percent of our energy supply will come from oil, coal, and natural gas in the year 2030. That is the same proportion of our energy consumption that carbon provides today. 
   That same report states that we should expect oil, gas, and coal prices to continually climb. In other words, if this country does not pursue a radically different approach to energy, we can expect dirty air, more pain at the pump, and more reliance on foreign oil. 
   The bill before us takes the vital first step in the pursuit of a new energy policy that looks to American innovation to provide renewable energy. This bill is a down payment, and only that, on a commitment to an energy policy that is fitting for the 21st century. The bill before us is fundamentally fair. 
   In 2004, the Congress sought to help American manufacturers better compete in the global economy, but in doing so they provided a 10 percent reduction in the Federal taxes owed by Big Oil. That translates into a tax subsidy for over $1 billion a year, a real boondoggle. 
   What is more, the Congress gave this subsidy to oil at a time when the industry was enjoying recordbreaking  profits that were resulting from $60 a barrel oil. That is wrong. Today we take the first step back in the right direction.  
   Today we're taking the taxpayer money and putting it to better use. Today the House of Representatives will decide that it's wiser to invest in renewable energy, innovation, and a future for our economy and our planet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, as I listened to my colleague from Louisiana, I would think that the end of the Western World as we have known it is about to descend upon us by these rather minor changes we are making in the tax policy of this country, by taking back subsidies to an oil industry that between January and September of 2006 has had $96 billion worth of profit reported. 
   Now these are minor changes at the most and we know that. This is a down payment on the changes that must go on in this country. We know the American people have spoken on this issue. They are demanding change. That is why they voted the way they did in November. They saw what they got out of the White House and out of the Vice President's office, the records of which are still kept secret so we don't know what agreements were made with the oil companies at the beginning of this administration. 
   I spoke earlier, and after I spoke I went out of the Chamber and I bumped into some people from the National Wildlife Federation, and they gave me 30,000 signatures of people who want this bill to pass, people who care about the environment. People who care about global warming, people who believe in national security, who believe in economic security, signed this in the last 3 weeks. The American people obviously are way ahead of us. 
   Detroit didn't know what was going on. The Prius was on the street for 3 years in Tokyo, and they never saw it coming. When the Prius came to the United States, the waiting time was 18 months long. That is what we have to change. We have to change the thinking in this country about whether we are going to be addicted to oil forever or not. 
   Now global warming is real. The average temperature in the ocean has gone up 1 degree worldwide. In the Northwest, it is up more than 2 degrees. And the changes that means for salmon spawning and for the ecology that goes on are under way. Yesterday's New York Times had a story about the melting of the glaciers in Greenland. There is no question about whether global warming is happening. The question is whether this Congress will respond and lead the way. 
   Speaker Pelosi when she came in said she was going to do these things and set a new direction for this country. Today we are finishing up 100 hours of efforts in a whole series of areas, this being the toughest, this being the most complicated, the most costly, the one that is going to take us the most time. 
   We can change the health care system in fairly short order if we want to. We can change college loans in fairly short order if we want to. But changing the way we use energy in this country needs to start today. 
   No one says this bill is the be-all and end-all of what should happen, but we can see countries that have done it. In Brazil, they have gotten themselves off gasoline. They are using ethanol. We could do that. The Brazilians are not smarter than we are. They just decided as a country they were going to get off their addiction to oil. 
   The Danes, when we dropped our support for the wind industry, picked up the technology and now at every place you go to see a windmill in this country, it is made in Denmark. Why is that? We started that in 1994 with some amendments supporting the wind industry, and then we let them expire. 
   Last year, 2005, we suddenly woke up and said, Oh my God, the Danes are ahead of us. We better start again. There is a whole series of things that we should be doing if we are serious about what is going to be our future. 
   Now, I have hoped that we would have a day like this when we would start to make the change. This is one small step. The Chinese say a journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. This is the first step. 
   Mr. Rahall has done an excellent job, and I want to congratulate the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and particularly John Buckley whose idea this bill was. He came to me with the idea. It was not my idea. It was John Buckley's and congratulations to John.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 10, 2006, IN IRAQ? -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call for an explanation and a full accounting from the Department of Defense concerning an attack on Camp Falcon last year. This much is not in dispute: Under cover of darkness on October 10, 2006, Camp Falcon, America's largest military base in Iraq, which is 10 miles south of Baghdad, was attacked by insurgents, and the base was shelled with mortars and rockets. An enemy round struck an ammunition store which triggered massive explosions and huge fireballs that lit up the night sky in Baghdad. 
   News footage and amateur video were shown on television in the Middle East, and a BBC reporter described the explosions as immense. In the days following the attack, U.S. military officers in Iraq repeatedly said that the damage would not degrade U.S. military capacity and that the attack did not injure or kill anyone at the base. 
   In a briefing on October 12, 2006, Major General William Caldwell told reporters, ``Very fortunately, no coalition forces or Iraqi security forces were injured, nor civilian casualties that anyone is aware of at this point. We lost some munitions, but took no personnel casualties.'' That is the official line for the military. 
   But the questions are beginning to surface as to whether the official line is the truth. It was brought to my attention yesterday during a meeting in my congressional office with Mohammed al Deeni, an independent member of the Iraqi Parliament. He came to the U.S. to talk with Members of Congress about the realities of life in Iraq. At my invitation, other Members of Congress joined me in this face-to-face legislative exchange of information. They heard what I am about to share. 
   During our meeting, I asked Mr. al Deeni if Iraq was so unstable that a terrorist attack could claim a large number of Americans in one attack. As many of us remember, that is what happened in 1983 when a massive terrorist truck bomb struck and killed 241 U.S. Marines in Beirut. I wanted to know if such an attack was possible in Iraq. Without hesitation, Mr. al Deeni said such an attack had already occurred. He said--and others are saying online--that the attack on Camp Falcon killed 300 Americans, wounded another 200 Americans and killed or injured another 200 Iraqis. 
   The Pentagon says there were no casualties. But a member of the Iraqi Parliament and others claim there were significant casualties. Which story is true? Satellite images, aerial photographs, videos and written accounts that purport to be firsthand can be found online. I will enter into the Record a list of some of these sites so that people can see for themselves. 
   Internet sites which contains video, photographs, or written accounts of the attack on Camp Falcon on October 10, 2006: 
   http://www.cawa.fr/destruction-du-camp-americain-falcon-explosions-d-armes-a-l-ua-et-ou-d-armes-nucleaires-tactiques-article00913.html.

   http://zennobia.blogspot.com/2006/10/al-rashid-falcon-military-bases.html.  
   Here is one excerpt from a site written after the attack by French journalists: ``Nine big carriers marked by the Red Cross sign transporting the dead and injured were seen by journalists ..... Silence still wraps the whole event from the side of the American military as well as the Bush administration, since there remains only a few weeks before the legislative elections, with a public opinion more and more against the war.'' 
   This happened just before the last elections, and it is unclear as to what happened. I don't know if these stories are credible. But these reports cannot be ignored. If we lost hundreds of U.S. soldiers and other Americans in one attack, Congress and the American people have a right to know about it. 
   I looked at the videos and the aerial photographs, and the damage appears quite extensive to buildings and military vehicles like tanks. Perhaps American soldiers and others miraculously escaped injury. That would be very good news. Or perhaps we don't know what really happened on the night of October 10, 2006 in an insurgent attack on Camp Falcon.  
   The Pentagon should open all of its files to independent journalists. I call for a full accounting as soon as possible. Some are saying there's a cover-up in the military. I say it's time to put all the evidence out in the open.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I proudly stand today with fellow veterans as the House debates the most damaging, costly, and divisive course of U.S. military involvement since Vietnam. 
   At a naval station in California, I treated combat veterans returning home from Vietnam, many with severe physical and psychological wounds like PTSD and the effects of agent orange. After Vietnam, America swore there would never be another tragic military misadventure, but that is exactly what is happening in Iraq. 
   The American people want this Congress to end the war and to bring our soldiers home now, not 2 years from now at the end of this President's term. That is what the American people elected Democrats to do in November. 
   What we do this week is a miniscule little step. Step two will come when we get to appropriations next month. 
   We have to get out of Iraq. We have to get out now, not 2 years from now. We are killing them, they are killing us, and nothing is getting better. And the reasons we started this whole war have turned out to be false. The American people know this, and today they are watching our debate. They will judge our actions. 
   Getting U.S. soldiers out of Iraq has been my top priority since they were sent there 4 years ago under false pretenses. And the new claim by the President that escalating the war will reduce the violence is just another attempt to mislead the American people. It is a lot like Lyndon Johnson sending the bombers into Cambodia and Laos. They don't accept it. The American people don't accept it and they won't. 
   Those who claim we cannot leave Iraq without causing chaos ignore reality. 
   I ask to insert in the Record a piece by Retired Lieutenant General and Reagan administration NSA Director William Odom that decisively debunks this argument.  
   Victory Is Not an Option  
   The new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq starkly delineates the gulf that separates President Bush's illusions from the realities of the war. Victory, as the president sees it, requires a stable liberal democracy in Iraq that is pro-American. The NIE describes a war that has no chance of producing that result. In this critical respect, the NIE, the consensus judgment of all the U.S. intelligence agencies, is a declaration of defeat. 
   Its gloomy implications--hedged, as intelligence agencies prefer, in rubbery language that cannot soften its impact--put the intelligence community and the American public on the same page. The public awakened to the reality of failure in Iraq last year and turned the Republicans out of control of Congress to wake it up. But a majority of its members are still asleep, or only half-awake to their new writ to end the war soon. 
   Perhaps this is not surprising. Americans do not warm to defeat or failure, and our politicians are famously reluctant to admit their own responsibility for anything resembling those un-American outcomes. So they beat around the bush, wringing hands and debating ``nonbinding resolutions'' that oppose the president's plan to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq.  
   For the moment, the collision of the public's clarity of mind, the president's relentless pursuit of defeat and Congress's anxiety has paralyzed us. We may be doomed to two more years of chasing the mirage of democracy in Iraq and possibly widening the war to Iran. But this is not inevitable. A Congress, or a president, prepared to quit the game of ``who gets the blame'' could begin to alter American strategy in ways that will vastly improve the prospects of a more stable Middle East. 
   No task is more important to the well-being of the United States. We face great peril in that troubled region, and improving our prospects will be difficult. First of all, it will require, from Congress at least, public acknowledgment that the president's policy is based on illusions, not realities. There never has been any right way to invade and transform Iraq. Most Americans need no further convincing, but two truths ought to put the matter beyond question: 
   First, the assumption that the United States could create a liberal, constitutional democracy in Iraq defies just about everything known by professional students of the topic. Of the more than 40 democracies created since World War II, fewer than 10 can be considered truly ``constitutional''--meaning that their domestic order is protected by a broadly accepted rule of law, and has survived for at least a generation. None is a country with Arabic and Muslim political cultures. None has deep sectarian and ethnic fissures like those in Iraq. 
   Strangely, American political scientists whose business it is to know these things have been irresponsibly quiet. In the lead-up to the March 2003 invasion, neoconservative agitators shouted insults at anyone who dared to mention the many findings of academic research on how democracies evolve. They also ignored our own struggles over two centuries to create the democracy Americans enjoy today. Somehow Iraqis are now expected to create a constitutional order in a country with no conditions favoring it. 
   This is not to say that Arabs cannot become liberal democrats. When they immigrate to the United States, many do so quickly. But it is to say that Arab countries, as well as a large majority of all countries, find creating a stable constitutional democracy beyond their capacities. 
   Second, to expect any Iraqi leader who can hold his country together to be pro-American, or to share American goals, is to abandon common sense. It took the United States more than a century to get over its hostility toward British occupation. (In 1914, a majority of the public favored supporting Germany against Britain.) Every month of the U.S. occupation, polls have recorded Iraqis' rising animosity toward the United States. Even supporters of an American military presence say that it is acceptable temporarily and only to prevent either of the warring sides in Iraq from winning. Today the Iraqi government survives only because its senior members and their families live within the heavily guarded Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy and military command. 
   As Congress awakens to these realities--and a few members have bravely pointed them out--will it act on them? Not necessarily. Too many lawmakers have fallen for the myths that are invoked to try to sell the president's new war aims. Let us consider the most pernicious of them.

   The way things are supposed to happen in the House is you drop in a bill and it goes to committee, and you have hearings, and you have markups, and you work off the floor before you bring things to the floor. When the Republicans were in control, they never had committee hearings, they never had anybody come in, they never had any markups. It was all written in the Speaker's Office and brought to the Rules Committee and put out on the floor without any preparation. 
   This Congress is preparing issues that will be brought to the floor over the next several months. We are not asleep. We are just doing the regular order, which is going to committee. 
   In the Ways and Means Committee today we discussed global warming. There wasn't one single hearing in this House on global warming when the Republicans were in session, and yet it is the biggest issue facing this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, finally, grudgingly, the administration has agreed to talk to Syria and Iran about the civil war that is raging in Iraq. This should have happened at least 2 years ago, so why now? 
   Has the President finally concluded what many of us have said for a long time: That you cannot shoot your way to a peace in Iraq? That would be a hopeful sign, but it is doubtful since he continues to escalate the U.S. presence in the middle of a civil war. 
   The apparent movement towards diplomacy comes at a curious time. The American people told their government last November to get their soldiers out of harm's way when they gave the Democrats a 2-year contract on the majority. And it didn't take long for this House to make a down payment on rebuilding trust with the American people. 
   Despite repeated Presidential claims that meant nothing, the overwhelming passage of Speaker Pelosi's first step in getting U.S. soldiers out of harm's way was the shot heard round the world. 
   No one wants to move faster than me in getting the soldiers out of Iraq. But every journey starts with a single step, and we have done it. 
   The American people and other nations welcomed the Speaker's leadership in getting this country to begin to set a new course in Iraq based on a reality, and not based on the same old rhetoric from the White House. They continue to bluster; so what else is new? 
   There are serious mainstream Middle East leaders who believe the U.S. policy has more to do with extraction than engagement. By extraction, they don't mean U.S. soldiers being extracted out of harm's way, they are referring to extracting Iraq's oil. 
   The Asia Times yesterday published two commentaries that are reverberating throughout the Middle East. One is called, ``U.S.'s Iraq Oil Grab is a Done Deal.'' And the other is entitled: ``Big Oil In, Stability Out Under New Iraqi Law.'' I will include the two articles for the Record. 
   As many articles in recent days have pointed out, the President's representatives in Iraq used intense pressure behind the scenes to get the Iraq government to take the first step in making production-sharing agreements, PSAs, the law of Iraq. There are scenarios in which investment and production will be a benefit to the Iraq people, but the Iraq people have to be solely in charge. As it stands, and as many fear, the  PSA language approved over the weekend could indenture Iraq's oil wealth to U.S. oil interests for decades to come. 
   As passed by the Iraq parliament, a new centralized government agency in Iraq, closely tied to the U.S., would have ultimate control over who gets access to Iraq's vast oil resources. 
   The oil industry itself says it costs one single dollar to extract a barrel of oil in Iraq, but that barrel brings $60 today on the world market. How does big oil, closely aligned to the President and Vice President, spell conservation? It is spelled I-R-A-Q. 
   Here is the U.S.-Iraq equation as seen by people from the Middle East: Billions of barrels of oil, billions of dollars in profits, dozens of U.S. military bases across Iraq, and thousands of U.S. soldiers remaining in Iraq. 
   The bottom line is this: Is the President hoping Iraq will import democracy, or will it export oil under the thumb of U.S. oil interests? 
   The production-sharing agreements have not yet been enacted into law. The outcome is still uncertain. But one thing is certain, production-sharing agreements that favor the U.S. means the U.S. will be in Iraq for decades. The President has expressed a new found interest in diplomacy. 
   Are we going to negotiate with Iran at the same time we push for PSA agreements to become law? A lot of people in the Middle East wonder. The U.S. needs to state its intentions if there is any hope for a diplomatic solution in Iraq. 
   We not only need to extract U.S. soldiers from Iraq, we also need to extract U.S. oil interests from dictating the oil future for the Iraqi people. The deeper the U.S. goes in influencing the distribution of Iraq oil wealth, the more we inflame the tensions and suspicions about why we invaded Iraq in the first place. 
   Remember weapons of mass destruction and Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and democracy? Now it becomes clear what it is really all about: Getting control of Iraq oil. 
   Madam Speaker, we have got to have the President come clean. Perhaps he will do a White House speech on this.  
   U.S.'s Iraq Oil Grab Is a Done Deal  
   ``By 2010 we will need [a further] 50 million barrels a day. The Middle East, with two-thirds of the oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize lies.''--U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, then Halliburton chief executive officer, London, autumn 1999. 
   U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney might as well declare the Iraq war over and out. As far as they--and the humongous energy interests they defend--are concerned, only now is the mission really accomplished. More than half a trillion dollars spent and perhaps half a million Iraqis killed have come down to this. 
   On Monday, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's cabinet in Baghdad approved the draft of the new Iraqi oil law. The government regards it as ``a major national project''. The key point of the law is that Iraq's immense oil wealth (115 billion barrels of proven reserves, third in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iran) will be under the iron rule of a fuzzy ``Federal Oil and Gas Council'' boasting ``a panel of oil experts from inside and outside Iraq''. That is, nothing less than predominantly U.S. Big Oil executives. 
   The law represents no less than institutionalized raping and pillaging of Iraq's oil wealth. It represents the death knell of nationalized (from 1972 to 1975) Iraqi resources, now replaced by production sharing agreements (PSAs)--which translate into savage privatization and monster profit rates of up to 75% for (basically U.S.) Big Oil. Sixty-five of Iraq's roughly 80 oilfields already known will be offered for Big Oil to exploit. As if this were not enough, the law reduces in practice the role of Baghdad to a minimum. Oil wealth, in theory, will be distributed directly to Kurds in the north, Shi'ites in the south and Sunnis in the center. For all practical purposes, Iraq will be partitioned into three statelets. Most of the country's reserves are in the Shi'ite-dominated south, while the Kurdish north holds the best prospects for future drilling. 
   The approval of the draft law by the fractious 275-member Iraqi Parliament, in March, will be a mere formality. Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister, is beaming. So is dodgy Barnham Salih: a Kurd, committed cheerleader of the U.S. invasion and occupation, then deputy prime minister, big PSA fan, and head of a committee that was debating the law. 
   But there was not much to be debated. The law was in essence drafted, behind locked doors, by a U.S. consulting firm hired by the Bush administration and then carefully retouched by Big Oil, the International Monetary Fund, former U.S. deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz' World Bank, and the United States Agency for International Development. It's virtually a U.S. law (its original language is English, not Arabic). 
   Scandalously, Iraqi public opinion had absolutely no knowledge of it--not to mention the overwhelming majority of Parliament members. Were this to be a truly representative Iraqi government, any change to the legislation concerning the highly sensitive question of oil wealth would have to be approved by a popular referendum. 
   In real life, Iraq's vital national interests are in the hands of a small bunch of highly impressionable (or downright corrupt) technocrats. Ministries are no more than political party feuds; the national interest is never considered, only private, ethnic and sectarian interests. Corruption and theft are endemic. Big Oil will profit handsomely--and long-term, 30 years minimum, with fabulous rates of return--from a former developing-world stalwart methodically devastated into failed-state status. 
   In these past few weeks, U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad has been crucial in mollifying the Kurds. In the end, in practice, the pro-U.S. Kurds will have all the power to sign oil contracts with whatever companies they want. Sunnis will be more dependent on the Oil Ministry in Baghdad. And Shi'ites will be more or less midway between total independence in the south and Baghdad's dictum (which they control anyway). But the crucial point remains: nobody will sign anything unless the ``advisers'' at the U.S.-manipulated Federal Oil and Gas Council say so. 
   Nobody wants to colonial-style PSAs forced down their throat anymore. According to the International Energy Agency, PSAs apply to only 12% of global oil reserves, in cases where costs are very high and nobody knows what will be found (certainly not the Iraqi case). No big Middle Eastern oil producer works with PSAs. Russia and Venezuela are renegotiating all of them. Bolivia nationalized its gas. Algeria and Indonesia have new rules for future contracts. But Iraq, of course, is not a sovereign country. 
   Big Oil is obviously ecstatic--not only ExxonMobil, but also ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell (which have collected invaluable info on two of Iraq's biggest oilfields), TotalFinaElf, Lukoil from Russia and the Chinese majors. Iraq has as many as 70 undeveloped fields--``small'' ones hold a minimum of a billion barrels. As desert western Iraq has not even been exploited, reserves may reach 300 billion barrels--way more than Saudi Arabia. Gargantuan profits under the PSA arrangement are in a class by themselves. Iraqi oil costs only US$1 a barrel to extract. With a barrel worth $60 and up, happy days are here again. 
   What revenue the regions do get will be distributed to all 18 provinces based on population size--an apparent concession to the Sunnis, whose central areas have relatively few proven reserves. 
   The Sunni Arab muqawama (resistance) certainly has other ideas--as in future rolling thunder against pipelines, refineries and Western personnel. Iraq's oil independence will not go down quietly--at least among Sunnis. On the same day the oil law was being approved, a powerful bomb at the Ministry of Municipalities killed at least 12 people and injured 42, including Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi. Mahdi has always been a feverish supporter of the oil law. He's a top official of the Shi'ite party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution of Iraq (SCIRI). 
   A whole case can be made of SCIRI delivering Iraq's Holy Grail to Bush/Cheney and Big Oil--in exchange for not being chased out of power by the Pentagon. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the SCIRI's leader, is much more of a Bush ally than Maliki, who is from the Da'wa Party. No wonder SCIRI's Badr Organization and their death squads were never the target of Washington's wrath--unlike Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army (Muqtada is fiercely against the oil law). The SCIRI certainly listened to the White House, which has always made it very clear: any more funds to the Iraqi government are tied up with passing the oil law. 
   Bush and Cheney got their oily cake--and they will eat it, too (or be drenched in its glory). Mission accomplished: permanent, sprawling military bases on the eastern flank of the Arab nation and control of some of largest, untapped oil wealth on the planet--a key geostrategic goal of the New American Century. Now it's time to move east, bomb Iran, force regime change and--what else?--force PSAs down their Persian throats.   
   Big Oil In, Stability Out Under New Iraqi Law  
   While debate rages in the United States about the military in Iraq, an equally important decision is being made inside Iraq--the future of its oil. A draft Iraqi law proposes to open the country's currently nationalized oil system to foreign corporate control. But emblematic of the flawed promotion of ``democracy'' by the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush, this new law is news to most Iraqi politicians. 
   A leaked copy of the proposed hydrocarbon law appeared on the Internet at the same time that it was introduced to the Iraqi Council of Ministers (cabinet). The law is expected to go to the Iraqi Council of Representatives within weeks. Yet the Internet version was the first look that most members of Iraq's Parliament had of the new law. 
   Many Iraqi oil experts, such as Fouad al-Ameer, who was responsible for the leak,  think this law is not an urgent item on the country's agenda. Other observers and analysis share Ameer's views and believe the Bush administration, foreign oil companies and the International Monetary Fund are rushing the Iraqi government to pass the law. 
   Not every aspect of the law is harmful to Iraq. However, the current language favors the interests of foreign oil corporations over the economic security and development of Iraq. The law's key negative components harm Iraq's national sovereignty, financial security, territorial integrity and democracy. 
   The new oil law gives foreign corporations access to almost every sector of Iraq's oil and natural-gas industry. This includes service contracts on existing fields that are already being developed and that are managed and operated by the Iraqi National Oil Co (INOC). 
   For fields that have already been discovered, but not yet developed, the proposed law stipulates that INOC will have to be a partner on these contracts. But for as-yet-undiscovered fields, neither INOC nor private Iraqi companies receive preference in new exploration and development. Foreign companies have full access to these contracts. 
   The exploration and production contracts give firms exclusive control of fields for up to 35 years, including contracts that guarantee profits for 25 years. A foreign company, if hired, is not required to partner with an Iraqi company or reinvest any of its money in the Iraqi economy. It's not obligated to hire Iraqi workers, train Iraqi workers or transfer technology. 
   The current law remains silent on the type of contracts that the Iraqi government can use. The law establishes a new Iraqi Federal Oil and Gas Council with ultimate decisionmaking authority over the types of contracts that will be employed. This council will include, among others, ``executive managers from important related petroleum companies''. Thus it is possible that foreign oil-company executives could sit on the council. It would be unprecedented for a sovereign country to have, for instance, an executive of ExxonMobil on the board of its key oil-and-gas decision-making body. 
   The law also does not appear to restrict foreign corporate executives from making decisions on their own contracts. Nor does there appear to be a ``quorum'' requirement. Thus if only five members of the Federal Oil and Gas Council met--one from ExxonMobil, Shell, ChevronTexaco and two Iraqis--the foreign company representatives would apparently be permitted to approve contacts for themselves. 
   Under the proposed law, the council has the ultimate power and authority to approve and rewrite any contract using whichever model it prefers if a ``two-thirds majority of the members in attendance'' agree. Early drafts of the bill, and the proposed model by the US, advocate very unfair, and unconventional for Iraq, models such as production sharing agreements (PSAs), which would set long-term contracts with unfair conditions that may lead to the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of the Iraqi oil money as profits to foreign companies. 
   The council will also decide the fate of the existing exploration and production contracts already signed with the French, Chinese and Russians, among others. 
   The law does not clarify who ultimately controls production levels. The contractee--the INOC, foreign or domestic firms--appears to have the right to determine levels of production. However, a clause reads, ``In the event that, for national policy considerations, there is a need to introduce limitations on the national level of petroleum production, such limitations shall be applied in a fair and equitable manner and on a pro rata basis for each contract area on the basis of approved field-development plans.'' The clause does not indicate who makes this decision, what a ``fair and equitable manner'' means, or how it is enforced. If foreign companies, rather than the Iraqi government, ultimately have control over production levels, then Iraq's relationship to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other similar organizations would be deeply threatened. 
   Many Iraqi oil experts are already referring to the draft law as the ``Split Iraq Fund'', arguing that it facilitates plans for splitting Iraq into three ethnic/religious regions. The experts believe that the law undermines the central government and shifts important decision-making and responsibilities to the regional entities. This shift could serve as the foundation for establishing three new independent states, which is the goal of a number of separatist leaders. 
   The law opens the possibility of the regions taking control of Iraq's oil, but it also maintains the possibility of the central government retaining control. In fact, the law was written in a vague manner to help ensure passage, a ploy reminiscent of the passage of the Iraqi constitution. There is a significant conflict between the Bush administration and others in Iraq who would like ultimate authority for Iraq's oil to rest with the central government and those who would like to see the nation split in three. Both groups are powerful in Iraq. Both groups have been mollified, for now, to ensure the law's passage. 
   But two very different outcomes are possible. If the central government remains the ultimate decision-making authority in Iraq, then the Iraq Federal Oil and Gas Council will exercise power over the regions. And if the regions emerge as the strongest power in Iraq, then the council could simply become a silent rubber stamp, enforcing the will of the regions. The same lack of clarity exists in Iraq's constitution. 
   The daily lives of most people in Iraq are overwhelmed with meeting basic needs. They are unaware of the details and full nature of the oil law shortly to be considered in Parliament. Their parliamentarians, in turn, have not been included in the debate over the law and were unable even to read the draft until it was leaked on the Internet. Those Iraqis able to make their voices heard on the oil law want more time. They urge postponing a decision until Iraqis have their own sovereign state without a foreign occupation. 
   Passing this oil law while the political future of Iraq is unclear can only further the existing schisms in the Iraqi government. Forcing its passage will achieve nothing more than an increase in the levels of violence, anger and instability in Iraq and a prolongation of the US occupation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Thank you, Mr. Larson. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the importance of two provisions in the bill before us, which relate to how the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI program, treats military families and others who desire to serve this Nation. Under current law, some military families lose part of their SSI benefits because a portion of their compensation is counted as unearned income. Under current rules, the amount of unearned income a disabled person receives reduces their SSI benefits. H.R. 3997 would stop treating military families this way, which occurs because of a kink in the law. 
   A similar inequity occurs with respect to AmeriCorps volunteers. For purposes of determining SSI benefits, current law provides disparate treatment to volunteers who are disabled. In some cases, these would-be volunteers would experience a loss or reduction of their SSI benefits if they choose to serve their community, despite their disability, through AmeriCorps. This only occurs because of an oversight in the statute, and the HEART Act corrects it, removing an important barrier to service. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, it's important that the bill that the President signs includes these provisions. With the SSI corrections included, H.R. 3997 says to American families that a Nation blessed by your service and sacrifice is one that will treat you fairly and justly.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (ANGLO-IRAQI TREATY OF 1930 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the reports out of Iraq these days make 2008 sound an awful lot like 1930. That's when the British strong-armed a so-called treaty to take control of Iraq's oil wealth. And it remained that way for decades until the people in the Middle East nationalized their oil wealth to end outside control. But western oil interests and the neocons have wanted it back ever since. 
   War Secretary Donald Rumsfeld may have said that invading Iraq had nothing to do with oil, but the announcement that western oil companies would get what they have lusted for says otherwise. 
   And editorial cartoonist Rob Tornoe of politicker.com summed up the world view the other day in a cartoon displayed right here next to me. He spoke truth to power with one compelling image. He says all at once that this entire war, its tragic casualties and immense cost, was all about oil. 
   As so many suspected all along, Secretary of State Rice tried to claim that the U.S. Government played no role whatsoever in securing sweetheart oil deals for Iraq's sweet crude oil. But the New York Times reported in a front page story, ``A group of American advisers led by a small State Department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the Iraq Government and five major western oil companies.'' 
   The immense oil reserves beneath Iraq are the world's second largest, and western oil companies want them, just as they did 78 years ago. And like 1930, they plan to permanently occupy Iraq. To remove any doubt from the minds of the American people, I would like to enter into the Record the entire Angelo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 
   Let's look at Article 5. It says that maintaining order inside Iraq is the primary responsibility of the Iraq Government. But then it immediately says that Iraq recognizes and accepts Britain's role inside Iraq and grants Britain the right to build air bases and maintain military forces inside Iraq. 
   That is exactly what the President and this administration has been saying all along. 
   The President has made it clear he wants the U.S. to stay in Iraq permanently. In 1930, they didn't call it occupation, they called it a treaty. And they are doing it all over again. 
   Here's another example. The Angelo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 addresses immunity for British forces and unlimited rights to bases and troop movements. And this administration is doing the same thing. People like Jonathan Schwartz on the Web site democrats.com, Internet sites like After Downing Street and newspapers like the Independent have all examined the 1930 document and compared it to current proposals. They conclude the date is different and it is now the U.S. instead of the British Empire. 
   Seventy-eight years later, the West is again trying to assume control of the Middle East under the guise of protecting them from themselves. In 2003, Donald Rumsfeld addressed U.S. troops in Baghdad and said, ``Unlike other armies in the world, you come not to conquer, not to occupy, but to liberate.'' 
   In 1917, British General Stanley Maude, addressing Iraqis in Baghdad, said, ``Our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors, but as liberators.'' The only new thing this administration added was that our soldiers would be greeted by flowers. We know that was not true, just as we know the entire basis for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was not true. 
   When the Prime Minister of Iraq the other day said that he wants a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces, the President said no, he wants Americans in Iraq indefinitely. 
   The calendar may say 2008, but this administration is acting like it's 1930 all over again. A journalist has just summed it up in a cartoon. There lies Saddam, and the new statue will be the logos of our five favorite oil companies. 
   If we ignore the lessons of history, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of history. 
   The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 
   Treaty of Alliance between His Majesty in respect of the United Kingdom and His Majesty the King of Iraq. Signed at Baghdad, June 30, 1930. 
   His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King of Iraq, whereas they desire to consolidate the friendship and to maintain and perpetuate the relations of good understanding between their respective countries; and Whereas His Britannic Majesty undertook in the Treaty of Alliance signed at Baghdad on the thirteenth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six of the Christian Era, corresponding to the twenty-eighth day of Jamadi-al-Ukhra, one thousand three hundred and forty-four, Hijrah, that he would take into active consideration at successive intervals of four years the question whether it was possible for him to press for the admission of Iraq into the League of Nations; and 
   Whereas His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland informed the Iraq Government without qualification or proviso on the fourteenth day of September, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine that they were prepared to support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two and announced to the Council of the League on the fourth day of November, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, that this was their intention; and 
   Whereas the mandatory responsibilities accepted by His Britannic Majesty in respect of Iraq will automatically terminate upon the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations; and whereas His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq consider that the relations which will subsist between them as independent sovereigns should be defined by the conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance and Amity: 
   Have agreed to conclude a new Treaty for this purpose on terms of complete freedom, equality and independence which will become operative upon the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations, and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries: 
   His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, for Great Britain and Northern Ireland: Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Henry Humphrys, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, High Commissioner of His Britannic Majesty in Iraq; and

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, yesterday the White House said that political strategist Karl Rove and former appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court Harriet Miers would be made available to the Senate for an interview regarding the growing U.S. Attorneys scandal. However, the White House refused to allow them to testify under oath or in public. 
   Is the White House serious? Do they honestly believe this Congress will allow them to get away with this? 
   It would be one thing if the Bush administration had been completely honest with the Congress over the last month, but every day there are new details that completely contradict what was said the day before. 
   Last month, Attorney General Gonzales said there was no coordination between the Justice Department and the White House in the firing of the eight U.S. Attorneys. But we now know that Karl Rove and Harriet Miers were involved from the very beginning. 
   The administration has stalled and deceived at every step during this investigation. With that track record, why should this administration believe the Congress would agree to unacceptable secret testimony without being under oath?

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, probably I knew Jack better than most in our delegation, because I did serve with him for a long time in the Washington State Legislature. And although  most Members would know me as somewhat liberal and Jack as being somewhat conservative, we were really good friends, because Jack was the kind of person you could sit down and talk to, and no matter what your political views were, he would sit and talk about whatever it was on your mind. 
   He told me a lot about his decisions to run for both the legislature and for the U.S. Senate, and he told me about how his first campaign worked. 
   Jack went out and planted a whole field full of pumpkins, and he took an instrument that was like a cookie cutter and had it made in his name, Jack Metcalf. He took all these pumpkins when they were small and scored them on the outside, and as the pumpkins grew, the name ``Metcalf'' appeared on the pumpkins. So by the time of the election, Jack went around and gave a pumpkin to every house in his district. 
   That is Jack Metcalf. That is the guy that was here, very unassuming, no airs about him whatsoever. He was a solid conservative, don't have any doubt about that, and he stuck to his principles. He was the kind of conservative you could talk to and find out what he thought. He would tell you exactly where he was, and that is where he was. You could try to convince him, and maybe it would work. 
   I had one experience with Jack which I have to tell about. I was the ways and means chairman of the State senate when Jack was there in the minority, and I had a bill that I needed an extra vote on. I needed somebody in the Republican Party. So I went over and I talked to Jack about it. 
   He listened to me and acknowledged that maybe that wasn't such a bad idea. But he was really concerned about the economic situation of the United States, and he really thought that we ought to be on the gold standard. So Jack and I had this long discussion about the gold standard, and I said, ``You know, Jack, we ought to have a hearing in the State senate on the gold standard.'' 
   Well, as you might guess, this would have been about 1983, the gold standard wasn't exactly very high on most people's agenda, but we had a hearing, and we listened and we talked and we asked the questions and had a great long discussion about this issue, and a few days later, when I needed a vote, Jack was there. 
   That is the kind of person he was. He was somebody who would listen to you, he would tell you what he was concerned about; and if you listened to him, you made a friend, and you were able to work with him. 
   His wife and kids, I know, perhaps tonight are watching. You should have nothing but pride for your father and your husband. 
   They list all the bills that he got involved in. Jack was a very, very dedicated environmentalist and did many things here. But what will always remain will be he was a guy who came here and said, I believe in term limits; he served 6 years, and he left. No fuss, no muss. He didn't ask anybody. He had made a commitment to his people in 1994 that he would leave, and he did surely as soon as the time came. 
   So we will miss Jack. He is the kind of person that makes this place a really humane place. Jack I don't think had an enemy in this place, because, as Norm says, even if he was going to say something against you, he would either before or after come and talk to you about it and say, ``I didn't mean that personally, but I just think you are wrong on that matter.'' He had that way, and we would do well to have that spirit come back to this House. 
   We will miss you, Jack.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his dedication to this issue and pushing it at all the meetings so we finally got it on the floor one last time. 
   For the last 2 weeks we have been talking about Wall Street, but it is time to turn our attention to Main Street, to all the decent, hardworking people who play by the rules but lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 
   Our economy has lost jobs for the last 9 months in a row, including 10 million Americans now unemployed and unable to find work. Today we got the figures and found out last month the economy lost 159,000 jobs. That is the biggest 1-month job loss in more than 5 years. In my home State of Washington, the unemployment rate has increased by nearly 30 percent over just the last 5 months. 
   Today we face a simple choice: Are we going to help these workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, or are we going to sit on the sideline and watch them suffer? This bill says we can and we must help. 
   The legislation provides another 7 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every State, plus an additional 13 weeks in high unemployment States who have more than 6 percent. This assistance will not cost a penny, because it really comes from the unemployment trust funds that we have already collected. 
   Our economy has lost 760,000 jobs this year, nearly 1 million more workers have joined the ranks of unemployment since Congress provided the last extension of unemployment benefits in June, and the number of States with high unemployment has doubled. If we don't act today, nearly 800,000 Americans will exhaust their benefits in the next few weeks. Even if you don't care about how these people feed their families, at least consider how much the economy will deteriorate if they stop buying goods and services. 
   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote to extend unemployment benefits for people who are suffering in this country.  
   I reserve my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to say it has been a pleasure to work with Jerry Weller. On a committee like this where you have contentious issues, he has been a great supporter as we have worked on child welfare issues and on foster children issues and unemployment issues, and it has been a real pleasure. I hope I get a ranking member to replace you that is half as good as you were. 
   I think that this bill that is out here may be in my view a little bit late. I wanted to put an amendment on the bailout bill that included the stimulus package, because I really think that we should be doing more for people on Main Street.     
   I think the people at home are angry in many respects because they think we don't understand the pain of what the average citizen in this country is feeling, and they feel like we are giving help to some people that perhaps don't deserve it or don't need it or whatever, and we are ignoring the people who really needed it. 
   The acceptance by the leadership of putting this bill up here at the end, I am pleased by that. I only hope that the Senate is listening because, Madam Speaker, some of those people are going to go home to States that we just saw mapped that are red. That means they have more than 6 percent unemployed. We have 19 States in this country where there is more than 6 percent unemployment. 
   For people to go out and run for reelection and say I didn't have time to stay and pass an unemployment bill wouldn't seem to me like a good campaign strategy. So I hope that this will become legislation that passes this House, the other House, and is ultimately signed by the President. 
   The people who lose their jobs in this country are real people. They are people who go to work every day, and one day they come in, like those who had a meeting in Seattle yesterday where they told the 4,300 people who are working at Washington Mutual that they will find out whether they have their job on the 1st of December. They are going to get their Christmas present by decision of the folks who bought Washington Mutual as to whether they are employed or not. No fault of theirs. Those are real people for whom this bill is a little bit of help to get them over, hopefully, a chasm so that they can reach the other side and get another job. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill. It is a piece of legislation that I am sure the Senate is going to want to deal with.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday morning, the morning after the Senate passed a very different bailout bill, two things happened: The filings for new unemployment benefits hit a 7-year high, and a number of telephones melted in my congressional office as my constituents called in their opinions. By the thousands, the people in the Seventh Congressional District are absolutely enraged by what the Senate put over here. 
   Senate Republicans blocked Senate Democrats from legislation that delivers for Main Street. Senate Republicans demanded the pot be sweetened, but they left out the millions of Americans who can't find a job and are running out of benefits. And they left out a lot of other Americans, too. 
   With economic times getting rougher by the day, Senate Republicans have no problem telling the American people you've got to go it alone. 
   Last week, the House passed on a strong bipartisan vote a stimulus package that would help Main Street, but Senate Republicans said no. They were willing to help Wall Street, but looked the other way for Main Street. 
   One caller said they were stunned that the Senate included a call for the Securities and Exchange Commission to alter a fundamental way assets are valued. It's called mark-to-market accounting, and let me quote an NPR report. 
   The Council of Institutional Investors and the CFA Institute oppose a suspension of mark-to-market--also known as ``fair value''--accounting because, in their opinion, the rule offers investors transparency. 
   In other words, suspending the rule is letting the fox into the henhouse. 
   The other day I voted in favor of the House bailout bill because I trusted Democratic leaders who worked tirelessly to represent Main Street. I still do, but Senate Republicans changed all that. 
   When Republicans force a bill that ignores the plight of regular Americans but includes so-called sweeteners, that is not worthy of support. 
   When Republicans force a bill that slips in more earmark spending, that's not worthy of support. 
   When Republicans force a bill through that includes an accounting gimmick, that is not worthy of support. 
   The Senate dug an enormous ditch alongside Main Street, and they want the House to drive into it. That is exactly what the President has driven this economy into over the last 7 years. 
   When Senate Republicans set the agenda, that's just another way of saying they are following the orders of the President who long ago lost all the trust of the American people. 
   That is not how we are going to restore the trust with the American people. And that is why I voted against the Senate Republican bailout.     
   There is no question that we need a rescue plan, but the Senate has just made matters worse, and that is pretty hard to do in this economy. Government has a role to play in calming the markets and addressing the economic crisis, but the more we learn, the more convinced I am the latest Senate plan is taking us in the wrong direction. 
   There are two models that have worked and which would serve as the foundation blocks that we can build upon in a short period of time to produce a plan that Americans could trust and believe in. During the Depression, President Roosevelt developed a Home Loan Housing Corporation that stabilized the housing market and helped homeowners work through the foreclosures. More recently, in the 1990s, Sweden stepped in and assumed temporary control of the financial system, cleaned up the mess, and then got out. 
   There are models available that we can use to quickly produce a solution that the American people will actually believe in because they will understand it and it will be transparent. The amendment from the Senate was to make it more un-transparent. There is a credit crisis in the United States to be sure, but there is no question today that there is also a trust crisis in America, every bit as damaging and debilitating. 
   We cannot solve the first crisis before we address the second. Since the current administration precipitated this, we should be focused on rebuilding a new foundation for a new administration to restore the faith and trust of the American people as we work to restore the trust and credit of our financial system.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today is an historic day. Along with others, I have labored for a very long time to produce a comprehensive mental health parity bill. Without a doubt, our actions today will benefit real people in real ways. Many times we come to the floor to debate and vote on legislation that many Americans may wonder what is the relevance or the purpose? No one who has suffered a mental illness or has watched a family member suffer a mental illness will ask what is the relevance? 
   As a doctor and psychiatrist, I want to emphasize to my colleagues that this bill will make a genuine difference in the lives of the American people we serve. I know the suffering of mental illness. Not only do many patients still face the stigma of mental illness, but they also face discrimination in coverage. 
   Most Americans would be outraged if they heard that health plans charged higher co-payments for cancer treatments or limited hospitals stays for those with heart diseases or denied care for diabetes. We would all be outraged. But, that is what we allow for mental illness. 
   We have heard a great deal about the costs of requiring mental health parity. What we hear very little about is the cost of not providing mental health parity. Many untreated mental illnesses can metastasize into serious physical and costly illnesses. Untreated depressions can result in heart disease. An untreated eating disorder can result in kidney failure. Yet, had we treated the mental illness we could have saved millions of dollars in costly care. 
   The issue of increasing costs of insurance is simply and categorically false. We know from the FEHBP experience that mental health parity has not resulted in significant costs. In fact, CBO has reported that H.R. 1424 would increase premiums by just two tenths of one percent. I would argue the longer term savings would offset any increase in premiums and that we will see a savings. 
   Access to mental health is simply access to quality primary care. It's key to preventing disease and improving outcomes. It simply makes no sense to treat the brain differently than the kidney or lungs or heart. 
   We have also heard a great deal about the use of the DSM-IV and scope of coverage. The use of DSM-IV is a tool for diagnosing mental illness and ensures that doctors, not insurance companies, define a mental illness. Some of my colleagues have argued that the use of DSM-IV will mean that plans must cover jet lag. These are not DSM diagnoses and refer to V Codes and not developed for the DSM. 
   My colleagues also argue that the use of the DSM-IV will prohibit plans from medical management. Again, my colleagues are wrong. As a practitioner, let me assure you that diagnosing and treating illness are very different things. Treatments can and will still be subject to medical necessity, like any other illness. 
   I think it is important for me to correct the record. Many of the speakers who addressed the House today are not health care professionals and have little understanding of mental illness. Yet, they claim to be experts on diagnosing and treating mental illness. 
   Finally, let me say a few words about the physician ownership offset. Just a couple of weeks ago, the administration sent to the Congress the Medicare 45 percent trigger recommendations. We have heard over and over again that Medicare spending is not sustainable and we need radical reforms. Yet, when we offer a small reform measure that will save more than $2 billion over 10 years, and protect patients from unnecessary care, some Members come to the floor to oppose. In fact, they argue that this physician ownership issue reduces choice or access. Who chooses to spend $2 billion more? 
   I understand that there may be some clinics that are providing quality care and we need to work to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are not denied access. But, let's remember what we are doing. This is about closing a loophole to limit physician ownership of medical facilities to reduce over utilization and protect full service community hospitals. Many of these physician owned facilities do not staff an emergency department or an ICU. This is about protecting the integrity of the Medicare program. This is about controlling Medicare spending. 
   I strongly support H.R. 1424. Let's end this inhumane practice of discriminating against those with a mental illness. Let's make sure that when families pay premiums for health insurance coverage that they have the right to medically necessary coverage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today I will vote ``Present'' on H. Res. 951. 
   Its stated purpose is ``condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and for other purposes.'' Everyone in this House, including me, condemns these rocket attacks. If that had been all that H. Res. 951 expressed, of course I would vote in favor. 
   But as so often happens in resolutions that concern matters of bipartisan and overwhelming support, vague and ill-considered ``other purposes'' were added. The United States needs the cooperation and involvement of nations throughout the region, including Syria and Iran, if we are to help bring about a stable and lasting peace to Lebanon, Iraq, and to help crack down on the very smuggling that is enabling these rocket attacks. 
   The State Department has repeatedly met with representatives of Iran and Syria to engage them, and is pursuing difficult diplomatic tracks with both countries. I applaud these efforts and recognize the difficult job State has. Injecting Congress into this mix, as expressed in this Resolution, at this point in time, is not helpful. 
   By not simply condemning the rocket attacks coming from Gaza and declaring our solidarity with the Israeli civilians threatened by them, by not simply condemning those in Gaza who are bombarding Israeli civilians, but drawing in the governments of Iran and Syria, we could diminish our diplomatic course and, at the same time, inflame tensions. 
   Who does this help? How does this contribute to resolving problems in the region? Why did a House vote on what should have been a simple statement turn into a complicated effort to add to difficulties with Iran and Syria? 
   I strongly condemn these rocket attacks; let there be no doubt about that. At the same time, I strongly support our State Department and its efforts to find a path to a lasting peace in the region. Let's not do anything that might interfere with that difficult yet vital goal.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, as we enter this period when the President is going to come before us and ask us to extend the surge in Iraq, we ought to hear the story of Jamie Dean. 
   Jamie Dean was a 29-year-old who came from Hollywood, Maryland. He enlisted and served 4 years, including 1 year in Afghanistan where he cleaned out caves and did all of the tough things that went on there. He came home severely depressed, suffering from PTSD, was being treated at the Veterans Hospital after being honorably discharged from the United States Army. 
   And then he got the letter. On November 26, he received a letter that said pursuant to Executive Order of 14 September 2001, you are relieved from your present reserve component status and are ordered to report to duty. He was going to be sent within 2 months into Iraq, a man who is suffering from PTSD. 
   This man broke. He started to drink. He had weapons holed up in his home. The day after Christmas, he was surrounded by the police and was shot dead. 
   We are breaking the Army. We are breaking the Marines. These people should be thought about when we consider the extension.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the brave men and women who are in harm's way right now serving and defending America should not be subjected to unfair taxes or barriers to assistance. But that is exactly what is happening today, and this legislation will change that for members of the military and others serving our Nation, for instance, in AmeriCorps. 
   Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel recognized the burden being placed on our heroes and included provisions that will alter over a dozen tax provisions and remove barriers to other benefit programs for military families. It's the least we can do for those who do so much for us. The chairman, a veteran, and I, also a veteran, are proud to bring legislation to the floor that demonstrates the House fully and fairly supports our soldiers. 
   For instance, there are provisions in the legislation that improve how the Supplemental Security Income, or SSI program, treats military families, veterans, and those who have served our country. Under current law, some military families lose part of their SSI benefits because a portion of their compensation is counted as unearned income. This bill would stop that unfair treatment. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change alone would affect about 3,000 military families with disabled children. In addition to helping military families, the legislation would ensure that AmeriCorps volunteers do not unfairly lose their SSI benefits. More specifically, the bill would prevent allowances provided to AmeriCorps participants from reducing SSI benefits. 
   On the tax side, the chairman included an initiative that Mr. Van Hollen and I proposed that would remove an obstacle for some Americans who serve in the Peace Corps. This provision ensures that overseas service by Peace Corps volunteers does not arbitrarily remove the exclusion for capital gains tax on a principal residence. This protection is similar to one already provided to Americans working for the Foreign Service. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of these provisions aim to ensure that service to our Nation does not disadvantage those who serve.

Res. 1185) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress should recognize the important contributions of Americans who serve as foster parents and, in doing so, unselfishly open their homes and family lives to children in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING FOSTER PARENTS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, every day another 850 American children enter foster care. If you go outside and walk along the Mall today, you will see cardboard cutouts of children. Another 850 representations will be added each day this week to help us all understand who are at risk and what is at stake. The fact is, most people are unaware of how many children are in foster care right now and how many more will be in foster care tomorrow. My hope is that the image of those cardboard cutouts will be so compelling that America will take and demand action. 
   As the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the foster care system, I want the House to make this issue as important as the children we need to help. Each child in this Nation deserves nothing less than a safe, loving home with a caregiver who ensures their physical and emotional well-being, supports their dreams in life and helps them become healthy and happy adults. For over a half a million children in our Nation, that home is not with their biological parents. Instead, the nurturing environment is found in the homes of foster families, who temporarily support a child until that child can either be safely returned to their biological parents or moved to a permanent home. 
   What I just described in a few words doesn't begin to cover the heroic actions by Americans on behalf of foster children, so we are here today to mark the month of May as National Foster Care Month. It is a designation reserved for heroes, and there are hundreds of thousands of American heroes to be noticed and thanked. They are the people who open their homes and their hearts to children who are seeking sanctuary when they are no longer able to live safely in their homes. These people are the safety net for these children, the difference between hope and disaster. 
   National Foster Care Month also recognizes the unsung heroes who work in the foster care system itself, these individuals who dedicate their lives to improving the well-being of children who are under the care of the State. Many of these dedicated people work for relatively little salary, with limited resources, and often face very dangerous situations. They do it because they care, and we are grateful. 
   There isn't anything partisan about ensuring the safety and well-being of children. We either meet our responsibility to protect these children, or we don't.     
   Lives indeed hang in the balance. That is why Congress must work together to improve our Nation's foster care system and to fully support these children, including those who age out of the foster care system each year and their caretakers, which includes grandparents and other relatives. It is up to us to ensure that the educational, medical, and emotional needs of foster children are met. It is up to us to make sure they know they are not alone. In truth, their outcomes in life are linked to our ability to guarantee that the State has the resources to provide these children with the assistance they need. 
   Foster children should have the same opportunities in life that our other children have. It is up to us to guarantee that our Federal programs support that basic right. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing May 2008 as National Foster Care Month. We salute the tireless work of foster care parents, case workers, court personnel, service providers, and advocates, many of whom are former foster children, for their commitment to supporting vulnerable children across this Nation. We must recommit ourselves to working to improve the foster care system because of the lives of innocent children who are at stake, and we have the power to make a difference. 
   I would like at this time to take one moment to recognize my colleague, Mr. Weller, who has been my ranking member on this subcommittee, and he and I have worked together hand in hand on this issue. This is not a partisan issue, and it has been a real pleasure to have Mr. Weller as my ranking member in this session of Congress. We have a bill coming which we hope this House will also approve at another time. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join with my colleague and friend John Lewis in fighting to do what is right for America's foster kids. 
   Every year, an estimated 24,000 foster kids reach their 18th birthday. Instead of a celebration, they hit a dead end. Try and remember what it was like when you were 18 years old. As it stands today for foster kids, the support system simply stops for those kids on the day at a point when they are not quite ready for everything they are going to face in the world. No place to live, no money for food, no money to go on for education, no place to live while they finish high school. All of those things are what face our youngsters in foster care today when they hit 18 in many States in this country. 
   Many of these children do not have access to critical support services like health care. If they are on medication, it ends that day.     
   They don't get the Medicaid, they don't get the coverage after that. There is no transition for these young people at all. Many are not connected to an adult who can serve as a mentor or someone who can be someone to get advice from when they go on. The system simply discards them. Not surprisingly, trouble can be the end result. Far too many become disconnected from the educational system and the labor force and become much of the homeless that we see on the streets of our city. Many of them wind up in our jails. 
   When the State removes a child from their biological parents because of abuse or neglect and places that child in foster care, we become the foster parents. Now, most of us did not have parents who threw us out on our own on the day we were 18. In fact, the whole boomerang idea of going back to your parents when you've been through college is very common in this country. We continue to have contact with our children when they're gone, after they're 18. Eighteen is not some magic date. And I believe a child in foster care deserves no less than anyone else's children. So we have some work to do to deliver on that promise, and we can take a big step by approving this bill.  
   Like many other young people, foster kids need the guidance and support of a caring adult that will last a lifetime. It's our job to make that happen. One way is to transition a child out of the system. We should make sure that when a child leaves foster care, they have a connection with someone, perhaps a lost sibling or some other relative that can be a source of love and support for them. Nurturing doesn't stop at 18, and if it continues, the odds for that foster kid doing well rise dramatically. 
   We should also provide a significant support system for these children after they become 18. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program was partly designed to fill this need. But additional supports are needed to provide these young people with skills and resources they need to become successful adults. It's time for Congress to follow suit and ensure that when a child leaves foster care they have an opportunity to prosper as an adult. 
   I thank Congressman Lewis for offering this important resolution, and urge my colleagues to support it and to work with us to strengthen our Nation's foster care system, so that young people who age out of the system are not thrown out of it but instead have the same opportunities that other kids have.

   When the President took over, gasoline was about $1.80 a gallon, and now it's $3.80 a gallon where I live. Now, that's an energy policy you could see developed in the White House by Mr. Cheney. He brought in all the oil company executives and said, how can we drive up the price of gasoline so you guys can make a whole lot of money? They had a secret meeting. They wouldn't tell anybody who was there. They wouldn't tell anybody what was talked about. They have been fighting in the courts for 8 years to keep from telling us what went on at that meeting at the beginning of the Bush administration. 
   We see the results. They got them, the biggest profits of the oil companies in history. And we tried to take a little $16 billion loophole and close it and use some of that money for alternative energy production and conservation and the President said, no way, we can't take anything away from those oil companies. Why, they need it all. 
   We're not going to get a reduction in oil prices in this country until we change the administration when BARACK OBAMA takes over on the 20th of January, 2009.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the President and the Vice President have vowed to repeat the mistakes of history, and they have put into motion a plan to do just that in Iran, even as the House is about to send the President a box of blank checks for Iraq against the will of the American people. 
   History is worth noting. In 1953, the United States and the United Kingdom launched Operation Ajax, a covert CIA operation to destabilize and remove the democratically elected Government of Iran, including Prime Minister Mossadegh. Why? Oil. 
   Under Mossadegh, the Iranian Government decided to reclaim Iran's rightful ownership to its national oil treasure, which had been exclusively controlled by the British, who were taking 85 percent of the profits. Oh, by the way, the United Kingdom also kept the books secret, merely telling Iran what its 15 percent take was. 
   As soon as Mossadegh began to reclaim Iran's oil, it was all over. Operation Ajax was set into motion. The U.S. Embassy in Tehran provoked phony and internal Iranian dissent, while the Brits engineered an Iranian financial crisis by orchestrating a global boycott of Iranian oil. We brought down the Iranian Government and installed the Shah. For two decades we propped him up against the will of the Iranian people. It was all about controlling Iran. It still is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, what makes America work is America's workers. 
   Today, America is going to work harder to protect its workers. We currently have a program that was put together in the middle of the night in 2002 in the midst of the fast track legislation, and it was never intended to work. 
   This bill provides protection for almost double the number of workers covered by that program. This measure before us also improves a more basic protection for all jobless workers, unemployment insurance. Only one-third of America's unemployed now receive unemployment benefits, and coverage rates for low-wage and part-time workers are considerably lower. 
   This bill provides up to $7 billion to States implementing specific policies designed to eliminate unnecessary barriers. We ask States to count a worker's most recent wages when determining their eligibility. We ask States to end discrimination against part-time workers. And we ask them not to disqualify workers who must leave work for compelling family reasons like domestic violence or taking care of a sick child or following a spouse whose job has moved. 
   These are State options. We are not requiring them to do anything. If they don't want it, they don't have to have the money. But we are giving them the opportunity to take care of their unemployed workers. The improvements promise to provide unemployment benefits to over half a million jobless workers if adopted in every State. Women particularly stand to gain from this bill because they are more likely to work in part-time or low-wage jobs and are more likely to leave for family reasons. The cost of supporting these reforms is fully offset by extending an unemployment tax that has been on the books for 30 years, and that President Bush is specifically asking us to continue. Any talk about increasing taxes is simply empty rhetoric from the other side. They know it, because the last time it was extended, they did it on their watch. 
   Mr. Speaker, a vote in favor of this bill should be the easiest vote that  every Member of Congress takes this year.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my Republican colleagues for proposing a substitute today. It's healthy for America to see two different views on how we should help dislocated workers. 
   Democrats want to help more workers who lose their jobs because of trade, especially workers providing services. The Republican substitute says no to helping those workers. 
   Democrats want to assure more dislocated workers have an opportunity to receive training. The Republican substitute would, instead, cap the amount of training any worker can receive, not to go on and finish a program. 
   Democrats want to assure health care coverage is affordable for workers losing their jobs by paying 85 percent of their premium. The Republican substitute said, well, 65 wasn't enough, but we'll give you 70. So again, they cut the workers short. 
   Democrats want a better wage insurance program to help trade-affected workers who are reemployed in jobs that pay less than their prior employment. The Republican substitute guts the program as it presently exists and instead only provides a benefit to those at the very lowest wage jobs. 
   Republicans don't care if workers have a chance to get a living-wage job; they want to force people back to minimum-wage jobs. Democrats want to help States improve unemployment insurance for all workers who are denied unfairly their benefits, especially women. The Republican substitute goes in the opposite direction by allowing the administration to approve waivers from States that could deny more jobless workers unemployment insurance. 
   In short, the Democrats want to help workers navigate the global economy. The Republican substitute, on the other hand, tells workers, well, you're still, more or less, on your own. 
   After this substitute is defeated, I'm hopeful that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will ultimately join us in passing a bill to assist America's workers when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, my distinguished colleague from Louisiana keeps worrying about the fact that we are mischaracterizing his amendment. I want to take a specific because the whole question of putting a cap on training benefits is a cut in benefits from what we presently have. The unworkable thing that was in the law before, when you cap at $4,000 the amount per year that a worker can get, a total of $8,000 over a 2-year period, in Minnesota and Maine, 50 percent of the workers spend $10,000. Thirty percent of the TAA workers in Pennsylvania spend more than $15,000 over 10 years. Twenty-five percent of the people in South Carolina spend over $15,000. Eighty percent of the workers in Nebraska spend more than $10,000. 
   Now, when you put that cap on there, you are saying to a 45- or 50-year-old worker who used to make 35, 40, 45, 50, $55,000, we are not going to give you sufficient money to really retrain for a job that you had equivalent in pay before. You are saying whatever you can get for four grand, fine, that's it. But if it takes more than that, well, you're on your own. 
   This bill is designed to try and help workers who were the middle class in this country, people who were making livable wages. Now, you also say in your bill that your wage insurance, it used to be in the present bill if you were over 50 and your job was making less than $50,000 a year, you could receive up to an additional $5,000 if you took a job that paid less than you were making before. 
   Now, what you've done in this bill, in this amendment you offer, you say we will give you a minimum wage job, and if you don't make an additional $2.40 above that minimum wage in your State, then we will sort of give you a little cushion up to that $2.40. That is pushing people to low-wage jobs. You are taking those $50,000-a-year people who were working in auto factories and working in manufacturing jobs across this country and you are saying, go out and get yourself a minimum wage job and we'll give you an extra $2.40 an hour. My, aren't we generous. 
   And you understand why we talk about you gutting what miserable program you put in place in the first place. 
   This bill that we have put together here today is one that will allow States, and the reason why we put additional money in for training is no one could use it before. They will under our bill.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we've been here before. In the 1920s, America spied on its citizens and arrested thousands because they advocated for change. In the 1950s, America black-listed innocent Americans whose only crime was to run afoul of Senator Joe McCarthy. In the 1970s, America illegally spied on people in the civil rights and the Vietnam antiwar movements, including Dr. Martin Luther King. 
   The transgressions were so egregious that a courageous Senator Frank Church from Idaho led a search for truth and affirmation of freedom. In the end, the Congress passed FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. FISA provides a swift and certain means for America to meet any threat without threatening America's freedoms. But this administration seems it cannot defend America without demolishing America's freedoms. 
   The President wants the Congress to undermine FISA with new legislation that would make it easy to spy on any American, just like the 1920s, the 1950s and the 1970s. These are not the good old days, and I oppose any attempt to use fear to subvert freedom. 
   We can keep America safe without sacrificing America in the process. I urge my colleagues to remember why FISA was created and why we should not neuter it in the near future.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, the month of May marks National Foster Care Month. The foster care system provides a safe sanctuary for children who are unable to live safely in their homes. 
   Its primary goal is to ensure their safety and well-being by providing them with critical services and working to find a safe and loving and permanent home. Over 500,000 American children are in the foster care system on any given day with over 100,000 of these children waiting to be adopted. They need our help, and I believe this is one place where every Member of the House can come together as one, committed to protecting these innocent children. 
   This morning, we, Mr. Weller and I, had a hearing in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support to review the changes and the challenges that child welfare agencies encounter in achieving positive outcomes for children and families under their service. 
   The hearing identified a number of areas that need to be improved to strengthen children and families, which I am committed to addressing. The hearing also highlighted the commitment of some of our most selfless Americans on behalf of some of our most vulnerable children. Millions of Americans serve as foster parents, and,  in doing so, have unselfishly opened their homes and their lives to children in need. These families are to be commended for working cooperatively with human service agencies and biological parents to strengthen the lives of these foster children. 
   We should also recognize the work of dedicated case workers, juvenile court justices, physicians and the advocates who have committed their lives to ensuring the safety and well-being of our most vulnerable children. These tireless workers should be commended for their work on behalf of children and families in crisis. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing May 2007 as National Foster Care Month and commending the dedication of foster parents, case workers, judges, service providers and advocates for their commitment to our Nation's most vulnerable children.     
   Madam Speaker, I would now ask unanimous consent to allow Representative Cardoza of California, who is the author of this resolution and a staunch advocate for improving the well-being of children in foster care, and actually an adoptive parent of a couple of kids from foster care, so he's done it at every level, to control the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (VOTE BY HOUSE ON WHETHER TO GO TO WAR WITH IRAN IS NEEDED NOW -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we need a vote on whether this country is going to go to war with Iran. We have talked to the Speaker about it. She has promised it. But the time is getting short. Every day that we wait, we allow people down at the White House to continue to talk about this. 
   The vote we gave in 2002 to allow the President to deal with the problems of 9/11 was not a blank check to attack any country in the world. This war on terror began with some sense in Afghanistan, and then moved to Iraq to the absolute chaos we have today. It is a quagmire from which we can't get ourselves. And, unfortunately, the President and his Vice President are leading us, it appears, toward a war with Iran. 
   Ask why the urgency? Why do you want to come out here and talk about that tonight? Well, there was an article that appeared today in the Al-Quds Al-Arabi, which is an Arabic paper published in London. It is a very respectable paper, and it is one that most people in this body, in fact most people in this country, never heard of, nor do they understand and will never know about it because our press won't pick it up. 
   But I read the Middle Eastern press every day. I have some in my office who read Arabic, and they translate it for me, and I get a summary every day in my office of what is going on. This article I think deserves to be quoted a little bit, because people may not get the Congressional Quarterly or the Congressional Record and read it. 
   The article says this: ``Vice President Dick Cheney yesterday ended his tour of the Arab world that started with Iraq and ended in the capitals of four other Arab countries, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. High ranking Arab diplomatic sources close to the talks with Cheney confirmed to the newspaper that the probability of war became more likely than peace in the region.'' 
   This is Arabs listening to the Vice President of the United States talk. 
   ``The same sources indicated that Cheney was talking to Gulf leaders he met in a very confident and self-assured way, stressing that the involvement of this country in Iraq does not mean it is in a weak situation and cannot launch another war.'' 
   Think about that. The Vice President is telling the Arab leaders, because we are in this mess in Iraq, just ignore that. We still can go to Iran and have a war. 
   Cheney went and talked to soldiers and sailors on one of the aircraft carriers, ``announcing to them,'' and this again is a quote, ``in a decisive manner that the U.S. will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons and that the option of a military attack is not excluded.'' 
   Now, he said, again quoting, ``Cheney expressed his conviction that striking Iran may be the best solution for the situation in Iraq.'' 
   Think about it. We are going to solve our problems in Iraq by attacking Iran. He says, ``because Tehran,'' the capital of Iran, ``has the biggest influence in the country and is the source of the arms of the militia.'' 
   Now, this is from a man who sent to Iraq a guy named Bremer who took down all the guards and all the barriers at the border between Iran and Iraq, and Iran, of course, has been coming into Iraq. This administration set it up, or else they were ignorant. You can take your choice on that. 
   He said, ``They do not expect that there will be any retaliation by Iraq's Shiite militias. Quite the contrary, the Sunni groups and militias will take the opportunity to settle accounts with the ruling government in Baghdad under American support.'' 
   So what he is saying is that the United States is shifting its support from the Maliki government, which is Shiite, and they are now over there telling people, well, we are going to now be supporting the Sunni elements so that they can get--Mr. Speaker, I include the translation of the Al-Quds Al-Arabi article for the Record.  
   Vice-President Dick Cheney yesterday ended his tour of the Arab world that started with Iraq and included the capitals of four other Arab countries, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, amidst a war of words with the Iranian President Ahamdi Nijad, who launched a diplomatic counter-attack in the form of two sudden visits to the Emirates and to Oman. 
   High-ranking Arab diplomatic sources close to the talks with Cheney confirmed to Al-Quds Al-Arabi that the probability of war became more likely than peace in the region after the round of meetings of the vice-president, and that the expected meetings between the Iranian and American sides in Baghdad might be the last chance to avoid military confrontation. 
   The same sources indicated that Cheney was talking to Gulf leaders he met in a very confident and self-assured tone, stressing that the involvement of his country in Iraq does not mean that it is in a weak situation and cannot launch another war, against Iran. Cheney, who visited the troops of his country in Iraq and the Gulf during his last round, made sure that he met American soldiers on an airplane carrier announcing to them in a decisive manner that the US will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons, and that the option of a military attack is not excluded. The Iranian President replied against that with severe threats in a press conference in Abu Dhabi, assuring that if they (Americans) make that mistake, the reply of Iran will be very strong and they will regret it. [Amedinejad said] ``All the world knows that they cannot beat us and Iran is capable of defending herself, and that the superpowers cannot stop us from possessing nuclear energy.'' 
   It was observed that Gulf states have begun searching for alternatives to the Gulf straits to export their oil abroad. There were suggestions to build pipelines to the Red Sea  or the Arab Sea across Yemen, due to fears of closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 18 million barrels pass daily. Western analysts expect that Iranian retaliation will include closing the Strait of Hormuz, bombing American bases, and burning down oil wells in the Gulf, in addition to bombing Israel with rockets from Iran directly, through Hezbollah in Lebanon or both. 
   Cheney expressed his conviction that striking Iran may be the best solution for the situation in Iraq, because Tehran has the biggest influence in the country and is the source of arms for militias. The source added that American estimates do not expect Iraqi Shiite retaliation against American troops in case war breaks out. Quite the contrary, the Sunni groups and militias will take the opportunity to settle accounts with the ruling government in Baghdad under America's support and protection. The same source indicated that Cheney asked his allies (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates) to reassure Sunni groups in Iraq and win them to the American side, passing a message that the U.S. has lost confidence completely in Al-Maliki government because of its failure to control the security situation and to achieve national reconciliation, including giving the Sunnis a bigger role in the decision-making process. 
   Cheney assured Gulf leaders that the Iranian nuclear reactor of Bushahr that lies on the other side of the Gulf will not be a target for strikes because it has no value and due to the presence of Russian experts at the reactor, and that even if it became a target of strikes, it would not cause pollution to the Gulf waters because it does not have depleted plutonium. Gulf states that obtain 90% of their water from treatment stations on the Gulf shores expressed to American officials their concerns and fears in the face of a water crisis which would be caused if a nuclear leak pollutes the Gulf waters in case of war with Iran. 
   The same source also confirmed that Cheney's talks in the four capitals focused on Iraq and Iran only and never dealt with the Arab-Israeli conflict. This was explained by a change of roles between Cheney and Rice, with the latter's role confined to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. 
   In Abu Dhabi, there are currently rumors about Mr. Nijad's asking the Emirates for mediation with Washington in the current nuclear crisis, and that he brought forth new ideas that an Emirate delegation will present to Washington in the next 2 days. The delegation is headed by crown-price and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Sheikh Muhammad bin Zaid. The delegation left for Washington, D.C. already and has among its members the foreign minister of the Emirates.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (TAKING THE ``FREE'' OUT OF THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, this is a propitious day. The market dropped 500 points yesterday, the largest drop since 2001. The economic and regulatory policies of this President has certainly taken the ``free'' out of the free enterprise system. Across America, the dominoes are falling. 
   Bear Stearns fell a few months ago; Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, a week ago; a distress sale of Merrill Lynch over the weekend; Lehman Brothers is looking for bankruptcy on Monday morning; and the auto industry is looking for another $25 million in bailout; and AIG wants a $40 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve. The stock market, as I say, went down 500 points yesterday. No one really thinks we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
   Who's next? We can't answer that question of who is next, other than to say an awful lot of people in the financial industry are working nights and weekends to assess their exposure, and do damage control, if possible. 
   What's next? This is a question we can begin to answer. What's next is that the American people are going to be on the hook for the Bush problem for the next generation, and in so many ways will have to pay much of the financial mess. 
   The last 8 years of this administration, they did everything they could to eliminate, gut, stymie, and ignore responsibility for regulatory oversight by the Federal Government. This administration worshipped at the altar of the free enterprise system and the market. The President wanted the gold, but without a standard. 
   Republicans did everything they could to let the financial industry do anything it wanted, regardless of consequence. At the same time, the administration made clear in its Federal appointments they wanted Federal regulatory agencies on the sidelines. 
   Without government oversight watching out for the interests of the American people, the industry turned free rein into freewheeling, irresponsible policies. When the dominoes began to fall, the administration stepped in to charge billions for bailouts to the American people. And it's not over yet. 
   The current financial crisis is the worst in decades, and yet the shell game goes on. The administration wants to hide the extent of the damage, the risk, and the burden on the American people. 
   I would like to enter into the Record the lead Sunday editorial in the New York Times, called: Bailout Hide and Seek. 
   The Federal budget deficit has swelled to more than $400 billion, and is headed for $500 billion, but the administration wants to keep the cost of the bailouts off the Federal books. They want to hide the magnitude of the crisis and their duplicity in making it possible for the last 8 years of economic abandonment. 
   Things are so bad that no one can accurately predict what the cost will be or how much the American people have been saddled with. The only thing the administration keeps saying is, Charge it to the American people. Just like the Iraq war, which is adding up to a trillion-dollar tab. 
   This President misspent the public trust and squandered the full faith and credit of the American people. The bills just keep coming due after the administration leaves office. They say in business: There's no such thing as a free lunch. What they don't say is that the President has arranged for the American people to pick up the tab. 
   The American financial crisis is the culmination of Republican economic policies. Spend freely, lower taxes, and don't ask anybody to make any kind of sacrifice for a war. Just spend. They got what they wanted, and left the American people holding the bag, and the tab. 
   The next administration will not only have to rebuild America's moral leadership in the world, we will have to rebuild America's economic system and the confidence here at home. The legacy of this President is clear. He took the ``free'' out of the free enterprise system, and instead billed it to the American people.  
   Madam Speaker, we can't wait to have the change that Barack Obama will bring for this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, there is something every American should remember as we deal with the administration's economic crisis. For almost 8 years, President Bush and the Republican Party have been staging events, issuing press releases, and telling everyone that we have to privatize Social Security and give it to Wall Street to invest. 
   For almost 8 years, the President and the Republicans have been telling the American people that Wall Street will wave its magic wand and inflate Social Security to Social Nirvana. They want satchels of money dropped off by that statue down on Wall Street of the bull, and they promise that Wall Street will use an incantation, something like ``hocus pocus,'' and they would work out their magic--for a fee, of course. 
   Democrats and Americans managed to hold their ground and have not taken this greedy plan to grab their Social Security. But the Wall Street Wonders worked their so-called magic in a lot of other places, and their outcome is just this: Now you see it, now you don't. 
   That describes the administration's bailout plan: Give us $700 billion and, like magic, the problems will go away. Hocus pocus, it's time for the administration to declare the magic wand option is off the table. It is time to recognize government has a responsibility to protect the people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, for years the administration has been rigging its case for war against Iran with posturing, finger-wagging and name calling. Those are not my words. One of my hometown daily newspapers, the Seattle Post Intelligencer, authored those words as the first sentence of an editorial they published this morning entitled: ``Iran: No, not again.'' I will insert the Seattle PI editorial into the Record at this point.  
   Iran: No, Not Again 
   For years, this administration has been rigging its case for war against Iran, with posturing, finger wagging and name-calling. 
   And now, just as Iran has struck an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency for inspection of its nuclear plants, and just as the IAEA chief, Mohamed ElBaradei, has said that country is slowing progress on one of those facilities, the United Kingdom's Guardian newspaper reports that Vice President Dick Cheney is pushing for a military ``solution'' in Iran. Naturally, President Bush is backing him, going against Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, both of whom favor diplomacy over military action (heck, it worked with North Korea). 
   In May, Cheney paid a visit to the USS John C. Stennis in the Persian Gulf, 150 miles off Iran's coast, for no other reason than to deliver threats. The New York Times reported that while Cheney said nothing new, he ``stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration's most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran's coast was unmistakable.''

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I had intended to rise this evening to focus my attention on the suicide bombing last week in Baghdad that killed and wounded several members of the Parliament, including Osama al-Nujafii. He was a member of the Iraq Parliament who participated in a historic live teleconference I hosted last month linking several of my House colleagues with several Iraq Parliamentarians. I wish him and the others wounded in the attack a speedy recovery. 
   That attack occurred inside the Green Zone, and it confirms that no one is safe in Iraq, no matter how many checkpoints or blast walls or press releases out of the White House. It confirms that the President's military escalation has only escalated the violence and the casualties. It confirms that the President has no control whatsoever on the events on the ground. And it confirms that the American people are right to demand that the President work with the Democratic Congress and establish a firm timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. 
   For now, most Americans are grimly aware of the weekend of bombings and killings across Iraq. But the situation is even worse. The Iraq war will live long after the U.S. forces leave the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the President announced that he's open to ideas to lower soaring gasoline prices. That's good news because I noticed gasoline prices began to rise not long after Vice President Cheney held secret meetings with the energy companies. So the first thing the President ought to do is have the Vice President release the transcripts from those secret meetings. The American people still don't know what the Vice President's energy cabal cooked up. The gasoline prices have skyrocketed ever since. 
   The President's solution is to allow his oil pals to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That keeps us addicted to oil, risks environmental catastrophe but feeds the profits of oil companies. Two of the oil companies, BP and Shell, reported almost $19 billion in profits from the first quarter, and their surrogates in the White House can only meet soaring gas prices with silence and secrecy. 
   The President claimed he's looking for new ideas. How about an old reliable one: open government. Tell the people what happened in those secret meetings. Maybe then we will find out why I paid $3.75 for a gallon of gas last night. It was $1.90 when the President came in.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, refugees come to America fleeing persecution, injustice, torture and even death. During a hearing before the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, we heard from one of those refugees. His name was K'Keng, and he fought alongside American forces during the Vietnam war. In fact, he was recruited and trained by our Special Forces. After the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, he was imprisoned for 6 years as a political prisoner, after which he eventually made it to the United States as a refugee. 
   He tried working, but the wounds he suffered during the war made that difficult. Based on his disability and the fact that he had almost no other source of income, he began receiving Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits. But those benefits were terminated when he reached a 7-year time limit on SSI on refugees. He is now 75, partially blind, and lives on only a few hundred dollars worth of food stamps every month, as well as assistance from his young son. 
   Nearly 7,000 elderly and disabled refugees have lost their SSI benefits. The Social Security Administration projects another 16,000 will do so over the next few years unless the Congress acts. 
   As the beacon of freedom around the world, America can do better than this. While it is true that a refugee may continue to receive SSI if he or she becomes a citizen, a series of obstacles make that transition to citizenship difficult within the 7-year limit of SSI benefits. 
   First, a refugee must live in the United States for at least 5 years before they are eligible to submit an application for citizenship.     
   A refugee must then confront a lengthy application process which can take up to 3 to 4 years. Backlogs in processing citizenship applications have been caused by a variety of issues, including protracted background checks put in place after September 11 terrorist attacks. There are other barriers to citizenship, such as the continuing impact of the recent annual cap on the number of asylees who may become legal permanent residents, a status which asylees must maintain for 4 years before they may submit an application for citizenship. 
   Also, some disabled and elderly refugees encounter difficulties navigating the application process, which includes both an English language and a U.S. civics test. 
   I'm pleased to say there is bipartisan support for addressing this issue. The last several budget proposals from the Bush administration have called for an extension in SSI benefits for refugees, and there is a bipartisan bill pending in the U.S. Senate. 
   I would like especially to thank Mr. Weller, the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, for working with me to forge the bipartisan bill we are now considering. 
   This bill, H.R. 2608, would generally extend SSI benefits for an additional 2 years for disabled and elderly refugees, asylees and other qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits have expired in the recent past. Benefits could be extended for an additional period for those awaiting a decision on pending application for citizenship. These policies would be in effect till 2010. 
   The legislation completely offsets the cost of the SSI extension for refugees within a provision that will reduce Federal tax refunds to recover unemployment insurance debts due to fraud. The Federal tax refund offset authority already exists to collect unpaid child support, unpaid State taxes and debts owed to the Federal agencies. 
   The bill simply says that if a State concludes that a worker has fraudulently received unemployment benefits or a business owner has failed to pay UI taxes based on fraud, the State can seek to receive a portion of any Federal tax refund that the individual may be owed. Before pursuing a tax offset, the State would be required to notify the individual and provide them with at least 60 days to contest the amount being recovered. 
   By catching and reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, this provision not only offsets the cost of the SSI extension for refugees, but it also will reduce unemployment taxes on employers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the legislation will cut payroll taxes by $326 million over the next 10 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, refugees come to our country fleeing persecution. They reside in our country legally, and those eligible for SSI are disabled, elderly or both. This legislation extends a modest benefit to help them provide for their most basic essentials. The bill will not add one dime to the Federal deficit, and it will even provide a tax cut. Such a combination should ensure broad support for this vital effort to help those most in need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we walk around our hometowns and cities, who thinks about the young people we pass hanging around in front of a store or a park or street corner? Some people simply avert their eyes and walk a bit faster, focusing on something else. Others, they quickly step by and try to get by them. 
   Can we tell which of them are begging, borrowing or stealing to eat? Do we stop and consider if these kids are selling drugs or their own bodies in order to buy food or pay for shelter? 
   Too few of us are willing to ask whether these young people might be homeless, and the fact is too many of them are homeless on the streets of our hometowns. As many as 2.8 million kids are homeless right now, right in front of our eyes, if we choose to look and see. 
   Some of these homeless kids are fleeing an unsafe home. Others are running from a child welfare system that fails them too frequently. And others are on the street for a myriad of other reasons. Whatever the reason, they are alone, afraid and vulnerable, unsure where to turn for help or to whom they can trust. 
   Sometimes help arrives too late. On an average, 13 homeless youth die every day from assault, suicide or sickness. It happens in our hometowns across America, and we need to take a stand. We can be the lifeline that pulls these young people back from the brink. 
   The Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee is in the process of conducting hearings on the ways America can ensure that vulnerable children look to us for help instead of to the streets where the pushers and pimps profit on our inadequacy in protecting these vulnerable youngsters. Federal resources like the Social Security Block Grant; title IV of the Social Security Act; and moneys provided under the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act do help vulnerable and homeless children. But our resources are falling short. It is like standing on the shore with a lifeline that only reaches 25 feet when the person drowning is 50 feet from shore. We are coming up short in spite of our best intentions. 
   The Federal Government should be doing more to prevent youth homelessness and provide a pathway towards self-sufficiency when children fall through the cracks. We can do a better job of partnering with State and local governments, nonprofits and faith-based organizations to provide assistance to vulnerable families and youth. 
   Imagine you are in the foster care system, and suddenly you are 18 and you are out of the system. You are on your own. You didn't have parents. You didn't have a family. That is why you were in foster care. And suddenly we throw these kids into adult life. In many cases, they wind up homeless. 
   In addition to meaningful reforms in Federal programs, I think the House of Representatives can also empower private and public organizations, citizens who employ their talent and compassion to prevent youth homelessness and provide help to homeless youth when prevention fails. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us, House Resolution 527, would say that, for 1 month out of the year, America is going to recognize that youth homelessness is an important challenge that we must face as a Nation. More importantly, it will say to every homeless young person that you are not alone anymore. The People's House sees you, and we intend to help. Organizations like Stand Up For Kids, which coordinates a nationwide effort to scour the streets searching for kids and providing resources for them, is one inspiration behind this measure. But it is the kids that should remind us of our duty to provide for and protect American youth and to pass this resolution. 
   Let this be the last day that we walk along the streets of our hometowns and not see the young people who are homeless young Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I have been elected as a subcommittee chairman in the new Congress, and I think the American people and my House colleagues deserve to hear something about my vision about that responsibility. 
   I am elected to chair the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. Human resources is really about America's safety net. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over many vital social and economic programs that support the American people. They are key portions of the Social Security Act, which include unemployment insurance, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, and programs to protect vulnerable and assist disadvantaged children. I don't think the present subcommittee name ``Human Resources'' really conveys the mission of that committee or the urgency, so we have decided to change the name to the Subcommittee on Economic Security and Family Support. 
   In one sentence, here is my vision of what this subcommittee can do in service of the American people: We can transform common dreams into the common good, and we have a social responsibility and a moral imperative to do it. We should at least begin an effort to cut poverty by 50 percent, and I intend to try. 
   Millions of Americans, many in families where both parents work, live in poverty today. That should be unacceptable in the richest nation in the world. The millions of children who go to bed hungry tonight, abandoned, abused, neglected, or just plain forgotten, it is a shame. We have got to remember. We have got to say to these children, ``You are not alone, and we will help.'' We can inspire innovations in child welfare for children in kinship care, for foster parents, for case workers, for family court workers, and countless other unsung heroes in America. ``We thank you for your service to the children and your communities and your family, and I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that your government does its part.'' 
   I am not standing here as a Democrat. Good ideas don't begin with a political party label; good ideas begin with a commitment to something bigger than ourselves but involving all of us. It is the common good. No child should be alone in a country as compassionate as ours. We can start there, and then debate the ideas and programs that can deliver the common good. We can vow to cut poverty in half. 
   Just 2 days ago, we stopped to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Let's not forget something Dr. King said: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' That applies to every nation on earth, including the United States. The richest nation on the earth is poorer for every American who lives in poverty. There is work to be done, and we cannot deny it. We can make America the nation where social and economic justice applies to everyone regardless of their economic circumstance. 
   We admire the visionary work done by leaders who have come before us. These leaders believed we have an obligation to assist Americans who lose their job through no fault of their own. In the 21st century, changes wrought by a global marketplace should challenge us to reexamine and strengthen the support for American workers. Anyone who loses their job, especially an older worker, knows what I mean. America is a nation founded on the common good. It is the fundamental basis of this country, and every caring family, we take care of each other. 
   The safety net committee I chair is woven out of the social fabric that created America. We have been handed the  responsibility and an expectation to do good. It is far too convenient to bash the government and blame it for all our ills. In America, the people are the government. I think the people expect and deserve a government that acts in their name and on their behalf in a way that reflects the hope and promise America has meant for over two centuries. 
   America's future is in our hands, and it is within our power to nurture, heal, and defend. That is my mission, and that is the mission of this Congress. The safety net is ours to weave and ours to protect. We must do it.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. I will give you a reason why we ought to have this amendment. We know what happens when we give this President a blank check. It always goes badly. We get a  banner, Mission Accomplished, and he gets to continue a failed war that has now claimed the U.S. economy as its latest casualty. That is why I urge my colleagues to approve this Lee amendment. 
   This lame duck President must not be able to indenture the next President to carry on a disastrous war of security. This is a lame duck administration trying to rewrite history, and they will tie the hands of the Nation into a knot in the process if we let them. The next President and the next Congress are the only ones who should determine the future policy in Iraq. This amendment ensures this will happen. 
   The President has had a blank check since 2001, and we see where we are. This amendment brings some balance to the process. It's time to close the blank check account for a lame duck President. We ought to approve the Lee amendment and preserve our chance in the future to get out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (THE ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4156, the Orderly Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act, just passed. 
   Let me be clear about why I voted for it. This legislation is a compromise that I hate, but it's the only way to move the agenda of the American people forward. This legislation is anything but perfect, but it does make important strides. 
   It requires the President to use funding to begin to redeploy U.S. soldiers out of Iraq within 30 days of enactment and sets a goal for complete redeployment by December 15, 2008. 
   It requires the President to implement a comprehensive diplomatic political and economic strategy to bring stability to Iraq. For the first time, the President will actually have a plan in Iraq. 
   It requires the President to report to Congress. It will end the secrecy that has surrounded everything about this war. 
   And it requires the President to accept what the rest of us know, that waterboarding is torture. It is a crime, and this bill says it's not going to be used in the interrogation of prisoners. 
   After World War II, we prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding U.S. prisoners of war. But the President's new Attorney General is walking around wondering about whether waterboarding is a crime. 
   House Republicans who voted ``no'' said they're willing to sacrifice the will of the American people at the altar of blind political obedience to the White House. 
   If Republicans in the Senate filibuster this bill, they'll be telling the American people to go away because  they intend to follow the President over the cliff. 
   If this legislation should reach the President's desk, it just might finally force him to confront reality. But I don't expect any of that to happen. 
   The President intends to hand Iraq over to the next President. In the meantime, this President is waging an Iraq veto war relying on Republicans to act as mechanical robots and rubber-stamp his vote on every single Iraq policy the Democratic majority has brought forward. 
   The American people may not understand how badly they've been deceived and misled by this administration, but it's going to continue. Sometime next spring, the President will announce things in Iraq are going so well he'll bring home a few thousand of our troops. He'll have them arrive in the fall during the election, when Republicans are desperate to explain why they ignored the American people. He will not tell us that 100,000 soldiers will be permanently stationed in Iraq at 14 military bases the administration has so artfully called enduring bases. Of these, five are superbases: Camp Victory North, al Asad Air Base, Balad Air Base, Camp Taji, and Tallil Air Base. These are huge bases with everything from video stores to supermarkets and rental cars. They are so big that one of them, Balad, 40 miles north of Baghdad, is the second busiest airport in the world, second only to Heathrow in the amount of air traffic. 
   Building enduring bases stands for indefinite U.S. military involvement in Iraq, which is not something the Congress or the American people want or will stand for. 
   The President is running a war by veto. If we could have a vote on a no confidence motion, this war would be over. But in our democracy, the ballot box is the only vote of no confidence and, regrettably, we have another year to wait to get rid of the President. 
   That only reinforces the need for today's vote. If Republicans won't support something as mild as this, then the American people need to know the Republicans are stonewalling. Every time we force the debate out in the open, the American people see it for what it is. 
   If Republicans continue to prolong the war, the American people will take charge next November and unelect even more Republicans. 
   We call this legislation a bridge fund, meaning to build a way to bring our soldiers out of Iraq and home where they belong. We're trying, and we're not going to stop until the American people can declare the mission accomplished and the men and women of our Armed Forces are home.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (THE BAD OLD DAYS -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, in my Seventh Congressional District in Washington State, and in towns and cities across the United States, the American people are justifiably outraged and at the same time dumbfounded that the President would send the Treasury Secretary up here to Congress asking for a blank check, declaring the sky will immediately fall if he doesn't get it. With a straight face, but no straight talk, he demanded unchecked, unlimited power to spend $700 billion of taxpayer money any way he sees fit. From the moment this President took office 8 years ago, his administration has done everything possible to roll back the clock to the roaring '20s, and now they want to roll the American people to pay for it. 
   For the last 8 years, this administration rewarded Wall Street and ignored Main Street. For 8 long years, this administration encouraged practices that have taken America back to the finances of 1929. But now this administration wants the American people to pay $700 billion for Wall Street's ignorance and greed, and what are they going to do with it? The American people are asked to sacrifice, but what about Wall Street? What does the President ask of them? Wall Street lobbyists are here by the busload, trying to cut deals to sweeten the pot for the people who pay them millions. When someone suggested any potential bailout ought to include a provision to refinance some mortgages, the lobbyists declared the sky would fall. And when somebody declared that there would not be golden parachutes for executives who masterminded this mess, we were told that that would be punitive. And then when the White House relented and said they might give a little on golden parachutes, the American people are supposed to be thankful and give in. 
   In case anybody has forgotten, the golden parachutes originally pegged at $13 million for the chief executives of Freddie and Fannie were cut. They ended up only getting $9 million. Does that sound like sacrifice to you? 
   Friends and supporters of this administration have had 8 years of unregulated, unfettered access to the wallets of the American people. Their complex derivatives and mathematical formulas were used to create financial products that can best be described in a single phrase: house of cards. This administration permitted, encouraged, and now wants to mortgage this house of cards to the American people. They take no responsibility for their role in the crisis. Instead, they warn the American people that they might suffer mightily if they do not act within a week. Suddenly the administration and the Republican Party that regularly decry government intervention now clamor for it, but only because they can't find $700 billion anywhere else. 
   How do they propose to pay for it? Does the President offer to reduce the massive tax holidays enjoyed over the last 8 years by the rich? Did they offer something that would benefit the working Americans who don't want to pay for this? 
   To all the American families where the husband and wife work two, three, four jobs to make ends meet, to all the single moms and dads who play by the rules, the administration has offered you a threat and a share in paying this $700 billion mortgage on a house of cards. This administration has brought America to the brink of national bankruptcy, and they are banking on fear again. They used fear to go to war. They used fear to take away your civil rights and spy on you. And now they are using fear of financial collapse, and they are just trying to scare you into getting them to do whatever they want. 
   There's a line that aptly describes this situation: ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.'' Don't be fooled. 
   Mr. Speaker, remember, trust is something that is already bankrupt.  The bank of trust in this administration is absolutely bankrupt. They have misled, lied, misrepresented, whatever word you want to use, on issue after issue. And now they give us 7 days. Come back, take out your wallet, and give them everything that's in it, $700 billion. Well, actually, we don't have to give them anything. We're going to borrow it from the Chinese. Let's borrow our way. 
   When will they talk about how you pay for the profligacy of this administration?

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (INVESTING IN AMERICA'S FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we will invest in America's future tomorrow by making college more affordable and accessible for over 5 million Americans. We are going to cut the interest rate in half over the next 5 years for undergraduates with subsidized student loans. Interest on those loans will drop from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next 4 years. 
   Investing in America's future is long overdue. Now, the question is: Who benefits? Ordinary Americans, that is who. This legislation will help low- and middle-income Americans who rely on subsidized loans to make college a reality. It gives them a real shot at the American Dream. 
   We know that an undergraduate college degree is a minimum education requirement for participating in the hope and opportunity of the 21st century. We also know that our sons and daughters have been forced to take on significant debt in recent years to pursue that college degree. In the last 5 years, undergraduate students and their families have seen tuition and fees rise over 40 percent at public universities after inflation. At the same time, the cost of borrowing money has gone up by 2 percent. 
   It is a debt load that is forcing talented young Americans to pass up a college education and America cannot afford to let that happen. Americans with an undergraduate degree earn much more on average than Americans without one. In 2005, the average earnings of someone with a college degree was 60 percent more than someone with only a high school degree. In today's dollars, we are talking about $37,000 versus $67,000 for a college graduate. 
   And there is every reason to believe this income gap will widen in coming years. Making college more affordable and accessible gives more of our children and grandchildren access to a better life, and those economic benefits ripple through the entire economy. 
   I represent Seattle, a city where technological innovation is a daily ingredient of our local economy, from Boeing to Microsoft, through a thousand start-ups. These companies need an educated workforce to succeed. Like it or not, we are competing in a global economy, and Americans deserve every fair advantage. 
   A college education is one of the best advantages, and it isn't just about making money. With a college degree, students have more careers to choose from. In other words, a college degree is a key that can unlock your own personal happiness. Imagine working at something you want to do every day instead of something you have to do. 
   Today, too many promising young Americans are not going to college because it costs too much, not because they do not have the ability to succeed. And we know there are racial and gender disparities that make it imperative for us as a Nation to make college more affordable, accessible, and available. 
   For those who do go to college, the typical student graduates over $17,000 in debt. So we are making a downpayment in this bill on America's future by cutting the interest rate on subsidized student loans, and we would be wise as a Nation to do more. 
   Today, the United States accounts for 14 percent of the world's college graduates. That is just half of the percentage we accounted for 30 years ago. In other words, knowledge is power, and other nations have dramatically stepped up their efforts. 
   A few months ago, the nonpartisan National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education released a new report that ranks the United States 16 among the 27 industrialized nations in the world for the number of students who complete a college education or advanced certificate degree. The data in the report also suggests there is a shortage of college-educated young Americans ready to take over as the college-trained baby boomers retire. We could be as much as 15 million college graduates short in just over a decade. That would be completely unacceptable in the United States of America. 
   Cutting interest rates in half on subsidized student loans is a start, but it is just that. It is just a beginning. We need to find other ways to invest in America's future by investing in America's future generation. We say it over and over again, that children are our future. This is an opportunity to put in law the fact that we mean business. The 21st century will require nothing less.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, the President's proposed budget can mean only one thing, the lights are on down at the White House but nobody's home. He has the House Republicans carrying the water, but their budget is his will,  make no mistake about it. If the President gets his way, lights will go off across America and people will suffer because of the President's complete disregard of the state of the economy, the plight of the American middle class and the domestic casualty from his irresponsible war in Iraq, that is, meeting the critical, unmet social needs of this country. 
   For instance, the President proposes slashing the Social Services Block Grant Program by $500 million this year and eliminating it altogether next year. In my home State of Washington, these funds are critical for providing child care for vulnerable families, Meals On Wheels and services to prevent child abuse. 
   But the President is more interested in helping the rich get richer and leaving the rest of America down and out. The President is willing to feed their greed by starving the U.S. economy and hurting the American people. 
   The American people deserve a budget that recognizes reality, and that's what the Democrats have offered. We provide tax relief to the middle class by demanding tax fairness for everyone. We include extended unemployment benefits, but I proposed a separate legislation this year because the American people expect their government to respond when an economic downturn hits and hurts them. They don't want any more New Orleans experiences. 
   We provide a budget based on reality, meeting the defense needs of the Nation, and meeting the unmet social needs of the American people. 
   In other words, the lights are on here, and the Democrats are home working for the American people. 
   The President has offered a budget that shouts it's all about funding a hopeless Iraq war while the Democrats have offered a budget that says it's about the economy and hope and help for the American people. 
   Vote for the American people and vote for the Democratic budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging and thanking Mr. Rangel for his leadership in providing the energy legislation which is before us today and to applaud Speaker Pelosi for setting the agenda at the beginning of this session that will change this country's energy. 
   We live in a Nation addicted to oil, and we simply can't afford it anymore. It's too expensive for the American pocketbook; it's too adverse for American security, and too perilous for the Earth's atmosphere. But the key to any and every part of the energy solution lies here in the Congress in its political will to change what we can change for the good of the American people and the Earth. 
   Our energy legislation is bigger and bolder than a barrel of oil. It's a balance of support for alternative energy production and conservation. Every American has a stake and an ability to make a change, and our energy legislation unleashes America's ability to create, innovate and seek out and do that which has not been done. This is America's declaration of energy independence, and the first campaign plans to win what must be won. Our grandchildren, our children, our constituents, our country deserves no less. To those who say we cannot rise to meet the future and that we must embrace the past, I say America's boundless optimism has plenty of room to grow and shine. When it comes to energy policy, we have not risen to the occasion or to America's potential. That changes today with this legislation. It deserves bipartisan support. 
   And I would point out that the rhetoric we're going to hear from the other side is basically, we have to protect the oil companies; we can't touch their profits. Now, at a time when Americans are paying record prices at the pump and oil is at $70 a barrel, we have to change the status quo, and we're going to do it. It doesn't affect oil produced in this country, and it will be better for us in the long run. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is really a defining moment for the Congress, Mr. Speaker, and how we vote will define whether we embrace the future or cling to the past that is destroying us. 
   Now, the last speaker talked about somehow, if we take back some of the obscene profits from the oil industry and use it to develop alternative energy and to invest in conservation measures around this country, that that will be the end of the Western World as we've known it. Between 2004 and 2006, oil companies experienced profit increases of an average of 62 percent, some of them as high as 117 percent. Now, oil profits, in the dictionary, that would be obscene, and anybody who thinks we're destroying the oil industry here simply is unwilling to look at the facts. 
   Supporting this energy legislation is really a vote to move toward our national security because our addiction to oil makes us vulnerable to foreign countries and keeps our soldiers fighting and dying in Iraq. No one here in this House still believes that oil wasn't a major reason why we went into Iraq. 
   Supporting this energy legislation is a vote to strengthen America's domestic economy because our addiction has made the American people vulnerable to punishing and unrelenting price shocks. We didn't start the increase in prices in energy. Gasoline prices weren't started in here by raising taxes. If you think that the oil companies, I don't know if there's anybody in this country who thinks that the Congress is what makes the oil prices go up, the gasoline prices. 
   Now, supporting this energy legislation is also a vote to save our planet,  because addiction to oil has placed us on a collision course with global warming. Every witness who came before the Ways and Means Committee, whether they were called by the Republicans or the Democrats, agreed that global warming is something we must deal with. The arguments I hear are not about whether there is global warming. The question is how should we deal with it how quickly, what's the best way. 
   Now, you either turn back now and we will face economic calamity and planetary catastrophe, that's a choice you guys can make, or turn back now and we fail the American people in our global responsibility. 
   The choice is very clear. The choice is really easy, and the need is urgent for our children, for our grandchildren, for the planet. 
   I ask all the Members to support this legislation.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the proposal Republicans have put on the table here are like the things that addicts say. They just want one more fix; let's just have one more quick fix to take care of their problems. 
   The things that you have said here make me wonder if you understand how business operates. To give people a one-year extension of money and say, make plans, build buildings, hire people and start a new industry, but you've got a one-year guarantee, indicates you have no idea how business runs. That's why we made it 4 years, to give people an opportunity to actually do this. 
   People listening might ask themselves, well, what's the cost to all this. Well, it costs a long-term extension for renewable energies. It costs a long-term extension for solar properties. It costs the production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, which plays into the ethanol question. It costs a long-term extension of energy-efficient commercial building expenditures. How can you build a building in one year, from planning to building to constructing, how can you do that? But that's what you're suggesting; we will give them one year.  
   The Republican motion to recommit makes sure that the renewable energy industry is denied the economic certainty they need to drive production of energy from renewable sources in order that the oil and gas industry can be fully sheltered. 
   You wouldn't want any competition for Big Oil. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas to talk about how you pay for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, it's not as hard as the President would like us to believe. Someone reminded me over the weekend of something. Here's what he said. 
   When the Japanese Army subjected American prisoners of war to waterboarding, it was a crime, and those responsible were severely punished. After World War II, several Japanese soldiers were convicted for waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war. 
   At the trial of his captors, Lieutenant Chase Nielson, one of the 1942 Army Air Force officers who flew the Doolittle raid over Tokyo, was captured by the Japanese, said, ``I was given several types of torture. I was given what they call the water cure.'' 
   He was asked what it felt like when the Japanese soldiers poured the water. ``Well, I felt more or less like I was drowning,'' he replied. 
   And yet we have an administration complete with Attorneys General and designees who aren't sure if waterboarding is a crime. They can check the record of war tribunals after World War II, because the rest of the world is sure. It was a crime then, and it is a crime today. 
   Over the weekend I saw ``Rendition.'' It ought to be required viewing for this body.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, unlucky or not, 13 is the number before us. That's how many predominantly Sunni nations in the Middle East have declared in the past year that they want nuclear power. We know that Iran is building a nuclear capacity which it claims will be used solely for power generation. Iran is predominantly a Shiite nation. While both are Muslim, Sunni and Shiite are different. At the grass-roots level, everyday people intermarry and get along just fine, until the governments in power decide they want religious ideology to govern everyone. 
   Sunni-Shiite dominance was behind the Iran-Iraq war two decades ago when Don Rumsfeld went to Iraq to pledge U.S. support to Saddam Hussein. Today the Iraq war has inflamed Sunni-Shiite passions and U.S. forces are in the middle of it, fighting and dying in a fight that we shouldn't be in. There's been a lot in the news about Iran's nuclear program, including threats by the Vice President that Iran will never be permitted to acquire nuclear capacity. In other words, the administration's international diplomacy with Iran begins with an order from the U.S. military to lock and load. A military strike directly ordered by the administration, or indirectly sanctioned by the administration, is considered a foregone conclusion by many in the Middle East.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, Martin Luther King said, ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' 
   Those that volunteer to serve our country deserve our thanks and our support. Members of our Armed Forces make tremendous sacrifices as they honorably perform their duties and deserve so much in return for their service. 
   The Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Act is an important piece of legislation that would eliminate many inequities that presently exist in Federal statutes affecting those performing service to our country. 
   The bill makes several improvements in the Tax Code for servicemembers and their families. It includes a provision to remove obstacles for Americans who wish to serve our Nation overseas through the Peace Corps by providing relief from capital gains taxes on the sale of a home. 
   Additionally, the bill makes several important changes to the Supplemental Security Income program, known as SSI. The SSI program provides critical benefits for servicemembers who are caring for a severely disabled spouse or child. This bill would change SSI's treatment of certain forms of military compensation when determining SSI eligibility and benefit amounts for military families. As a result, more military families will be able to benefit from this important safety net. This bill would remove penalties that presently exist for blind,  disabled, and elderly veterans under the SSI program. 
   And, finally, the bill would end the disparate treatment of compensation that is paid to some AmeriCorps volunteers but not to others under the SSI program. This modest change would enable disabled Americans to serve their country and their community despite their disability. For some Americans, AmeriCorps can provide a pathway for the disabled to gain the skills to reenter the workforce. 
   At this time, I would like to enter into the Record the following documents. 
   Stories of Americans With Disabilities in National Service 
   People with disabilities volunteer for the same reasons that anyone else does--to give back to their communities, to improve their surroundings, and to be active and engaged in life. Some national service participants who have disabilities volunteer with organizations that serve other people with disabilities, while others focus their efforts on helping to meet a wide range of critical community needs. The individuals profiled here represent a small sampling of the many people with disabilities involved in the Corporation for National and Community Service's Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America programs. 
   AMERICORPS*STATE AND NATIONAL
   Steve Hoad, AmeriCorps Alumnus 2001, AmeriCorps*VISTA Alumnus 2003 Augusta, Maine; disability: blind. 
   Steve Hoad served with the Maine Conservation Corps in Augusta as a coordinator of volunteers on a statewide basis. The program, called SERVE--Maine (State Environmental Resource Volunteer Effort for Maine), identifies volunteers for outdoor or natural resource projects sponsored by government agencies or nonprofit groups. As a person who is blind, Steve thinks it's important for lots of organizations, including the Corporation for National and Community Service, to address inclusion. Steve feels his contributions are important for the additional reason that, in his opinion, ``..... people with disabilities have been left on the sidelines and pushed into isolation by a couple of different ideas that people seem to have. One is that because maybe someone looks different or acts differently or speaks differently, that they're not as smart; and the other is that because someone is disabled, they can't contribute anything, they need to be helped. Those two ideas become very exclusionary.'' 
   AMERICORPS*VISTA 
   Dawn Facka, AmeriCorps*VISTA Alumna 2001, Anchorage, Alaska; current location: Charleston, South Carolina; disability: hearing impaired. 
   Dawn Facka, a service-learning coordinator with AmeriCorps*VISTA, advocates for people with disabilities and serves as a role model for young men and women with disabilities that come to serve in AmeriCorps Programs. In addition, she teaches others about the importance of inclusion and facilitates disability awareness and diversity training to AmeriCorps*NCCC members. She strives to create a work environment that is welcoming and understanding to those individuals with disabilities by advocating for community involvement and supporting organizations that support and help individuals with disabilities. She says that ``If AmeriCorps, had not opened the doors of opportunity to me, I most likely would still be ashamed and embarrassed of who I am and [how] society has labeled me. I would still be apologizing to people who did not tolerate or accept my hearing loss. I can't begin to show my gratitude ..... to AmeriCorps for showing me another world.'' 
   AMERICORPS*NCCC 
   Joe Tierney, AmeriCorps*NCCC Alumnus 2001 and 2002, Charleston, South Carolina; current location: Boston, Massachusetts; disability: traumatic brain injury. 
   Joe Tierney dedicated two years of his life to service with Americorps*NCCC. During these years he tutored children, built houses, designed and built wheelchair ramps, surveyed and mapped a historical graveyard, blazed trails, worked at a camp for children and adults with disabilities, and much more. Of his time there he writes, ``Throughout my service I met some amazing individuals, traveled to some fascinating locations, and learned a variety of skills, but most importantly my service gave me the opportunity to recover, the ability to experience life with a smile. I made the decision to join AmeriCorps because I felt an obligation to give back, I understood that I was very fortunate to have recovered and that I would have never done it without the help of many thoughtful, committed, competent individuals.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (OIL INDUSTRY MAIN BENEFICIARY OF IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the American people have not received very much information about a major issue in and around the Iraq war, and the oil industry would like to keep it just that way. Fortunately, investigative journalism is still being practiced, and I want to share information uncovered by a reporter for AlterNet, in the United States, and a major Sunday story this week in The Independent, a newspaper in the United Kingdom. 
   The number one Iraq story for all of 2006 on AlterNet, which is an Internet-based news and opinion site, was a two-part series by a reporter, Joshua Holland, entitled: ``Bush's Petro-Cartel Almost Has Iraq's Oil.'' 
   Last Sunday, The Independent carried stories with these headlines: ``Future of Iraq: The Spoils of War, How the West Will Make a Killing on Iraqi Oil Riches.'' And ``Blood and Oil: How the West Will Profit from Iraq's Most Precious Commodity.'' 
   Members of Congress are limited in how much information we can enter into the record at one time, so I will enter into the record The Independent story. I will also encourage every American to seek out and read the complete AlterNet story, which is available online. 
   These investigative reports paint a disturbing picture and raise troubling questions about big oil's attempting to steal the oil wealth and resources of the Iraqi people. From the beginning of the Iraq invasion, more moderate voices, especially overseas, questioned whether the ulterior motive behind toppling Saddam Hussein was a grab for Iraqi oil. In this scenario, democracy is a by-product of oil production, not the real reason for military action in Iraq. 
   Gaining access to the oil wealth of Iraq has had oil industries salivating for years. Gaining control of that oil wealth would be a prize beyond compare for the oil industry. Iraq has the third largest oil reserves in the world, and there are many oil geologists who believe that vast additional oil reserves are just waiting to be discovered in Iraq's western desert. They call it the Holy Grail, and some believe the untapped riches could propel Iraq from third to first place in the world's oil reserves. 
   An estimated 115 billion barrels of oil reserves are under Iraq. Today's price is $53 a barrel, and that is an 18-month low. The American people are still suffering from the oil price shocks and  high prices at the pump, and the oil industry is booking record profits in the billions of dollars every quarter, record profits in a world that is addicted to oil. 
   In 1999, Vice President Cheney was running Halliburton, and he said in a speech that another 50 million barrels of oil would be needed by the end of the decade, and the key was the Middle East. 
   This administration and the British prime minister have repeatedly said that the U.S. invasion was not about oil. But these investigative reporters say a new law is quietly working its way through the Iraqi government that would give unprecedented access, control and oil wealth to Western oil companies. It would happen under what is known as a production sharing agreement, a PSA. 
   Here is how The Independent put it: ``PSAs allow a country to retain legal ownership of its oil but gives a share of profits to international companies that invest in infrastructure and operation of the wells, pipelines and refineries.'' 
   The news account continues: ``Their introduction would be a first for a major Middle Eastern oil producer. Saudi Arabia and Iran, the world's number one and twoexporters, both tightly control their industries through state-owned companies with no appreciable foreign collaboration, as do most members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC.'' 
   The PSA's would give big oil in Iraq deals that would last for 30 to 40 years. These deals, the news reports point out, would force Iraq to share its oil wealth with Western outsiders, not their own people. Up to 70 percent of the profits would go to outside producers in the first years, and the news media points out that these deals could be enforced ahead of any social and economic reforms in Iraq and ahead of any social programs. One person quoted called it ``colonialism lite.'' 
   The President said it is not about oil. The prime minister said it is not about oil. They said Iraqi oil was for Iraqi people. But the legislation working its way through the Iraqi government is about nothing but Western access to the oil and its incredible wealth. The leaked drafts of the legislation show the West in a role with access and control, including a provision in the leaked draft document that would enable Western oil companies to transfer their wealth right out of Iraq. They don't have to leave it in Iraq at all. 
   Quoting directly from the leaked draft, ``A foreign person may repatriate its exports in accordance with foreign exchange regulations in force at the time.'' In fact, the language is so favorable to companies that they would be able to take every bit out and sell the rest to the world.  
   A vast amount of Iraq's wealth would be up for sale, by foreigners, to foreigners. 
   Quoting the leaked draft: ``It may freely transfer shares pertaining to any non-Iraqi partners.'' 
   The United States has been in Iraq for over 4 years already. 
   How long will we be there if western oil companies are given free rein to put a vice grip on Iraq's oil? 
   If western oil companies get a 30-year agreement, we may call Iraq the 30-year war. 
   The President said Iraq was all about democracy. News reports now give us a picture that say it might have been all about the oil. 
   Read the news reports and decide for yourself. 
   I include for the RECORD the article from The Independent.   
   Blood and Oil: How the West Will Profit From Iraq's Most Precious Commodity 
   So was this what the Iraq war was fought for, after all? As the number of US soldiers killed since the invasion rises past the 3,000 mark, and President George Bush gambles on sending in up to 30,000 more troops, The Independent on Sunday has learnt that the Iraqi government is about to push through a law giving Western oil companies the right to exploit the country's massive oil reserves. 
   And Iraq's oil reserves, the third largest in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels waiting to be extracted, are a prize worth having. As Vice-President Dick Cheney noted in 1999, when he was still running Halliburton, an oil services company, the Middle East is the key to preventing the world running out of oil. 
   Now, unnoticed by most amid the furore over civil war in Iraq and the hanging of Saddam Hussein, the new oil law has quietly been going through several drafts, and is now on the point of being presented to the cabinet and then the parliament in Baghdad. Its provisions are a radical departure from the norm for developing countries: under a system known as ``production-sharing agreements'', or PSAs, oil majors such as BP and Shell in Britain, and Exxon and Chevron in the US, would be able to sign deals of up to 30 years to extract Iraq's oil. 
   PSAs allow a country to retain legal ownership of its oil, but gives a share of profits to the international companies that invest in infrastructure and operation of the wells, pipelines and refineries. Their introduction would be a first for a major Middle Eastern oil producer. Saudi Arabia and Iran, the world's number one and two oil exporters, both tightly control their industries through state-owned companies with no appreciable foreign collaboration, as do most members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Opec. 
   Critics fear that given Iraq's weak bargaining position, it could get locked in now to deals on bad terms for decades to come. ``Iraq would end up with the worst possible outcome,'' said Greg Muttitt of Platform, a human rights and environmental group that monitors the oil industry. He said the new legislation was drafted with the assistance of BearingPoint, an American consultancy firm hired by the U.S. government, which had a representative working in the American embassy in Baghdad for several months. 
   ``Three outside groups have had far more opportunity to scrutinise this legislation than most Iraqis,'' said Mr. Muttitt. ``The draft went to the U.S. government and major oil companies in July, and to the International Monetary Fund in September. Last month I met a group of 20 Iraqi MPs in Jordan, and I asked them how many had seen the legislation. Only one had.'' 
   Britain and the United States have always hotly denied that the war was fought for oil. On 18 March 2003, with the invasion imminent, Tony Blair proposed the House of Commons motion to back the war. ``The oil revenues, which people falsely claim that we want to seize, should be put in a trust fund for the Iraqi people administered through the UN,'' he said. 
   ``The United Kingdom should seek a new Security Council Resolution that would affirm ..... the use of all oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people.'' 
   That suggestion came to nothing. In May 2003, just after President Bush declared major combat operations at an end, under a banner boasting ``Mission Accomplished'', Britain co-sponsored a resolution in the Security Council which gave the United States and UK control over Iraq's oil revenues. Far from ``all oil revenues'' being used for the Iraqi people, Resolution 1483 continued to make deductions from Iraq's oil earnings to pay compensation for the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
   That exception aside, however, the often-stated aim of the United States and Britain was that Iraq's oil money would be used to pay for reconstruction. In July 2003, for example, Colin Powell, then Secretary of State, insisted: ``We have not taken one drop of Iraqi oil for U.S. purposes, or for coalition purposes. Quite the contrary ..... It cost a great deal of money to prosecute this war. But the oil of the Iraqi people belongs to the Iraqi people; it is their wealth, it will be used for their benefit. So we did not do it for oil.'' 
   Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Defense Secretary at the time of the war and now head of the World Bank, told Congress: ``We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' 
   But this optimism has proved unjustified. Since the invasion, Iraqi oil production has dropped off dramatically. The country is now producing about two million barrels per day. That is down from a pre-war peak of 3.5 million barrels. Not only is Iraq's whole oil infrastructure creaking under the effects of years of sanctions, insurgents have constantly attacked pipelines, so that the only steady flow of exports is through the Shia-dominated south of the country. 
   Worsening sectarian violence and gangsterism have driven most of the educated elite out of the country for safety, depriving the oil industry of the Iraqi experts and administrators it desperately needs. 
   And even the present stunted operation is rife with corruption and smuggling. The Oil Ministry's inspector-general recently reported that a tanker driver who paid $500 in bribes to police patrols to take oil over the western or northern border would still make a profit on the shipment of $8,400. 
   ``In the present state, it would be crazy to pump in more money, just to be stolen,'' said Greg Muttitt. ``It's another reason not to bring in $20bn of foreign money now.'' 
   Before the war, Mr. Bush endorsed claims that Iraq's oil would pay for reconstruction. But the shortage of revenues afterwards has silenced him on this point. More recently he has argued that oil should be used as a means to unify the country, ``so the people have faith in central government'', as he put it last summer. 
   But in a country more dependent than almost any other on oil--it accounts for 70 per cent of the economy--control of the assets has proved a recipe for endless wrangling. Most of the oil reserves in areas controlled by the Kurds and Shias, heightening the fears of the Sunnis that their loss of power with the fall of Saddam is about to be compounded by economic deprivation. 
   The Kurds in particular have been eager to press ahead, and even signed some small PSA deals on their own last year, setting off a struggle with Baghdad. These issues now appear to have been resolved, however: a revenue-sharing agreement based on population  was reached some months ago, and sources have told the IoS that regional oil companies will be set up to handle the PSA deals envisaged by the new law. 
   The Independent on Sunday has obtained a copy of an early draft which was circulated to oil companies in July. It is understood there have been no significant changes made in the final draft. The terms outlined to govern future PSAs are generous: according to the draft, they could be fixed for at least 30 years. The revelation will raise Iraqi fears that oil companies will be able to exploit its weak state by securing favourable terms that cannot be changed in future. 
   Iraq's sovereign right to manage its own natural resources could also be threatened by the provision in the draft that any disputes with a foreign company must ultimately be settled by international, rather than Iraqi, arbitration. 
   In the July draft obtained by The Independent on Sunday, legislators recognise the controversy over this, annotating the relevant paragraph with the note, ``Some countries do not accept arbitration between a commercial enterprise and themselves on the basis of sovereignty of the state. `` 
   It is not clear whether this clause has been retained in the final draft. 
   Under the chapter entitled ``Fiscal Regime'', the draft spells out that foreign companies have no restrictions on taking their profits out of the country, and are not subject to any tax when doing this.  
   ``A Foreign Person may repatriate its exports proceeds [in accordance with the foreign exchange regulations in force at the time].'' Shares in oil projects can also be sold to other foreign companies: ``It may freely transfer shares pertaining to any non-Iraqi partners.'' The final draft outlines general terms for production sharing agreements, including a standard 12.5 per cent royalty tax for companies. 
   It is also understood that once companies have recouped their costs from developing the oil field, they are allowed to keep 20 percent of the profits, with the rest going to the government. According to analysts and oil company executives, this is because Iraq is so dangerous, but Dr Muhammad-Ali Zainy, a senior economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies, said: ``Twenty percent of the profits in a production sharing agreement, once all the costs have been recouped, is a large amount.'' In more stable countries, 10 percent would be the norm. 
   While the costs are being recovered, companies will be able to recoup 60 to 70 percent of revenue; 40 percent is more usual. David Horgan, managing director of Petrel Resources, an Aim-listed oil company focused on Iraq, said: ``They are reasonable rates of return, and take account of the bad security situation in Iraq. The government needs people, technology and capital to develop its oil reserves. It has got to come up with terms which are good enough to attract companies. The major companies tend to be conservative.'' 
   Dr. Zainy, an Iraqi who has recently visited the country, said: ``It's very dangerous ..... although the security situation is far better in the north.'' Even taking that into account, however, he believed that ``for a company to take 20 percent of the profits in a production-sharing agreement once all the costs have been recouped is large''. 
   He pointed to the example of Total, which agreed terms with Saddam Hussein before the second Iraq war to develop a huge field. Although the contract was never signed, the French company would only have kept 10 percent of the profits once the company had recovered its costs. 
   And while the company was recovering its costs, it is understood it agreed to take only 40 percent of the profits, the Iraqi government receiving the rest. 
   Production-sharing agreements of more than 30 years are unusual, and more commonly used for challenging regions like the Amazon where it can take up to a decade to start production. Iraq, in contrast, is one of the cheapest and easiest places in the world to drill for and produce oil. Many fields have already been discovered, and are waiting to be developed. 
   Analysts estimate that despite the size of Iraq's reserves--the third largest in the world--only 2,300 wells have been drilled in total, fewer than in the North Sea. 
   Confirmation of the generous terms--widely feared by international nongovernment organisations and Iraqis alike--have prompted some to draw parallels with the production-sharing agreements Russia signed in the 1990s, when it was bankrupt and in chaos. 
   At the time Shell was able to sign very favourable terms to develop oil and gas reserves off the coast of Sakhalin island in the far east of Russia. But at the end of last year, after months of thinly veiled threats from the environment regulator, the Anglo-Dutch company was forced to give Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom a share in the project. 
   Although most other oil experts endorsed the view that PSAs would be needed to kick-start exports from Iraq, Mr. Muttitt disagreed. ``The most commonly mentioned target has been for Iraq to increase production to 6 million barrels a day by 2015 or so,'' he said. ``Iraq has estimated that it would need $20bn to $25bn of investment over the next five or six years, roughly $4bn to $5bn a year. But even last year, according to reports, the Oil Ministry had between $3bn and $4bn it couldn't invest. The shortfall is around $lbn a year, and that could easily be made up if the security situation improved. 
   ``PSAs have a cost in sovereignty and future revenues. It is not true at all that this is the only way to do it.'' Technical services agreements, of the type common in countries which have a state-run oil corporation, would be all that was necessary. 
   James Paul of Global Policy Forum, another advocacy group, said: ``The U.S. and the UK have been pressing hard on this. It's pretty clear that this is one of their main goals in Iraq.'' The Iraqi authorities, he said, were ``a government under occupation, and it is highly influenced by that. The U.S. has a lot of leverage ..... Iraq is in no condition right now to go ahead and do this.'' 
   Mr. Paul added: ``It is relatively easy to get the oil in Iraq. It is nowhere near as complicated as the North Sea. There are super giant fields that are completely mapped, [and] there is absolutely no exploration cost and no risk. So the argument that these agreements are needed to hedge risk is specious.'' 
   One point on which all agree, however, is that only small, maverick oil companies are likely to risk any activity in Iraq in the foreseeable future. ``Production over the next year in Iraq is probably going to fall rather than go up,'' said Kevin Norrish, an oil analyst from Barclays. ``The whole thing is held together by a shoestring; it's desperate.'' 
   An oil industry executive agreed, saying: ``All the majors will be in Iraq, but they won't start work for years. Even Lukoil [of Russia], the Chinese and Total [of France] are not in a rush to endanger themselves. It's now very hard for U.S. and allied companies because of the disastrous war.'' 
   Mr. Muttitt echoed warnings that unfavourable deals done now could unravel a few years down the line, just when Iraq might become peaceful enough for development of its oil resources to become attractive. The seeds could be sown for a future struggle over natural resources which has led to decades of suspicion of Western motives in countries such as Iran. 
   Iraqi trade union leaders who met recently in Jordan suggested that the legislation would cause uproar once its terms became known among ordinary Iraqis. 
   ``The Iraqi people refuse to allow the future of their oil to be decided behind closed doors,'' their statement said. ``The occupier seeks and wishes to secure ..... energy resources at a time when the  Iraqi people are seeking to determine their own future, while still under conditions of occupation.'' 
   The resentment implied in their words is ominous, and not only for oil company executives in London or Houston. The perception that Iraq's wealth is being carved up among foreigners can only add further fuel to the flames of the insurgency, defeating the purpose of sending more American troops to a country already described in a U.S. intelligence report as a cause c&#233;le 2bre for terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, there is hardly anyone asking the right question at this time, and it is whether the U.S. involvement in Iraq will end as it did in Vietnam or last forever as it has in Korea. Last week, the President declared his intention to keep America in Iraq forever. That's a sure sign the President's been talking to the Vice President again. 
   Iraq looks nothing like Korea did in 1952. There is no DMZ and no 38th parallel separating the opposing forces. In Iraq, the war is everywhere. In Korea, the DMZ is one of South Korea's most popular tourist destinations, with buses hauling people back and forth. It's so popular you have to book the  trip weeks in advance. It costs $42, by the way, and that's without lunch. 
   At the DMZ, you can visit the small building where an armistice was signed, and risk stepping across a painted line on the floor separating North and South Korea, which remain technically at war. Is this the President's vision of Iraq? Hardly, but that's what he would like the American people to believe. 
   It sounds so simple and so safe and so utterly detached from Iraq, where every street corner in Baghdad is a war zone. The President wants an indefinite military presence in Iraq, but a majority of the Iraq parliament signed a petition demanding a timetable for the U.S. to leave, which the President ignores. 
   The President wants permanent military bases in Iraq despite the thoughtful and bipartisan conclusion of the Iraq Study Group. That group said, ``The United States can begin to shape a positive climate for its diplomatic efforts internationally and within Iraq, through public statements by President Bush that reject the notion that the United States seeks to control Iraq's oil or seeks permanent bases within Iraq.'' 
   But the President rejected their common sense and ordered the base building to go forward. What exactly are we protecting with the Iraqi people fleeing by the millions? South Korea never looked like this. 
   In Iraq, students graduating from college used to dream about getting a good job and raising a family. Now they dream of getting out of Iraq alive and as quickly as possible. 
   Just today, the United Nations issued a new report that says 4.2 million Iraqis have been displaced, half driven out of their homes by rampant and unrelenting bloodshed, and the other fleeing the country. It's estimated by the U.N. that 30,000 Iraqis cross into Syria every month, and Syria says the actual number is much higher. Jordan, meanwhile, has already taken over 1 million Iraqis. What have we done? We have granted 701 Iraqi refugees asylum in the United States. 
   The President recently announced we're willing to accept up to 7,000 Iraqis. Over 2 million Iraqis have fled their homeland so far, and we're going to take in a few thousand. 
   When we left Vietnam, we took hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese with us. Within a few months 130,000 Vietnamese had resettled here, and within a few years the number topped 320,000. These were our Vietnamese friends, people who had risked their lives to help us in Vietnam. We didn't desert them and they didn't desert us. 
   In Iraq, the President says we're willing to take a few thousand in a Nation losing millions of its people. The Iraqi people are fleeing their homes and their homeland in increasing numbers, flooding into nearby countries unable to cope with the refugee crisis. 
   Millions of peaceful, law-abiding Iraqis from its intellectual establishment, to its merchants, professionals, civil servants, and ordinary citizens are doing whatever they can to leave. And the President is doing everything he can to stay, building bases and demanding a so-called law to gain access to Iraqi's oil. 
   The President's stay-the-course strategy has evolved into his stay forever strategy. It hasn't worked before and it won't work now. 
   The President's military escalation is an absolute failure, and the sooner the President admits his mistake, the faster we can develop a national exit plan that protects our soldiers and gives Iraq back to the Iraq people, no strings or military bases attached. 
   Mr. Speaker, please pass the message to our President. It's time to bring the troops home. A hundred a month are dying, more and more. Last month, the third highest month in the war. It's not getting better. We've got to bring the troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we're here today to take a stand on behalf of low-income and vulnerable Americans who have been left out, shut out, dropped out or forced out of any chance at decent, affordable housing because of the predatory economic policies of this Administration. 
   Under the leadership of Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel, we have bipartisan legislation before us today that finally responds to the needs of the American people. 
   For too long, too many disadvantaged and vulnerable Americans have been forgotten, ignored or under-served when it came time to provide economic assistance. 
   For the first time in a long time we have legislation that recognizes and addresses the unique housing needs and circumstances of the working poor, and other vulnerable Americans. 
   We provide States and cities with incentives to ensure that low-income housing options remain available to those who need it most. 
   We increase the allocation of Federal low-income housing tax credits and expand the authority of States to issue tax-exempt bonds to help finance affordable housing. 
   Section 103 includes language to ensure that Federal assistance that helps vulnerable populations, like the elderly, the sick, and veterans, does not reduce the value of the Federal low-income housing tax credits used to finance affordable rental housing. 
   Section 104 allows for consideration of whether an affordable housing development employs technology and practices to improve its energy efficiency, when Federal low-income housing tax credits are allocated to affordable housing developments. 
   Section 104 also clarifies that students who were formerly in foster care are not precluded from renting affordable housing financed by Federal low-income housing tax credits. 
   This legislation touches the lives of real Americans who have been left behind or outright forgotten for too long. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. 
   If we fail to meet the needs of vulnerable Americans, then we will fail to live up to our responsibility of governing on behalf of all people.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the President is going to talk to the congressional leaders about Iraq. It is his way of trying to defuse the will of the American people. He is going to talk about his vision for a military victory in Iraq. He is going to talk about his military escalation and how well it is working. 
   He is not going to talk about the bombing in the Green Zone last week, or the fact that about 3 hours ago there were 127 Iraqis killed by a suicide bomber. And it is only early morning. There is plenty of time left in this day. 
   The President will say there are good days and there are bad days. In truth, there are only bad days, and worse days in Iraq. 
   The only thing worth talking about is protecting our soldiers by getting them out of the Iraq quagmire. That is the only discussion worth having, because setting a timetable is the only way to protect and defend the U.S. soldiers he keeps sending into harm's way. 
   Don't give him an inch, Mr. Speaker. Bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (DRUM BEATS OF WAR ARE GROWING LOUDER -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the drum beats of war are growing louder. There is a growing fear here and around the world that the President, either alone or by proxy, will order a military strike against Iran. 
   The President has escalated the military presence in Iraq at the same time he has escalated the military rhetoric concerning Iran. The President's accusations against Iran are being planted like seeds in fertile ground. Is this how the President cultivates diplomacy, or is he sowing the seeds for another war? 
   The House must pass legislation that would require a debate and a vote before the President orders U.S. Forces to launch a military strike against Iran. This is the people's House, and the American people have spoken. They don't trust the President, and they are worried about his saber rattling toward Iran. 
   I think of it this way: If Iraq is a quagmire, and it is, then Iran will be quicksand, with America sinking deeper and deeper into a disastrous foreign policy grounded in brute force and producing brutal consequences: thousands of American soldiers dead, tens of thousands of American soldiers gravely wounded, billions of dollars borrowed and wasted, over 100,000 Iraqi civilians killed and injured, a raging civil war. 
   And after all that, the President and the Vice President say a military option is on the table for Iran. To prove it, U.S. warships were ordered into the Gulf 2 weeks ago. It was a show of military might around the date that the Russian military intelligence sources have widely forecast that the U.S. would strike Iran in stories posted online and in newspapers. 
   The current political regime in Iran is a government I do not endorse or support, but the record must show that the President's policies in Iraq created the problem the President now warns he will fix by military action, if necessary. 
   After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the President installed Paul Bremer as America's de facto premier of Iraq. Mr. Bremer answered only to the White House and not to the Iraqi people. Bremer dictated a series of policies that dismantled Iraq from the inside out. With the White House calling his every move, Bremer first dismantled the Iraqi civil society, plunging an entire nation into chaos. The Iraqi civilians who ran everything from sewage treatment plants to traffic control to keeping the lights on were summarily fired. The country's infrastructure remains crippled by Bremer's order 4 years later. Bremer also dismissed Iraq's military, and in so doing, he put tens of thousands of demoralized Iraqis on the streets with a gun and a grudge. The vast majority of these people were in the military for the pay and the job, not because they supported Saddam. 
   With Iraqi civil and military sectors wiped out over 4 years ago, there were no Iraqis left to guard the borders between Iraq and Syria and Iraq and Iran. The borders have been wide open ever since because the appointed proxy government didn't bother to understand the history of the region or a basic national security need to protect a nation's borders. 
   We know weapons and insurgents have been walking across Iraq's open borders. Almost a year ago, leaders told me in Amman, and these are Iraqi leaders, that the most constructive thing the U.S. could do would be to withdraw from the cities and redeploy to the borders and establish border guards. 
   Instead of doing something constructive, the President ordered a military escalation in Iraq that is destructive. The Iraqi people want us out of Iraq. The American people want us out of Iraq. But the President drives us deeper and deeper into Iraq and then threatens military action against Iran.  
   As a lame duck President and as slave to his own failed foreign policy, Congress must ensure that the President cannot unilaterally strike Iran in the remaining months of his failed presidency. Congress must pass legislation that preserves the checks and balances to guarantee that the President must listen to someone other than the Vice President.     
   America cannot afford to remain on a hair trigger until a new President takes the oath of office in January 2009, but that is exactly what will happen unless Congress steps up to ensure that the President stands down on a military strike against Iran. We must take away his blank check.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (U.S. CASUALTIES IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to Dana Milbank at the Washington Post and to Hal Bernton at one of my hometown newspapers, The Seattle Times. These two journalists, writing almost exactly 4 years apart, have pierced the veil of secrecy this administration shamefully uses to hide the painful images of U.S. casualties in Iraq and the touching and patriotic farewells by loved ones. 
   On Sunday, April 18, 2004, Bernton wrote a story called: The Somber Task of Honoring the Fallen. This poignant story included the first newspaper pictures of caskets being loaded into a military airplane. The story, which I will enter into the Record, set off a firestorm, because the administration did not want anyone to see the grim reality of war--rows of flag-draped coffins inside a military plane to begin the last homecoming. And the civilian contractor who took the pictures was fired for sharing them with the media. They were published at a time when the administration was doing everything to make people believe in its May 1, 2003, Mission Accomplished banner. 
   The administration continues to spin the message from that phony PR event. To do that, the administration continues to hide the grim reality of the Iraq war. Last Thursday, Milbank wrote a story in the Washington Post called: What the Family Would Let You See, the Pentagon Obstructs. Almost 4 years later after The Seattle Times story, the American people are still denied access to the truth. 
   Behind me is a photograph of Lieutenant Colonel Billy Hall from the Post story. Let me read an excerpt from that story: 
   ``The family of 38-year-old Hall, who leaves behind two young daughters and two stepsons, gave their permission for the media to cover his Arlington burial--a decision many grieving families make so that the nation will learn about their loved ones' sacrifice. But the military had other ideas, and they arranged the marine's burial yesterday so that no sound, and few images, would make it into the public domain.'' 
   They don't want you to see the faces of our fallen heroes, and in my view that's outrageous. Lieutenant Colonel Hall is the highest ranking military officer to fall in Iraq. He went to Garfield High School in Seattle. He deserves to be buried according to the wishes of his family, not hidden from view, because the people running this war only want you to see the images that proclaim Mission Accomplished. I will not accept this disrespect for our soldiers and their families, or the outright distortion of the truth about the war. To honor our fallen heroes, I and many of my colleagues here in Washington have easels outside our congressional offices with pictures and the names of service men and women who have died in Iraq. 
   Outside my office, there are three boards with the photographs of 94 soldiers from the State of Washington who have fallen in Iraq. Brave fallen heroes, including: 
   Specialist Christopher W. Dickison, 
   Major William G. Hall, 
   Lance Corporal Daniel Chavez, 
   1st Lieutenant Michael R. Adams, 
   Specialist Joshua M. Boyd, 
   Staff Sergeant Tracy L. Melvin, 
   Sergeant 1st Class Steven M. Langmack, all from Seattle. 
   I will enter into the Record the Web address where you can see the faces and the names of the fallen from every State: 
   http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/search/ 
   Instead of helping to provide closure to these wounded families, the President's surrogates are deepening the wounds for these families. They only want to share their grief and the pride in their loved ones. Who wouldn't be proud of Billy Hall? They want to share that with us. 
   Today, in full view, let us honor the ultimate sacrifice made by Lieutenant Colonel Billy Hall and the fallen soldiers from Washington and across this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (VICE PRESIDENT SHOULD RESIGN OR FACE IMPEACHMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, it is time for a new exit strategy, one that removes the Vice President of the United States from office, voluntarily, if he chooses, but by impeachment if he stonewalls. 
   The time has come for the Vice President to go. Our Nation and our national security interests at home and abroad cannot afford to have this Vice President one heartbeat away from the Presidency. As it stands now, the Vice President's damage to U.S. interests, security, system of government and our position at home and abroad will take years to overcome. 
   As my constituents in the State of Washington's Seventh Congressional District know, I have struggled mightily with this matter for a long time. In grave matters facing our Nation, I believe conscience and a deep respect for our system of government should guide our actions and words. 
   I didn't hesitate to speak the truth to power before the invasion of Iraq, despite the bitter partisan acts that I knew would follow. I have no doubt that I will be targeted for a new round of shelling after these remarks. 
   The intent of this administration and this Vice President has been to silence all dissent, and it always happens the same way; relentless attacks until people ask themselves, do I want to subject myself to that kind of hell if I speak out? Fear is what kept this administration in office in 2004, and fear is the only public discourse this administration understands and practices. Why debate, when you can dictate? Why follow the law, when you can act like you are above the law? 
   For months, I believed that impeachment was a dire course of action. Over these same months, I have seen the haven't repeatedly drive our Nation into increasingly dire situations in Iraq, Iran and within our country as he tramples on the Constitution like it was a doormat. 
   For months I have considered if America would best be served by bringing forth articles of impeachment against the Vice President. I kept asking myself, is the Vice President's conduct that dire, because impeachment is the closest thing there is to internment on political death row. 
   The Founders intended impeachment to be used when those running the government forgot that they worked for the people, and the Founders intended impeachment to be used when toughs running the government acted as though they were above the law. 
   When you look at the record, you have to conclude that the Vice President has placed himself above the law. He holds himself accountable only to special interests, who meet with him in secret with no record kept of who was there, what was discussed or what promises the Vice President made. 
   For the last 4 years, the Vice President has refused to allow routine office inspections by a Federal agency regarding the safe handling of America's secrets. The Vice President defies the Information Security Oversight Agency, claiming he is not part of the executive branch of government. When a sitting Vice President claims that he is not part of the executive branch of government to which he was elected, it is time to remove him. 
   The Vice President holds himself accountable to no one. He ordered the Secret Service to destroy visitors logs, and we have learned in the Washington Post recently, that the Vice President circumvented every check and balance inside the White House to force through his own agenda, to spy on Americans through illegal wire traps, creating the gulag at Guantanamo, and subverting civil liberties and free speech at every turn. 
   Since the President permits the flagrant disregard of the Constitution, it is up to the Congress to act and defend the American people. With each new revelation, America has seen only glints of what has been done totally in secret. 
   For all we don't know, this much we do know: The Vice President holds himself above the law, and it is time for the Congress to enforce the law. I believe the evidence is overwhelming and the articles of impeachment against the Vice President should be drawn up. 
   The Vice President likes to say the military option is on the table. Tonight it is time to say the impeachment option is on the table. 
   I am adding my name to H.R. 333, calling for the impeachment. For the good of the Nation, the Vice President should leave office immediately. Call it a medical condition, call it a political condition, call it what it is; the departure of a person who forgot that he works for the American people. 
   The Vice President must either resign or face impeachment.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (WE SHOULDN'T USE FORCE AGAINST IRAN -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the sounds we are hearing and the signals we are seeing from the administration remind me of the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq. For all those supporters of the President who claimed 6 years ago that military intervention in Iraq would be the U.S.'s last option, we now know the war was the first, preordained and only option of the administration. They just had to cook the books to make the American people believe otherwise. 
   America has paid a very steep price: America has lost lives; Iraqis have lost lives; $1 trillion lost; American moral leadership in the world lost. And we cannot afford to let this administration do it again with a military strike against Iran before the President and Vice President leave office in January. 
   The news of late is deeply troubling, and we have a responsibility to remind the Americans of the administration's penchant to conduct diplomacy with bullets and bombs. 
   I believe the people have the right to know and the right to demand this administration, and the Republican ticket for the Presidency, declare there be no military strike against Iran by U.S. forces or on our behalf by a U.S. ally like Israel unless the Congress votes for it. 
   My concerns come directly out of the reporting by credible, mainstream international news organizations that have built their reputation on credibility. 
   I enter into the Record a September 1 story from the Jerusalem Post. The headline is: ``Dutch intel: U.S. to strike Iran in coming weeks.''  
   Dutch Intel: U.S. To Strike Iran in Coming Weeks  
   The Dutch intelligence service, the AIVD, has called off an operation aimed at infiltrating and sabotaging Iran's weapons industry due to an assessment that a U.S. attack on the Islamic Republic's nuclear program is imminent, according to a report in the country's De Telegraaf newspaper on Friday. 
   The report claimed that the Dutch operation had been ``extremely successful,'' and had been stopped because the U.S. military was planning to hit targets that were ``connected with the Dutch espionage action.'' 
   The impending air-strike on Iran was to be carried out by unmanned aircraft ``within weeks,'' the report claimed, quoting ``well placed'' sources. 
   The Jerusalem Post could not confirm the De Telegraaf report. 
   According to the report, information gleaned from the AIVD's operation in Iran has provided several of the targets that are to be attacked in the strike, including ``parts for missiles and launching equipment.'' 
   ``Information from the AIVD operation has been shared in recent years with the CIA,'' the report said. 
   On Saturday, Iran's Deputy Chief of Staff General Masoud Jazayeri warned that should the United States or Israel attack Iran, it would be the start of another World War. 
   On Friday, Ma'ariv reported that Israel had made a strategic decision to deny Iran military nuclear capability and would not hesitate ``to take whatever means necessary'' to prevent Teheran from achieving its nuclear goals. 
   According to the report, whether the United States and Western countries succeed in thwarting the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions diplomatically, through sanctions, or whether a U.S. strike on Iran is eventually decided upon, Jerusalem has begun preparing for a separate, independent military strike.  
   I also enter into the Record the August 29 Jerusalem Post story entitled, ``Israel reaches strategic decision not to let Iran go nuclear.''  
   Israel Reaches Strategic Decision Not To Let Iran Go Nuclear  
   Israel will not agree to allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons and if the grains start running out in the proverbial egg timer, Jerusalem will not hesitate to take whatever means necessary to prevent Iran from achieving its nuclear goals, the government has recently decided in a special discussion. 
   According to the Israeli daily Ma'ariv, whether the United States and Western countries will succeed in toppling the ayatollah regime diplomatically, through sanctions, or whether an American strike on Iran will eventually be decided upon, Jerusalem has put preparations for a separate, independent military strike by Israel in high gear. 
   So far, Israel has not received American authorization to use U.S.-controlled Iraqi airspace, nor has the defense establishment been successful in securing the purchase of advanced U.S.-made warplanes which could facilitate an Israeli strike. 
   The Americans have offered Israel permission to use a global early warning radar system, implying that the U.S. is pushing Israel to settle for defensive measures only. 
   Because of Israel's lack of strategic depth, Jerusalem has consistently warned over the pat years it will not settle for a `wait and see' approach and retaliate in case of attack, but rather use preemption to prevent any risk of being hit in the first place. 
   Ephraim Sneh a veteran Labor MK which has left the party recently, has sent a document to both U.S. presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama. The eight-point document states that ``there is no government in Jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear Iran. When it is clear Iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons, an Israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered.'' 
   According to Ma'ariv, Sneh offered the two candidates the ``sane, cheap and the only option that does not necessitate bloodshed.'' To prevent Iran's nuclear aspirations, Sneh wrote, ``real'' sanctions applied in concert by the U.S. and Europe is necessary. A total  embargo in spare parts for the oil industry and a total boycott of Iranian banks will topple, within a short time, the regime which is already pressured by a sloping economy and would be toppled by the Iranian people if they would have outside assistance. 
   The window of opportunity Sneh suggests is a year and a half to two years, until 2010. 
   Sneh also visited Switzerland and Austria last week in an attempt to lobby those two states. Both countries have announced massive long-term investments in Iranian gas and oil fields for the next decade. 
   ``Talk of the Jewish Holocaust and Israel's security doesn't impress these guys,'' Sneh said wryly. 
   Hearing his hosts speak of their future investments, Sneh replied quietly ``it's a shame, because Ido will light all this up.'' He was referring to Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, the recently appointed commander of the Israeli Air Force and the man most likely to be the one to orchestrate Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, should this become the necessity. 
   ``Investing in Iran in 2008,'' Sneh told his Austrian hosts, ``is like investing in Krups Steelworks in 1938, it's a high risk investment.'' The Austrians, according to Sneh, turned pale. 
   In related news, Israel Radio reported that Iran has finished installing an additional 4,000 centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The Islamic Republic also announced it will install an additional 3,000 centrifuges in coming months. 
   The pan-Arabic Al Kuds al Arabi reported Friday that Iran has equipped Hizbullah with longer range missiles than those it had before the Second Lebanon War and also improved the terror group's targeting capabilities. 
   According to the report, which The Jerusalem Post could not verify independently, Hizbullah would begin a massive rocket onslaught on targets reaching deep into Israel's civilian underbelly in case the Jewish State would launch an attack on Iran.  
   These and other news stories should remind us that this administration remains in office for several months but years ago forfeited their trust with the American people over the Iraq War. 
   What is especially worrisome to me is that the administration has shifted the Iraq war to the air in an effort to make it an antiseptic war that might be more acceptable to the American people. We're grateful that U.S. casualties in Iraq are down significantly, but when a war should never have been started, every single casualty is a price too high. 
   And today, the U.S. is an unwelcome occupier, and the administration is ignoring the wishes of the elected Iraqi Government to set a date to leave. Instead, the White House is trying to run their country and continue this war. 
   Bombs falling from 30,000 feet have the same devastating impact on innocent Iraq civilians as bullets and bombs at street level. We just don't hear about it much in the American news media. But I hear about it from people in the Middle East who wonder if we will ever leave Iraq and worry that an antiseptic aerial war will be used against Iran. 
   Where once we stood tall on the moral high ground, now decent people the world over question our motives, our resolve, and our moral leadership. They fear, and so do I, that this administration will make the calculation that as long as we drop bombs from 30,000 feet, or fire cruise missiles from 300 miles offshore, the American people can be misled into another war. We must not let that happen. 
   The current leadership in Iran has few, if any, friends in this House today, and I am not one of them. But we cannot solve every challenge that confronts us with military confrontation. And we cannot meet other challenges when our moral high ground has turned into the shifting sands during this administration. 
   When Russia invades Georgia, who in the world is going to listen to the rhetoric of a U.S. President who invaded Iraq? 
   When Iraq says set a timetable to leave and this President says no, who in the world is going to listen to a President who says Iraq is a sovereign Nation? 
   And when this administration says they aren't planning a military strike against Iran, why would anyone in the world believe it when the fine print says all the options are still on the table? 
   Instead of occupying Iraq, the U.S. should be occupying the moral high ground, and we can start by stopping any effort to use force against Iran. Let's do it today before it's too late. We need, Mr. Speaker, a vote before we do anything against Iran.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, with the clock winding down on the President's second term, this seems like a good time to stroll down memory lane, looking back on America then and now. 
   Under this President the number of Americans without health care has risen from 38 million to 46 million. Under this President the price of gasoline has risen from less than $1.50 a gallon to $4 a gallon. Under this President the unemployment rate has risen to over 6 percent, with millions more Americans out of work and running out of help. Under this President the prices that Americans pay for food, fuel, college, transportation, and medical costs have risen by 25 percent. And let's not forget that mortgage foreclosures are rising while housing prices are falling, like a rock. This President has been willing to bail out Wall Street but never mind Main Street. 
   Strolling down memory lane can be very educational, especially when you consider the President is running for an unprecedented third term. They talk about change, but only the names will change. The Republican ``wreck-o-nomic'' policies that created this economic disaster will remain exactly the same. That's not nostalgia; that's a promise from this administration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, next week Luis Carriles is scheduled to stand trial for allegedly lying to immigration authorities when he entered the United States 2 years ago. 
   Most Americans have probably never heard of Carriles, but everyone should know the real case against him because it shows the double standard of the Bush administration and its so-called commitment to fight terrorism. 
   Carriles is being prosecuted for an immigration violation in America, but he has been convicted in other nations for acts of terrorism, including the downing of a commercial Cuban airliner over 30 years ago that killed 33 innocent people. He is a wanted international fugitive. The Bush administration knows this, but instead of turning Carriles over to the sovereign Governments of Cuba or Venezuela, as they have asked, we are going to get him on an immigration violation. 
   Why is the Bush administration handling Carilles in this way? Three letters say it all: CIA. 
   Carriles was a CIA agent. He was part of the Bay of Pigs debacle, and his fierce opposition to Cuban President Fidel Castro has been reported by the media. 
   Officially, Carriles left the CIA in the middle of 1976. That is the year that Luis Carriles was convicted in Venezuela of masterminding the downing of the Cuban airplane. 
   The administration won't reveal what role Carriles played as a CIA agent or what his assignments were. His shadowy connections to the United States Government almost certainly continued after he and the agency parted ways. The media has reported that Carriles helped funnel U.S. supplies to the Contra rebels attempting to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua in the 1980s. 
   Carriles himself has personally boasted of a role in the deadly bombings of hotels in Havana, Cuba, in the 1990s. And Carriles was also convicted in Panama in the year 2000 for a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. He was sentenced to prison, but he was later pardoned and set free. 
   You would think that capturing a man like this would have the administration calling a news conference to declare their success in the war on terror with a long-sought terrorist in custody. Not so. Instead, the administration is busy trying to get a court to bar him from testifying about what he did for the CIA. Carriles' lawyers have said his client will talk about that, and the assignments during and after his official employment. One of the CIA directors during the time of Carriles' connection to the agency was former President George H. W. Bush, the President's father. 
   The American people have a right to know what really happened in the 1970s and what role, if any, the United States played in the deadly games of Carriles. Was he a rogue agent or was he acting on CIA orders? 
   The Cuban Government wants him, but we are not talking to Havana as long as Castro is alive and in power. Venezuela, which has an 80-year-old extradiction treaty with the United States, has repeatedly asked for Carriles. But the President isn't talking to Venezuela, either, so those requests have been denied.

   The Republican House leader apparently finds the First Amendment inconvenient for his taste. The First Amendment protects Americans from exactly the kind of foolish proposal before us today. Separation of Church and State is one of the fundamental principles within the First Amendment: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .....'' 
   We must not roll back civil rights in this Nation, not today, not tomorrow, and not ever, but that's what the I leader of the Republican party proposes. There is no reason to justify this attempt to roll back longstanding civil rights and religious liberty protections in a program that has benefited countless children over the years. In a nation like ours with so many religious traditions, built-in protections prohibiting religious discrimination in federally funded programs represents a fundamental commitment towards a society that values the contributions of people of all faiths. 
   Religious organizations have had a long and proud history in Head Start programs, including in my own district of Seattle, where the YWCA is a Head Start provider. Civil rights protections have never been a bar to participation by these organizations. If these safeguards are repealed, thousands of dedicated Head Start teachers and parent volunteers could find themselves no longer welcome at some Head Start programs run by followers of other faiths. 
   Religious organizations are free to engage in faith-based hiring when they use their own funds to promote their institutional ministry, but not when they use Federal money to educate our Nation's children. It would be wrong to permit religious organizations to use Federal dollars to discriminate on the basis of religion in running Head Start programs that are intended to benefit disadvantaged children of all faiths. 
   On behalf of the people of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., County, in Washington State, I strongly oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ``No.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I think the torch of the Statue of Liberty might just be burning a little brighter today because we are soon going to send to the President a bill that helps the most vulnerable on our shores, refugees coming to America fleeing persecution, injustice, torture and even the threat of death. They are Jews from the former Soviet Union, Kurds from Iraq, Hmong fighters from Vietnam and other oppressed peoples from around the globe. 
   Refugees often flee their home countries with little more than their clothes on their backs. When they are disabled or elderly, employment can be difficult, which means they face almost complete destitution without assistance. Our Nation's program that is designed to help low-income elderly and disabled individuals, the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI, now terminates assistance to these refugees after they have been in the United States for 7 years. This cutoff was designed with the expectation that refugees would become citizens within this time frame and would then be eligible for continued benefits. However, a series of obstacles make that transition to citizenship difficult within the 7-year limit of SSI benefits. First, a refugee must live in the United States for at least 5 years before they are even eligible to submit an application for citizenship. A refugee must then confront a lengthy application process which takes up to 3 to 4 years. Backlogs in processing citizenship applications have been caused by a variety of issues, including protracted background checks put in place after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
   There are other barriers to citizenship, such as the continuing impact of a recent annual cap on the number of asylees who may become legal permanent residents, a status which asylees must maintain for 4 years before they submit an application for citizenship.     
   Also, many disabled and elderly refugees encounter difficulties navigating the application process, which includes both an English language test and a U.S. civics test. 
   We passed bipartisan legislation a year ago in the House to extend SSI benefits for refugees and other humanitarian immigrants. The legislation before us today is that same bill sent back to us with an amendment by the Senate. The most significant modification by the Senate was to require all refugees to sign an affidavit that they are making a good faith effort to become U.S. citizens. 
   This bill, H.R. 2608, would generally extend SSI benefits for an additional 2 years for disabled and elderly refugees, asylees and other qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits have expired in the past. Benefits could be extended for an additional time for those awaiting a decision on the pending application for citizenship. These policies would be in effect through 2011 and would restore SSI benefits for roughly 20,000 refugees. 
   The legislation completely offsets the cost of this SSI extension for refugees with a provision that would reduce Federal tax refunds to recover fraudulent unemployment insurance payments. This Federal tax revenue offset authority already exists to collect unpaid child support, unpaid State taxes and debts owed to Federal agencies. 
   Before pursuing a tax offset, a State would be required to notify the individual and provide them with at least 60 days to contest the amount being recovered. By catching and reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, this provision not only offsets the cost of SSI extension for refugees, but it also would reduce unemployment taxes on employers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the legislation will cut payroll taxes by $315 million over the next 10 years. 
   Madam Speaker, refugees come to this country fleeing persecution. They reside in our country legally, and those eligible for SSI are disabled, elderly or both. This legislation extends a modest benefit to help them provide for their most basic essentials. The bill will not add one dime to the Federal deficit, and it will even provide a tax cut. This combination has generated very broad support for the measure, which passed the House unanimously last year and did likewise in the Senate last month. Additionally, the Bush administration has proposed the same policies in the President's budget. 
   I would like to expressly thank my colleague, Mr. Weller, the ranking member, for working with me to forge this bipartisan bill. Today's action is the last step needed to provide a helping hand to those who need it most. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill allows Members to accomplish three objectives with a single vote, help needy refugees, cut taxes and reduce the Federal deficit. That's a trifecta that should draw support from every Member of the House. 
   But I want to conclude, really, with a story about one of the witnesses who came before our subcommittee. His came was K'Keng, and he fought alongside American forces during the Vietnam War. In fact, he was recruited and trained by our own special forces. 
   After the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, he was imprisoned for 6 years as a political prisoner, after which he ultimately made his transfer to the United States as a refugee. He tried working, but the wounds he had suffered during the war made that difficult. 
   Based on his disability, and the fact that he had almost no source of income, he began receiving supplemental security income, or SSI benefits. For those benefits, he had those benefits, but they were terminated when he reached the 7-year limit on SSI for refugees. 
   There are thousands of other refugees who have taken different paths to get here, but their basic story is the same. They fled persecution, they now reside legally in the United States, they are disabled or elderly, and they need our help. 
   This bill will provide them just the assistance, without raising the Federal deficit by a single dime. In fact, the anti-fraud provisions in this bill reduce the debt by nearly $100 million and cut taxes by over $300 million. 
   I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation, to help the needy, cut taxes and reduce our debt. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1432) supporting the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by promoting national awareness of adoption and the children in foster care awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved in adoption, recognizing current programs and efforts designed to promote adoption, and encouraging people in the United States to seek improved safety, permanency, and well-being for all children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, far too many of our Nation's most vulnerable children long for nothing more than a safe and permanent place to call home. 
   As the de facto parents of foster children, it's our responsibility to ensure that each child who is unable to safely return home to their biological parents has the ability to achieve permanency through adoption. Sadly, too many children are languishing in the foster care system for far too long as they wait to be adopted. 
   There are currently 129,000 children who are waiting to be adopted out of foster care. These children, on average, will have to wait nearly two-and-a-half years in the foster care system before they are adopted by the family. A minute can be a lifetime in the eyes of a child. Imagine how a child feels as they wait nearly two-and-a-half years for a family to pick them. 
   Representative Weller and I introduced bipartisan legislation, which just passed the House, which would provide a variety of policy initiatives aimed at increasing the number of children who are adopted from the foster care system. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act extends, expands, and improves the Adoption Incentives Program. This successful program provides financial bonuses to States that increase the number of children adopted out of foster care. 
   I have to add that, sort of parenthetically, I started the subsidized adoption program in the Washington State legislature in 1971. There has been a very uneven spread of that concept across the States in this United States. So it's important that we at the Federal level set the standard and say to States, here's some money if you will think about doing subsidized adoptions for these kids. 
   Since the inception of this program, nearly 440,000 children have been adopted out of the foster care system. 
   The bill also would provide additional incentives for States to continue to increase the number of children who leave the foster care system for permanency through adoption or through guardianship placement with a grandparent or a relative caregiver. 
   Additionally, the legislation would provide adoption subsidy assistance to all special-needs kids--these are the ones that are the hardest to get adopted--rather than those children whose birth parents were eligible for welfare under rules that were in place in 1996. 
   The bill expands Federal adoption assistance by delinking eligibility for assistance from the now defunct AFDC program and by phasing in adoption subsidy to children by their age and their length of time in foster care. 
   And finally, the legislation would provide direct Federal adoption assistance to tribal governments who run their own child welfare programs. Tribal governments would be able to access the same service that is now available to the States. Such services will allow tribal governments to increase the number of Native American children that are adopted out of the tribal foster care systems. 
   The month of November marks National Adoption Month, and that's what this resolution is really all about.  As we celebrate the countless families who have opened their homes and their hearts to children who are in need of a home, I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting the goals and the ideals of National Adoption Month. 
   Every child deserves nothing less than a safe and loving place to call home. By working together in a bipartisan fashion, we can do our part to ensure permanency and success for all the children. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Mr. Weller on these two bills and this resolution through the Congress. And certainly I have enjoyed working with him and have never felt that any courtesy I've extended him has been anything but reciprocal in our dealings. However, there has been on the floor here some discussion of some extraneous material that I struggle to hear how the connection was to adoption subsidies or options or foster kids, but I'm sure there was one someplace there--all the speakers at least mentioned it sort of in passing and then went on to talk about energy. 
   Now, as these adoptive parents, many of them ordinary folks, want to drive down to get the child at the adoption agency, they're going to have to buy gasoline. And gasoline has gotten out of control. Lots of people want to blame oil companies or speculators or a lot of other things. And the question is, do you really want to help those people? 
   Now, there is going to be a stimulus package coming out. And if we put gas stamps in it--the average person under 300 percent of poverty will spend $1,000 more a year for gasoline, so if we gave them gas stamps like we give them food stamps for $500, we could cut that price in half. And I hope that all my colleagues on the other side, if that happens to be in the stimulus package, will consider voting for it this time. 
   There is a question in my mind, however, about the description of what went on last night. It's as though the Democrats didn't propose anything. It's as though we just sort of walked around and fiddled around and looked at the sky. But, in fact, there was a very good proposal here on the floor. There was money for renewable energy standards. There was money for strategic energy reserve to be invested in renewable energy. There was royalty reform. Can you believe that the oil companies never give any money to the Federal Government? 
   And this bill last night said, look, we want to repeal the tax subsidies and make the oil companies pay their fair share for drilling on public lands. Now, that's land that belongs to you and me and the foster kids and the children who are being adopted. But the oil companies have some idea that they don't think they should have to pay any royalty when they suck the oil out and then sell it to us at four bucks a gallon. Now, that seems like a good proposal. 
   We also paid for the bill last night by taking $18 billion that was allowed in a loophole several years ago. We closed that loophole and said we're going to use it to do the future development of renewable energy in this country that needs to be done. 
   Now, by contrast, the Boehner bill that was brought out here had no payment for anything, just increase the national debt. That is the Republican plan for this country: Do whatever you want, spend whatever you want, drive up the national debt, and leave it for these foster kids and these adopted kids. They're going to pay for it. Most of the Members in here will be dead before we get anywhere near paying for the debt that's been driven up by this Congress. And yesterday's oil bill was just more of the same. 
   Now, the other part of it that's really sort of interesting, our bill required actually using the leases that they already have, sort of ``use it or lose it.'' They have millions of acres under lease, but they want to get something more out there somewhere, I don't know. If you go out 50 miles off the coast of California and Washington State, you're at about 10,000 feet. If you think you're going to drill for oil out there, you have never been on the West coast of this country and looked at what we have for an ocean. 
   So, this business about ``drill, drill, drill, oh, good, drill, drill, drill,'' it makes a nice slogan, probably goes on a bumper strip pretty well, but the basic assumption behind that bumper strip is that the American people are stupid. It seems like the Republican Party thinks that the American people are stupid, and if they can just get into chanting, ``drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill,'' that somehow the price of gasoline will come down. I don't know if that is some kind of a mantra, maybe it's some kind of magical thing they got from a witch doctor somewhere. But drilling everywhere is not going to bring down the price of gasoline. 
   We've seen in the last month gasoline go from $150 a barrel down to wherever it is today, somewhere below $100. And has gasoline dropped by 33 percent? Is gasoline down to $3 or down to $2.70? And why did it come down? Because we drilled? No. Because the speculators got worried. The speculators got worried that Americans were getting smart and they were figuring ways to get around without using gasoline. And so consumption has come down in this country, and suddenly the speculators are really worried. 
   What if the American people don't do what we expect them to do? What if they don't buy big gas guzzlers anymore? They buy cars that get 35-40 miles per gallon. I drove from my house in Seattle to Spokane for the State convention, over the Cascade Mountains, over 5,000-foot peaks, and you know what? I got 49.5 miles per gallon. 
   Now, the oil companies are really worried that a lot of people are going to start doing that, and so the speculation on where the price of oil is going to be started coming down. But it didn't affect anything at the pump--maybe 10 cents, maybe five cents, who knows. But we didn't drill a single bit, and yet the gasoline prices came down. So what is it that makes them go up and what makes them go down? 
   Nothing in this bill from Mr. Boehner has anything whatsoever to say about speculation or about oil company profits, not one single word. All he says is, open it up, let them drill anywhere they want. Let them go and sink a drill. In fact, we got some votes out of the Republicans because they actually were drilling in places where the military said this kind of creates a problem, please don't drill there; don't let that area be open for drilling. 
   And so when people come out here and stand out here and say over and over again, ``we have to drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, that's going to fix it all,'' they haven't looked at our bill. 
   Now, the Senate is over there, and they're going to send us over a bill here shortly to extend the tax credits on wind and on solar and on geothermal because they know that renewable energy is the way this country has to go. We are not going to solve our problem by drilling inside the Continental Shelf of the United States. 
   If the President wanted to bring gas prices down, all he would have to do is release some of the oil out of the oil reserve. We've got millions of gallons of gasoline sitting out there. And if the market truly is what we say it is, if there is more supply, then the price should come down. Well, dump some of that reserve out onto the market. It was done once before and gasoline dropped about 15 cents a gallon, but not under this President. They want to keep it up there and keep talking about drilling because this administration has been an oil administration from the very first week. When the Vice President of the United States had in his office a great conference with all the oil people in this country and has kept secret for 8 solid years what was decided there, you have to wonder about what's happened to this country and the average taxpayer and the average person in this society. 
   So we're here today to deal with a few problems of some kids. And I really appreciate the efforts that have gone in by the bipartisan support on the committee. And I don't really like to get out here and talk like this, but you just can't stand here or sit here and listen to that baloney without ultimately saying, do they really care, or is it just about winning an election? Is it looking for a bumper strip that will work and that the American people will hear ``drill, drill, drill''? 
   They're going to do it all day long. Every single suspension bill has 20 minutes on each side. So on the Republican side, we're going to be treated to the same litany. It will be different people, I hope. I mean, I don't want the same person coming out here. They're probably lined up somewhere back in the cloak room getting ready to come out on the next bill. But the fact is the American people aren't stupid.  
   I was saying to my staff as we were listening to this, can you imagine grandma or mom or a father who is out of work? I mean, unemployment in this country is now over 6 percent; it's gone up. You've got banks crashing all over the place; you've got the Federal Government putting $85 billion into trying to save AIG, and you're talking about ``drill, drill, drill.''

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Children in foster care are sometimes called our forgotten children. We are here to banish that thought forever. We are here to provide children in foster care the same things that all children need, family, support and an equal chance to succeed. 
   With that goal in mind, the House unanimously passed legislation in June to improve the Nation's child welfare system. The bill we are considering today is a modified version of that legislation, and it reflects an agreement with Senators BAUCUS, GRASSLEY and ROCKEFELLER, who have been working on similar legislation. 
   This agreement maintains all the critical provisions in the House-passed bill, such as helping grandparents and other relatives who want to permanently care for children in foster care and extending assistance to thousands of children who now age out of foster care every year on their 18th birthday. 
   In addition, the legislation now includes a provision that will begin to make sure that all special needs children are eligible for adoption assistance, not just those who come from a family that is eligible for a welfare program that no longer exists. 
   When a child is removed from his or her home because of abuse or neglect, government, on behalf of society, becomes legally responsible for that child. All of us, therefore, act as parents to children in foster care. But for too many foster care children, we fail to fully live up to our parental responsibilities. 
   We fail to provide them with permanent homes. We fail to meet their health and education needs, and we fail to help them find their way in the world. 
   Perhaps the most obvious example of our failure is when foster children are literally pushed out into the streets when they are 18 years old. No parent I know abandons their children at age 18, and yet that is what our Federal policy for foster care does. 
   It says to kids to have been abused or neglected, who have been removed from their homes, or who have been placed many times in multiple foster homes that we expect more of them than we would expect of anyone else, including our own children. We displace them from their homes and from any meaningful financial support, and tell them, make it on your own, you are on your own. 
   Another example is our failure and the inconsistent effort to help foster children stay connected to their families. We have a system that tells grandparents that they will be denied any assistance if they become legal guardians for a foster child. This is contrary to the growing base of research illustrating that children do better living with relative guardians than they do living in traditional foster care. 
   Additionally, siblings are too often split apart at the time of placement. Just when a foster child most needs their brother or sister, they are sometimes separated from them. 
   Ensuring school stability is yet another area where we too often come up short. Not enough is done to ensure children can stay in their current schools when they are placed in foster care. We rob them of the one place where they may actually feel secure. 
   We also hear too many stories about foster children not receiving adequate health services, especially for mental health. Furthermore, we have a special duty to ensure the prescription medications foster children are receiving are effective and appropriate, instead of quick and easy. 
   Finally, we don't provide adequate assistance for Native American children who are removed from their homes and then cared for in the tribal communities. 
   The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act would provide new supports and protections to address many of the concerns I just outlined. The legislation would allow States to extend foster care up to the age of 21, giving young men and women more time to get an education and become truly self-sufficient. 
   Recognizing that many grandparents and other relatives want to provide loving, permanent homes for children in foster care, this bill would provide Federal payments to relatives who become legal guardians of children for whom they have cared as foster parents. It also requires improved efforts to keep siblings together when they are removed from their homes. 
   The measure would require increased oversight on health care needs of foster children, focusing on the assessment, the treatment of health conditions, continuity of care, and monitoring the use of prescription drugs. There is also renewed attention paid to ensuring educational stability for children in foster care, including avoiding frequent school changes. 
   Additionally, this bill gives tribes equal and fair access to Federal resources dedicated to keeping vulnerable children safe. For the first time, a tribal child welfare program would directly receive Federal foster care funding. 
   The legislation would also provide new resources to ensure all child welfare workers have equal access to training, which ultimately results in better care for children. 
   This bill extends and improves incentives for States that increase the number of children adopted out of the foster care system. To ensure that we are  adequately helping all families adopting special needs children out of the foster care system, the bill will phase out a requirement that an adopted child's birth parents be eligible for welfare under outdated rules from a program that no longer exists. 
   The legislation includes two provisions that save money and thereby ensures that the bill is completely budget neutral. The first provision would clarify the uniform definition of a child for tax purposes to ensure that the earned income tax credit and other tax benefits are being provided to the families for which the benefits were intended. 
   The second provision would allow the Treasury Department to improve its management of the government's short-term operating cash. This language, which has been recommended by the GAO and proposed by the administration, would permit investment of cash in a broader number of institutions, thereby reducing the current concentration of risk and increasing the rate of return. 
   I want to thank, again, my ranking member, JERRY WELLER, who is going to leave us. He has been a real partner in striving to work for and improve the lives of children in the foster care system. His efforts will be missed when he leaves Congress at the end of this session, but enacting this bill will surely send him out on a high note. 
   Before I yield to Mr. Weller, I would like to talk about another Member of Congress who is not with us today. 
   The passing of Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a great shock to all of us who worked with her. We were always impressed by her tireless energy and her infectious smile. 
   Stephanie was a true champion for vulnerable families and children. In fact, her first legislative achievement in Congress was a bill designed to improve training opportunities for caseworkers in the child welfare system.     
   In recognition of Representative Tubbs Jones' efforts to help vulnerable kids, this bill names the primary source of Federal funding for the Social Security Act for Child Protective Services after her, as well as making several improvements to the program. 
   The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program will help at-risk children for many years and decades to come, just as she did during her life. 
   In conclusion, this bill does not address every challenge confronting children in the welfare system, but will take a major step toward correcting many of the system's shortcomings. I only wish Jerry was going to be here to work with me while we put a bigger bill through next year. 
   This legislation is bipartisan, budget neutral, and good for kids; therefore, it deserves the support of every Member of the House, as it did when it passed unanimously some months ago. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I think we are having a discussion today about the tale of two bills, actually. The bill that we have before us here today is really landmark legislation, and as Mr. Weller has said, it is the product of bipartisanship here in the House and actually, bicameral. 
   I talked to Senator Grassley; we talked about various aspects of the bill so that there was open communication on this issue. And what we've produced from that is landmark legislation that is a significant step forward for children, for foster children, probably the biggest step in more than 10 years. And I think when the Congress works together for the common good, things get done in a very positive way. 
   Children are America's future, and today we're making an investment in that future, and in our own. We all want our children to be connected to their family, and this bill expects the same for foster children. We want our children to feel like they are in a loving, permanent home, and this legislation expects no less for foster kids. We want our kids to go to a school and have decent medical care, and again, we've done that in this bill, or we've begun the process. Finally, we want our children to have the best chance to succeed in life, a desire that did not end on their 18th birthday. This bill shares in that hope for kids. 
   This bill says to foster kids, you're not forgotten. There is a future and the future begins today. I want to encourage all my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Chairmen get the unique opportunity of kind of borrowing a lot of ideas from other people. I took some from Danny Davis and some from Stephanie Tubbs Jones and some from Mr. Weller, and we put a bill together. 
   Even chairmen shouldn't get all the credit, because staff people like Nick Gwynn and Sonya Nesbit and Sean Hughes on our side have played a major part in talking our way through this bill. 
   In contrast, we have the energy bill which was brought out here and we continue to hear people talk about as though there was no hope of working with the Senate. 
   Now if the Republicans in the Senate would like to work with the Democrats, I think we can put a bill together. We did it on child welfare. Certainly we ought to be able to do it on something as important as energy. 
   But to write off legislation and say, oh, the only bill that could pass out of here is the only one that could pass through the Senate, that's simply not respecting the legislative process. The Republicans in the Senate really have to make a choice. They either support American taxpayers and consumers and talk about new energy jobs, or they do what the big oil companies want. That's a very simple choice. 
   I think that it's unfortunate if we in this House give up and say, well, the Senate won't come to their senses; they won't do anything reasonable on energy. They did reasonable things on child welfare because they cared about this country's kids. I think, in the Senate, they care about this country's welfare, and they're going to do something reasonable on energy. 
   So all this talk about only the House can produce a perfect bill to be rubber-stamped by the Senate, it didn't work in child welfare. They had to make their changes. We will see some  changes in that Senate bill, if they're thinking about the common good, and not about election on the 4th of November. If it's all about elections, we won't get a bill on energy out of the Senate. But if there is a desire to deal with the common good for this country, then we will look at the comprehensive bill that was put together over here. And actually some Republicans voted for it. Now that shows it can be bipartisan, even in the House, on a very contentious issue. I think that the fact that it's over in the Senate bodes well. We have a whole week yet for them to come to their senses and send us a bill back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, let me talk about a surge in Iraq the President is not talking about. An outbreak of cholera is spreading across the country, harming and killing innocent Iraqi people. Five hundred new cases were confirmed in Kirkuk in the last 5 days. 
   The World Health Organization says there have only been 12 deaths so far, but there are 3,000 confirmed cases and 30,000 more Iraqis are sick. As a medical doctor, let me tell you that cholera is caused by human waste contaminating the water supply. In other words, the sewage treatment plants that we were supposed to rebuild that worked prewar are still not working after the surge. And innocent Iraqis are suffering. 
   When a Seattle church group sent me to visit Iraq in 2002, they asked me to see firsthand how Iraqi children were suffering from the effects of the first war in 1990, the subsequent economic sanctions and how their suffering would only get worse in a new war. They were right. 
   Cholera is the latest example of a failed war. Instead of talking about the surge, the President should be talking about the scourge of cholera.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (THE PRESIDENT'S WAR ASSESSMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, when the President arrived in Australia the other day, he told the prime minister, quote, ``We're kicking ass'' in Iraq. It is a clear sign that he intends to keep a massive U.S. military force in Iraq as long as he remains in office. And he will make it official administration policy next week. ``We're Kicking Ass in Iraq'' might be the headline of the report the White House is writing for General Petraeus to deliver to the Congress next week. 
   It is supposed to be an objective military assessment, but the President has declared it will be a White House spin document, as usual. Here's what the President's ``kick ass'' assessment translates to on the ground: 10 U.S. soldiers killed this week; 793 U.S. soldiers killed so far this year; 3,752 U.S. soldiers killed since the beginning of the war; and 27,186 U.S. soldiers wounded since the beginning of the war. And, 71,000 documented Iraq civilian deaths since the beginning of the war, although the actual number is much higher. 
   As the Times of India newspaper said today, Iraq is getting worse day after day after day. We don't even know how bad things really are. 
   The ACLU filed a lawsuit the other day demanding the U.S. release military documents concerning the number of innocent civilians killed by the U.S. forces. They fear the government is hiding the human cost of war. We don't know, but reliable information does exist. 
   There is plenty of factual information for the President to rely on, but he won't. An independent commission of retired U.S. generals released a report today that concludes that the Iraqi national police force is so corrupt the force should be disbanded. These U.S. military experts concluded that Iraq's Army over the next 18 months, ``Cannot yet meaningfully contribute to denying terrorists safe haven.'' 
   The GAO released its own independent study showing the Iraq Government has reached only three of the 18 benchmarks established as part of the U.S. continuing to fund the war. In case anyone thinks that achieving three of 18 isn't too bad, let me tell you what they are. 
   The first benchmark we achieved was passing a law that legally protects the rights of minority parties in Iraq. Except the minority Sunni population remains outside the political situation totally. The other two benchmarks the Iraqi Government achieved was setting up security and public relations offices to support the military escalation. But the White House will use the military brass to paint a much rosier picture next week in its report to the Congress. 
   Besides the kick-ass assessment by the President, there have been recent reports trying to bolster the administration's position. I enter into the Record at this point a story appearing in today's Washington Post. It's on page 16, but it ought to be on page 1. The headline is: ``Experts Doubt Drop in Violence in Iraq. Military Statistics Called Into Question.'' I urge everyone to read this important news story. The only conclusion one can reach is, here we go again.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of shaping globalization to ensure that its benefits are shared more broadly, particularly for the vulnerable living in America or in developing countries. 
   President Kennedy said that American apathy ``would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience.'' His observation rings true today perhaps more than yesterday. Globalization is not helping the poor around the world as much as it is helping the rich. We have a moral obligation to adjust our trade and development policies to reverse this situation. 
   The bill before us would extend a program that's enabling developing countries within our own hemisphere to diversify and grow their own economies. The Andean trade preference program has enabled the creation of jobs in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador by reducing import tariffs on American-bound products from these countries. 
   These economies are doing well in part because of the partnership achieved through ATPA, so it's important that we extend this program in order to not undo the progress that has been achieved in what can be a very economically and politically fragile region of our hemisphere. 
   This extension, while important, is a baby step. It is imperative that this Congress this year examine the need to reform our trade policies to ensure we provide maximum opportunity to the poorest of the world's poor. 
   One of six children in Africa, where the majority of the world's poor live, will die before reaching age 5, on a continent where hunger is a key factor in more deaths than those caused by all infectious disease. 
   The United States, in agreeing to the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, committed to fully opening our markets to the least developed countries. It's been 8 years. It's time to act. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Generalized System of Preferences continues to fall short. I'm really disappointed that we could not achieve bipartisan consensus on making some modest improvements in GSP and AGOA within this bill, but I am confident we will reach consensus in the future. 
   Madam Speaker, I will enter into the Record a letter from the Catholic Bishops. This letter encourages us to pass the bill before us and pass legislation to improve our trade policies with the least developed countries.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas brings tears to my eyes. Big Oil has America over the proverbial barrel. Not only are we paying $100 a barrel for oil and over $3.30 a gallon at the pump, and it will soon be $4.00, not only are oil companies piling up record profits at $10 billion a quarter, but the American people are sending truckloads of taxpayer money to fatten Big Oil's wallet every month. 
   The legislation before us would stop the madness of American people subsidizing oil companies after they got their Republican friends in the White House and the people's House to give them a windfall they didn't earn, didn't deserve, and don't need. 
   The legislation before us today will keep America on course to a sustainable renewable energy future. We can dramatically reduce the energy consumption by dramatically increasing energy efficiency, and this bill does that, using tax credits and interest-free financing to partner with the American people to enable them to renovate their homes, to reduce consumption, and to install efficient appliances. 
   We can dramatically increase the development and deployment of alternative fuels like biodiesel and produce advanced biodiesel fuels with an even lower carbon footprint. And this bill goes in the right direction. We can dramatically increase the development of clean and renewable sources like solar, and this bill does that. Extending the investment tax credit for solar energy production will keep 240 million tons of CO  
   2 out of the atmosphere. That is like parking 52 million cars. 
   Today we declare that America will not permit corporate greed to force the American people to choose between food on the table and fuel to heat their house or get to work. Today we declare that America will put Americans ahead of Big Oil. Today we declare that America will power tomorrow with clean, renewable, and sustainable resources. And today we declare we will consume less power tomorrow. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and declare the dawn of a new day in America, when the rising sun not only symbolizes the hope for a new day, but delivers the energy for a tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (USING CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, you don't negotiate with the barrel of a gun, but that seems to be the President's strategy with respect to Iran. That is why the House must legislate to ensure that the President cannot unilaterally start another war in the Middle East, this time with Iran. 
   The President has lost all credibility, and the world worries that another war will be waged in Iran in the name of regime change. It has been over a quarter of a century since the U.S. tried constructive engagement instead of destructive isolationism in dealing with Iran. 
   Foreign policy under this President has played a role in pushing Iran's leaders to the fringe. The Iranian President appears intransigent and willing to use strident rhetoric to drive a wedge between the United States and other nations. What is our response? Showdown and confrontation are the diplomatic skills of this White House, a repeat of the spin cycle to foment a march to war against Iraq. Today it is economic sanctions against Iran, but what about tomorrow? 
   Presidential advisers like the Vice President continue to encourage a policy of aggression. The President says one thing, but the Vice President says all options are on the table. The Secretary of State says one thing, but then we read what is going on behind the scenes from an investigative reporter, Seymour Hersch. The world is weary over the war in Iraq, and the world is worried about the President's intentions regarding Iran. 
   The other day the Asia Times raised these concerns in the section entitled ``Dispatches From America.'' The Times published an article by Tom Engelhardt called ``A Bombshell That Nobody Heard,'' and I will enter it in the Record. The article considers the troubling information revealed by Seymour Hersch, especially the disclosure of U.S. military planning for a first strike capability targeting Iran, and ready to go on one day's notice. 
   Despite official denials, we see and hear the Vice President chill the world by saying a military option against Iran has not been ruled out. Having seen it before in this administration, one troubling thought comes to mind: Bullets and bluster are more likely to produce bloodshed than peace. 
   That is why the House must exert its constitutional duty when it comes to the President's intentions with respect to Iran. We have got to chart a new course in the Middle East, and it has to be based on a commitment to stop the bloodshed, not guarantee the flow of oil. And we cannot hope to achieve peace or stability in Iraq or Iran without addressing the Palestinian-Israeli issue openly, honestly and urgently. 
   The issues of the Middle East are inextricably interconnected, and no one understands that better than Speaker Pelosi. At a time when the White House prefers to choose sides, our distinguished leader prefers to pursue peace in the Middle East, demanding diplomacy aimed at achieving peace through social and economic justice for all. 
   It is the kind of vision the whole world has passionately embraced before when the world believed the United States could stand taller than any problem and person in the region. 
   So one has to wonder, what were they thinking the other day when some Members of AIPAC, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, rudely booed during a keynote address as the Speaker spoke very plainly on this issue. She said the Iraq war has not made America safer, has not made Israel safer, and has not made peace in the Middle East much easier to achieve. 
   That is the truth. What is wrong with speaking the truth? Leaders speak the truth because they have a deep and abiding faith in the strength of people everywhere to see the truth for what it is and to use it to lay a foundation to build a better world. 
   Today, America has a Democratic leader willing to see the world as it is, but unwilling to leave it that way. These are difficult times and we face difficult decisions just ahead. We need a strong commitment to get our soldiers out of Iraq and the strength to prevent another military misadventure in Iran. 
   The path to peace should be littered with pages and pages of negotiation, not booby trapped by inflammatory rhetoric and people unwilling to listen. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record the materials referred to earlier

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (PENTAGON RED TAPE KEEPS MEDICAL RECORDS FROM DOCTORS OF THE WOUNDED -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today a story appeared in the Washington Post entitled ``Pentagon Red Tape Keeps Medical Records From Doctors of the Wounded.'' 
   The Defense Department is refusing to give the records of people wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan to physicians who are taking care of them in the Veterans Department. It is absolutely unbelievable that there could be that kind of bureaucratic snafu. 
   Now the Defense Department says, We don't have the authority to give the records on the wounded that are leaving us and going to the Veterans Department. 
   Absolute bureaucratic nonsense. I have introduced H.R. 1128 with Mr. Filner, which gives that authority to the Defense Department. I hope that other Members will sign this bill, and that we will pass it by unanimous consent when we return to the House after the Presidents' Day break. 
   In the next week, there are going to be people who are injured and transferred to the veterans hospitals who can't get their records transferred. How can a doctor take care of somebody if they don't know what happened to them on the battlefield? This is the kind of thing we have to stop if we support the troops.  
   Pentagon Red Tape Keeps Medical Records From Doctors of the Wounded  
   Department of Veterans Affairs doctors are furious over a recent decision by the Pentagon to block their access to medical information needed to treat severely injured troops arriving at VA hospitals from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The VA physicians handle troops with serious brain injuries and other major health problems. They rely on digital medical records that track the care given wounded troops from the moment of their arrival at a field hospital through their evacuation to the United States. 
   About 30 VA doctors in four trauma centers around the country have treated about 200 severely wounded soldiers and Marines. The docs had been receiving the complete digital records from the Pentagon until the end of January, using the Pentagon's Joint Patient Tracking Application. 
   But on Jan. 25, when Shane McNamee, a physician in the Richmond VA Medical Center, tried to get the full records, he couldn't. He sent an urgent e-mail to VA chief liaison officer Edward Huycke. 
   ``My JPTA account has been disabled within last few days,'' McNamee wrote. ``I called the hotline and was told that all VA accounts have been locked. Could not get a good answer why. Anyhow--I have 4 [Iraq/Afghanistan] service members to arrive within the next 2 days. This information is terribly important,'' the doctor wrote. 
   Thirty-four minutes later Huycke e-mailed back: ``Ok, Shane. Will get on it. Not sure what's up.'' 
   An hour or so later, a senior VA official forwarded McNamee's e-mail to Lt. Col. David Parramore at the Pentagon, saying that McNamee ``needs his access back to JPTA to provide the best possible treatment for soldiers injured in [Iraq/Afghanistan] arriving there in a few days. Can you help?'' 
   Tommy Morris, director of Deployment Health Systems, responded the next morning to Parramore's inquiry, after contacting Ellen Embry, deputy assistant secretary of defense for force health protection. ``I spoke with Embry and no agreements, no data sharing via access to JPTA.'' 
   The access cutoff came after Morris, in a Jan. 23 e-mail, instructed a colleague: ``If the VA currently has access I need a list of persons and I need their accounts shut off ASAP. It is illegal for them to have access without data use agreements and access controls in place by federal regulations and public law.'' 
   There have been meetings between VA and Pentagon officials. The Pentagon declined to comment yesterday. VA officials apparently thought it might have been resolved Monday. But an e-mail Monday from Morris to a co-worker said: ``The leadership has not authorized the VA accounts to be turned back on, in case someone approaches you about this.'' 
   Last week, Sens. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) and Larry E. Craig (Idaho)--the chairman and ranking Republican on the Veterans' Affairs Committee--wrote David S.C. Chu, undersecretary of defense for personnel, of their ``deep concern'' about VA trauma center doctors not having access to complete records. 
   ``For those servicemembers suffering from a traumatic brain injury,'' they wrote, ``VA's access to in-theater imaging is an important and valuable tool for tracking their patient's progress since being wounded or injured.'' They suggested the VA doctor be given temporary access to JPTA while the data-sharing questions are worked out. 
   They're still awaiting an appropriate response. McNamee is still waiting for the records.

Maybe they are off by a million; maybe it's only 4 million.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the bill we just passed has the weight of a feather. It is very weak on setting a date to get our soldiers out of Iraq. If anything, this legislation bends in the wind as a sign of flexibility by the Democratic Congress to work with the President. 
   And yet a piece of legislation so inherently weak has provoked so many attacks from the White House that its real value may be proving to the American people that the President is out of touch and out of control. 
   The President's military escalation has only escalated the body count, but he claims we are making progress. Mr. Speaker, tell the President we are not making progress. We are making widows and widowers. The bloody awful war must end now, but the President is in total denial. 
   How many more must die before this President opens his eyes to reality? We are not seeding democracy. We are spilling blood into the soil, and what is growing is hatred for America, contempt for the President's military occupation and the killing and maiming of America's next generation. 
   What will the President say to the 82nd Airborne when his rationale for continuing this war is irrational? This heroic, distinguished unit of American soldiers has suffered its worst single day of casualties since the Vietnam War. 
   Mr. Speaker, what will the President say; we are winning? There will be bad days in Iraq? We are making progress? Mr. Speaker, tell the President we are not making progress. We are digging graves to bury mothers and fathers and sons and daughters, all patriotic Americans, all of them sacrificed needlessly. 
   They marched off to war, and tens of thousands of Americans are coming home in coffins and on stretchers. The American people have had enough of this bloody, worthless war, but the ways of Washington are not as wise and as pragmatic as the will of the American people. 
   Today, we passed a weak-kneed piece of legislation that this President will cut off at the knees. The President will emerge from his reality-proof bunker just long enough to veto the bill. He will make a speech and what will he say? My way or no way. 
   The stroke of the President's veto pen will be like a knife cutting away any hope of reason or sanity for ending this bloody, God-awful war. 
   The President has retreated to a bunker where he cannot hear the American people, the Iraqi people, our soldiers, military experts and world leaders who keep telling him that the Iraq War will never end until we end it by withdrawing our soldiers and demanding diplomacy. 
   The American people want their government to listen. The American people want this President to stop ordering soldiers into the crossfire of civil war. The American people want our soldiers home and out of harm's way. 
   I voted for this Iraq bill today, knowing it will never become law. But I voted for the Iraq bill today because the weight of a feather can sometimes support the resolve of a Nation. 
   This piece of legislation is the smallest step down the right road, the only road available to leaders who can truthfully assess the reality on the ground in Iraq and respond with reason. 
   Some will say we are sending a message with this bill, but I think differently. 
   I believe the President will be sending a message to the American people when he vetoes this bill, a bill so flexible that it could barely stand on its own. The President's veto message will be that he refuses to listen, refuses to change, refuses to work with Congress and rejects the will of the American people. 
   The President said America will still be at war in Iraq when he leaves office in January 2009. That ought to be America's worst fear. And the only way to overcome it is for the American people to demand that the Republicans vote with the Democrats to overturn any Presidential veto that perpetuates the war any longer. And if Republicans will not do it, then elect someone who will. 
   The American people have spoken in November and they have said, get out of Iraq. It is time for the President to stop talking and start listening. Bring our soldiers home and leave Iraq to the Iraqis.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, this President has used the resolution that we passed some years ago as a blank check to take us into a disastrous situation in Iraq, leaving Afghanistan half done. 
   What we are trying to do with this amendment is simply say to the President, you have to stay where we put the money. If you want to come out and go after Iran in a preemptive way, as you did against Iraq when you had no evidence, when you came to this floor and presented evidence that  turned out not to be true, and use that as a pretext for going into war, we are heading for in Iran, in my view, another Gulf of Tonkin kind of situation, where you cook up a situation. 
   This administration took down the border between Iran and Iraq and now complains to us everywhere that we are getting all kinds of weapons coming in from Iran. Using that as a pretext, the Arab press yesterday reports that the Vice President was in the Middle East telling people that war is coming, telling them that the problems in Iraq don't keep us out of anything. They won't be any hindrance to us going into Iran. 
   This amendment is simply an attempt to put a minor block in the way of this administration's desire to widen this war, probably to get people's minds off how bad it is in Iraq. 
   This is supposed to be winding down in Iraq because of the escalation. But in fact that is not what is happening. We are losing more soldiers every day. We have had the bloodiest months in this war. 
   This amendment is simply to say the United States Congress will decide where this country goes to war, not the President, who wants to go out and create whatever situation he wants in the world. 
   I urge the adoption of this amendment.

The American people needed a helping hand back in January when I introduced the legislation, and they need it now more than ever. 
   Just the other day, my home State of Washington reported the largest 1-month increase in unemployment in 28 years. The unemployment rate spiked in just 1 month from 4.7 to 5.3 percent. We saw much the same happen at the national level. 
   Yet for all the evidence, all the objective data, we saw the White House order Senate Republicans to drag their feet until the President got his way. Last week, the House voted overwhelmingly to pass emergency unemployment on its own merits. We achieved a two-thirds vote in here, veto-proof. So what did the President do? He ordered the Senate Republicans to withhold help from the Americans until he could force Congress to cut out the extra help needed in badly hit States like Michigan, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, California and the District of Columbia.     
   Today we're going to get the best that we can get from a lame duck President and the Senate Republicans. 
   John Mccain must have written off Michigan and California. But the American people have been hit hard by economic calamity, rooted in the disastrous policies of this administration, and they deserve better than this. When Americans can't find jobs because this President and Senate Republicans have tanked the economy, I submit the wrong people are standing in the unemployment line.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, we are going to approve a plan that will produce significant new energy resources for the American people. We have passed this bill four times. Mr. Brady is right. There is nothing new here. We keep passing it and passing it and the oil companies keep killing it. 
   What you're hearing today, just the last speaker says, let's drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or go hat in hand to OPEC and say, Please produce more oil. Or let's have some more secret meetings down in the White House with the Vice President and design a new tax policy that will get our oil prices even higher. They met in the first months in the White House and decided how to drive up the oil prices for the oil companies. 
   We are going to implement a tax plan that uses the Tax Code to produce renewable energy to put us on a path to providing our children with an energy-independent future. The plan creates incentives for America to apply technology and use practices to use energy more efficiently than the way we are presently doing. 
   There was a time a long time ago when the United States led in alternative energy. But now Denmark, Japan and Germany are far ahead of us because of 8 years of this present administration and their attitudes toward alternative energy. 
   With this legislation, we'll take a big step toward regaining our leadership in the manufacture and deployment of renewable energy. This legislation will not only create jobs in what may be the world's largest emerging industry, but it will be a blueprint for the energy policy for the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we've bailed out Wall Street once already this year. We may be doing it again soon. But it's time to bail out Main Street by doing what we should have done 50 years ago, and that is provide Americans with universal health care. It's the fastest and most effective way Congress can shore up the American family. Because we all know that Americans are either paying too much for health care, can't afford to buy enough coverage, or can't afford any coverage at all. And the cost in dollars and in human terms is staggering. 
   A generation ago, the head of General Motors famously said, ``as GM goes, so goes the Nation.'' It's no secret that GM and America are struggling with an economic crisis. We can make the difference by addressing the single largest expense facing an American family and American business today, health care. Every day in America, the American people are forced to dig deeper and deeper into their own pockets to pay for health care. And every day American business is forced to transfer more of the burden to employees or drop coverage altogether. 
   America's health care system today looks like an ambulance riding on one wheel. And even that wheel will soon fall off if we continue to support a failed system that is not made in America, not worthy of America and nothing more than an accident of history. 
   In the early 20th century, there was a movement to provide universal health care. But ironically it was fiercely opposed by the insurance industry at a time when it made most of its money selling death benefits to those who feared a pauper's grave. Emerging from the Great Depression in 1930, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted to institute universal health care. But his advisers feared the American Medical Association would kill FDR's proposal for Social Security in their opposition to health care. 
   In the 1950s, the legendary labor leader, Walter Reuther, first won a health care benefit and a pension too for automobile workers in a labor agreement with General Motors. Then Reuther tried to enlist GM and others to join forces and lobby the Federal Government to institute universal health care. But business couldn't see coming the economic storm from global competition and didn't trust government. Organized labor, flush from a victory in Detroit, saw health care as a perpetual win at the bargaining table, and organized medicine was relentless at lobbying until they drove the universal health care program into the ditch again. 
   In the second half of the 20th century, there were other attempts by the American leaders, but all of them were killed by seemingly unlimited lobbying resources. Today we have 50 million Americans with no health care coverage at all, another 25 million Americans without adequate protection, and every American can't find pants with pockets deep enough to keep paying costs that are already out of sight. 
   The only universal truth about health care in America today is that every single American knows someone with a health care crisis or is facing one themselves. American business has to compete today in a global economy, but American business has a major health care benefit expense on its books that the international competitors do not have. Even great companies in my congressional district, which are national models to providing employee benefits like health care, are being stretched to the limit, and their balance sheets, like a rubber band, can only flex so much before they break. 
   We cannot stand idly by and watch when we know that developing and instituting an American single payer health care system can dramatically improve the health of American business and American families literally and financially. And for the first time in decades, we have a chance if we're willing to seize the opportunity. There are cracks in the dams of opposition. A new survey of U.S. doctors published recently in the Annals of Health Research finds that 59 percent of American doctors now support single payer health care plans, which is a dramatic double-digit increase in support in the last 7 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (HEALTH CARE UNINSURED AWARENESS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, this is Health Care Uninsured Awareness Week. The number of Americans without health insurance has grown about 5 million since President Bush took office. The health care crisis is America's single largest domestic issue, but the President has offered Band-Aids to cover his lack of leadership. And the people have noticed. Nine out of ten Americans told a recent CBS/New York Times poll that the American health care system needs to be completely rebuilt. 
   Today, the number of Americans without any health insurance surpasses the combined population of 24 U.S. States: Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. That is the population without health insurance. 
   But the crisis is even worse than that. Millions of Americans are underinsured, and millions more can't afford the copay, or have to fight constant battles with the big drug companies and the HMOs. 
   In Seattle, my congressional district, here is what one constituent wrote to Health Care for All Washington, one of the organizations I work closely with: 
   ``My dad has prostate cancer and has taken a turn for the worse. We had to postpone a quarterly injection of his drug because we are having trouble with the health insurance over the cost of the drug. It has been extremely frustrating as the insurance company has the drug in the wrong category. They sent us a letter admitting as much, but every 3 months we have to fight with them again, anywhere from $180 to $1,800. Anyway, since we postponed it, my dad has suffered.'' 
   Does that sound familiar? 
   The pain inflicted by the health care crisis is hurting families across the United States. According to the Census Bureau, almost one-third of Latinos are uninsured, one-fifth of African Americans, 15 percent of children, 18 percent of full-time employees, and 11 percent of middle-class families. 
   In other words, only the rich can afford to live without risk. Only the rich are immune, because they have been coddled by the Republican-imposed income tax shelters that can pay for health care. Every other American is one layoff, one major accident, one major illness or divorce away from being uninsured and facing financial ruin. 
   Since the President took office, health care premiums have risen 87 percent. Have your wages gone up that much? 
   Here is another personal story from a letter: ``I have always worked and I have never taken welfare or asked for help from anyone. Last month, I was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. There is no cure for this slow-moving cancer. I will not be able to buy health insurance now because I have a preexisting condition. Even if I can find it somewhere, I would not be able to afford the big premiums. The only solution I can come up with is to leave America and move to another nation where I can get health care coverage.'' 
   When American citizens consider leaving the country as the only viable option, that is not a solution, that is an indictment of a failure to act. The only solution to America's health care crisis is a single payer, universal health care system. We have tried everything else except the right idea. 
   Under H.R. 1200, my bill, every American would be guaranteed a package of benefits. States would administer their own programs, with decisions made closest to the patient. The health care system today is all about profits, not patients. My bill would put patients back in charge. It would provide predictable and lower cost for American businesses, and everyone would be covered. 
   The special interests have run the health care system into the ground, and millions of Americans have been ground into financial ruin as a result. The single most common cause for going into bankruptcy in this country is health care costs. 
   America stands virtually alone in the industrialized world in not caring for its citizens, and being a loner is insensitive, incomprehensible, and intolerable. If all we do is read these poignant stories and ring our hands, we will turned our backs on the people who elected us to serve them by leading. It is time to pass universal health care. We can do it, but it will take some leadership in the White House. Unfortunately, we may have to wait until 2009 to get a President who understands that all Americans should be protected with health insurance.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Not every child in America is raised in a safe and loving home. More often than we realize, children become the victims of abuse and neglect from the very people they should be able to trust the most, their parents. 
   Today the Income Security and Family Support Committee that I chair is united behind this resolution to designate April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. Democratic Representatives John Lewis, Pete Stark, Michael McNulty, Kendrick Meek and Republican Representative Jerry Weller, the subcommittee's ranking member, Wally Herger and Jon Porter are cosponsors of the resolution. 
   Our goal in designating April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month is to increase public awareness of the serious threats that child maltreatment imposes on children, and to encourage Americans to break the cycle of violence. 
   2005 is the most recent year for which data is available from the Department of Health and Human Services. Nine hundred thousand children were victims of substantiated cases of abuse and neglect. Nearly 1,500 children, mostly under the age of 4, died as a result. Another half a million children could not live safely with their parents and were removed from the home. 
   Child abuse and neglect has a devastating impact on the life of a child that goes beyond the immediate physical and emotional pain that is inflicted on them. Children who suffer from maltreatment are at greater risk of developmental delays and behavioral problems that could last a lifetime. Child maltreatment can delay or disrupt the normal cognitive development process which, in turn, impacts academic achievement.     
   Children who are the victims of abuse and neglect tend to have lower math scores and English grades, and they repeat grades more frequently than other children. We know that poor academic skills can lead to a child's dropping out of school, continuing a cycle of negative consequences that can last a lifetime. 
   A history of child abuse and neglect can also disrupt the development of skills that children use to interact with others, such as problem-solving and communication. These skills are critical in stopping the development of other serious behavior problems even among seriously troubled youth. Moreover, victims of child abuse and neglect tend to have greater levels of depression compared to other children. These children are also more likely to suffer from mental illness, experience problems with drugs, and are more likely to become teen-age parents. 
   Not every child who has suffered from abuse and neglect will experience poor outcomes. Many maltreated children will persevere against the odds and find the ability to cope and even to thrive. They could develop and maintain the personal characteristics that will make them more resilient than others. Of course, this resilience can depend on a child's finding a safe and loving home to live in and access to support systems, educational resources, and health care. 
   These amazing kids deserve to be recognized and celebrated for their remarkable ability to persevere over the most difficult of circumstances and for setting an example for other children. 
   In recognition of the fact that too many of our Nation's children will become the victims of violence at the hands of their parents and many others are at risk of such abuse, Congress has expressed the commitment over the last several decades to stop child abuse and neglect. In 1935 Congress established the Child Welfare Services program to provide Federal funding for a variety of services for States to use to protect children who are at risk of abuse and neglect and who assist those who have been victimized. 
   In 1993, Congress took another step to protect children when it created the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. This program is the largest source of Federal funding designed to  stop child abuse and neglect before it starts and to support vulnerable families who are at risk of falling into crisis. 
   Last fall we reauthorized promoting Safe and Stable Families on a bipartisan basis, and we made a number of key improvements. For instance, new funding will allow us to respond to the growing methamphetamine problem that threatens the safety of many of our children in communities across America. We provided States with additional resources to attract, train, and retain caseworkers. We required States to have caseworkers visit children in foster care once a month to make sure they are getting the proper care. And we increased funding that is available to the Native American community as well. 
   These are only modest steps that will strengthen our ability to prevent the incidence of child abuse and support vulnerable families. Certainly more can be done, but these programs express the commitment of Congress to protect abused and neglected children. 
   In recognition of Child Abuse Prevention Month, I urge my colleagues to join me in increasing public awareness of the threat to innocent children and to promote public policies designed to prevent child abuse and safeguard our most vulnerable children. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, reforming health care in America is not nearly as hard as the special interests would like the American people to believe. The special interests want to protect their profits, but Congress should concern itself with protecting the health and well-being of the American people. 
   There are two major news stories today that should be viewed side-by-side. On their own, each story is powerful. Taken together, however, the stories offer compelling evidence of what happens when special initiates lobby against meaningful reform in the United States; while in France, people receive universal health care that is ranked number one in the world by the World Health Organization. 
   A new study conducted jointly by Harvard University and the University of Washington in my district has yielded a startling conclusion. Reporter Tom Paulson has the story in today's Seattle-Post Intelligencer. Let me read an excerpt, ``One of every five American women and one of every 25 men are either dying at a younger age or seeing no improvement in life span. The lead authors told the PI, ``It is what you would expect to see in a developing Nation, not here in the United States,'' according to Dr. Ezzati, a Harvard professor. Dr. Chris Murray from UW called it a complete surprise, and said, ``It's remarkable in the history of the U.S.'' 
   We pay more for health care than any nation on Earth, yet life expectancy is declining for millions of Americans.     
   At the same time, for about half the cost, every French citizen has access to universal health care, rated the best in the world.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the President has isolated himself from all the evidence, military advice, members of his own party, and the American people. He is not staying the course in Iraq. The President is making matters even worse by escalating the war. 
   He has ordered at least 21,500 more U.S. soldiers into the middle of a bloody and violent civil war. This President has stepped backward in history. He is making the same tragic mistakes of Vietnam all over again. 
   The President's speeches won't stop a bullet, and they won't protect soldiers from the tsunami of violence inundating Iraq. Our soldiers don't have enough equipment or support. Soldiers know it, but the White House ignores it. 
   Some of the best newspapers and magazines in the Nation are reporting the facts, and they are not just repeating the President's spin. 
   From the McClatchy newspapers, here is a recent headline: ``Soldiers in Iraq view troop surge as a lost cause.'' 
   From the San Francisco Chronicle: ``Corners cut in rush to add troops; shorter training time, lack of equipment hurt readiness, experts say.'' 
   And the latest issue of Business Week said: ``Military equipment: Missing in action.'' 
   I will enter these stories into the Record.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, many of my friends ask me as we struggle to fund this war, why are the Iraqi Parliamentarians going on a 2-month vacation? The answer is very simple: Self-preservation. The AP reported that ``a few shells'' fell in the Green Zone last weekend. Well, my sources in Amman and in Baghdad told me that 47 mortar rounds landed in the Green Zone on Sunday, and on Monday they hit the parliament building, destroying the office of Dr. Mashhadani 5 minutes after he left it. 
   The AP also reports that the Defense Minister, Mr. Obeidi, has told reporters that Iraq's military was drawing up plans in case U.S. forces left the country quickly. ``The army plans on the basis of a worst case scenario so as not to allow any security vacuum. There are meetings with political leaders on how we can deal with the sudden pullout.'' 
   It sounds to me like we are looking at off-the-hotel-roof in Vietnam, or maybe it was the pullout from Beirut. 
   I wish, Mr. Speaker, we could make the President be honest with us about what he is actually planning. The world can't figure it out.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (HONORING PRIVATE BOOKER TOWNSELL -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, Senator Bill Nelson and I introduced legislation today to amend the dark chapter of American history by providing a fair and just settlement for our African American soldiers who were wrongly convicted after an incident at Fort Lawton during World War II. 
   Last Saturday, I stood with the family of Booker Townsell at his gravesite in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At long last, Private Booker Townsell received a burial with full honors, in a ceremony filled with emotion and symbolism. At long last, Booker Townsell received the military honors he deserved. 
   I want to read into the Record the remarks I read last Saturday because Booker and his family deserve to have his long overdue military honors permanently etched into the Congressional Record. 
   In the House, I represent Seattle in King County, Washington, home to Fort Lawton and home to author Jack Hamann. He exposed what Booker Townsell, his family and others have often lived and known for a long time, that the color of their skin determined their fate and denied them due process. 
   And on behalf of the people in my Seventh District, who live in a county proudly named in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, let me sum up our feelings by quoting Dr. King: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
   That's why I got into this fight. America cannot and must not permit  racial injustice to breathe the same air that we breathe, or to live among us as a plague upon our Nation, or to poison the sweet light of day with its grim darkness of evil. 
   We come here today in the name of justice, to fully and finally honor Private Booker Townsell, a soldier, a hero, an African American who served his country in a time of war, only to be deserted by his country in his time of need. 
   Racial injustice struck down this innocent man, and others, who were denied the opportunity to live their lives with a full measure of honor for their military service and who were denied all their rightful benefits for their military service, including the right of their family to receive an American flag when they passed. 
   The American flag is a powerful symbol of our Nation's strength, unity and commitment to core values like equal justice under the law and equal rights. Today our flag also represents the courage of an Army private and the dignity of his family to accept justice delayed after being denied so long, and it represents the ability of a great Nation to look inward and admit a grave injustice. 
   This is a proud day for Private Booker Townsell and his family. He has been promoted from Army private to American role model, and his life, service and this day teaches us a lot about ourselves and our Nation. 
   Dr. King said: The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. 
   Booker Townsell, and his family and others like Sam Snow who lives in Florida, stood up to the challenge and, in so doing, stood up for us all. Today, on their behalf, America renews its vow to fight racial injustice, to acknowledge the deep and tragic mistakes of the past and to restore hope in the future. 
   Here in Washington the work is not finished. The legislation Senator Nelson and I introduced today will, along with others, including Congresswoman Moore from Milwaukee, direct the Army to provide the Fort Lawton survivors like Sam Snow in Florida and families like Booker Townsell with the economic benefits to which they're entitled. 
   It's the least we can do. I also hope that we can put a memorial on the Fort Lawton site to teach future generations about the sacrifices made by Booker Townsell, Sam Snow, and others, and to remind us that we must never forget that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
   Today, we salute Private Booker Townsell and his loved ones on behalf of this grateful Nation. We are grateful for his military service, his courage, and his dignity, and grateful that America is strong enough to admit its mistakes and provide justice and honor at long last. 
   I would like to enter into the Record an article from the Milwaukee Sentinel dated 19 January 2008, entitled, ``Injustice Undone.''  
   Injustice Undone: Soldier Honored More Than 20 Years After Death  
   Carol Blalock closed her eyes and smiled as the sound of gunshots rang through the bitter cold morning air on Saturday. 
   At long last, justice had been served. 
   Her father, Booker Townsell, who died in 1984, had finally been granted full military honors, a proper military burial at Graceland Cemetery on Milwaukee's northwest side. An Army contingent, including Ronald James, Assistant Secretary of the Army, traveled to Milwaukee to correct an injustice begun more than 63 years ago. 
   In August 1944, Townsell and 42 other African-American soldiers were blamed for the lynching death of an Italian prisoner of war at Fort Lawton, an Army base outside Seattle. Many of them, including Townsell, were convicted of rioting. Two others were convicted of manslaughter. 
   The story might have ended there, had it not been for curiosity of a television reporter named Jack Hamann, who, along with his wife, Leslie, spent 20 years uncovering the facts of the case. Their account, in the book ``On American Soil: How Justice Became a Casualty of World War II,'' prompted a bipartisan call for the convictions to be overturned and full military honors to be restored. In October, the Army reversed the conviction of Townsell and the others. 
   Hamann stood at the front of the chapel at Graceland on Saturday, fighting back tears as the Army color guard played taps. 
   ``Reporters are trained to check out emotionally,'' he said. ``But this one is tough.'' 
   Also standing in the crowd was Ronald Hayes, a retired master sergeant and Townsell family friend, who likewise swallowed hard when Wisconsin Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Roger Lalich presented the U.S. flag to Townsell's oldest daughter, Marion Williamson. 
   ``This is good,'' Hayes said. 
   Later in the day, nearly 200 people gathered at the Milwaukee County War Memorial Center to pay tribute to Townsell and to celebrate his ultimate exoneration. 
   ``He wouldn't have wanted this attention,'' Williamson told the crowd. ``But he deserves it. I hope my father's soul can finally rest in peace.'' 
   Speakers included Jim McDermott, Democratic congressman from the state of Washington who pushed to have the Army reverse the convictions. 
   ``Too often the color of skin defined fate and denied due process,'' McDermott said. 
   Quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., McDermott talked of why this decision is so important and the need to celebrate it so urgent. 
   ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' he said. McDermott complimented the Army for admitting a grave mistake. He recalled the images of Townsell as a dedicated family man and factory worker, who danced with his children and cheered his granddaughter at her track meet. 
   It would have been easy for Townsell to wallow in the bitterness of this dark chapter of his life, McDermott said. Instead, he chose to persevere. Again invoking King's words, McDermott said, ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.'' 
   As far as Blalock and the other members of Townsell's family were concerned, Saturday's ceremony was no less precious because of the time it took to make things right. 
   ``I loved my father's laugh,'' Blalock said. ``When they had that 21-gun salute and played taps, it was like I could hear him laugh again.''

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, it is time that America work for America's workers, farmers and families. The Peru Free Trade Agreement is a step in the right direction. It marks the first time in history that a FTA has incorporated labor and environmental provisions. 
   This is a major step forward because it signals that the pursuit of trade is not an end, but a means to help raise living standards and provide opportunity. I represent a trade dependent city and yet my constituents are leery of FTAs because they fear that American workers have been left behind. 
   Today, we are at a crossroads. We can continue down the path we have been on and keep pursing freer trade knowing that many Americans are falling through a domestic safety net built 70 years ago, or we can pursue policies that respond to a new century. 
   Last week the House made a good start by adopting legislation to reform the Unemployment Insurance program and update the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. We must do more. Health care that is tied to employment is insecure. 
   Education benefits that aren't available to working adults do not meet the needs of the modern workforce. Our trade agreements need to be smarter, too. We know that supporting core worker rights--human rights--is central to enabling workers to benefit fully from their labor. 
   We know that the tools of public policy need flexibility to ensure access in areas like affordable prescription drugs. We know that the Earth's environment isn't yours or mine, it's ours. 
   Chief Si'ahl, the inspired leader of the Duwamish and Suquamish Tribes, for whom my City of Seattle is named, said it best. 
   A century ago, this great tribal chief said: ``We did not weave the web of life. We are merely a strand in it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.'' 
   My support for the Peru Free Trade Agreement is for this particular FTA, in part because of the progress we've achieved in incorporating labor and environmental standards, and health concerns. 
   I will continue to consider each FTA on its merits, and in its own context. 
   I will be paying close attention to the Administration and its commitment to Americans through TAA and healthcare for the children of working families.  
   In the end trade is about people and the jargon--FTA and TAA--had better produce SBA--Standing by Americans. 
   The research is clear; this FTA will increase American exports in key goods that come from my State, including: IT products, wheat, apples, pears, peaches and cherries. And this agreement will be good for Peru, too. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't vote for it.

   No one understands that better than Representative Barney Frank, my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. With Barney's leadership, the House passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act last night. ENDA is a clear statement that we will protect and defend the rights of Americans in the workplace. 
   As far as I'm concerned, the issue comes down to one simple declarative sentence: your sexual orientation and lifestyle is your own business, not your employer's business. No person or business in this country should have the right to discriminate against any American. 
   I stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with Barney Frank and my constituents in Seattle in strong and unwavering support of ENDA. A chance at the American Dream should apply to every American. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, they all hope and care and wish like all the rest of us. They deserve nothing less than a full measure of justice and equality in this country. So do the transgender Americans, and we have more work to do to extend the protections to them.  
   We made progress with ENDA and neither Barney Frank, nor I, nor my constituents will rest until we can declare with conviction that all Americans are created equal.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are saying we must have an end to the war, as have two Republican Senators. It is time for us to look at the actions of the Vice President of the United States. 
   You remember when George Bush sent DICK CHENEY out to find a Vice President and he found himself? Well, if you read the last 4 days of The Washington Post, you read a chilling picture of the actions of the Vice President as he manipulated the intelligence leading us into the war. He has been the driving force to keep us in that war and still is today. 
   Then when questioned about what he does over there, he says, I am not a member of the executive. I don't know exactly. I have an office here, but I am not covered by the things the President says. 
   This man has been evading an Executive Order from 2003 by the President of the United States that everyone tell how they are covering classified material. But the Vice President is above that.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. We appreciate the legislation that you've put before us today. The Andean Trade Preference Promotion Act continues to enjoy broad bipartisan support, and I believe the program is needed because we have a responsibility to ensure that our market, the largest in the world, remains open to the products from developing nations. 
   ATPA is a program that is helping to reduce poverty and strengthen our economic ties with our hemisphere, but it really is only one scheme of many. The generalized system of preferences is also a vital tool we use to fight global poverty and better engage with developing countries. 
   As you know, the duty-free treatment GSP provides to imports coming from developing nations like India and Brazil is at risk of being eliminated by the Bush administration. In the case of India, the tariffs the Bush administration will propose on Indian jewelry will cause the loss of 300,000 jobs, and that would weaken our strategic alliance with an important ally. In this case, what's bad for India is also bad for the United States. 
   Now, in the coming weeks and months, I hope that we can work together to ensure that any GSP benefits aren't revoked for arbitrary reasons that would have a negative outcome in developing countries. And I hope that you would be willing to listen to those kind of proposals.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, any voice of reason inside the current administration is a voice in the wilderness, a voice that will be silenced by the President, all of which should be a matter of grave urgency for the American people. 
   The administration has set its sights on military confrontation with Iran. Just like Iraq, any voice of reason will not be merely muffled; it will be silenced. 
   Remember Colin Powell? Where is he? Remember General Shinseki? He was drummed out for speaking truth to power about what it would really take to win in Iraq. 
   Now Admiral Fallon, the Secretary of Defense, wouldn't return phone calls until the Admiral got the message to turn in his resignation because he questioned the President's policy toward Iran. 
   The President's foreign policy is open hostility and a finger on the trigger looking for any provocation for a military strike against Iran. That's what the neocons want; that's what co-President DICK CHENEY wants. 
   Their thirst for oil is matched only by their thirst for war. They think the U.S. will dominate the world with military confrontation. They are the only ones who believe that. We must keep the pressure on to ensure the President does not launch another war. Four thousand have already died. 
   That's enough.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY, A DEMOCRACY WILL FAIL -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 years I have struggled with the issue of whether the House should impeach a sitting President. Next to declaring war, impeachment is the gravest matter the House of Representatives must consider. I fully understand the gut-wrenching consequences of such a national debate that could precipitate. 
   Yet there is one fact we cannot overlook or escape. America cannot regain its moral leadership in the world if America cannot hold its leaders accountable for their actions at home. 
   The allegations that could warrant impeachment keep growing. They have been illuminated in recent books, including ``The Way of the World'' by Ron Suskind; the book by Vincent Bugliosi; and the new book by Bob Woodward, ``The War Within.'' 
   Over 5 years ago, I tried to place asterisks in the Congressional Record next to the statements about Iraq the President made to Congress. I was attacked for saying the President would mislead us into the war. But the American people ultimately learned the truth. There seems to be no end to the allegations, and we have a responsibility to investigate their authenticity. That's why I am signing onto a resolution to consider impeachment of the President. Without accountability, a democracy will fail.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (VOTE ON IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BILL -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the American people want U.S. soldiers out of Iraq. A majority of Iraq's elected Parliament want U.S. soldiers out of Iraq. And I want soldiers out of Iraq, out of harm's way and out of the middle of a civil war. 
   This is what the American people elected us to do in November, knowing the best way to support our troops is to protect our soldiers and get them out of Iraq. 
   Since January, 431 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq; 83 American soldiers died in January, 80 died in February, 81 died in March, 104 died in April, and 83 Americans have died in Iraq so far in May. 
   Since January, 2,496 U.S. soldiers have been wounded in Iraq. In fewer than 5 months, the U.S. casualties in Iraq is already exceeding the number of soldiers who died or were wounded in Iraq in 2003. But the President insists we're winning. The reality is his stubbornness and intransigence has lost the war and the peace. 
   Outside my office, we honor the fallen heroes of the State of Washington by showing the photographs of 78 men and women killed in Iraq. Adding more pictures will not sustain their memory. We honor these fallen heroes only by protecting the living. 
   The way forward is not more casualties, as the President freely admits will occur. 
   The way forward in Iraq is not claiming phony ties to 9/11, fake intelligence, or outright fabrication, although these are the trademarks of this administration. 
   Demanding a timetable to get our soldiers out of Iraq, as I have done repeatedly, is the strongest support anyone in this Congress or country can do to support our soldiers. 
   I voted today to support U.S. soldiers by voting against a bill that approves an endless war and provides the President with a box of preapproved blank checks. A Nation does not support its soldiers by accepting more Americans killed and wounded in Iraq while carrying out the flawed mission of a failed presidency. The Congress does not support our soldiers by passing flawed legislation that supports a President who is totally out of touch with reality. 
   Spending more money in Iraq without a timetable to get out of Iraq only buys more casualties in a needless military disaster ordered by a President who can mislead, but not lead, America in war or peace. 
   The invasion of Iraq was and is all about oil. The one and only benchmark that matters to the President is for Iraq to pass an American-engineered oil law that delivers the oil wealth of Iraq into the hands of Western oil companies. 
   The President would not listen when a majority of Iraq's parliament signed a petition last week demanding a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. That's because it doesn't matter what they think; only what the President and his neocon friends want. And they want oil. They want it so much that the President will keep the U.S. soldiers in Iraq until he can strong arm the passage of a law that provides cover for Western oil companies to control Iraq's vast oil wealth. That is the President's definition of mission accomplished. 
   The American people elected us to stand up to a President who is out of touch and out of control. Over 3,000 U.S. casualties ago, we were handed the gavel to lead against the President who had taken his Republican majority in Congress to suspend the coequal branch of government. 
   The President issued orders, and the Republicans bowed their heads and complied. We must lead, not capitulate. 
   American soldiers will never be safe as long as the President can order a military escalation in one breath and, in the next, predict growing casualties. The Iraq people will never be free so long as the President has the freedom to occupy their Nation. The American people will never be served as long as the President can go it alone in Iraq and in the halls of Congress. 
   The American people gave us a mission, but on this day, we have failed in that mission.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Chairman, as a child psychiatrist, I have seen lots of these kids. I have seen them both in detention centers and in mental health facilities and in a variety of settings in which youngsters with really severe problems, people try to handle them. And it is with that in mind, that is why I rise in strong support of H.R. 5876, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs For Teens Act of 2008. 
   It was introduced by my friend, GEORGE MILLER, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of what is a very important piece of legislation that will help protect America's kids. 
   In answer to the remarks of one of my colleagues just a moment ago about whether or not maybe we ought to let California deal with their problems, this is a problem nationwide. This is not a California problem. There are parents all over this country who have severely disturbed youngsters who try to find a place to place a kid in hopes that the program that is offered will in some way help their child get back on the track to being a successful adult. There are thousands of these youngsters every year that look for a place, some in their States, some outside their State. Parents know what they know. They may not know what the rules are in various States, and in some ways it is almost inevitable something like this, because of the transfer across State lines, that we have a national standard by which we require programs to operate. 
   They go to these programs for help in facing behavior and emotional problems, substance abuse and sometimes elements of building self-confidence that are known as bootstrap programs or wilderness camps or self-help boarding schools, and they operate across the country. 
   Now the teenagers who come into these programs receive help.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. But tragically, Madam Chairman, they sometimes become the victims of child abuse and neglect. And you have heard about the GAO study, and I think there are plenty of examples about why this is necessary. 
   The bill would stop any program from restraining kids for any reason other than safety. It would stop a program from withholding essential food and water, clothing and shelter. It would mandate education and training for workers. It would require operators to disclose everything from the roles and responsibilities of their employees to confirmed cases of abuse.  
   Now to ensure compliance, the department will be empowered to carry out unannounced inspections and enforcement. And above all, this bill places the safety and well-being of the child above marketing hype and unscrupulous operators. In some cases, people have closed a program in one State and moved to another State. These programs that truly help children with a positive, uplifting experience will only benefit from this legislation. 
   There is no place in America for a program that hurts kids who are there trying to get help. This is not a bootstrap program, it is a dangerous program that should be changed or shut down, and I urge my colleagues to support this. 
   To allow children who are unable to control their own emotions and their own well-being to be in the hands of people who aren't thinking about them from their safety first is really a misguided program, and this bill will correct that.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (THE PRESIDENT'S CALL TO LIFT THE BAN ON OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, we've just been treated to a lecture to a third grade class about what pollution we ought to worry about. Apparently, my colleague from Texas doesn't understand that the problem is that, when you burn oil, you pollute the atmosphere, and that's where the real problem is and why finding more oil is not the answer to the world's problems. 
   The American people have had a few days to consider the President's call to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling. The New York Times calls it ``The Big Pander to Big Oil,'' saying, ``This is worse than a dumb idea. It is cruelly misleading. It will make only a modest difference, at best, to prices at the pump, and even then, the benefits will be years away.'' 
   The Los Angeles Times was even blunter in its characterization of this proposal by our President. It said, ``It's nonsense for them to use the run-up in gas prices as an excuse to advocate offshore drilling.'' Continuing, ``What's really needed, though, is a moratorium on worthless suggestions from politicians for lowering gas prices.'' 
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's editorial, up north from Los Angeles, said, ``Offshore drilling: This well is dry.'' They said, ``But drilling/plundering our coasts for about 19 billion barrels of oil--that's really all that's available--is akin to placing a Band-Aid on the hemorrhaging wound that is our oil-dependent, wasteful lifestyle.'' 
   The Seattle Times called it Bush's last gasp on oil, and their editorial said, ``Longing for a higher mileage vehicle in the face of gasoline at $4.30 a gallon? The President's response has been ANWR, not CAFE. (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)--drilling in a wildlife refuge, not fuel efficiency.'' 
   There's a pattern here from coast to coast. The American people are tired of rhetoric that fails to meet the reality test. The oil industry already has access to 68 million acres of Federal oil reserves, but they are only pumping out press releases. The President already has access to mountains of data on the urgent need to dramatically change our energy policy to focus on renewable resources, conservation and efficiency. Instead, the President gives us political expediency that will not fill a gas tank, that will not lower gas prices and that will not help our addiction to oil. 
   For the first time, Congress will have to go it alone to shape energy policy for the 21st century. Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, has shown that the people's House is up to the task. This week, the House will consider several bills from Democratic leadership that builds upon our existing record for bold, new energy legislation. We are going to take up legislation that holds oil companies accountable, but the fact is we may not get it all done, and we may have to wait for a new President. As long as the oil dynasty occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we're not going to get any serious changes in this country. 
   So hang onto your hats, folks. You're going to have a lot of trouble with oil prices and with gas prices over the next few months.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we are here today on behalf of young people like Anthony Reeves, a former foster child in Georgia who wrote something that defines our call to action. ``Life is tough enough when transitioning out of care, but it's even tougher if you don't have the support that you need from people who care about you or if you don't have resources and skills packed along with the rest of our belongings as you are shown out the door.'' 
   Anthony's words should remind us that government, and ultimately society, acts as the legal guardian of foster children. These are our children, and the fact is we are failing too many of them. 
   There is no shortage of problems to confronting foster care--insufficient services for at-risk families, too few qualified case workers, and an outdated Federal eligibility standard, to name a few. We'll have to confront these issues in order to provide the comprehensive reform that is so urgently needed. 
   Today we are focused on the shortcomings in the existing system that can disconnect foster children from the things they need most--family, support and school. 
   Sometimes children have to be removed from their homes to protect them from abuse and neglect. That is a sad, but undeniable fact. But the foster system unnecessarily disrupts other connections to home, family and school for these vulnerable children at a time when they're most in need. One glaring example of this is when foster children are literally pushed out into the streets when they turn 18 years of age. No parent I know of severs all ties and abandons their kids at age 18, yet that is Federal policy for foster care. We displace them from their homes, support them, and then tell them to go it alone. Rather than provide a glide path to success, we subject foster children to a crash landing. 
   Another example is the inconsistent effort to help foster children stay connected to family. Today, we deny grandparents assistance if they become the legal guardians to a foster child. This is contrary to the growing base of research illustrating that children do better living with relative guardians than they do living in traditional foster homes. Additionally, siblings are too often separated during foster care placement just when a foster child most needs a brother or a sister. 
   Ensuring school stability is yet another area where we too often come up short. Not enough is done to ensure children that they can stay in their current schools when they are placed in foster care, thus depriving them of the one place where they may feel secure. 
   We also hear too many stories about foster children not receiving adequate health care services, especially for mental health. Furthermore, we have a special duty to ensure that prescription medications foster children are receiving are effective and appropriate instead of quick and easy. 
   And finally, we don't provide adequate assistance for Native American children who are removed from their homes and then cared for by tribal communities. 
   For Anthony Reeves and every foster child, we can and must do better. And that is why we are here today. The Fostering Connections Success Act addresses many of these issues. The legislation would allow States to extend foster care assistance up to age 21, giving young men and women more time to get an education and become truly self-sufficient. 
   Recognizing that many grandparents and other relatives want to provide loving, permanent homes for children in foster care, the bill would provide Federal payments to relatives who become legal guardians of children for whom they have cared for as foster parents.     
   It also requires improved efforts to keep siblings together when they are removed from their homes. The measure would require increased oversight of the health care needs of foster kids. And there is a renewed attention paid to ensuring educational stability for foster children in foster care, including avoiding frequent school changes. 
   Additionally, the bill gives tribes equal and fair access to Federal resources dedicated to keeping vulnerable children safe. For the first time, tribal child welfare programs could directly receive Federal foster care financing. The legislation also provides new resources to ensure all child welfare workers have access to training, which ultimately results in better care for kids. And, finally, this bill extends and improves incentives for States that increase the number of children adopted out of the foster care system. 
   The legislation includes two provisions outside of the foster care system which save money and thereby ensure that the bill is budget neutral. The first provision reduces Federal tax refunds for individuals who have fraudulently collected unemployment insurance. The same policy has already passed the House once. The second provision will allow the Treasury Department to improve the management of the government's short-term operating cash to achieve a better rate of return. While this bill doesn't do all that's needed, it does meet many of the critical challenges in our foster care system. 
   We received a letter today from the American Academy of Pediatrics, representing 60,000 professionals, urging passage. The academy said: ``Our Nation has a moral and legal obligation to provide the best possible care to these most vulnerable children.'' I couldn't agree more. 
   The legislation is bipartisan, budget neutral, and good for children, and deserves every Member's support. 
   Before I yield to my ranking member on the subcommittee and the co-author of this bill, let me first thank him for his dedication to foster children and his willingness to find common ground. Jerry Weller has been a true partner in doing what is right for our most vulnerable children. He's retiring from Congress this year, and I can think of no better parting gift than passing a bipartisan bill he worked on to improve the lives of foster children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I will only take a moment here at the end. The old rule we learned a long time ago is if you have the vote, shut up. So I am not going to make a long speech. 
   It has been a great pleasure to work with Mr. Weller. The only thing I really am sad about is that you won't be here to work with me on the Invest in Kids Act in the next legislative session of this Congress. 
   This bill obviously does not do everything. One would always like to do more. But what we did today was what was possible and what we could pay for and what we could agree upon. I think that that is the important thing for people to realize, that the Congress does work together, and it works best when the sides work together on issues like this. They can be resolved, even though some of these have some sticking points here and there, they can be resolved, and in this case, the children are the beneficiaries. I think for that, the Congress should all be proud today as we vote unanimously, I hope, for this bill. 
   I think that there are children out there right now who are going to benefit from this, whose stories, many of which we heard in the committee, and if we stood here and told the stories that we heard in the committee, everyone would be in support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (ESTABLISHING AN EARNED IMPORT ALLOWANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Beginning a generation ago under the leadership of John F. Kennedy, the United States became a world leader in ensuring that American trade policy is designed to encourage economic growth in developing countries. President Kennedy said that American apathy toward poor-country development ``would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience.'' It is a moral imperative for the United States to construct trade policies that foster development. 
   One billion people exist on less than $1 a day right now. The income gap between the least developed countries and the world's industrialized countries grew by nearly 40 percent over the last 25 years. The income of those people in rich countries is now 93 times that of those living in the least developed countries. 
   For nearly a generation, we know that the world's poor have gotten much poorer. When we consider President Kennedy's words, the call to action is compelling. 
   While we work toward a broad, multilateral agreement to lower trade barriers to goods and services produced in poor countries, we should also ensure that our unilateral policies are constructed as wisely as possible in order to spur development. The legislation before us takes a critical step in that direction. Let me highlight some of the important provisions in H.R. 6560, which is supported by a broad range of stakeholders including producers, importers, and consumer groups. 
   H.R. 6560 will extend the Generalized System of Preferences for 1 year providing producers in poor countries the certainty they need to retain and attract investment while providing importers effective access to affordable goods that are critical to their supply chain. U.S. consumers will benefit as a result. Importantly, this extension provides the Congress some breathing room to examine how GSP can improve to foster greater development abroad while also providing American producers greater certainty and opportunity. 
   The bill before us makes a narrow but critical change to the way we treat apparel imports from the Dominican Republic. This change, which is supported by all of the key stakeholders, including the U.S. textile industry, will better enable the Dominican Republic's apparel producers to compete with producers in East and Southeast Asia. 
   Anchoring a textile and apparel industry in Central America strengthens the economies of the entire Western Hemisphere. This provision also builds upon progress made earlier this year with respect to Haiti, helping to foster a much-needed economic growth in the Caribbean. 
   Lastly, this bill addresses two issues which are of specific concern to me because they're related to our trade policy towards sub-Saharan Africa. 
   For the past decade, my colleagues and I have continued to explore ways to encourage more investment in job creation in sub-Saharan Africa. We have done this primarily through enacting the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and some of our wishes have come true. We've seen the growth of an apparel industry in southern Africa, which has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and has provided hope for economic progress and justice. AGOA has contributed positively toward an increase in exports from sub-Saharan Africa in many countries, and a diversification of exports, which is good for economic growth and for stability in the region. 
   But it has also demonstrated that a trade policy is only one component of a development policy. Beginning in 2006, we experimented with a new idea to encourage greater investment in the upstream production of apparel. It was called the Abundant Supply Provision. It encouraged or required African apparel producers to first use locally produced fabric before sourcing fabric from producers in places like Asia. While well-intended, this provision has had the opposite effect of what the proponents sought. 
   Earlier this month, the Committee on Ways and Means hosted the trade ministers from the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. They told us that apparel exports under AGOA have declined 15 percent this year and that thousands of jobs are at risk if we do not repeal this abundant supply provision. By doing so today, we demonstrate that we have listened to Africa and that we are responding, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. 
   In addition, we will help enable the sub-Saharan African nation of Mauritius to compete in the global apparel industry by enabling them the ability to use third-country fabric in apparel exports that qualify under AGOA. 
   I'm looking forward to working with my colleagues to devise other measures that will better encourage upstream investment in sub-Saharan Africa, to promote job creation, and economic growth. 
   This legislation is a strong bipartisan measure, and I want to recognize the leadership of Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel, Ranking Member Jim McCrery, Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander Levin, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Wally Herger, who we will hear from in a moment. 
   I also want to recognize and thank the staff whose tireless efforts in the trenches have been invaluable. They are Tim Reif, Angela Ellard, Behnaz Kibria, and Warren Payne. 
   I believe our rightful place is at the front of the line when it comes to fighting global poverty by supporting economic and social justice. I believe that's what the U.S. meant in 2000 when we signed on to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. 
   We know our current policies fall short, but tonight we're moving in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6560 because John F. Kennedy was right back then and today. Let us learn from history and follow the inspiration of a great American leader who believed the United States,  Democrat and Republican, had the legislative duty and the moral responsibility to lead the world. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, when the President took office, gasoline cost less than $1.50 a gallon, and a barrel of oil was selling for $30. So they had a planning meeting down at the White House, and gas has jumped to $4.50 a gallon and oil is nearly $150 a barrel. 
   Despite these facts, the President would like the American people to believe that he has proposed a credible  new plan to lower energy prices, but consider this: The President's invasion of Iraq and tacit military threats to Iran have destabilized the Middle East and driven oil prices out of control. 
   Big Oil has leases, access, and decades to drill on millions of acres on the Continental Shelf, but they choose instead to drill down into the wallets of the American people. Oil companies are already exploring today. They're exploring the upper limits of their stock prices by using their billions in profits to buy back stock, not to reinvest in America. 
   We still don't know what the Vice President's secret meeting with the industry was when gas prices were $1.50 a gallon, but it sure looks like it's working for the oil companies, but it isn't working for us.

   ``James B. Comey, the straight-as-an-arrow former number two official of the Justice Department, yesterday offered the Senate Judiciary Committee an account of Bush administration lawlessness so shocking it would have been unbelievable coming from a less reputable source.'' 
   The American people understand that political appointees are a fact of life when a new President takes office, but the American people demand that competence and integrity overrule political party affiliation.

   The revelations began over the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys. Now there is a new revelation about Gonzalez trying to force the previous Attorney General to agree to anything the White House wanted. What else don't we know? 
   For the last 6 years, congressional oversight was nonexistent. What cases were priorities and what cases were not? And why not? What did and did not happen following the murder of an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Seattle? 
   My friend, Tom Wales, had been the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Seattle under the previous administration. He was a well-respected law enforcement officer known for his pursuit of white color criminals. He was also a vocal and strong advocate for gun control. Tom was shot and killed in his home while working at his computer one late night in October. If Tom was killed, as some suspect, because of those he brought to justice, then he died in the line of duty. No one has ever been charged, although there are news accounts that indicate authorities have a prime suspect. 
   Now there is a new suspicion. Did the White House want its appointee in Seattle, John McKay, fired in part because he was vigorously pursuing the Tom Wales case? 
   Someone sent me a blog recently asking the same fundamental question: Why would Justice not throw every available resource into finding Tom's killer? Why would they not want the investigation by their own U.S. Attorney in Seattle to proceed with every possible resource? 
   Some bloggers say it is all because of Tom's advocacy for gun control, but the answer may be tragically simpler. Maybe Gonzalez wanted the Republican U.S. Attorney appointee in Seattle to spend all his time on something else; to find or, if necessary, invent voter fraud in a close Washington governor's race, narrowly won by the Democrat. Could they have been that arrogant, that uncaring about the death of a good man, an Assistant U.S. Attorney? Most people would have dismissed that notion until recently. Now the revelations about the Attorney General and the attitude he took toward cases, perhaps including the murder of a Federal officer in Seattle, cannot be adequately described by words like shocking. 
   At this point, I believe there are two necessary mandatory actions that must be taken. The Attorney General must go, now. His allegiance to partisan political interests above his oath to uphold the laws of the United States is outrageous. 
   Secondly, even if it requires the appointment of an outside independent prosecutor, the Justice Department should immediately, vigorously and conclusively investigate the murder of Tom Wales and not stop until the killer is charged and brought to justice. We owe that to Tom Wales, his family, and every law enforcement officer who risks his or her life every day in service to the American people.  
   Mr. Comey's Tale: A Standoff at a Hospital Bedside Speaks Volumes About Attorney General Gonzales 
   James B. Comey, the straight-as-an-arrow former No. 2 official at the Justice Department, yesterday offered the Senate Judiciary Committee an account of Bush administration lawlessness so shocking it would have been unbelievable coming from a less reputable source. The episode involved a 2004 nighttime visit to the hospital room of then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft by Alberto Gonzales, then the White House counsel, and Andrew H. Card Jr., then the White House chief of staff. Only the broadest outlines of this visit were previously known: that Mr. Comey, who was acting as attorney general during Mr. Ashcroft's illness, had refused to recertify the legality of the administration's warrantless wiretapping program; that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card had tried to do an end-run around Mr. Comey; that Mr. Ashcroft had rebuffed them. 
   Mr. Comey's vivid depiction, worthy of a Hollywood script, showed the lengths to which the administration and the man who is now attorney general were willing to go to pursue the surveillance program. First, they tried to coerce a man in intensive care--a man so sick he had transferred the reins of power to Mr. Comey--to grant them legal approval. Having failed, they were willing to defy the conclusions of the nation's chief law enforcement officer and pursue the surveillance without Justice's authorization. Only in the face of the prospect of mass resignations--Mr. Comey, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and most likely Mr. Ashcroft himself--did the president back down. 
   As Mr. Comey testified, ``I couldn't stay, if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the Department of Justice had said had no legal basis.'' The crisis was averted only when, the morning after the program was reauthorized without Justice's approval, President Bush agreed to fix whatever problem Justice had with it (the details remain classified). ``We had the president's direction to do ..... what the Justice Department believed was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its legality,'' Mr. Comey said. 
   The dramatic details should not obscure the bottom line: the administration's alarming willingness, championed by, among others, Vice President Cheney and his counsel, David Addington, to ignore its own lawyers. Remember, this was a Justice Department that had embraced an expansive view of the president's inherent constitutional powers, allowing the administration to dispense with  following the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Justice's conclusions are supposed to be the final word in the executive branch about what is lawful or not, and the administration has emphasized since the warrantless wiretapping story broke that it was being done under the department's supervision. 
   Now, it emerges, they were willing to override Justice if need be. That Mr. Gonzales is now in charge of the department he tried to steamroll may be most disturbing of all.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say what the real issue here is. The Republicans are willing to say that 50,000 rich fat cats are more important than 21 million middle-class folks in this country. 
   Now, the people they're defending are people who have an adjusted gross income of $1 million, or more, who knows, and those folks are paying a 15 percent tax rate. That means they have to pay $150,000 in taxes. Oh, my God, they have to get by on $850,000. What we're saying is, let's tax them like the fireman who pays 30 percent. Thirty percent of $1 million is $300,000. Those poor people, they'll only have $700,000 to get by on. That's what it's about, folks.  
   Congress has an opportunity to demonstrate real leadership today by supporting a visionary proposal put forward by Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel of New York. 
   First, we're going to help millions of middle class Americans by passing the tax extenders that are included in this legislation; without them, 23 million Americans would be harmed by a tax provision called AMT that was never intended to affect and hurt the middle class. 
   As part of the extensions in the bill, I included a provision that will extend the deduction for payment of local sales tax. Yes, people in my State of Washington will benefit, but so will taxpayers in the eight other States where there is no State income tax. 
   I am pleased that Mr. Brady joined me in this important matter. It is another sign that we have produced legislation that is bi-partisan. 
   This is only a 1-year extension, but I think we will have an opportunity to make it permanent when the House begins considering tax reform, and the visionary proposal put forward by Chairman Rangel. 
   Fact is, we are restoring fiscal discipline and so even good proposals that rightly benefit people cannot be fully implemented all at once because of the need to find ways to actually pay for what we propose to spend or return. And that may be the most important point of all. 
   Chairman Rangel has produced an honest proposal based on dollars and sense. 
   What's different today, Mr. Speaker, is that this House has decided to pay for this tax relief. 
   We are going to save middle America from the alternative minimum tax, and do so by closing the big tax loopholes that billionaires have been driving their Hummers through. 
   On Wednesday, the Department of the Treasury informed the Nation that we are 9 trillion dollars in debt. Last month President Bush signed the fifth debt-limit increase since the beginning of his term. 
   He talks about being a fiscal conservative but his Republican Congress emptied your wallets and borrowed astronomical sums of money on credit. 
   As a result of this fiscal mismanagement, the dollar is on the brink of collapse and the Chinese are suggesting they'd prefer to hold debt in Euros instead of the greenback. It's not just the credit markets on Wall Street that are in trouble. Our public credit market is in jeopardy, too. 
   So what does the Bush Administration and his rubber-stampers in the minority suggest? They want to extend these tax cuts, but borrow the money to pay for them. 
   That's not the kind of leadership America needs. I urge support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, my concern that the President might launch a military strike against Iran is well known; but my mission here today is not rhetorical. I am here to propose that Members of Congress participate in an Iran war game. 
   Television could carry the event so the American people can watch it all. We know that the Pentagon has conducted war games to examine the casualties and consequences of a U.S. military strike against Iran. We should, too. 
   Here are some of the questions that could be answered: Could we use bunker buster bombs? Could a U.S. military strike against Iran result in a wider Middle East war? What provocation would cause the President to provoke such a strike? 
   A group of retired, high-level CIA agents brought this idea to me. These are patriots whom we trusted with keeping and protecting America's secrets. They and others, including a retired Air Force colonel who conducted war games in the Pentagon, would accurately produce a U.S.-Iran war game just as it is done in the Pentagon. I know because they gave me the plan. 
   A military strike against Iran would involve life-and-death issues. We need to understand what they would look like. I urge my colleagues and the media to join me in demanding that we publicly conduct a U.S.-Iran war game as soon as possible. 
   Think what we would have learned if we had done it before Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (TENSIONS IN THE WORLD TODAY -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, it says something about tensions in the world today when the first thing I want to enter into the Record is a reminder of my strong and long-standing commitment to the defense of Israel, the safety and security of the Jewish people, and the absolute right of Israel to exist. 
   I offer this preamble because I also want to say I am deeply troubled by the news reports around the world today that Israel recently conducted a major military exercise in what many military analysts see as training for a possible strike against Iran. 
   The United States supplies Israel with billions of dollars in military hardware, training and intelligence, and I believe it is both appropriate and urgent for the U.S. to raise questions about their intentions and to aggressively pursue diplomacy in this region. 
   We have made such a mess of things in Iraq that it's hard to believe that any nation can think war can achieve peace. 
   News reports say Israel conducted a massive military exercise in plain sight to send signals to the United States, Europe, and Iran that Israel is prepared to launch a massive military strike against targets in Iran if diplomatic efforts to halt or delay its nuclear program fail. 
   Almost immediately, Iran retaliated in the press saying any attack against its proud nation with a strong military capability would be met with an equally massive counteroffensive. The media reminds us that Iran has just taken delivery of accurate Russian-made surface-to-air missiles. We are edging perilously close to a hair-trigger moment when someone, somewhere, will do something that turns saber rattling into a provocative military confrontation, and we will be at war again on another front. I am deeply worried by that. 
   There are those who would have us believe that U.S. military superiority ultimately trumps any nation, any force. We are the most powerful military Nation on Earth, but with power comes responsibility, accountability and leadership. 
   For all the bombs and guns and missiles we have at our disposal, history is replete with failed policies and missions and dubious figureheads we propped up against the will of the people, and any rational approach to U.S. foreign policy. This includes the history of our U.S. secret involvement in Iran in the 1950s when we and the British worked to overthrow and replace the Iran elected leader, Mohammed Mossadegh, and installed the Shah of Iran. We kept him in office because we wanted a direct pipeline to Iran's oil well.     
   As the most powerful Nation on Earth, you would think that we could  do a lot more to prevent war than simply wringing our hands while we read the newspapers. And I think we can. 
   First, we have to abandon the notion that all U.S. policy begins and ends behind the butt of a gun. Now some will stand up and say, Well, that is just Jim McDermott, the doctor, who believes we don't have to use guns to fight for peace. Well, I have some company. 
   I would like to enter into the Record a story carried earlier this week in the Asia Times. It reports on the first conference held by the Center for New American Security. Ambassador James Dobbins, who was special envoy to Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo under President Clinton and special envoy to Afghanistan under the current President Bush said that this was about U.S. policy in Iran: ``I reject the theory that the implicit threat of force is a necessary prerequisite to successful diplomacy.'' 
   Let me read the news story: 
   ``Looking back on 40 years of U.S. diplomacy, Dobbins, now director of the Rand International Security and Defense Policy Center, concluded that the conventional wisdom about the need to back up diplomacy with your adversaries with force is wrong. 
   ``'I can say that most of it was not conducted against a background of threat of force,' said Dobbins, `and when the threat of force was introduced, diplomacy failed.' 
   ``In a line that got applause from the more than 750 people attending the conference, Dobbins said his solution was to `deal with Iran.' '' 
   I urge everyone to read this story and I urge the administration and the Congress to start asking tough questions and demanding straight answers while there is still time. 
   We have seen what strikes in Iraq did back in the 1980s. We saw a strike in Syria a few months ago, and we are going to wake up one morning with another problem on our hands if we don't start asking serious, tough questions of this administration.  
   DEAL, DEAL, DEAL WITH IRAN  
   Washington--The assumption that the United States should exploit its military dominance to exert pressure on adversaries has long dominated the thinking of the US national security and political elite. But this central tenet of conventional security doctrine was sharply rejected last week by a senior practitioner of crisis diplomacy at the debut of a major new centrist foreign policy think-tank. 
   At the first conference of the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), ambassador James Dobbins, who was former president Bill Clinton's special envoy for Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo and the George W Bush administration's first special envoy to Afghanistan, sharply rejected the well-established concept of coercive diplomacy. 
   Dobbins declared in a panel on Iran policy, ``I reject the theory that the implicit threat of force is a necessary prerequisite to successful diplomacy.'' 
   Looking back on 40 years of US diplomacy, Dobbins, now director of the Rand International Security and Defense Policy Center, concluded that the conventional wisdom about the need to back up diplomacy with adversaries with force is wrong. ``I can say that most of it was not conducted against a background of threat of force,'' said Dobbins, and when the threat of force was introduced, ``diplomacy failed''. 
   In diplomatic dealings with the Soviet Union, however, Dobbins said, ``We never threatened to use force.'' 
   Dobbins complained that the debate over diplomacy with regard to Iran has been between those who are ready to use military force now and those who ``say we should talk with them first''. Advocates of diplomacy, he said, have to ``meet a high threshold--they have to offer the reversal of all Iranian positions''. In effect, they have to deliver Iranian ``capitulation'', said Dobbins. 
   Although very different from the Soviet Union as a threat, Dobbins observed, Iran is similar in that ``we can't afford to ignore it and we can't overrun it''. Real diplomacy in regard to Iran, he argued, would result in ``better information and better options''. 
   In a line that got applause from the more than 750 people attending the conference, Dobbins said his solution was to ``deal with Iran''. 
   The Dobbins argument represents the first high-profile challenge by a veteran of the US national security community to a central tenet of national security officials and the US political elite ever since the end of the Cold War. 
   The recently established CNAS has strong connections with former Clinton administration national security officials and the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party. CNAS president Michele A. Flournoy and chief executive officer Kurt M. Campbell both held positions in the Clinton Defense Department. William J. Perry and Madeleine K. Albright, Clinton's secretaries of defense and state, respectively, gave opening remarks at the conference. 
   The Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and of the national security elite has long associated itself with the idea that the threat of military force--and even force itself--should be at the center of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Key figures from the Clinton administration, including Perry, Albright, former United Nations ambassador Richard Holbrooke, former assistant secretary of state James P. Rubin and former deputy national security adviser James Steinberg, lined up in support of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq in 2003. 
   Flournoy and Campbell have already made it clear that CNAS' orientation will be to hew the common ground uniting the national security professionals who have served administrations of both parties. Flournoy co-authored an op-ed with former Bush administration deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage two days before the NCAS conference, and Armitage also introduced the conference. 
   A paper by Flournoy and two junior co-authors ostensibly calling for a new U.S. ``grand strategy'' is notable for its reluctance to go too far in criticizing the Bush administration's policies. It argues that the current US positions in Iraq pose the ``real threat of strategic exhaustion'' and calls for ``rebalancing risk'', but offers no real alternative to indefinite continuation of the Bush administration's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Instead, it urged the ``rearticulation'' of goals in both Iraq and Afghanistan by replacing the ``maximalist language used in past years'' with ``pragmatism''. 
   But the choice of Dobbins to anchor a panel on Iran indicates that the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and of the national security community now has serious doubts about the coercive diplomacy approach to Iran that has dominated policy thinking since the beginning of the Clinton administration. 
   A paper on Iran policy co-authored by Campbell and released at the conference reflects a new skepticism toward the threat of an attack on Iran as a way of obtaining Iranian cooperation. It argues that U.S. military threats against Iran ``have had the opposite effect'' from what was desired, hardening the resolve of Iranian leaders to enrich uranium and giving the Islamic regime greater credibility with the Iran people. 
   The paper also reflected an unwillingness to dispense entirely with the military option, however, proposing that the United States ``de-emphasize, but not forswear, the possibility of military action against Iran''. 
   The paper advised against even taking the military threat off the table in return for Iran's stopping its nuclear program, on the ground that Washington must be able to use that threat to bargain with Iran over ``stopping its support for terrorism''. 
   The principal author of the paper, James N. Miller, who is senior vice president and director of studies at CNAS, explained in an interview after the conference that he believes Dobbins' assessment of the problem is ``about right''. Miller said the threat to use force against Iran to coerce it on its nuclear program ``is not useful or credible now''. 
   But Miller said he would not give up that threat, because the next president might enter into serious negotiations with Iran, and Iran might refuse to ``play ball'' and go ahead with plans to acquire nuclear weapons. If the president had a strong coalition behind him, he said, ``The use of force is an option that one should consider.'' 
   The idea that diplomatic negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program must be backed by the threat of war is so deeply entrenched in Washington that endorsement of it seems to have become a criteria for any candidate being taken seriously by the national security community. 
   Thus all three top Democratic hopefuls supported it during their primary fight for the Democratic nomination. 
   Addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention in early 2007, Hillary Clinton said that, in dealing with the possibility of an Iranian nuclear capability, ``no option can be taken off the table''. Barack Obama and John Edwards also explicitly refused to rule out the use of force against Iran if it refused to accept U.S. demands to end its uranium enrichment program.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to what I heard out here.  
   I was sitting in my office listening, and it is interesting to imagine yourself being like the people at home listening on television to the Republicans talk about fiscal responsibility. Now, you have just heard the figures, but I want to bring back some images to your mind because a budget is a statement of your principles and what you care about in society. 
   I remember when Katrina hit and we were sitting watching television looking at the absolute chaos and failure of the Republicans to deal with a national crisis. Those pictures looked like the Third World. In fact, we were quicker to go out to Indonesia to deal with the effects of tsunami than we were to deal with the problems of people in our own country, in New Orleans. 
   In large measure, I believe, the election of 2006 was a rejection by the American people of the Republican we-don't-want-government-to-work philosophy. Anybody who appoints a guy who runs cattle shows or horse shows to run the emergency management organization in this country does not care about the security of the American people. Meanwhile, giving tax breaks. Unbelievable. Spending us into a deficit. 
   I mean, when I came to Congress, all I heard for the first 6 years were Republicans coming out and saying, We have to pass a balanced budget amendment. By God, we have got to balance the budget. 
   So we did in 1994. We did it, and lo and behold, here comes all this money in and soon we have a balanced budget with a potential surplus. The Republicans win, and I don't know whether they had amnesia or they didn't really mean it in the first place when they talked about a balanced budget. You can choose which of those you want. 
   Either they were deceiving the people or they just lost their minds when they got in control and spent us into this hole. Now for them to come out and say we are going to balance the budget in 2012, why don't you say you are going to balance the budget in 2049? That is as good a date as any. You don't mean it. You never meant it because when you came in, you made decision after decision after decision that dug the hole deeper. The old aphorism everybody knows in this country: If you are in a hole, the first thing you should do is stop digging. But the Republicans, session after session, came out here and dug the hole deeper. I don't know what they were looking for. Maybe they were looking for china or gold. I don't know where they were going. But, clearly, the budgeting that has come out of the Republicans was phony from the outset and the people said we don't want any more of that. 
   The people want a government that works. There is a reason why we have government. We have government to do those things for people that they cannot do for themselves. All of us over here believe in individual responsibility. We think people should be responsible. They should save money. They should get an education. They should raise their children. None of us over here disagree with that individual responsibility. 
   But there are some things that people cannot do for themselves. They cannot prevent the effects of a hurricane. They look to the government to deal with that. But the Republicans said, No problem. Leave the jobs open. And you could find the same kind of things all through this budget, whether you are looking at the national parks or you are looking at what they have done to the environment. 
   The President bragged about what a great education Governor he was, and he came in here and told us we are going to have this No Child Left Behind bill. Then he proceeded to underfund it by $17 billion. Now, if you are serious about schools, you put the money in schools. You don't give tax breaks to people making a half million dollars a year. They have got enough to get by. Most all of them can pretty much get by on half a million. But there are schools in this country which are failing for the lack of money to do the things that are necessary for the school system. 
   And the choice the President made was let's give the tax break. Never mind that silly bill I had about No Child Left Behind. He didn't mean it. You didn't mean it. And that is why we had the election of 2006. And the budget you see out here is the priorities of the Democrats trying to bring some sense back to a government that we want to actually function when the people look to it and need it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (HEALTH CARE: THE BIGGEST DOMESTIC CRISIS FACING AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, the biggest domestic crisis facing America today is health care. Every 30 seconds, an American files for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious health problem. So says a recent study from Harvard University. And that is just one of the chilling new statistics that should compel Congress to act. 
   Every Band-Aid has been tried and has not solved the problem. Instead, the crisis of health care has been allowed to fester like an open wound. We cannot continue to tinker around the edges. 
   Today, the health care system is increasingly dysfunctional. America is fast becoming a nation of haves and have-nots, those wealthy enough to afford comprehensive health care coverage and the vast majority of American people struggling to maintain coverage. 
   It is time to provide universal health care for every American, and the only delivery system that works is a single-payer health care system, which is what I propose in H.R. 1200. We don't need to change the way health care is delivered. We do need to change the way we pay for it. 
   Today's health care system is pockmarked with inequities, overutilization and uncertainty. We don't get the benefit or the cost-savings of a risk pool that includes every American. Instead, we have wildly different programs, costs and outcomes across this country. 
   The casualties are mounting and spreading. America's health care crisis is fast becoming America's economic crisis, especially for small business, the backbone of the U.S. economy. 
   Data compiled by credible organizations reveals the depth of the crisis. We are spending over four times as much on health as we are on national defense, yet 47 million Americans are defenseless because they don't have any health care coverage at all. We are spending over $2 trillion a year on health, an average of $6,280 per person, and it is too much.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Chairman, we know what needs to be done. The PEPFAR reauthorization bill is it, and we're doing it. 
   This bipartisan bill not only reauthorizes PEPFAR but also dramatically strengthens the programs. H.R.  5501 elevates the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria from an emergency to sustainability. In so doing, we declare that HIV is no longer the death sentence that it was only 5 short years ago. We can hope and strive for a generation free of HIV and AIDS. 
   I want to thank the chairman and the subcommittee chairman for including provisions in the legislation that Representative Granger and I introduced, which strengthens the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. We must ensure that women and children have access to early screening and lifesaving drug therapies. We can do this by providing greater training and education on effective prevention. We also must ensure that they integrate these services with other maternal health efforts. 
   Every day more than 1,000 children around the world are infected with HIV. An estimated 90 percent of those infections occur in Africa. But a single dose of an antiretroviral drug given once to the mother at the onset of labor and once to the newborn during the first 3 days of life reduces transmission by 50 percent. Fewer than 10 percent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-poor countries have access to these prevention services. But I'm proud that this bill includes prevention provisions to strengthen our commitment to prevention and save lives in the process. 
   Perhaps the most important provisions are those that recognize the importance of expanding access to screening and treatment of women and children. H.R. 5501 also provides my provisions to establish two 5-year targets that will bring us closer to a generation free of HIV/AIDS. 
   The first goal is to increase the percentage of children receiving treatment under PEPFAR from 9 to 15 percent. Treatment allows the greatest hope for giving a child infected with HIV the chance to an adulthood free of the disease. 
   The second goal is for 80 percent of pregnant women in the most affected countries to receive HIV counseling and testing and, where necessary, antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission. 
   The biggest limitation on reaching these goals is the availability of trained personnel. This bill sets a goal of 140,000 people to be trained by 2015. In South Africa, where my wife is working on the ground in this epidemic, they are closing pediatric hospitals because there's no pediatrician to run them. Now, the 80 percent goal is a down payment on our hope of achieving 100 percent by the time this authorization expires. 
   We have a chance today to send a message that America cares enough to lead the world in fighting these deadly diseases. We should speak loud and clearly. The legislation gives more people the chance to be survivors instead of statistics.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that strengthens our commitment to fighting the global HIV/AIDS/TB and malaria epidemic.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, this is the choice we have to make today. We stand up for our children and their future or we stand down with the President and tobacco companies. Good health or no health for millions of poor and disadvantaged children across America--that is what's at stake today. 
   The President will spend $50 billion in 5 months on a war in Iraq, but he won't spend $35 billion over 5 years on poor and vulnerable kids. We pay for SCRIP but we will keep paying for the war for decades to come. We take care of our children while the President passes his war costs on to our children, and grandchildren. 
   We can vote to provide access to quality, affordable health care for our Nation's children by voting to override this veto, or we can vote to sit back and watch the economic security of our working families erode day by day, as this Administration has done. 
   The President said he is using his veto pen on SCRIP to show he is relevant, but with the stroke of a pen he has merely shown he is irresponsible with the health and welfare of America's future. 
   Let's set a good example for our children and support a bipartisan, fiscally responsible, health care bill that will get us one step closer to universal coverage for all Americans.

   All this talk about benchmarks is a diversionary tactic by the administration to keep making war. Last November, the American people elected Democrats for one reason above all others, to get U.S. soldiers out of Iraq and get Americans out of the Iraq war. 
   The American people have given up on the credibility of the President. Every week another poll confirms another vote of no confidence by the American people against this President. In a new poll, the Americans disapprove of the President's handling of the Iraq war by a two to one margin. 
   Newsweek magazine has the President's approval ratings even lower. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans believe the President's actions in Iraq show he is stubborn and unwilling to admit his mistakes. 
   In USA Today, nearly 80 percent don't believe the President's assertion that a U.S. presence in Iraq is preventing terror attacks here at home. 
   The American people get it. Nothing good comes from being in Iraq, and nothing worse will happen by leaving Iraq. 
   The American people have issued orders, but the President refuses to redeploy his thinking. More U.S. soldiers and more Iraqi civilians are dying every day. Iraqi children are being traumatized every day by the sight of dead bodies in the street. Over a million Iraqi civilians have fled to Jordan and Syria, where the refugee crisis grows by the hour. 
   And the President's plan to address this reality is spending more money building concrete walls in Baghdad. Walling in the Iraqi people isn't going to solve anything and may, in fact, worsen the ethnic cleansing that is essentially a part of a civil war raging throughout the country. 
   How ironic that a Republican President authorizes building concrete walls to contain and separate Iraqi people. The Soviets tried it in Berlin, and it wasn't many years later that Ronald Reagan, a Republican President, told Gorbachev, ``Tear down this wall.'' 
   Iraqi leaders are demanding that the U.S. stop building walls that are in effect concrete jail cells, locking up innocent Iraqi citizens and making them easy prey for more attacks. It may be their country, but that doesn't matter to this White House. 
   By yesterday, 144 Iraqi lawmakers out of 275 signed a petition calling for the U.S. to set a timetable to withdraw. That is a majority. The story broke this morning on Alternet.com, and one of the reporters, Joshua Holland, has broken other significant news stories concerning Iraq. This is the first time that over half of the duly elected members of the Iraqi Parliament have gone on the record demanding a date for U.S. withdrawal. 
   Iraqi leaders want their country back, but this President isn't going to honor that request. The President's veto of the supplemental Iraq spending bill was his de facto military escalation of the war, a declaration that he intends to keep making declarations of war, not peace, and the President's veto was his rejection of working with the Congress to end the Iraq war. 
   A war with benchmarks is still a war. A war with benchmarks in this administration is a war without end. The only benchmark this administration will understand is an up-or-down vote on the Iraq war. And we have been promised an up-or-down vote on Iran, and we need to take that as well. 
   Members deserve the opportunity to say with their vote what they think and what we are hearing back home from our constituents. Unless we do the job the American people elected us to do, the President won't be the only one getting a vote of no confidence. 
   The people have spoken and spoken. In the People's House, it is time we accept the will of the American people. Schedule an up-or-down vote on setting a timetable for getting U.S. soldiers out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, as I listen to my colleagues on the other  side today, it seems like I am back in medical school in 1963 when the American Medical Association president told us, if we get that Medicare, that will be the end of health care in this country; there is no way we will have any kind of good health care in this country. 
   Well, the fact is we would never have had it if we waited for you to do it. During the 12 years you were in control, you proposed not one single way to deal with the 46 million Americans who have no health insurance. 
   Now with respect to senior citizens, they are isolated in a blizzard of confusing programs and options which cost more than a 250 percent difference in the same zip code. I live in 98119. You can spent 250 percent different depending on which program. 
   People don't know that. My mother is 97, and you expect them to pick this up. They ought to get a lower cost, and we are going to get it for them by getting the Secretary to negotiate them, as he should. That creates a huge national pool that the companies cannot ignore, and they are going to have to work toward the common good. 
   Now, it is time we worked for the common good in here, not for the pharmaceutical industry or the insurance industry or anybody else but the seniors who have to deal with the prices of their drugs. That is what they are asking for us. It is the same proposal we have used in the VA. 
   You would think we would be doing that to the veterans if it was bad? Come on. This is good for the veterans, it is good for the seniors, and it is finally working toward the common good in this House.

<DOCNO>Mr. McDERMOTT. (AIR FORCE TANKER DECISION -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, even before the Air Force announced its decision on a new tanker, serious questions were being raised about the fairness of the process and the justification of the outcome. Barely a week later, it is becoming increasingly clear that the United States Air Force has called an air strike on U.S. jobs, U.S. companies, and a level playing field. That is grounds for a reduction in rank. You can't tell Boeing you want a 767-size tanker, then change your mind, and then deny them the ability to fairly compete with the Triple-7. As it stands, the Airbus won't even fit in our hangars. Maybe the biggest reason the Air Force has an aging tanker fleet is because it has a prehistoric process that ought to be rendered extinct like the dinosaurs. 
   This is about fairness, this is about selecting the right company to keep America strong, and it so happens the right company is Boeing. Boeing offers the best people, the best plane, and the best deal, but the Air Force shot them down with a botched decision that outsources our national defense to foreign companies. If they won't admit their mistake, Congress should do it for them. The U.S. tanker decision should be grounded because it is unsafe to fly.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, when Katharine Lee Bates wrote ``America the Beautiful'' in 1893, I believe her poetic lyrics were intended to express the goodness of the American people as much as the natural beauty of our great Nation. America was founded on the concept of helping one another, and that selfless spirit expresses itself in countless acts of goodness by ordinary Americans every day. 
   I want to harness that American spirit, and I want to make it a part of the American experience. Mr. Farr, Mr. Walsh, and Mr. Shays have joined me in putting this amendment together, and we had a bill previously, because we believe that making this possible for every American is really where we ought to be. 
   We all benefit in countless ways from a Nation that is our home. I believe we owe something in return. But there are countless ways for every American to serve and give back to America, and America certainly could use their help. That's why we put this together as an amendment to establish a Congressional Commission on Civic Service. 
   We want this commission to investigate ways to create a broader commitment to national service in order to strengthen our common sense of responsibility to our community, our Nation, and to each other. 
   The commission would hold hearings around the country to engage the American people and get their own ideas. Whether it's in schools or nursing homes or prisons or mental hospitals or in the forests or cleaning up beaches or whatever, we want to talk to the local people. The commission would report to Congress with recommendations on how to harness the power of one, that is, the power of American people to improve our Nation. 
   Our amendment is a first step. It is simply an authorization, and the Congress will need to follow up with an appropriation. It mirrors the legislation we introduced last year, H.R. 1819. 
   Throughout the process, we have worked closely with some of America's best organizations: Voices for Service Coalition, the National Peace Corps Association, Corporation for National and Community Service, and the State AmeriCorps Administrators. 
   President John Kennedy once said: ``Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' From that came the Peace Corps and other organizations similar, and we want to recreate that sense of American expectation in this time. With this amendment we want to help America answer that question and the call. 
   Today America needs the American people like never before to meet the challenges of a slowing economy, health care, education, conservation. The government can't do it all, and ordinary Americans can and in many cases already do much of it. 
   It's time to build on the success of our national service programs like AmeriCorps by considering bold proposals that compel, inspire, and enable us to tackle the challenges, big and small, that will always confront us. There is no shortage of ideas. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, I am waiting for Mr. Farr, but we will see if he gets here in time. 
   The recommendations produced by this commission would be a plan of action because it will look at three key areas: to improve the ability of Americans to serve, to improve our community here and abroad. It will also identify and offer solutions to the barriers that make it difficult to perform national service and volunteer. And, finally, we will look at ways to build the foundation of service opportunities that are currently available. 
   According to the data collected from the Census Bureau, Americans over the age of 16 are volunteering at an historically high rate with 61.2 million, giving their time in 2006 to help others by mentoring students, beautifying neighborhoods, and restoring homes after disasters.
