<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1367 provides that it shall be in order on the legislative day of Thursday, July 24, 2008, for the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules relating to energy. 
   Today, a barrel of oil costs $124. Last week it was $134. In June, it was over $140 a barrel. Congress is acting, and the market is reacting. Many factors, we know, contribute to the price of a barrel of oil: demand, supply, our economy, speculation, actions that Congress does or doesn't take. But make no mistake, the actions that this Congress has taken and will take are having an impact, a positive impact, to bring down the price of a barrel of oil. 
   To just remind my colleagues what this Congress did, on May 13, we passed H.R. 6022, a bill I sponsored, to halt shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That bill was signed into law by the President. 
   On June 26, we passed H.R. 6377 to squeeze speculation out of the market by directing that the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, utilize its authority to better regulate the energy markets. 
   On July 17, a strong majority of the House supported H.R. 6515, the DRILL Act. This bill would actually open up 22 million acres in Alaska for drilling and direct oil companies to either use the leases they have on the remaining 68 million acres, or lose them. They have the opportunity to increase production. We are asking them to do it. 
   Every time the price of oil declines, consumers and businesses save money. Let me just give one example. The airline industry alone, it costs them $430 million every time the price of a barrel of oil goes up $1. In the past 20 days, the price of oil has come down nearly $20. That is approximately an $860 million savings for the airline industry and our traveling public. 
   The energy crisis that we face is real, and it requires long-term action, but it also requires immediate action. And the actions that we can take to take the pressure off the price, we should take. Although the price has recently fallen, we have much more we can do, and we must today take this opportunity to provide the immediate relief that will occur by releasing 10 percent of the oil now in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the market. That would get relief to the American consuming public within 2 weeks. 
   Incidentally, this is not an unprecedented action by Congress. It is smart policy, it is nimble policy. It has been done in the past by Republican and by Democratic Presidents. A few examples: on January 16, 1991, the first President Bush released fuel from the SPR. That was in conjunction with the start of the Gulf War. President Bush said this will send an important message to the American people that their $20 million investment in an emergency supply of crude oil has produced a system that can respond rapidly. 
   A second time, September 22, 2000, President Clinton released 30 million barrels from the SPR into the market. President Clinton said, ``This is the right thing to do. It is good energy policy. It is good national security policy, and good family policy.'' The market responded immediately with prices dropping 18.7 percent. 
   Incidentally, when the first President Bush did it, the price went down 33 percent. Our own President Bush, August 31, 2005, he authorized a drawdown of crude oil from the SPR. This was after Hurricane Katrina. Prices dropped 9.1 percent. 
   So what we have within our grasp is the opportunity to take an action recently taken by three Presidents that immediately resulted in the reduction of the price of gasoline. In one case 9 percent, in another case 18 percent, and in a third case 33 percent. This is a time-tested action that will help Americans now address the crippling cost of fuel. 
   Many of my colleagues have joined together urging the President to use his authority to release fuel from the SPR. The President can do that with a stroke of the pen. But if the President refuses to act, Congress must act. We know, incidentally, Madam Speaker, that this bill will not solve our energy problems. It is going to take a long-term change in our energy policies to release ourselves from our addiction to oil. Releasing fuel from the SPR is not a substitute for a long-term policy, but it is a necessary action and a practical action to provide immediate relief now by using a resource that does belong to the American people. 
   Let's keep in mind that we do need a change in direction on our energy policy. Our country has 2 percent of the proven reserves of energy in the world. We are about 4 percent of the population, and we are consuming 25 percent of the world's energy. That is not sustainable. It is not good for our long-term security. We know we can do better by having a policy that includes higher mileage standards for our vehicles, higher energy efficiency standards, tax incentives for clean energy alternatives, better construction designs, and restoration of mass transit and rail. By doing that, we can create jobs, improve our environment, develop affordable energy, and strengthen our national security. But let's take the immediate short-term actions that are within our grasp to take that will provide immediate relief to our airline industry, to our businesses, and to our consumers and American families. Take the actions that we can take, and take them now. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, this bill is really a simple and straightforward opportunity for Congress to take an action taken by previous Presidents and Congresses to lower the price at the pump for the American consumer and for American businesses. 
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has over 700 million barrels of oil. That is an asset that was bought and paid for by the American taxpayer, it's an asset of the American taxpayer and citizen, and it's there to be used for the benefit of the American citizen and the American taxpayer. 
   This legislation would direct that 10 percent of that reserve--10 percent only; 70 million barrels--could be released. And what we've seen in history is that in the three most previous instances where, with a stroke of a pen, the President has used that authority to release this asset belonging to the American people, it's resulted in a reduction in the price at the pump of gasoline from 33 percent to 18 percent to 9 percent. So it's a proven action that Presidents have taken to benefit the American consumer. 
   It's also responsible. You know, 20 days ago, oil was over $140 a barrel. It's $124 a barrel today. And that means that when we are replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it's going to cost less for the American taxpayer. 
   There is a reason why so many interested parties who are affected by the high price of oil strongly support this. The Air Transport Association, National Farmers Union, American Truck Association, League of Conservation Voters, many Republican Members of Congress: ZACH WAMP, RODNEY ALEXANDER, HEATHER WILSON, Senator Collins, Senator Hutchison, Senator Isakson. And the reason is that whatever we are going to do in the long term to change our energy policy, why would we not take the immediate action in the short term that can provide immediate benefit to the American consumer and to American businesses?     
   It just stands to reason that a responsible Congress is going to take those actions that can provide direct and immediate relief to the American consumer. That's what the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will allow. Ten percent, not all of it. It's not robbing the savings bank. It's using an asset that belongs to the citizens of this country to provide help to the families of this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman, Mr. Peterson, and the ranking member, Mr. Goodlatte, for doing the usual bipartisan work to address a problem in a practical way. 
   The question that they faced is this: Will the futures market be one that is dedicated to price efficiency or will it be hijacked for speculative market manipulation? Will the futures markets serve the needs of those who need it--airliners, fuel dealers, truckers--or will it be in service of financial speculators who, moment to moment, are trying to take advantage of the volatility at the expense of the American consumer? 
   This legislation strikes a balance. It sends a clear message that the markets should be about price efficiency, not short-term momentary advantage when the consequence is inflicting damage on the American family, the American small business, the American economy. 
   There are practical steps in here--overseeing offshore trading, position limits, over-the-counter trading regulations. These are things that should be done and are being done.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. The question is this: Our small insurers in Vermont that do business in a good and friendly way usually are in the range of $100 million. That is above your limit. The requirement that they will have to, in effect, indicate an insolvency risk threatens their rating which would adversely affect their business. 
   My question is, as you go forward, and as new information becomes available, my hope is that you and the committee would be willing to make what adjustments are feasible within the context of the overall goal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, while President Bush is asking Congress and the American people to give his failed policy in Iraq more time, even some of the President's closest allies don't believe the strategy will work. 
   Last week, it was reported that Hunt Oil Company of Dallas, Texas had signed an oil exploration and production deal with the Kurdish Regional Government. That Hunt Oil Company is owned by Ray Hunt, major campaign supporter of President Bush and a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. His decision to bypass the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and negotiate directly with the Kurds shows his lack of confidence that Iraq will develop a functioning government in the near future, and it undermined important efforts for the Iraqi oil sharing law, which collapsed last week. 
   While President Bush is asking our Nation to sacrifice more of our brightest young soldiers and to spend hundreds of billions more in taxpayer dollars in pursuit of his Iraq strategy, one of the President's closest allies and advisers is betting that his strategies will continue to fail and, in fact, is looking to profit from it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Courtney. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think any of us want to be here talking about the war because it's a tragedy, and I believe the American people have come to that conclusion. Whether they supported going into the war or they opposed going into the war, they figured out that at this point our military men and women have done all they can do. They toppled Saddam. They reported back truthfully that there were no weapons of mass destruction, and they allowed stability in Iraq so that Iraq had three democratic elections. At a certain point, it is up to the Iraqis to step up and build their own institutions and their own democracy. We obviously can help and we have some responsibility. But the American people, those who supported the war, those who opposed going into the war initially, have come to a pretty commonsense conclusion: We have done our job, the military has performed ably, and it is time for the Iraqis to take our place. 
   The fundamental question that the President has put to this Congress and to the American people is this: Is it the proper role of the United States military to be refereeing a civil war? That's the question. Now, Republicans and Democrats in the past have been united that our military has a primary responsibility for defending us in fighting wars, not for refereeing civil wars. 
   A couple of things. One, there has never been an example in the history of the world where a third-party military has actually refereed a civil war to a peaceful political and economic conclusion. There are examples of third-party militaries, outside militaries, coming in on one side and, through force of arms, imposing an outcome. But that is not the policy even of the Bush administration. 
   Is this a civil war? Here's what is going on in Iraq right now: There are several different civil wars that are underway. In the south in the Basra region where our ally Great Britain has  basically taken its 44,000 troops down to 5,000 troops and redeployed them to a base, there are three different Shia wars going on. They're not fighting about democracy. They're not fighting pro- or anti-Iran primarily. They're not fighting about the future of Iraq as a united country. They are fighting about oil. It is about who is going to be in control of that port and that refinery in Basra. 
   You then go to Kurdistan. Kurdistan has been, in effect, independent since 1991, Mr. Speaker, after the first Gulf War. And they have actually built an economy. They have outside investment coming in. They will not even allow the Iraqi flag to be flown in Kurdistan and are bent on achieving their own independence. But they want oil as well and are threatening, and they have an independent military, the Peshmurga, to take significant forceful action if they don't, from their perspective, get their share of oil in the Kirkuk region. 
   Then you have Baghdad. Baghdad has been the site of the most extreme ethnic cleansing. Before the fall o 
   Saddam, Baghdad had 65 percent population that was Sunni. That was the seat of Saddam's power. Now it is 75 percent Shia. 
   A neighborhood that I visited, Mr. Courtney, when I was with a delegation to Iraq, the Dora neighborhood, had previously been Sunni and was now Shia, and peace came about basically by displacing the people who used to be there and putting new people in. 
   And the overall dislocation in Iraq is astonishing, as you mentioned, my friend from New Hampshire: 2 million Iraqis displaced internally, 2 million exiled; 4 million people already, about 60,000 a month, are affected by this. And that is the equivalent in the United States, 20 percent of our population or about 50 million people. Think about it if 50 million people were displaced, either thrown out of the country or fleeing the country or had to move from Texas to Vermont or Vermont to New York because of force and fear. 
   Then you have the provinces around Baghdad. The Sunni Triangle, Anbar, Diyala, a couple of provinces where General Petraeus was arguing that there was, quote, ``progress.'' Well, again, no one is going to quibble about a military person's estimation of whether there is military progress, but what has happened there largely is that there has been dislocation. The Sunni tribal leaders have done what most analysts expected they would do: They would turn against al Qaeda because they are nationalists. They are much more concerned about Iraq than they are accommodating this radical ideology and they would, quote, ``work with the United States.'' 
   But what's the price that we are paying? What is the tactical decision that was made? The decision was made to arm tribal chiefs. Now, that can work in the short run. It gives them arms to fight alongside American soldiers in some particular circumstances. But what is the overall policy of the Bush administration? It is a strong central Iraqi Government centered in Baghdad. So what you have now is a United States policy that arms factions in the provinces, which is a momentary truce of convenience, that has no loyalty to the central government in Baghdad. And down the road, as what happened in Afghanistan when the United States, to pursue its interest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, armed the Taliban, and that Taliban then became the monster that produced an Osama bin Laden. But we have our policy where we are literally doing two things against the middle: arming factions who are hostile to a central government even as we say our goal is to have a strong central government. 
   So none of us know what all the details are, but what you have is an incredibly internal complexity: a Shia south where there is Shia factional fighting, a Sunni Triangle where there is a temporary alliance of convenience, you have ethnic cleansing in Baghdad, and you have a Kurdistan that is insisting upon being independent. 
   Incidentally, on this question of being independent, even the President's friends who have business interests are getting it. You read the report last week about Hunt Oil. Hunt Oil is owned by Mr. Hunt, a very good friend of the President, a big contributor and a member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Committee that the President pays deference to, listens to. Mr. Hunt bypassed the central government in Iraq and is entering into a direct oil agreement with Kurdistan. So he not only has made his bet that the President's policy is going to fail, he is making arrangements to profit by that failure. 
   So why is it that we are asking the American military, the American taxpayer to continue pursuing a dead-end policy? There is one reason that the President now offers to defend a policy that is bankrupt, that is a dead end, that has a history of failure. That argument that the administration is making is this: If we leave, there will be chaos. 
   Now, think about it. Those who oppose the war, those who voted against it argue that if we invaded Iraq, in all likelihood the outcome would be the quick toppling of Saddam and the long-term chaos and violence that would follow. The argument that the President rejected then he is embracing now. 
   All of us who oppose the war really do so with a heavy heart because we know that the choices that are available to this country and to the people of Iraq are very constrained and there is going to be untold suffering that lies ahead. We don't have good choices, but the question is what is the right choice that is going to mitigate the suffering? And that right choice has to be to redeploy our troops because the continued presence of the United States through the military emphasizes a military approach to a political problem. And that's why all of us are here doing everything we can to change our direction in Iraq. 
   And I thank you for my opportunity to participate with my wonderful colleagues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress passed legislation, of course, to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's a bipartisan bill, provides health coverage to 10 million low-income Americans. It's fully paid for, no change in eligibility requirements. And the President says he's going to veto it because it's going to lead to ``socialized medicine.'' 
   We've had children who have received access to doctors for years. Many States have done it on their own. The Federal Government has supported it with the children's health care initiative. And what's happened? Children have been able to see a doctor. Parents have gone to bed at night with the confidence that if their child was sick they'd have access to health care. 
   It is bipartisan. Republican Senator Susan Collins said, ``I can't believe the President would veto a program that benefits low-income children.'' 
   Charles Grassley: ``The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him to reconsider.'' 
   Senator Hatch: ``We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage.'' 
   No justification for this veto, Mr. President. Change your mind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1175 provides for consideration of the Senate amendments to H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. 
   The rule makes in order a motion by the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Frank, to concur in the Senate amendments with three House amendments. The rule provides 3 hours of debate on the motion, with 2 hours controlled by the Committee on Financial Services and 1 hour controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule also provides for a division of the question on the adoption of the three House amendments listed in the Rules Committee report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we all know why this rule and the underlying bill are so important. Millions of Americans are confronting the growing prospect of losing their home. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, have already lost their home in a foreclosure epidemic that is the legacy of the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   According to recent reports, the most severe real estate recession in decades is going to continue to weigh down the economy, the pace of foreclosures is going to continue to rise, and homes continue to lose their value at increasing rates. This foreclosure epidemic has spread to virtually every major city in the United States. 
   What the Committee on Financial Services has done here is brought us a bill that addresses this problem directly. It's not a bill that intends to lay blame. There is plenty of that to go around. It's a bill that's intended to solve a problem. 
   Here are some of the sobering facts about the problem: 
   The number of homes entering foreclosure in the first 3 months this year was double the same period as last year. 
   One in every 194 homes received a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of this year. 
   And home prices are down, on average, 12.7 percent, which is basically the first time that's happened since the Great Depression in the early 1930s. 
   As the foreclosure trends intensify, the problem can only get worse. As foreclosure signs go up in neighborhoods, the value of the property in that neighborhood declines, even if the creditworthiness and the ability to pay of the homeowner is as strong as ever.     
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about, as I mentioned, solving a problem. It creates opportunity for the lenders and the mortgage servicers to minimize their loss; it provides an opportunity for homeowners to stay in their homes, but it shares the pain as well as the opportunity. In order for lenders to take advantage of the opportunity presented in this bill, they are going to have to write down the value of the loan consistent with the current appraisal value. In order for homeowners to have an opportunity to participate in this program, they are going to have to give up the equity that they thought they had, including any moneys they had paid in downpayments. 
   House Resolution 1175 provides for the consideration of three House amendments to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. 
   Amendment No. 1 includes H.R. 5830 regarding the FHA refinancing, H.R. 1852 regarding FHA modernization, H.R. 1427 regarding government-sponsored entity reform, those being Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and H.R. 1066 regarding community development investments, among other bills. Each  piece of legislation in this amendment has already been passed by the House so we are really going over work that this entire body has considered before, or it has been rigorously debated and amended through the committee process in Financial Services and Ways and Means. 
   Amendment No. 2 includes H.R. 5720, the Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 under which middle-class families would be eligible for a loan of up to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new home, and homeowners filing jointly would receive an additional deduction from their property taxes of $700. States will also receive a temporary increase in low-income housing tax credits and $10 billion of additional tax exempt bond authority for low-interest loans to build low-income rental housing and to refinance certain subprime mortgages. 
   One of the underlying causes of the subprime crisis was that more and more Americans who wanted to rent couldn't and had to get themselves housing by getting into loans they couldn't afford. 
   Amendment No. 3 is a bipartisan amendment offered by Congressman Miller and Congressman LaTourette regarding the preemption of State laws regulating foreclosure. 
   The centerpiece of this legislation is H.R. 5830, the FHA Stabilization and Homeownership Retention Act included in amendment No. 1. That bill would enact a voluntary program, voluntary, for homeowners and lenders, and I emphasize voluntary, nothing is being forced on anyone except the opportunity to work this out. The process would begin with a homeowner or servicer of an existing eligible loan with an FHA-approved lender, and the FHA-approved lender would then determine the size of the loan that meets the requirements of the program and that the borrower could reasonably repay. The plan targets a group of homeowners who would be able to stay in their homes if they had a reduction in principal and monthly servicing charges. 
   The Congressional Budget Office says that this legislation could save 500,000 mortgages from foreclosure. Other estimates put that number much higher, at over a million. 
   Just as important as keeping Americans in their homes, this legislation protects American taxpayers. The government's liability under this program is limited and only applies if a borrower defaults and the amount recovered in foreclosure is below the outstanding debt still owed. This is a program that will be paid for largely by the folks participating in it and benefiting from this option as an alternative to foreclosure, and that is through a series of financing and copayments that will be assessed at the time of closing as the life of the loan continues through fees for a period of about 5 years. 
   There are going to be about $300 billion made available under this bill for guarantees, but the CBO scored the legislation as having an outside risk to taxpayers of about $2.4 billion. And I would like to have my colleagues think about that for a moment in the context of the $29 billion that was made available to back the rescue of the investment banks when Bear Stearns collapsed. 
   The biggest cost to the taxpayer would be to let the economy unravel, to let neighborhoods decay, and to let thousands if not millions of homes go into foreclosure. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5830 and other critical parts of this legislation provides an avenue to stability, to restoring economic stability to our neighborhoods, to our working families in this country, and to our lenders. We all thank the excellent leadership of the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Ways and Means for working together, Republicans and Democrats, to bring this legislation to the floor for consideration. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my good friend from Texas. 
   Madam Speaker, this 110th Congress has to decide, as does every Congress, whether it's going to focus its collective energies on devising practical solutions to real problems or will this Congress use the practical problems that everyday Americans face as fodder for endless debate on irresolvable, ideological disputes. 
   Our Financial Services Committee, with cooperation on both sides, and our Ways and Means Committee have made a very clear decision to focus their energies on the resolution of practical problems. They have taken note of something that we all are well aware of: We do have a foreclosure crisis in this country. Eight thousand families a day are receiving a foreclosure notice. And the decision that our committees made was to bring forward to this body for its consideration a practical approach that is going to provide some relief to creditors, it's fair to them; a bill that's fair to borrowers, it's fair to them; and a bill that's going to be good for the economy to provide stability that we need in order to get back on our feet. 
   This is a very practical bill. If it's going to give an opportunity to homeowners who are facing foreclosure, they are going to pay the price of losing their equity that they had achieved or thought they had. If it's going to be fair to the creditors, it's going to require some sacrifice on their part because they're going to have to write down the value of their loan to reflect what the current appraisal value is. But already it's having a positive effect on the economy. 
   We're going to hear plenty about the pros and cons of this bill in the 2 hours or 3 hours of debate that will follow. But there's another element to this story that's really quite remarkable and I think something which we all can take heart from. This bill is a product principally of three people from extraordinarily different backgrounds: a war hero in Korea, African American from Harlem; a Massachusetts so-called Democratic liberal; and a man from Wall Street who probably is one of the most successful capitalists and entrepreneurs in the history of this country, the Secretary of the Treasury. They made a decision to focus on the practical and urgent needs. They had a capacity, each of them, to have some understanding of the pain and fear that a mom and dad would experience when their child was coming in wanting to know if they were going to the Little League game that night and they were poring over a foreclosure notice and trying to figure out how they were going to keep that household together. And those men, the three of them, from totally different backgrounds, probably with completely different ideological perspectives on the world, decided they had to find a way to help that mother and father and that family stay in their home.     
   And what they did is they came up with a practical solution not just because they cared about that family, but they cared about the security and the future of this American economy. 
   The bill that they have helped put together, again, for our collective consideration, is one that is hopeful for America. It is not about finding blame  and fault about how we got here. And we all have our theories on this. But we know there was a large element of agreed. But instead of focusing, by looking in the rearview mirror and playing the blame game, we have people of different backgrounds, different ideologies who said they were united in the common objective to help American families and to stabilize the American economy. And I believe that all of us can be proud of their willingness to help each other. 
   What they have shown us with the work that they did was that there is redemptive power in cooperation. And the beneficiaries of that can be families of this country that we all love. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, this point of order is really essentially about whether or not we are going to consider the rule and, ultimately, the Energy Independence and Security Act. In fact, I would say that it may well be an effort by folks who are opposed to the legislation to find a way to kill the legislation itself. We believe that this legislation should proceed. 
   The fact is that the other side had absolute control in this body or had a majority in this body for 12 years, enjoyed control in both bodies and in the administration for the past 6, for most of that 6, and did not come up with an energy policy that did anything other than raise the cost of oil, home heating oil, gasoline, increase our dependence on foreign oil, weaken our national security and contribute to global warming. This legislation is about changing the direction of American energy policy, and the issues that have been raised in this legislation are ones that have been debated outside of this body for several years. 
   The legislation now brings to this body for its consideration such topics as increasing fuel efficiency, energy efficiency, green buildings, cellulosic agriculture-based energy efforts that will be vital to the farm sector and rural sectors of our economy. 
   So we believe that the House is going to have an opportunity to vote on this point of order and reach its judgment about whether it wants to proceed on the important question of changing the energy policy in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I am not aware of any earmarks in the bill. I'm completely unaware of any earmarks in the bill. There is CBO information suggesting that the unfunded mandates, which is a separate one, is not within any of the rule provisions as it applies to the public sector, maybe as it applies to the private sector.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I am going to yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). But before I do, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona; I would like to thank him for the good work that he has done on earmarks that he did when he was a member of the majority and now as a member of the minority. 
   But I would also remind the gentleman that, in fact, under the leadership of the current Chair of the Appropriations Committee, there has been a massive change in direction on earmarks. In fact, it's been a reason why some of the budget bills took longer than last year because there has been an exhaustive effort to go through and identify anything that can be called an earmark to allow Members who wish to address it to raise their points. 
   What I've said to the gentleman is that we are unaware of any earmarks in this legislation. And I appreciate your late-night work at finding provisions that, as you have presented them, you're characterizing as possible earmarks. I am aware of absolutely no earmarks. 
   The so-called unfunded mandate, there is language in a letter, Mr. Speaker, from the CBO that suggests that there may be a slightly above the threshold under the rule, but that's a decision that this body can make and will make. It's incidental, not significant, to the overall policy. 
   So having said that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Castor).

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his comments and his arguments here on this point of order, and also for the work that he has done. 
   I happen to believe that process does matter, but I also think substance matters, and they have to go together. Ideally, when we're working in a perfect world, they do. But one of the major reasons that we don't have an actual conference committee report is because our friends in the other body refused to go to conference, refused, refused to go to conference to discuss our energy future, Mr. Speaker. How is that right? Is that a proper use of process? 
   The reason we are here and the way that we're here is because there has been a decision made by the majority of the American people that they want a new energy policy, and the basic question for this body is whether we want to give that new energy policy or we don't. 
   The best process is going to get the best bill, but it takes cooperation on both sides. And if we have, in the other body, a refusal to even go into conference, it leaves leadership in this body with a single choice: do nothing and capitulate, or move ahead. 
   On this question of earmarks, we have given you as much assurance as we can possibly give you that there are not earmarks in here. We have the CBO letter about so-called unfunded mandates in the private sector. That's going to be a decision for the body. 
   I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this motion to consider. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 846 provides for consideration of the Senate amendments to H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act. The rule provides for a motion by the majority leader to concur in the Senate amendments with the House amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the majority and minority leaders, or their designees. 
   Mr. Speaker, many Members of this body have worked long and hard to change the direction of energy policy in this country. I can't mention them all, but I would be remiss not to pay special acknowledgment to the Speaker, to Mr. Dingell, and to Mr. Markey. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House in a very short time will have an opportunity to turn the page on generations of energy policy. Perhaps the best way to characterize what has been the U.S. policy on energy is captured by looking at a photograph that serves as a metaphor. What it shows is the United States hand in hand with OPEC producers, on whom we have become increasingly reliant and dependent, pursuing an energy policy of drill-and-drill, consume-and-consume, spend-and-spend; all with ever-escalating and budget-busting expense inflicted on our families and businesses; all with reckless denial, reckless denial, to the environmental damage that we are doing by this policy to the Earth we all share; and all with cavalier disregard to our national security by depending on regimes that are not our friends. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill brought before you does two fundamental things in changing the direction of energy policy. It says that we are going to consume less by taking practical steps, long overdue, to increase mileage standards, to allow American families going to and from work, picking up their kids, going to daycare, bringing them to soccer games, to travel in safe vehicles manufactured by American workers that get 40 percent more miles per gallon. Mr. Speaker, that will save the average American family $700 to $1,000 a year. 
   Second, by making a strong national commitment to renewable energy, to having energy that we produce, that we keep our American dollars and our American jobs here at home, and by investing in cellulosic ethanol, wind and solar and technologies that have shown promise to give us the energy we need, the jobs we require and the environmental improvement that is essential, this turns the page on what has been an overdue time for change in our energy direction in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, the current system just ain't going to work. The ever-escalating cost to our families is not sustainable. In December of 2002, the price of a gallon of gas was $1.48. Today it is about $3.09. Five years ago it cost an average Vermont family about $600 to heat their home during the winter. It is over $1,500 to $2,000 now. 
   The environmental damage is indisputable. With 4 percent of the world's population, we are still consuming about 20 to 25 percent of the world's energy, and we generate roughly 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air each year. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can't afford to be sending so many American dollars abroad; $500,000 every minute from the pockets of American consumers and American businesses go to countries that provide us with the oil that we need, when they are not particularly good friends of ours. That is $500,000 every minute, $30 million every hour, $5 billion every week. 
   This energy bill turns the page from a country that has been excessively dependent on oil consumption to a country that is going to be self-confident in its people, in its resources and its ingenuity, to take on the energy challenge and turn it into energy opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), appreciate his arguments, and will close on behalf of our side. 
   There are two arguments that I heard in the course of this debate. One was about process and procedure. I happen to believe that process and procedure is important. It's important not in its own right; it's important for what it can do to help us in this body create better legislation. But process can be abused. It can be abused when the goal is not to make a better bill; it's to obstruct the passage of any bill. And the choice that had to be made by leadership on this side, particularly in view of the decision in the other body to refuse to go to conference, was whether to accept that use of process that obstructed consideration of energy legislation this country needs or to move ahead. They made the right choice. 
   Second, this legislation, a thousand pages, as Mr. Diaz-Balart and others mentioned, they had some fun holding up the bill. Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of that 1,000 pages contains provisions that have been considered in many cases passed by this House of Representatives. What this bill is is a compilation of the work that many people in this body have been doing for years. What's different is that it is actually coming to the House floor for a vote. 
   Substantively, this legislation does turn the page on energy policy. I showed a picture in the beginning. It's a metaphor really for the energy policy that we have had in this country for generations. It's the American administration hand in hand with OPEC leadership, OPEC countries, pursuing a policy of drill-and-drill, consume-and-consume, export our dollars and import their oil. 
   If we turn the page, we are going to have a new picture. We are going to have a picture of the American Congress and the American administration hand in hand with American farmers who are driving their tractors, creating energy alternatives. It is going to be a picture of the American Congress with young engineers who are creating better, more efficient appliances. It is going to be a picture of the American Congress and American families who are driving to and from their soccer games, to and from work, to and from day care in safe vehicles, manufactured by American workers, that get 40 percent higher mileage, saving that family $1,000. 
   We know, we know that this is a hat trick. If we change our energy policy and we act like a confident Nation, not a dependent Nation, we can protect the planet, reverse global warming. We can create good jobs and keep American dollars at home, and we can increase our national security by reducing our dependence on regimes that have no particular interest in the security of the United States but whose primary interest is in the dollars from American consumers and American businesses. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Res. 1350 provides that it shall be in order on the legislative day of Thursday, July 17, 2008, for the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules relating to a measure concerning the domestic production of oil and natural gas. 
   The energy crisis that we face is real. It requires immediate attention and short and long-term action. As a Nation, we have in our reserves less than 2 percent of the proven oil and gas reserves in the world. But with 4 percent of the population, we consume nearly 25 percent of the world's oil. That's not sustainable over the long term. 
   We must take this opportunity now to provide relief immediately to people paying over $4 at the pump, $5 for home heating oil, and we need a commitment to a new energy future focused on creating clear and clean domestic alternatives. 
   Under suspension of the House rules, this body will take up later the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands bill. The bill promotes the responsible domestic production of oil and natural gas on the 20 million acres that make up the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. That would provide an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil, a higher estimate than the consensus estimate of oil that is available in ANWR. 
   The DRILL Act, as it is called, will increase oil production and do it sooner than other alternative proposals. It will facilitate also the construction of existing pipelines within 5 miles of where they already are located. So its environmental footprint will be minimal, and engineering challenges also minimal. This will help move oil and natural gas to the market. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas. 
   First of all, there is common agreement here. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know this. People are suffering. They cannot afford spending more than $4 a gallon for gas, and folks in my part of the country, the cold weather region, are living with enormous anxiety about how they're going to pay $5 a gallon for home heating fuel. So the problem that we face is real and it is urgent. 
   I disagree with one of the authors of the energy policy that got us here, and that is the former senator from Texas, Phil Gramm, who is advising their Presidential candidate. And he recently announced that we really don't have a problem. He said, ``You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession.'' And he's saying that America is a nation of whiners. 
   You know what, people have a right to complain about an energy policy where they can't afford to fill up their gas tank. They're living in enormous anxiety when the fuel truck shows up to heat their home, and they have to make decisions between food and fuel, between medicine that they need and the fuel that's required to keep their home warm.     
   This is about rejecting the energy policy that has failed us and has brought us here. 
   You know, my friend from Texas made a statement that I agree with. He said the oil companies should be our  friends. That is right. Oil companies have been very good at what they do--exploring for oil, finding oil, refining oil, producing oil, and getting it to the market. But the policies that we've had in place since President Bush became the leader of this country have enriched the oil companies. But the oil companies, in turn, with over $500 billion in profits, have not reinvested that money into either producing where they can or moving to an alternative energy policy. 
   You know, one of the folks raised the question as to whether or not this is a ``fig leaf'' bill, whether there's rhetoric in this bill because we're talking about 20 million new acres that has a proven capacity of at least 10 billion barrels of oil. Is it a question of Congress not making lands available for drilling onshore and offshore when we know already there are 68 million acres onshore and offshore available, and this bill makes it clear we want to make 20 million acres more available? Is it a question of lands where there is oil available being denied access? Or is it a failure on the part of the oil companies to invest? 
   You know, ExxonMobil, in one quarter, made about $40 billion in profit; for 1 year, $40 billion in profit. Did they put that profit into new drilling technology, into exploiting some of the leases that they have, into getting oil out of the ground and into the market? No. They spent $32 billion buying back their own stock. 
   Basically what you're seeing is that the oil companies that have been doing extraordinarily well under this energy policy that's got us to this crisis have not been reinvesting their money, but they've put their capital on strike. They've been buying back shares and maintaining the value of their stock at the expense of exploiting the oil fields that they have immediate access to. 
   Well, I want to go through some of the arguments that my friend from Texas made. He accused the Democratic Congress of a mind-boggling refusal to increase production. That's just flat out wrong. You've got the 68 million acres where the oil companies right now have the legal right to go in and drill, and they haven't done it. That's not an act of Congress, that's a corporate decision made by the major oil companies. 
   Second, he said that the energy companies don't go there because they are ``dry holes.'' That's just flat out wrong. I mentioned earlier I actually do think the energy companies are good at what they do. They don't waste their money or their stockholder money. And when they decide to spend their money on purchasing a lease, it's because they've come to their own independent conclusion that it's worth that investment, that there is oil in the ground or under the sea. 
   So those oil companies have access to it. Why don't they drill? And also, why aren't there drills available, the drilling rigs for offshore drilling and drilling rigs on land? There's two reasons: one, the oil companies are doing great sitting on these leases; the longer that they wait, the more they make. If they bought a lease when oil was at $30 a barrel and then it goes to $75 a barrel and up to $130 or $140 a barrel, that's money in the bank. The longer they wait, the more they make. 
   A second reason is, they aren't willing to risk the profits in increasing production. As long as there is a shortage of supply, the price stays up. And their profits are exploding as we speak. So there is an enormous amount of responsibility that we have and expect from the oil companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would like to refer people to the photograph that was just on display when the gentleman from Oregon was speaking. It showed the President of the United States hand in hand with King Abdullah as they were about to go into a meeting to discuss oil. And the President of the United States had a mission, and it was to ask the leader of another country, not particularly a friendly country to us, to solve our problem by increasing production of oil in Saudi Arabia in order to get us out of the jamb we are in here in America. 
   The question that we face in this country is whether or not we are going to address in the manner of a confident country, of an ingenious country, of a country willing to take on its own problems, the challenge of changing our energy future. 
   The President's approach, as was described by Mr. DeFazio from Oregon, is to drill yesterday, to drill today, to drill tomorrow, and to drill forever. And the news is in. Oil is not in infinite supply. And if we need any better authority about the limitations of oil, think about Mr. T. Boone Pickens who made a very successful career as a Texas oilman, and he points out the obvious: if you have 87 million barrels of oil consumed today, you have production at 86 million, the proven reserves are limited, the capacity to actually get more out of the ground is somewhat limited, it can be expanded but not at infinite levels, it is time to begin yesterday to plan an alternative energy strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, a self-confident country does not put its head in the sand and ignore the problems that it faces; it challenges them. It accepts the burden of responsibility. It has the confidence that we have the people, the talent, and the political will to make that transition to an alternative energy economy. 
   The American people have that figured out. They know if we are going to create jobs and strengthen our economy, we have to know that green jobs are good jobs and that taking on the challenge of filling up the gas tank in a way that uses alternative energy and creates jobs is the pathway to the future. 
   So this debate is really a fork in the road. It is between two very clear choices. The oilmen in the White House, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, believe that the fuel of the future is oil. They think that we can drill our way out of the situation we are in. Americans, I believe, have come to the conclusion that is wrong and will fail and that the pathway to the future is alternative energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, our American democracy depends on a strong middle class, and our middle class has relied on institutions that support working Americans. The American institution that has done more to strengthen the backbone of our democracy and the rights of American workers is the labor union. 
   At a time when you would least expect it, the middle-class American is losing ground. Corporate profits are up. Executive pay is up. Productivity of our workers is up. And yet our middle class is under assault. Worker incomes haven't kept pace with rising costs for education, health care, energy, transportation, child care, and housing. We haven't faced greater income inequality since before the Great Depression. 
   Why is it that as our economy grows and CEOs have unfettered freedom to negotiate lavish contracts, our workers are left behind? 
   Many believe, as I do, that strengthening the rights and opportunities of workers will increase opportunities for all and strengthen the American economy. Our economy has done best when all share in a stake in its success and all share in its rewards. 
   Congress can help our workers achieve better wages, benefits, and working conditions. We can help level the playing field. The Employee Free Choice Act is based on the simple proposition that workers should have a protected right to organize when they choose to do so. That right must be straightforward, enforceable, and fair. If a majority of workers sign up for a union, they form a union. It is that simple. 
   Congress today can play a positive role in promoting the vibrancy of our democracy and helping workers get ahead. Last month we began to do so by raising the minimum wage, making college more affordable, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Today we act to protect the rights of workers as they pursue the American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   Together, we have a lot of work to do: To help working families get ahead, restore America's standing in the world, and bring our budget back in balance. Making progress is what our constituents in 435 districts around this country have elected us to do. 
   To be sure, our differences will be intensely debated. However, our mutual obligations is to do everything we can to move our country forward by confronting directly and immediately the challenges before us. To succeed in the job our constituents sent us here to do, we must lay out rules in a regular order that Members can count on. These ground rules will not guarantee an outcome, but they will set out a framework where we, as an institution, make progress and serve the public. 
   That is why the Democratic leadership embraces three very simple,  straightforward principles that will help us succeed. As the Member from California has laid out, we set out today to establish a regular civility in this body. 
   Civility, it is mutual respect, really, requires straightforward ground rules to guide debate. It requires adherence to rules that apply to all. Each of us will know and be able to assure the citizens who elected us when it comes to votes in this, their representative body: Members will have time to read what they are voting on; Members will have time to vote, but votes will not be held open for the purpose of changing the outcome; and Members will vote on conference reports that are the ones agreed upon by the conferees, not ones altered after the fact. 
   These rules, applied to all, will help us do the work of the people we represent. Our debates at times will be intense, as they should be, but we must strive to have our debates on the merits. The rules we propose for your consideration are basic. They are rules that apply to legislators in Vermont where I am from, and probably rules that your own legislators take for granted: Time to read and review before voting, timely voting procedures, and considering conference reports as signed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I served 13 years in the Vermont legislature, sometimes in the minority and sometimes in the majority. We in Vermont were proud of the legislative process and standards that we set. Those in the majority couldn't do things simply because they had the power. Minority voices were heard, Members were kept informed, and our legislative process was respected. We did have intense debates on the issues, but more often than not, not always, at the end of the day, good ideas were considered and we were able to move Vermont ahead. 
   These changes that we present for your consideration today are not just about process, they are about passing good, substantive legislation. 
   These new rules to establish civility to this body are essential for Congress to do the work of the American people and to build the trust of those we serve. 
   We face looming challenges in America, to the security of our families and to the security of our country. And nobody and no party has a monopoly on the good ideas required to steer us forward. The simple and straightforward rules of engagement will help all of us do that. 
   Yesterday, the minority leader, in handing over the gavel to the new Speaker, was graceful and was wise when he reminded us that we can have disagreements without being disagreeable. Both the Speaker and the minority leader stated on our behalf what we all know to be true: All of us are here for the common purpose, to make America a better place. There is and must be room for all of our voices to be heard to achieve our common purpose. 
   The rules we propose will help us do that. How? By establishing very clear ground rules that apply to all, the majority as well as the minority, to every Member, committee chairs and ranking members, House veterans and House freshmen. One and all alike.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (ROBERT T. STAFFORD WHITE ROCKS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, it is with mixed emotions that I stand here on my first full day as a Member of Congress to say good bye to a great Vermont statesman. Senator Bob Stafford passed away last December at the age of 93. I feel a deep sense of pride to have the first Bill I introduce be one that honors Bob Stafford's commitment to Vermont by redesignating the White Rocks National Recreation Area as the ``Robert T. Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area''. 
   Senator Stafford was born in Rutland in 1913. He had a long and distinguished career as a civil servant to the state, serving the state for nearly 30 years first as Governor, Representative, and Senator. Robert Stafford was a man who knew Vermont, and understood how to best serve Vermonters. 
   It was through his many public service positions around the state that he learned the importance of moderation and bipartisanship. He served as Rutland County State's attorney, as Deputy State Attorney General, and then as State Attorney General. In the late 1950's he was elected Lieutenant Governor, and in 1959 he became Governor. 
   In 1960, Bob Stafford was elected to Vermont's sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won five successive re-elections. In September 1971, he resigned his House seat to accept appointment to the U.S. Senate following the death of Senator Winston Prouty. After winning a special election in 1972, he proceeded to represent Vermont in the Senate for the next 17 years. 
   When he came to Washington, a member of the Republican Party, he formed many close relationships with members of both parties. Senator Stafford was able to be effective because of his reliance on moderation and compromise. He was a leader among his peers, and became an advocate for issues that were close to him and to Vermont. Affordable education and his dedication to the environment became his most important issues. The Stafford Student Loan program has made higher education more accessible for millions of Americans. 
   While his achievements in the areas of education and federal disaster relief were very important, it is the legacy he has left behind for the work he did in protecting the environment that he was most proud of. Bob Stafford shared Vermonters' belief that we have a moral obligation to leave for our children a cleaner environment than the one we inherited. He was a leader and visionary who helped shape and strengthen some of our Nation's most critical environmental laws for over two decades. Serving as Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee from 1981-1986, he led the charge to expand and strengthen the Superfund toxic waste cleanup law in the mid 1980's. 
   Please join me today in honoring the tremendous life and service of Senator Bob Stafford. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and pass the Congress by unanimous consent.  
   The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

   Madam Speaker, this is really a very simple question, and it is whether we're going to extend unemployment benefits to American workers who are suffering the largest 1-month surge in increased unemployment in 22 years. 
   And we can bring in all kinds of other arguments about what our energy policy should be, what the compensation should be, what the formulation of the benefits should be. But the bottom line is that we have Americans who have worked, and through no fault of their own, but because of economic forces completely and utterly beyond their control, they've lost their jobs. 
   And when we have discussions about micromanaging how these go out, in lump sums or weekly payments, and we're talking about trying to give an incentive, it is, in my view, Madam Chairman, very patronizing. 
   What is worse to an American than to lose his or her job? 
   Most Americans find their sense of satisfaction and self-worth in taking care of their family, in being providers, and by being a good, productive worker. All of us who've had the opportunity to have a good job know that there's nothing better than that. So there is a lot of built-in incentive for any American who's without a job to get a job. 
   But, in the meantime, $300 a week, that's about what the average benefit is, is barely enough to keep gas in the car, keep your home heated, to put groceries on the table. We know it's not even close to adequate. So there is plenty of incentive. 
   And the question for us is not behavioral psycho dynamics. The question for us, as a Congress, is whether, when there is this largest spike in unemployment in 22 years, we're going to ignore it or we're going to respond. And we have the tool that was started in 1935 to respond, where workers and others put money into a fund that is to be used at times of stress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for yielding me this time. 
   I also join in the praise for the bipartisan work of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, the excellent work of Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf. 
   Mr. Speaker, the job of the next President of the United States, whoever that may be, whatever party that person may represent, is very straightforward. They are going to have to reintroduce America to the world. They are going to have to reintroduce the America of cooperation, of working together, of multilateralism rather than unilateralism, of diplomacy rather than force, and strength through persuasion and cooperation. 
   This Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the introduction to a new relationship that America will have with the world and a new relationship that our appropriations bill will have with the taxpayers of this country. It really does two things. One, it restores accountability. That is best seen in the fact that it does not give a blank check on more money to Iraq that will go down the sink hole. Number two, it recognizes that we have to be a participant in cooperating with other countries in order to solve global problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Appropriations Committee is to be commended for this strong bipartisan work. Our image in the world has been tarnished by the foreign policies of this administration, from the war in Iraq to the rejection of multilateral agreements such to the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, to human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Through this appropriations measure, we have the opportunity to send the world a different message about America's priorities. We do that in this bill by allocating $6.5 billion to combat global health crises, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. We have provided needed help to those suffering from genocide in Darfur by investing $949 million in development assistance. 
   We offer needed food, water and shelter for refugees around the world, and we make good on our obligations to international organizations investing $334 million in multilateral programs to address the global challenges, and we pay $1.3 billion in U.N. peacekeeping operations. The bill also helps protect the American taxpayer and brings needed accountability from the administration. 
   I would also like to commend the committee for restoring funding for a small but extremely important initiative, the Middle East Regional Cooperation, or MERC program. Established in 1979 by my colleague from California, MERC provides grants for collaborative scientific research projects between Israel and its Arab neighbors. MERC grants have made it possible for many Vermont students to travel to the Middle East to conduct environmental research at an innovative program called the Arava Institute. 
   This incredible program, working together on difficult environmental problems, has allowed Vermonters and others to live and work alongside Israeli and Arab colleagues, working together on environmental problems that affect the entire region. MERC grants have made this experience possible, and I applaud the committee for working to make sure this invaluable program receives the funding it deserves. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition to supporting important work in the Middle East, this bill implements needed changes to our policy in another conflicted region, Colombia, as was eloquently described by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). This bill recognizes that it is time for change in our Colombia policy.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, to govern is to choose. For the past 6 years, the choices made by the Republican leadership in this Congress have been wrong for America: tax cuts for the very wealthy, budget cuts for everyone else in health care, in education and the environment. It has led to the largest deficit in the history of this country. 
   The new Congress is making a different choice, promising to invest in America's priorities, first by bringing back fiscal responsibility and then making government work for average working families. Last week this House passed a Homeland Security bill. It improves aviation and port security, restores cuts to first responders across the Nation. 
   This week we passed an Energy and Water appropriations bill that finally provides a significant investment in studying the effects of global warming, something that's been ignored for far too long. 
   This new Congress is moving this country in a new direction and has made a new choice.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, we have 47 million Americans without health insurance. Today, we are going to have an opportunity to vote on providing 10 million children with continued health care coverage that they are going to need. This is, as in the spirit of many of the good things we have done, bipartisan. The Governor of Vermont, Republican, supports it. Republican Senators Hatch and Grassley support it, done a tremendous job. The response from the President, unfortunately, is to veto this legislation. 
   It is hard to understand how it is that, when the cost of this program is the equivalent of 2 weeks' spending on the war in Iraq, we can't find it in our capacity to spend that money to make certain that parents, when they go to bed at night, know their kids, when they need a doctor, will have access to the health care that they need. Our opportunity here in this House is to send the President a message, in the hopes that he will do the right thing and sign this bill, with an overwhelming bipartisan bill that reflects the bipartisan work and bicameral work that was done to bring it to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you. I have been listening, partly presiding, but I have been thinking about this question of why is it there is such a sense that we need to do something called a stimulus package, where we are talking about $100 billion going into an economy that is $14 trillion, and it's a modest amount. Why is it that there is such a sense that this stimulus is needed when in fact, by historical standards, unemployment is actually relatively low. We had bad news. It went from 4.7 to 5 percent. But the historical average is well above 5 percent. 
   The reason there is such anxiety is the reasons my friend from Kentucky and all of you have mentioned, that this has not been a rising tide that lifts all boats. Most people, even those who are employed, have not had wages that have come close to keeping up with their bills, and that has been intensified, of course, with energy, buying gas, buying home heating fuel, paying for your college education for your kids, and medical bills. The story that the Speaker told about that young family with medical bills is painful, but it's true. So what you have had is this economy that is simply not working for average people. 
   So what do we have an opportunity to do? A stimulus package is something that is concrete. We don't offer it as something that is going to ``solve'' the problem, but it is going to show that there's a cop on the beat. And there is an opportunity, by following the advice of economists across the spectrum, from conservative to liberal, that say that in a time of declining incomes, a stimulus is a mainstream Keynesian approach to giving a shot in the arm to the economy and a boost in confidence. 
   Now, we do that and do it quickly, hopefully in the next 2 weeks, and we do it together with our colleagues. It's a statement of confidence, and it also, by the way, establishes that where you need to help is with those folks who are paying their bills on the basis of their salary or punching a clock. Then we have the longer term work to do, and that is to right the inequities that have been so systemically applied to have this vast spread between the middle class, low-income folks, and everyone else. It's all these things people have been talking about, credit card abuse, this scheme that was cooked up by Wall Street and others on the subprime mortgage, and even the so-called exceptional mortgages that are below subprime, the way that Wall Street has found to package these and then sell them to, in some cases, unsuspecting buyers, and in some cases, to knowledgeable buyers who thought they could make money; the degradation of any kind of regulatory oversight, when regulatory oversight done right is going to protect average people. The chairman of Financial Services, I think, put it right on regulation. There's only two problems; one is when you do too much, and the other is when you do none at all. It is something that has to be done in order to protect the pocketbooks of everyday Americans.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. The elements of the stimulus package, as we know, are being discussed, but basically it would be a short-term tax break or check to families; it would be food stamps for folks who are struggling; it would be an extension of unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 39 weeks for folks who have been laid off from their jobs. So those are some of the things that would help. 
   It's not just Vermont, as you know, my friend from Iowa. By the way, I am a great fan of the Homestead Act, but if your forebears had not walked from Vermont to Iowa, you might be a Congressman from Vermont right now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, in April, I had the opportunity to join five of my colleagues on a delegation trip to Afghanistan. And our six-member delegation, three Democrats and three Republicans, spent 2 days in Iraq, 2 days in Afghanistan. And we had an opportunity to speak with American, Iraqi, Afghani soldiers; military leaders; security forces; government leaders; and civil servants. And at every turn in our trip, we encountered these extraordinary men and women from our country that are doing incredible work in very dangerous and trying circumstances. And I had the opportunity to meet troops from my State as my colleagues met troops from their States, and all of us were incredibly proud at the selflessness of these troops who are performing the missions that we have assigned to them. 
   But the circumstances in each country and each war are very different. Iraq is in a full-blown civil war. The British, our last remaining significant ally in Iraq, will soon withdraw, and American forces are now viewed as occupiers. The situation is much different in Afghanistan. And I came away, as did my colleagues, with the clear impression that there is will on the part of Afghani leaders to step up and to take control of their future. 
   In Afghanistan, we have 37 allied nations joining with us to help the Afghanis drive out the Taliban and to restore order and to create a future for that country. 
   In fact, the differences between these two situations in Iraq and Afghanistan was best summed up by three soldiers I spoke to who had completed full tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I asked, What is the difference in your experience? And the soldiers said, In Iraq it seems as though everyone is interested in fighting each other and us. In Afghanistan everyone is interested in fighting for their future. 
   What this legislation recognizes is that we have partners, 37 other nations, working with us in Afghanistan, and we have a partner, the government and people of Afghanistan, in our effort to restore order and to create a future for that country.  
   H.R. 2446, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act, reinforces the United States' long-term commitment to support Afghanistan in its efforts to confront its challenges and to complete its transformation into a secure and prosperous future. 
   This bill enhances the narcotics operations. More importantly, it provides incentives to encourage greater participation from our NATO allies in the International Security and Assistance Force. If we have learned anything, it is that we have got to work together and not alone.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Last week, the Government Reform and Oversight Committee voted to subpoena Secretary Rice and it was faced, the committee, with a simple question. We could do our job or not. 
   There is no question, no question that the intelligence used by the administration to justify the war in Iraq was dead wrong. Secretary Rice was the administration's principal spokesperson, and under her leadership the administration was certain but wrong about the Niger claim; certain but wrong about the aluminum tubes, certain but wrong about the al Qaeda connection, about the mobile labs, about unmanned aerial vehicles. And there are now three questions that Congress must answer. How did the White House and Secretary Rice have such confidence they were so right when, in fact, they were so wrong? How can we protect the American people and U.S. military from such misinformation in the future? And was the administration's active dissemination of bad intelligence premeditated and deliberate, done with the intention to deceive the American people, or was it reckless and cavalier, done to justify a decision to go to war that had already been made?

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York, my colleague from Washington, and colleagues on the Rules Committee. 
   Today, as you know, the House takes up the 10th of 12 appropriation measures, and this bill is all about continuing to make progress in America, in this Congress, in changing our domestic priorities. There are two points about this bill I want to address: first, law enforcement; second, science. 
   Law enforcement in our communities is the front line of protecting our communities. It is best done locally. This legislation, bipartisan, by the way, reverses 5 years of cuts to local law enforcement grants at a time when we need it. Violent crime, unfortunately, is on the rise. This funds our local law enforcement communities to do the job of building and maintaining safe communities. It does soundly reject the administration's proposed cuts to undo funding formulas that have been particularly helpful with the small State minimum. 
   The bill heavily invests in the safety and well-being of Americans, providing a total of $3.2 billion for State and local law enforcement efforts. $430 million will go to the Office on Violence Against Women. And, as you know, that strives to reduce the prevalence of violence committed against women. $100 million goes for the Cops on the Beat program, something that has been a major bipartisan success over the years. 
   The second issue is science. I want specifically to applaud the subcommittee for its support of the sciences and the emerging multidisciplinary field of service science. That combines disciplines like computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, business strategy, and management sciences to meet the 21st century needs of the workforce. The National Science Foundation should review what is currently being done in the area of service science and explore what more can be done. 
   The work of the NSF and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, is critical to fostering greater U.S. innovation and competitiveness in science, technology, engineering, and math. The investment in these agencies is an investment in that education and the development of the crucial multidisciplinary skills that are required to maintain our workforce and compete in the world economy. 
   As much more of our economy is service-based, we must ensure that our science agencies are focused on both research and education that promote innovation in service sectors such as education, health care, energy, telecommunications, and finance. The growing service sector in my State of Vermont is probably typical. It provides some of our best-paying jobs, nearly 80 percent of our employment. Last year we exported more than a half billion dollars in services, and 8,000 Vermonters were employed because of foreign investment in that sector. 
   This bill's investment in service-related research and STEM education through the NSF and NIST will foster innovation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am a new Member of Congress and proud to be part of an institution that has been the cradle of democracy, and very proud to be part of this new class of Republicans and Democrats that came here in the year 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, in Vermont, and I think across America, average citizens were somewhat bewildered when they looked at what was happening in Washington. When they saw us go from a record surplus to a record deficit, the only conclusion they could come to was we had lost our way. 
   When they saw that the drug companies prevailed in actually getting legislation that prohibited price negotiation to get the best price for taxpayers and seniors, they thought America had lost its way. 
   When they saw that over the course of 9 years, Congress had allowed itself nine pay increases totaling $31,000, but the minimum wage worker was stuck at $5.15 an hour, they thought America had lost its way. 
   When they saw that when major legislation was brought before this body and the vote was extended for 3 or 4 hours in order to arm-twist, persuade people to change their votes, they thought Congress had lost its way. 
   I believe what this election was about across America was people in Vermont and people in districts from Vermont to California saying that they wanted Congress to start solving problems. What this 100 hours was about was making a down payment to America, where we are trying to give confidence to Americans that this Congress can do the work that needs to be done to improve the lives of average, everyday people. The strength of our democracy has always depended on a strong middle-class and opportunities for people at the low income level who want to climb the ladder of opportunity. 
   What we have done in this first 100 hours, frankly, working together with many on the other side of the aisle, is establish that we actually can govern and we can pass legislation that will be meaningful. We have rejected politics as being about finding wedge issues that will divide us so that we can focus on economic issues that can unite us. And this is a beginning, it is not an end. 
   These first 100 hours, in my view, have been remarkable. We have changed the way Congress does business by enacting ethics reforms; no meals, no free trips, no free travel, and we did this with the support of 68 Republicans. 
   To return to fiscal responsibility, we adopted pay-as-you-go budgeting. That is going to impose itself on Republicans and Democrats, whether proposing spending increases for programs you favor or tax cuts you might want to advocate for. We did this with the support of 48 Republicans. 
   To help working families who have really been squeezed as our economy starts widening between those who have and everyone else, we passed cuts in student loan interest rates that will save the average student about $4,400 over the life of the loan, and we did that with the support of 124 Republicans. 
   We passed, of course, the first minimum wage increase in 10 years, and that is going to help America's lowest paid workers, and we did that with all the Democrats and the support of 82 Republicans. 
   And on and on; on stem cell research, on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and the commonsense step of ending tax breaks for Big Oil that costs taxpayers $14 billion, while it increased our dependence on foreign oil and put off the day when we embraced the challenge and obligation all of us know we have, to move towards alternative energy. 
   What we know is this: America has very severe challenges: Health care, 47 million Americans without it; health care for the Americans that do have it, that they are increasingly finding they can't afford; bringing our troops home from Iraq; restoring our budget to balance; moving in a new direction on energy. 
   What we know is true is that the only way we are going to solve those problems is if we work together. We are in it together, and it is by working together, as we have in these past 100 hours, that we can make progress for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from Florida and for his ringing endorsement of public spending for public projects. 
   Two things: first, Democrats readopted in this Congress the principle of pay-as-you-go, acknowledging that we have to pay our bills, and that good intentions are not enough to balance the budget. We will do that as we did before. But in this bill we are proposing to spend 7.5 percent more than the President asked for. And the reason? That spending is necessary and required if we're going to protect the rivers, the waterways, the air and the land of this great country. 
   Second, the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt is alive and well in this bipartisan bill by Mr. Dicks and by Mr. Tiahrt. We are getting back into protecting the America that we are responsible to hand down to the future. This bill, a bipartisan bill, appropriates $266 million for climate change research across all Federal agencies. This bill creates a commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation that will review scientific questions that need to be addressed to adapt to global warming and to recommend action. This investment in furthering our understanding of the impacts of climate change is a down payment on our future. If there has been a debate about whether global warming exists, this bill puts an exclamation point that the bipartisan conclusion of Congress is that global warming is real, is urgent, and requires immediate attention. 
   The spirit of Teddy Roosevelt is also alive and well in this bill in the Forest Legacy Program. And thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member. The Forest Legacy Program brings communities together, protecting their forests. In my own State, two very small towns of Fairlee and West Fairlee have been working hard contributing their own money to protect their Brushwood Forest. The increase in the Forest Legacy Program, something that's been overdue, is going to give them a fighting chance to be able to do that. 
   The spirit of Teddy Roosevelt is alive and well in the bill's commitment to water quality. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides all of our States resources for local sewage treatment projects, one of the most important investments in the country towards public health.     
   The spirit of Teddy Roosevelt is alive and well in the self-help efforts in this bill in the small amount of money, $16 million, that provides for rural water technical assistance. This helps small communities across the State of Vermont and across the country get the technical assistance that they need in order to do locally what is required for the benefit of their own citizens.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, today we begin debate on the question of whether to escalate the war in Iraq. 
   The administration's policy on Iraq has failed. It failed yesterday, it is failing today, and it will fail tomorrow. These failures have left America weakened, not strengthened. 
   Today, we must chart a new course. We must end the war in Iraq. 
   Each one of us is immeasurably proud of the service of our troops. They answered the call to duty, and they have done their job.     
   I am particularly proud of our Vermont troops and our families. No State has sacrificed more per capita in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan than our State of Vermont. But while our men and women in uniform have done their jobs, the President's policies have failed this country and failed our troops, demonstrably and repeatedly. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is now our responsibility to chart a new direction; one that brings our troops home, restores diplomacy to foreign policy and improves the readiness of our military. And we start today. No more troops, no more phony intelligence, no more blank checks. We must end this war. 
   Top military commanders have made it clear that no amount of American military force can take the place of the political consensus required to end Iraq's civil war. We now face two questions: What is best for America and what is best for Iraq? And the answer to both questions is to end this war. 
   This resolution, Mr. Speaker, is just a beginning. The President has left us no choice. America must change the direction of the war. If the President won't, we will. 
   Today, we choose the path which offers us the best hope for success: escalating the military conflict, as the President proposes, or taking the first step in a new direction. To strengthen America, we must choose a new path. Top generals have said it, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group confirmed it, and the American people demand it.

   The rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services now printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed in part A of the Rules Committee report, shall be considered as adopted. 
   The bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order to provisions of the bill, as amended. 
   The rule makes in order seven amendments printed in part B of the Rules Committee report. Each amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report and by the Member designated in the report. The amendments are considered as read, are debatable for the time specified, are not subject to amendment and are not divisible. All points of order against the amendments except, again, those in clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI are waived. 
   Finally, the rule does provide one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule which makes in order nearly all of the amendments that were brought to the Rules Committee. Even though many on our side had concerns about the intent and effect of certain provisions in the amendments, the Rules Committee, with the recommendation of the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, voted to allow the House to debate the amendments and let the votes fall as they may. 
   Besides the manager's amendment, the rule makes in order more Republican amendments, actually, than Democratic ones, four Republican and three Democratic amendments. The few amendments that were not made in order by the rule were either withdrawn, determined to be nongermane, or had already been voted on earlier by the House. 
   The rule also provides extensive time for debate on each amendment so that the House can have a very vigorous discussion on each of them. Under this rule, each of the amendments is debatable for 20 minutes. Two of the amendments are debatable for an hour each. 
   Chairman Frank came before our committee and testified that we should allow considerable time to debate each of these amendments on their merits and allow the views of all Members to be heard, even if that meant that we have to work late into the evening. 
   The Rules Committee agreed with the chairman, and I am pleased to bring forth this very even-handed rule. 
   Madam Speaker, as you know, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 25, 2005, followed by Hurricane Rita on September 24 and Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, causing extraordinarily heavy loss of life and dislocation of thousands of families. Hurricane Katrina alone devastated 90,000  square miles, made 770,000 people homeless and had a death toll of 1,464 in Louisiana alone. 
   Just by comparison, in 1906 the earthquake and fire in San Francisco killed an estimated 500 to 3,000 people, resulted in about 250,000 people homeless. The Galveston Island flood of 1900 killed as many as 8,000 people, in the island and the city. The Chicago fire, the famous fire of 1871, burned an area of approximately 3 square miles and made 100,000 people homeless. 
   In the aftermath of the storms, Congress approved $16.7 billion for Community Development Block Grants, and that's the portion of Katrina aid that we are talking about here, to aid the affected areas with rebuilding efforts. Of that, roughly $1.2 billion has been spent. There has been a lot of bureaucratic mismanagement, frankly, in FEMA, resulting in the delay of aid approved to the people who need it. 
   Tragically, many residents continue to be displaced, and the pace of home repair and reconstruction is much slower than had been hoped for. And tens of thousands of federally assisted evacuees from these hurricanes face impending deadlines later this year for continued eligibility for rental assistance. A great number of residents are still scattered around the country, many hundreds of thousands of miles from their homes. 
   Madam Speaker, we are aware that FEMA didn't get its job done in the aftermath of the hurricane. We are here, in part, to try to put this back together and make certain that the aid people need is delivered. In part, this Congress now is responding to the needs of the folks in the gulf coast again. 
   I am very pleased to support this rule and support the underlying bill because it does provide some overdue housing relief to displaced gulf coast residents. H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007, was passed out of the Financial Services Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 50-16. The bill is practical in speeding up the repair and rebuilding of homes and affordable rental housing to the displaced low-income victims to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.     
   Very specifically, the measure frees up for use $1.175 billion in funds that was previously made available to the State of Louisiana, but which has been held up by FEMA. Louisiana has proposed combining these funds with other Community Development Block Grant funds under its Road Home program for grants to homeowners, but FEMA won't approve use of the funds, thereby slowing down the program because of concerns about specific provisions of the Road Home program that provide incentives for homeowners to commit to return to the State of Louisiana and live. 
   This bill would transfer such funds to CDBG grants in order to expedite the availability of those funds. The bill also has a number of provisions designed to address the shortfall in affordable housing for low-income families. And, as we all know, it was low-income families who bore the brunt of suffering as a result of these hurricanes. This measure would prevent public housing units in New Orleans from being demolished until the Federal Government has a plan to replace them and grant displaced public housing tenants an absolute right of return to either their former neighborhood or one as close as possible. 
   Faced with a looming September deadline for the cutoff of some 12,000 families currently receiving Disaster Voucher Program assistance, H.R. 1227 extends this deadline through at least the end of the year and authorizes replacement vouchers to affected families when the program terminates, and that would continue as long as the family is eligible for voucher assistance. 
   Additionally, responding to numerous accounts of government waste in the gulf coast rebuilding process, H.R. 1227 includes a number of provisions to ensure effective oversight. Federal funds must be used efficiently, effectively, and legally. The bill requires the State of Louisiana to submit monthly reports on the progress of the Road Home program in making funds available to homeowners. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to complete quarterly reports identifying any waste, fraud, and abuse in connection with the program. We have got to stay on top of this money. And the bill requires the GAO study to examine methods of improving the distribution of Federal housing funds to assist States with hurricane recovery efforts. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes reimbursement of communities and landlords for monies lost through providing assistance to displaced individuals. A number of communities and private sector landlords throughout the country did play a critical role in providing housing assistance to evacuees in the aftermath of the hurricanes. This was crucial at a time when housing was in short supply and hundreds of thousands of families needed that assistance. We want to encourage such actions in future disasters to restore people's faith that the government can be a friend and an ally at a time of extraordinary need. 
   Much of the gulf coast remains devastated. Residents continue to suffer from inadequate housing, health care, and other basic services. And, more than 1 1/2 years after Hurricane Katrina struck, the situation in the gulf coast remains an emergency. We must act now to right some of the wrongs that have been done and not wait on the sidelines anymore. We urge that you support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And then there was one amendment that was not allowed because it was an amendment that was earlier offered and rejected by this House, and that was at the recommendation of the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, who had a very open process in the Financial Services Committee considering numerous amendments and then has pretty much invited any Member who wanted to submit an amendment to have an opportunity on the floor to do so or for consideration before the Rules Committee.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, in response to my friend from Georgia, I would say two things. First, there are seven amendments that have been allowed. One of them included an amendment by the gentleman from Georgia that was not timely, but was accommodated by the Rules Committee. The amendment that was rejected is an amendment that has been rejected before. 
   The second point that I think it is important to make is that we have a responsibility in this House to get work done.     
   And the rules are intended to help us do the work of the American people, not be a political wedge to make bogus arguments about process. And it is a disgrace, it is a disgrace, that going on 2 years after these hurricanes, there are people who are still homeless because we had a Federal Emergency Management Administration that was incompetent and reckless. It was headed by a person whose previous experience was as a judge of an Arabian horse contest, and that happened under the administration and the Congress that was led by Republicans. 
   That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to this Congress. It is not acceptable to this party. It is not acceptable to this Congressman. It is not acceptable by a bipartisan vote of 52-16 of the Financial Services Committee. 
   We have business to do because there are people who are still in emergency situations well over a year after devastating hurricanes. This legislation is about doing something now that should have been done 1 1/2 years ago. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my good friend from Florida. 
   Once again, Madam Speaker, this is, we believe, a fair and open rule that provides consideration for a much-needed, bipartisan piece of legislation. The rule makes in order nearly every amendment brought to the Rules Committee, more Republican than Democratic amendments, and with considerable time to debate the merits of each amendment that will be presented. 
   The underlying bill will provide increased flexibility for already allocated funds, provide new oversight for existing programs. It preserves public housing, assists evacuees with rental housing and provides support for landlords in local communities who assisted evacuees with housing. 
   Don't forget the displaced victims of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. That is really what this is all about. The Federal Government's response to the storms has been a national embarrassment, and it is just not acceptable. We have an obligation, all of us, to get our act together so that they can move on with their lives and put them back together. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, a couple of things about this. Number one, the fact that this is a bipartisan bill is really a breakthrough. The fact is that having the support of the Agriculture Committee, ranking member and the chairman, indicates that there is a coming together on something that is incredibly important. 
   We have had a lot of debate about how this is going to affect the price of gas, but the way, as I understand it, the Agriculture Committee approached this, was how are we going to protect consumers? How are we going to protect farmers? How are we going to protect fuel dealers and airlines that have the burden of buying in the futures market because they need price stability, and they need a futures trading market in order to have price discovery, so that coming together was about recognizing that the institutional mechanism of a commodity futures trading commission has to be in service of those farmers in the Midwest. 
   It has to be in service of airlines that are trying to get us from here to there, of our fuel dealers that are delivering home heating fuel to our people at home. We can have a debate about how much prices are going to come down. In fact, since this committee took this under active consideration, the prices have come from 150 to 100. We can argue about what's the cause and effect, but it certainly was contemporaneous and had a big impact.     
   But what is happening in our economy is that basic institutions that have served us well, mortgages for homeowners, or the futures trading for farmers and others, have been hijacked for other reasons, not just to help a person buy a home or help a farmer have a price, but to become a commodity itself used by Wall Street to speculate for financial manipulation and market reasons. 
   That is not what these institutions are about, and the Congress has a fundamental decision before it. Are we  going to stand up for American farmers and American consumers and provide protection for the institutions that they absolutely need, we need, or are we going to allow them to continue to be hijacked by Wall Street for other reasons?

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. My amendment is quite simple. 
   It would add municipalities to the list of entities eligible for the National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program. Keep in mind, anyone who is going to be successful has to go through a competitive grant process. 
   The reason for that is the municipalities are the ones that at the grassroots level oftentimes provide these services. Obviously, we all live in towns or in cities, and this environmental education initiative outlined in the legislation is being offered, in many cases, by small towns in rural America and in large towns elsewhere. In fact, in smaller towns, it's the local Parks and Recreation Department. That's a subset, obviously, of the municipality and who is the ultimate intended beneficiary of this opportunity. It's the Parks and Rec Department that takes the lead in providing environmental education to our kids. This amendment would allow those agencies to participate. 
   According to the National Park and Recreation Association, an entity that has endorsed this amendment, municipal park systems are the best and most logical partners for schools and for other educational agencies across the country to develop effective environmental education programs. 
   In my own State of Vermont, environmental education programs are offered by almost every town during their summer programming. The programs are great for the kids in helping them appreciate the environment and the value of protecting it. The town of Colchester, for instance, boasts four summer environmental education offerings. Killington, Vermont did a survey, and it revealed that the majority of citizens thinks their town should offer through parks and recreation such an education program. 
   Such programs are committed to providing diverse, accessible and effective environmental education at the grassroots. This amendment will bolster these efforts by assuring properly trained staff and the best materials. Tested instruction strategies are available for and are integrated into environmental programming. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I appreciate the concerns expressed by the gentleman from California, but I think I can assure him that the definition won't dilute the program, and there are two reasons. 
   One, the term ``municipality'' does have a legal definition. It's a city, basically, or an entity as defined in the code of the applicable State. In Vermont--and I think this is pretty much true around the country--you have subdivisions. You have the Parks and Rec Department. The point here is that it is the Parks and Rec Department that is oftentimes doing this kind of work. 
   So what this amendment would do, I think, is it would achieve that goal of local control and delivery at the most elemental and local of levels, which I think is an objective that the gentleman from California and I share. 
   The other thing that gives me some reassurance--and it may not quite reach the level of assurance that the gentleman from California looks to--is that the grants will be competitive, so there will be a process that applicants have to go through, whether they're a municipality or whether they're any other entity making an application. It will be reviewed by an impartial authority. Let's certainly hope that's the case. Then the merit-based decision will be that this application looks like it's going to help a lot of kids and be effective, and it will be granted on that basis, not on the name of the applicant or on that of the particular entity. 
   So I really do appreciate the concerns that were offered. I have more comfort with the constraints of the definition of ``municipality,'' apparently, than does my friend from California, but ultimately, the backstop here is that independent review that is going to be the final arbiter of who gets these competitive opportunities. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill, I think, brings in sharp relief a major question that this Congress is now having to contend with. 
   Our economy has been hijacked by speculation. Institutions that have served average American families, average American farmers, average American businesses very well have become casino chips on Wall Street. A couple of examples: One, mortgages. Folks were able to get a mortgage when they had enough savings and could get one that they could afford and they would buy a home. Mortgages were turned into subprimes that became investment vehicles by Wall Street, and now we're seeing the collapse. 
   A second institution, and this is why the Agriculture Committee is so involved, is the futures market. The purpose of the futures market was to give some price stability to our farmers, to our fuel dealers, to our airlines, folks who absolutely had a need for some price stability, some price discovery with the commodity they were producing. 
   And how did we get to this situation where it's been taken over by Wall Street? We can thank Enron for that. And it is important to understand historically how we got here. 
   Enron came into this Congress in 2001 and asked, literally, for a loophole, and they got it; and that was to allow speculative trading in the futures market. What that has resulted in is a vast increase in speculative activity in the energy market and the futures market for commodities by financial players as opposed to by farmers, by fuel dealers, by airlines. 
   We saw what happened with the subprime mess, and now we're seeing what has happened in the commodity futures trading market and why it's so essential that we get control on this and restore the futures market and restore it to what its original intention was, that is, something that's going to help the American consumer, the American farmer, the American small business. 
   This committee bill is bipartisan. The Agriculture Committee probably has the two most bipartisan leaders in the House with Chairman Peterson and Representative Goodlatte. And what they've done is made a decision in this committee to bring a bill that restores the commodity futures trading market to its original purpose, and that is having as its focus helping our farmers, our consumers, and small businesses and saying ``no'' to Wall Street; this is not one of your toys for speculation and enrichment. 
   So this is absolutely essential not just for the farmers and the small businesses, the fuel dealers, the airlines, but for capitalism itself. If we don't have mechanisms that reward work as opposed to just speculation, we're not going to have an economy that works. 
   So this bipartisan legislation recognizes the fundamental requirement that we have institutions that work to reward and help our farmers and our small businesses.  
   Today, the House will take up H.R. 6604, the Commodity Market Transparency and Accountability Act. This bill will take crucial steps to curb excessive speculation in the energy futures markets. 
   Each weekend I hear the same thing from Vermonters: increasing expenses for fuel, child care, health care, and education are making it harder and harder for working families to make ends meet. Energy costs are an enormous driver of this crisis. The average U.S. heating oil bill is expected to be a record $3,500 for the upcoming winter, up 76 percent from two winters ago. This is not sustainable. Based on the current state of the market, speculation is a large contributing factor to the astronomical spikes we have had in just the past 12 to 18 months. 
   In 2000, Enron and several large energy companies successfully lobbied the (Republican-led Congress to exempt energy markets from government regulation. This lack of oversight has resulted in multi-billion dollar price manipulation and excessive speculation by traders. This special interest loophole is allowing energy traders to rip off Americans who are already struggling every winter to heat their homes. The previous Congress sold us out to Enron, creating a Wild West in the energy markets at the public's expense. It's time to end this rip off. 
   Last November I introduced H.R. 4066, the ``Close the Enron Loophole'' bill. My bill and the bill we will vote on later today calls into question the excessive speculation occurring in the marketplace. Are we going to allow the oil futures market to continue to profit from ripping-off our hardworking constituents, or are we to pass and enforce responsible regulations on energy futures trading? Families who already struggle to pay fuel bills, should not be forced to choose between putting food on the table and keeping their house warm as energy traders continue to line their pockets. 
   This bill will not solve our energy problems. Forcing speculation out of the market is not a substitute for real commitment to a long term energy policy. As a nation that possesses less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, but uses 25 percent of the world's oil, we must adopt new policies--higher mileage standards for our vehicles, higher energy efficiency standards, tax incentives for clean energy alternatives, better construction designs, restoration of mass transit and rail--we can create jobs, improve our environment, develop affordable energy, and strengthen our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 877 provides for the consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 6, to move the United States toward greater energy independence and security, to increase the production of clean renewable fuels, to protect consumers, to increase the efficiency of products, buildings, and vehicles, and to promote research on and deploy greenhouse gas capture and storage options. In short, it's a comprehensive energy bill. 
   The rule makes in order a motion by the majority leader that the House concur in the Senate amendment. The rule waives all points of order against the motion except clause 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is historic legislation. Today, we will move from a policy of dependence on foreign oil, a policy of endless drilling, to a policy of independence and efficiency. It's a policy that is overdue. It's overdue for the health of the American economy, the health of the world environment, and for the strengthening of our foreign policy options. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the American economy is being hit very hard by spiraling fuel prices. Around the country, families are sitting around their kitchen tables wondering how they are going to afford their fuel bills this winter. In December of 2002, just a few years ago, the price of a gallon of gas was $1.48. It's now $3.09. Five years ago, in Vermont it cost a family about $600 to heat their homes. Now, it's about $1,500. 
   Our current energy policy of spiraling costs, environmental degradation, and increasing dependence on people who are not particularly our friends is weakening America, harming our environment, and stretching the budgets of our families. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses each and every one of these problems. It's fiscally responsible. It starts by repealing some, but not all, of the big oil and gas tax giveaways and reinvests that money to ensure energy independence. It increases fuel efficiency standards, and this is probably the single most important provision of this bill. The last time this Congress increased fuel efficiency standards was 32 years ago, and since that time the American auto industry has lost market share. The cost of operating a car has increased. What this bill does, which is historic, is increase the mileage standards by 40 percent so that the fleet-wide average in 2020 will be 35 miles per gallon. 
   That is the first real step toward fuel efficiency in those 32 years. It's going to save American families $700 to $1,000 at the pump; it's going to produce $22 billion in net annual savings for consumers by 2020; and through the application in this legislation of efficiency standards, which essentially is that you make a toaster that uses less rather than more energy, and other appliances the same, it's going to save consumers $400 billion through 2030. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue, and it is a declaration of independence from the old energy policy that had us relying on people who were not our friends to supply us oil that we were addicted to, at prices that we could no longer afford. Today, we are going to turn the corner, and the American people are going to see direct results in our economy, in our environment, and in our security as a result of this landmark legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Texas was expressing his concern about the impact on American families with the ever-escalating cost of gasoline, the ever-escalating cost of home heating fuel. Certainly you are no stranger in your job to the impact of that on our budget, trying to find money for the low-income heating assistance program. All of us have constituents that experience the kind of pain the gentleman from Texas is describing. 
   The problem is the policy we have pursued has resulted in endless consumption, endless escalation of prices, and constant dependence on the Persian Gulf folks who are not really our friends. If there is a metaphor for what has been the American energy policy through many administrations, one of dependence, of drilling and drilling, consumption and wastefulness, it was a photograph that appeared in the New York Times in April of 2005.     
   At that time there was an emerging sense that the cost of energy was having an enormously negative impact on our families. The cost of gasoline had risen over $2 a gallon. That price now seems quite wonderful; but in an effort to deal with it, the President of the United States invited the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Crawford and invited him there for discussions. And the picture on the front page of the paper was of the President of the United States and the Crown Prince holding hands going into the President's home to discuss energy policy. And the request by the President on behalf of the American people to the Crown Prince was that they raise production, in order, theoretically, to lower prices. Well, you know what? That's the same policy that we've pursued for generations, raise production, drill more, leave control in the hands, many times, of foreign countries that have very little regard for the long-term interests of the American people. 
   It's a policy that has not worked and is running into the dead-end reality that there are limits on how much fossil fuels we can drill. There's damage to the environment, and the cost is ever escalating as the demand for this commodity increases with the growth in economies in India, China, and the rest of the emerging world. 
   That was a photograph of dependence. This energy bill is about turning the corner and being the self-confident Nation that we should be, that within our own borders, with the resources and technical skills of our people, with what can be done in the agriculture sector, the engineering sector, that we can actually take resources that are immediately available to us, that are renewable, and we can transform them into the energy that our families need to drive their cars to and from day care, to get to and from work; that we can transform that into the energy that our industries need in order to produce, manufacture, and create jobs for the American people. 
   And the side benefit, and a central goal, is that it can, as it must, dramatically reduce the carbon emissions that are polluting this world and threatening our planetary future. That is a real crisis that requires immediate action. 
   We have a responsibility to the families that the gentleman from Texas mentioned to do everything that we can to make it affordable for them to do what they have to do to raise their families, to get to work. And we all jointly have a responsibility to the environment because it is our obligation, very simply, that we leave this planet as clean, hopefully cleaner than, as when we found it. The path that we're on has been one of further degradation. The path we're choosing is one of renewal and redemption. This is good for jobs. It's good for the environment. It's good for securing America's foreign policy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my colleague from Florida, and I admire her leadership on energy issues, among many other issues. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to speak about two things. One is an amendment that I offered to this bill that's been incorporated into the manager's amendment. 
   This bill recognizes that one of the steps that we have to take, long overdue, is to build up our public transportation system. It's going to provide relief to commuters; it's going to help our environment; it's going to create jobs. 
   The amendment that I offered and that Mr. Oberstar incorporated into the manager's amendment would allow funds to be used by local transportation authorities, like the Chittenden County Transportation Authority, to retrofit their equipment and facilities in order to improve energy efficiency and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Those would be specific purposes for which authorized funds may be used. 
   Specifically, it means that an organization like the Chittenden County Transit Authority in the Burlington area could retrofit their buses and be more fuel efficient. They've been trying to do that. A shortage of funds has kept them from achieving all of their goals. It would also allow the transportation authority in that State and in other States to build a natural gas pump station locally. This, we believe, is a very important part of the legislation presented to you. 
   Second, we're having, in the process of this debate, an ongoing discussion about energy. The fact is--and I think we all know this--in the past when we've had crises around energy, it has never produced a lasting and durable response. There has been an immediate response but nothing lasting, whether it was after the OPEC organization in the early '70s, after the Gulf war or after Katrina. Usually, a crisis does produce a response. It hasn't. We know the time has passed as to when we can look the other way. 
   What accounts for the high cost of energy? The reality is there are a number of factors. The weak dollar is one, because of our current account deficit. Speculation is another. There has been a massive increase in speculation in the commodities markets in general, in oil in particular, where it's gone from folks who are delivering the product or who are receiving the product, to financial speculators who see that there is money in playing that game. 
   There has also been an increased demand with globalization. China and India are building their economies. They're using more energy. But there has also been a significant failure of leadership to move us away from an oil-dependent economy. The reality is, what we need to be doing here in Congress is addressing both the short-term  steps that we can take as well as the long-term need for a new energy policy. 
   So what are the specific things that we can do in the short term? One, we can stop filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and diminish demand. We've done that. That will have a positive impact in reducing demand. Second, we can limit speculation. We should be putting limits on how much the speculative players can influence price, not only because there is significant expert testimony that that is adding a premium to the cost of a gallon of gas or to a gallon of home heating fuel, but that it also is creating a potential bubble where innocent participants and pension funds may see the value of their assets suddenly diminish when the market goes south. So we will be considering later anti-speculation legislation that will be helpful as well. 
   Third, the ``Use It or Lose It'' legislation. Our friends on the other side have been making a big argument about the need to increase production. You know, there is not any disagreement here that part of our transition from an oil-based economy to a carbon-free economy has to include the continued production and use of carbon-based fuels, including oil. No question about it. The issue here is whether or not we need to increase lands that are available when we have 68 million acres already under lease, permitted, where all the oil companies need to do in order to produce more oil is to put metal to the Earth. This is 68 million acres, Madam Speaker, as you know, that is both onshore and offshore. 
   So the argument is that we need to be opening up a national park and starting to drill there or into other coastal areas when we have 68 million acres already available, but for reasons that only the oil companies--the leaseholders--are aware, those are not producing needed oil and natural gas for our citizens. It's estimated that the amount of oil that's available under those 68 million acres is 4.8 million barrels.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. So what we need to do that also is a long-term energy policy is to increase mileage standards and take away the tax breaks that are going to the oil companies and steer them to alternative agency. Incidentally, ExxonMobil, which made $40 billion this year, spent $32 billion buying its stock back rather than producing oil on these leaseholds. 
   We also have to have a new energy policy so we can keep our money at home. We're sending $1 trillion to the oil-producing states like Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, not particularly our friends. If we keep that money at home, we're going to strengthen our economy.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, as has been said, there's a number of causes for the high price in gasoline: a weak dollar, increasing demand from around the world, the failure of leadership to move into alternative energy policies. We have to focus on all of them. 
   But one of the reasons is rampant speculation, and the question is, will we try to squeeze the speculator or will we allow speculation to continue to squeeze the consumer? 
   This is a first step, where we're telling the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to do its job, determine the facts, make specific recommendations and actions on how to protect us, and incidentally, many innocent Americans have pension fund investments that are pouring into the speculative market.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1318 provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 5811, the Electronic Message Preservation Act. The resolution, as you know, provides 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The rule makes no amendments in order because no amendments were submitted for consideration.  
   H.R. 5811 is an important bill introduced by Chairman Waxman that modernizes the requirements of the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act to ensure that vital government records are preserved for historical posterity. 
   The Electronic Message Preservation Act will make certain that we retain important Presidential records by directing the Archivist to establish standards for the capture, management, and preservation of White House and Federal agency e-mails. The Archivist of the U.S. will set new standards for tracking Federal e-mail records and annually will certify whether the records management controls put in place by the President meet those standards and comply with the act. 
   The bill will protect American history so that we will not lose important records in an antiquated record system that exists now, but it will also guide and enforce document retention policies within the executive branch. 
   The bill is very necessary. Through its investigations, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee discovered that in one instance the current White House had lost hundreds of days of e-mail, and in other instances allowed numerous White House officials, including Senior Advisor Karl Rove, to use Republican National Committee e-mail accounts for government business--improper, obviously. E-mails sent by White House officials over these RNC accounts related to official government business, and potentially hundreds of thousands of these e-mails have been destroyed. 
   In addition, the White House did grossly mismanage its own e-mail records and ignored concerns that were raised not by Congress, but by the National Archives, about the way it was storing e-mails. 
   Further, the current print-and-file record retention systems are both unreliable and not in step with modern advances in technology. For example, when President Bush came into office, the White House had an automated system in place for archiving e-mails, but in 2002, the White House decided to abandon this archiving system and replace it with an ad hoc manual system, doing so in an electronic age. White House officials were warned by the technical staff of their own White House staff and by National Archives that this ad hoc manual system for managing e-mails presented an obvious threat and serious threat of losing records. And the White House's own technical expert said the system was, to use the word of that expert, ``primitive'' and carried a high risk that ``data would be lost.'' Yet, despite these warnings, the White House has still not put into place a reliable, up-to-date system for preserving e-mails. 
   This bill will change that. It will require the Archivist to establish specific standards for the management and preservation of electronic messages, including the capability to retrieve messages through electronic searches. These standards will help prevent a situation like what is happening under this administration. H.R. 5811 directs e-mail records to be stored electronically and removes ambiguity in the current law that was established before we even had e-mail. 
   The bill and the manager's amendment were approved by voice vote in the committee because it is timely and it's necessary. I urge the passage and a ``yes'' vote on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I'm going to approach the podium to use some charts. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about the preservation of electronic records. The debate has turned into a discussion of our energy policy. And there are two reasons why we would be discussing energy instead of the substance of the actual bill. One is that our friends on the other side don't have anything to say about the importance of the preservation of electronic records. Two is they want to use the opportunity of floor time to make a case, their case, about energy. I intend to respond to both of those issues. 
   First of all, I want to go back to what this legislation is about. It's about the preservation of the historical record for the American people. It's also about the preservation of the records of the administration so that in the future when any Congress wants to hold any President accountable, there will be documentation of what has happened in that administration. 
   It is extraordinarily important that this Congress restore its constitutional function of insisting on accountability for the American people. We have three branches of government, and one of them has been asleep for the 6 years going into the year 2006, and that was Congress, the legislative representative of the people of this country, who demand and are entitled to accountability. If you do not have the preservation of the records of their government--these are not records belonging to the President. They're not records that belong to the executive branch. It's not for them to decide ``yes'' or ``no'' that we will preserve these records. This is a right of the American people. It's their property. And what this electronic records preservation does is say that you cannot use the paper system that doesn't work in an electronic age in effect to conceal from the American people what you did. It is overdue. And to take this debate and inject into it another topic, as important as energy is, is to trivialize the fundamentally important responsibility that this Congress has to the American people to restore oversight and accountability. 
   This government has make enormous mistakes and justified them by concealing information from the American people. What do you need to know more than what happened in the pathway to the war in Iraq? If the truth had been out there for the American people and for many in this body to know what the President knew and when the President knew it, what the administration knew and when they knew it, we would not be in this catastrophe for the American people called the war in Iraq. 
   So this legislation that says that e-mail records are going to be restored and retained electronically is of profound constitutional importance to the continuation of Congress in its role as the overseer and protector of the American record and the American taxpayer. So on its merits, this legislation should be considered as of absolute  vital importance to the people of this country. And we have heard no objections, and, indeed, this legislation was passed by voice vote. 
   Now, since the issue was raised, since the debate on this profoundly important question of constitutional oversight has been hijacked to turn it into an energy debate where it really doesn't belong, I am nevertheless going to respond to the arguments.     
   You start by this proposition. Implicit in many of the arguments that my friends on the other side made was that those of us on the Democratic side somehow don't understand the pain that the American consumer is experiencing with these record high gas prices. 
   I have got to just speak about Vermont. What I hear about from Vermonters is fear. I've never heard this. And gas prices are tough. They are trying to figure out how to get from here to there and pay for it. They've got cars that they don't get great mileage. They are doubling up. They are doing what they can. But, bottom line, the thing they are terrified about and they have real anxiety is how are they going to heat their homes next year. 
   We have to heat our homes there. And, folks, when they see that gas delivery truck show up, and last year it was like $2.50 a gallon, it's going to be $5 a gallon next year, and these families don't have the money to pay $1,000, $1,500, $2,000 to fill up a tank. They don't know what they're going to do. And we are going to see Vermonters who are doubling up. Generations are going to be living together because they don't know how they are going to pay that bill. 
   So, believe me, there's not a single Member in this House, Republican or Democrat, who doesn't profoundly understand the impact that this is having on everyday people, on our small businesses, on our economy. 
   So we can go back and forth with the accusations and we can go back and forth with the slogans, or we can acknowledge the obvious. The obvious is we have to do everything that we can in the short term to try to bring relief at the pump, to try to bring pressure off the small business and the consumer. Anything in the short-term that we can do, we should do, and we should do it together. But we also have to move to a long-term energy policy that no longer allows oil to have an iron grip on our future. That is what Americans know. 
   Short-term, what are some of the things we can do? We have done them. We stopped filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It will reduce demand by 70,000 to 90,000 barrels a day. Second, we are considering legislation for the oil companies to use the leases they have, or lose them. 
   There's this debate about bringing production online. Obviously, supply is an issue here. In the world, we pump about 86 billion barrels a day. We consume about 87 billion barrels a day. But the fact is that the slogans that I am hearing about just opening up other offshore areas in ANWR totally ignores the current reality, and that is that the oil companies, that are very good at what they do, have leases, existing leases that they pay good money on, on 68 million acres of land. That land, their leases, their leases exceed by 2 1/2 times the area of the State of Ohio, the Minority Leader Boehner's district; 2 times the State of Illinois; 2 1/2 times the size of Pennsylvania. These are leases on Federal lands, onshore and offshore. 
   What are the oil companies doing? Not much. They are producing oil on a fraction of the leaseholds that they have.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   That could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil a day. Yet the oil companies are not drilling where they have leases to do so. Instead, we are turning this argument into the prospect that we may be able to drill in the future on other places where there aren't leases, waiving away what will be the long-term problems of trying to make that come online, and the fact that it would probably save about a penny and a half a gallon in 10 to 20 years. That is not fair, direct honesty in the debate for the American people.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. So what do we have? We have a situation where the oil companies are not drilling where they can, and we are saying to them, Drill where you can. We also have a situation where the oil companies, the longer they wait, the more they make. If you're sitting on leases and oil in the ground, under the sea was $35 a barrel when you bid that lease, then it went to $75, then it went to $100, and now it's $140 a barrel, you're making money just having that in the bank. So the oil companies, the longer they wait, the more they make. 
   We know that oil company profits are exploding.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   The oil companies have made $125 billion. Record profits again this year. How are they spending that money? Are they investing in refineries, are they investing it in renewable energy, are they investing in drilling rigs or offshore facilities to drill in those areas? No. They are buying back their stock. 
   The oil companies, energy producers, should be part of the solution, and they should be using the technical ability that they have, the extraordinary skills that they have and the extraordinary profits that they have to help us find a way to an energy independent future, and it's not happening. 
   We know that, bottom line, everything we can do short-term, we can do, but the idea that we can do instantly something is a stretch. But what we can do, we should do. 
   On speculation, we are considering legislation now, and as we speak, the Chair of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Peterson, is conducting 3 days of hearings to try to squeeze the speculator instead of having the speculators squeeze us; on not filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and topping it off. 
   I am demanding of the oil companies that they start producing oil in those 68 million acres where they actually have leases and the right to be producing that oil. They could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil a day. Do you know what we produce domestically right now? Five million barrels of oil a day. It could lead to a doubling of the production. 
   So the fact is there are things that can be done that we are promoting that they be done aggressively. We are insisting that the oil companies be accountable to use and produce on the leases that they have, yet they refuse to do it. And we have been consistently and aggressively moving for a new energy policy that is going to create green jobs, that is going to give us much greater independence in foreign affairs, and is going to help us clean up our environment. 
   A confident nation is one that faces directly the problems that it has. And when it comes to the question of energy, what symbolized for me the energy policy that this country has had was a front page picture of the President of the United States, hand-in-hand with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia as they were about to go into a meeting. In the custom of the Arab States, they walked into that holding  hands. The purpose of that meeting was for the President of the United States, the greatest country on Earth, to implore the King to increase production of oil. 
   You know what? A confident nation, a nation that takes on the challenge of solving its own problems, does not go hat in hand to others and ask them, who are not our friends, incidentally, to solve our problems. We take that challenge on ourselves. We take it on because it's our responsibility. We also take it on because we know that in the doing of it, we are going to create jobs, clean our environment, and give us much more latitude in foreign policy. 
   So this debate on energy, misplaced as it is in this matter of electronic records and restoring the responsibility of Congress to the American people to conduct oversight and to preserve a historical record, important as that is, the argument on energy, the question of energy is the profound question that this country faces economically for the next generation, and the challenge will be whether we are willing to face that squarely and take it upon ourselves to solve our problems, or we are going to continue to be dependent on oil companies that have not played on behalf of the American people and on foreign countries that are not our friends; Venezuela, Middle East States, Russia. We have to take on this challenge ourselves. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will just close by saying, going back to this bill, that it's an extraordinarily important bill, not just so that we can preserve records, but that we in Congress can restore confidence to the American people that we are a cop on the beat. 
   This bill makes significant and long overdue changes to document retention systems that were outdated and inefficient. The vast amount of government business that is currently conducted over e-mail requires that we update the law regulating record retention. Government e-mails should not be deleted or destroyed, as they are as important in revealing to the public and historians as paper documents, and we all know that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   First of all, I would like to thank you. Your committee has done extraordinary work throughout the year, probably produced more good legislation than any other. 
   I want to thank you for working with me on this issue that is raised on this bill regarding the ability of small businesses to continue to use the SBIR program. Specifically, I want to thank you for agreeing to work with me to monitor agency actions to ensure that smaller firms are not represented in the agency's distribution of SBIR awards. 
   Also, I want to say that I am pleased that you agree to work with me and in Congress and that this matter needs vigorous study, and we will work to ensure that a National Institute for Standards and Technology study, which I would like to place in the Record, is included in the conference.     
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Reclaiming my time, you have my commitment to monitor Federal agencies' efforts to award grants to small firms. And as this legislation moves forward, we will work with you to identify ways that agencies are properly studying and making available opportunities for small businesses.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (CLOSE THE CONTRACTOR FRAUD LOOPHOLE ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental responsibilities that this Congress has is to protect taxpayer dollars. That has become an enormous challenge, as many of the taxpayer dollars that are appropriated are paid to private contractors. 
   The growth in contracting in the past 6 or 7 years has exploded. Procurement spending in 2000 was $213 billion. Procurement spending is when we enter into a contract with a private company to deliver goods or services. That amount exploded last year to $412 billion. Much of that is going to Iraq and Afghanistan. Much of this is being subject to waste, fraud and abuse. 
   The Oversight Committee under Mr. Waxman and Mr. Davis has done vigorous oversight and identified in 2006 that there were 118 contracts valued at $745 billion that were found by government auditors to include a significant component of fraud, abuse and mismanagement. And, in fact, it got worse. 
   In 2008, that report identified 187 contracts valued at $1.1 trillion, where they were plagued by waste, fraud and abuse. 
   The bottom line is, will we, as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats, be vigilant in protecting taxpayer dollars? We have to do that, especially when there is documented evidence of rip-offs, wicked rip-offs that have occurred with taxpayer dollars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. 
   There's two goals that we have. The first that we widely share is that every taxpayer dollar will be accounted for, and that the taxpayers who were working hard to support this government and our troops will see that their money is spent on proper things that are in the contract. We have to protect the taxpayer. 
   The second is we've got to protect the troops. If we are spending money in Iraq and Afghanistan for the intended purpose of bringing our troops home and improving our national security, any dollar that's wasted that results in any additional injury, or one day prolonged in the conflicts, is a dollar that is improperly wasted. We cannot do that. 
   So I believe that this loophole, however it got there, by mistake or by sleight of hand, however it got there, it's got to be closed. Obviously, if you have a regulation, as it was written, that says we will report fraud when it is a rip-off on a domestic contract, but we won't when it's on a foreign contract, we're sending a very unambiguous message. There's a green light to rip off taxpayers if the money is being spent abroad. That's not a defensible position. And that's why we're closing this loophole to make it absolutely clear that's unacceptable. 
   Now I think it does make sense. What Congressman Davis proposed as a new way of proceeding is fine with me. And here's why. The bottom line is protecting the taxpayers and protecting our troops. And if we can accomplish that better by finding a way that has bipartisan support, we can all have more confidence that we'll be successful. 
   So I'm glad to work with Chairman Davis in order to have this get done in a bipartisan way. I want to thank very much Chairman Waxman and the great work of my chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Towns, for bringing this forward so quickly and so effectively.

   It was pretty shocking what we heard when this came up. Mr. Eric Prince of Blackwater was in before our committee, and the question was, how did your contracting go from $75 million to over $1 billion. And then in the course of it, what was your salary. He admitted to about $1 million in salary but then also disclosed there's about a 10 percent profit, which would mean, just by doing plain math, $100 million just in the bottom-line profit to the sole owner. We don't know exactly whether that's the case, but that's certainly the way it looks. 
   Mr. Murphy's legislation will let the taxpayers know how much they are spending that goes to the bottom-line profit of an individual in this war when our soldiers are working so hard in such danger and getting so little pay for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1125 provides for the consideration of H.R. 5819, the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate, with 40 minutes controlled by the Committee on Small Business and 20 minutes controlled by the Committee on Science and Technology. The rule makes in order 17 amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. The amendments are each debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Since its inception in 1982, SBIR has assisted small businesses to compete for Federal research and development awards. It does that by reserving a percentage of the Federal R&D funds for qualifying small firms which would not otherwise be able to compete in the Nation's R&D arena with larger companies. 
   SBIR is a unique collaboration that allows Federal agencies to fund projects to meet specific agency needs while expanding opportunities for small businesses, including women and minority-owned businesses. SBIR has enhanced the role of innovative small businesses and higher education research institutions in federally funded research and development while fostering competition and productivity in economic growth. 
   SBIR, Mr. Speaker, targets the entrepreneurial sector because that's where the innovators thrive. The risk and expense of conducting serious R&D efforts are often beyond the means of small businesses, so SBIR funds are a critical start-up in development stages, encourage the commercialization of technology, product or service, which  in turn obviously helps the United States economy. 
   And the results, by the way, speak for themselves. Not only are 85 percent of the businesses competing in SBIR small firms employing 20 or fewer persons, but the program has generated 50,000 patents over 25 years. SBIR has helped thousands of small businesses drive enhancements in our Nation's defense, new protections for our environment, and advances in health care. 
   The National Research Council and the National Academies' report, in assessment of the Small Business Innovation Research Program, states, ``The SBIR program is sound in concept and effective in practice. The SBIR program has created a competitive entrepreneurial environment upon which small, independently owned businesses can compete to strengthen America's high technology economy. Many consider SBIR to be one of our most successful technology development programs.'' 
   This rule allows for consideration of a welcomed reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR programs. Just very briefly, what it's going to do is increase the existing set-aside for SBIR to 3 percent, and for STTR to six-tenths of a percent, increase SBIR and STTR grant award levels, increase congressional oversight and evaluation of programs, make changes to shorten the application review periods, and create an outreach development program for underrepresented States, regions, types of businesses, and numbers in the workforce. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I have mainly listened as this debate has unfolded, and I have an observation. This is a sad spectacle. The Congress of the United States has before it now a bill that is intended to address an urgent need to provide research funding for our small businesses. 
   Small business is the backbone of our economy, it is where most jobs are created, it is where some of the best innovations occur, and where our small businesses need some assistance to put together the financing package required to explore innovative research and development ideas. Our small businesses don't have the funds that are available oftentimes through big venture capital operations. And what we are hearing in this debate is a complete and utter disregard for the content of this bill and, instead, turning it into a political debate that veers wildly away from any truth about what the history of this whole gas crisis is. 
   Number one, the basic question before us is, are we going to help the research and development needs of our small businesses? We believe it is urgent that we do so, and we won't be deterred by what is now a political argument. 
   Second, since our friends on the other side have made an accusation that there has been Democratic culpability, almost a conspiracy, in raising gas prices, I want to respond to the absurdity of that. 
   We have heard from our speakers how the price of a barrel of oil when President Bush took over was $25, it is now $119. We know that the war in Iraq, when it started, that catastrophic war, the price was $35, it is now $119. But what we also know is that under the leadership of the Republican Congress, we turned a blind eye on the Government's responsibility to look out for the middle class. Why? We destroyed regulatory oversight that is necessary to help folks pulling up with their pickup truck to fill up their gas tank. 
   This Enron loophole, snuck in, in the middle of the night with the complicity of a Republican Congress is, Mr. Speaker, and I say this intentionally, unconscionable, unconscionable to meeting the needs of average Americans who are trying to work hard and pay their bills. Fifty cents at least in the price of a gallon of gasoline is because the speculators, the hedge fund managers, are singing every day as they make wire transfers to their bank accounts at the expense of everyday Americans. 
   And my question is, why will not those who are expressing concern about the cost of gasoline and how that impacts small business and impacts our families, why will they not get behind Congressman Stupak and support The PUMP Act, get rid of the Enron loophole? Why will they not join with many of us who have sent letters to the President imploring him to release the strategic petroleum reserve or at least stop buying. One action would reduce, according to Goldman Sachs, the cost of a gallon of gasoline by 25 cents. And then there is the legislation that we passed that the Republicans voted against. 
   So what we have is an accusation made by people who every time they have had an opportunity to take a concrete specific action that would help, have said no, have said no to the Enron loophole reform, have said no to The PUMP Act, have said no to stop buying in the strategic petroleum reserves. 
   So it leaves me with a question. Is what we are hearing about politics, or is it about policy? I have come to my own conclusion. But we are here on a bill that is going to help small business. That is our job. And our job in this rule should be to make that bill a better bill, not to hijack what is a good bill and turn it into a political food fight. 
   We have got two issues here that have been injected. One is, are we going to help small business or not? There is broad bipartisan support. The two committees of jurisdiction have done an excellent job.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3685, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   Unfortunately, in 31 states, it is still legal to fire someone because that person is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In 39 states, it is legal to do so if the person is transgender. I am proud that Vermont already protects individuals against employment discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. Vermont's 1992 Human Rights Law included sexual orientation protections in public and private employment, as well as public accommodations, education, housing, credit, insurance and union practices. In May of this year, Vermont included gender identity protections in employment, public accommodations, and housing. I applaud Vermont for these important steps and we must do the same on the national level. 
   When making employment decisions, employers should look at an individual's qualifications and the quality of the work they produce, not their sexual orientation or gender identity. The public strongly supports this notion. 
   Many employers have already acted on their own. Approximately 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies include sexual orientation in their nondiscrimination policies. More specifically, 49 of the Fortune 50 companies have a policy against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   Progress is being made on the gender identity front as well. Approximately 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies include protections against gender identity discrimination in their corporate policies. 
   Where employers do not act, however, the Federal government must step in and extend this protection to employees across the country. Employees are currently protected from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin or disability. 
   If not enacted today, I believe this Congress will soon realize that gender identity protections, like in Vermont, are also necessary and I stand ready to join my colleagues in taking that next step. 
   The decision before us today is whether or not we take a giant step forward. Whether or not we as a Congress want to protect the millions of gays and lesbians across the country from employment discrimination. This legislation is a perfect example of how this Congress has made a commitment to a new direction. This new direction embodies the values of equality and fairness, making sure that workers, children, families, and communities can fully participate in the successes of our economy. This bill would have never seen the light of day in past Congresses. 
   I am glad that the rule makes in order the amendment by Representative Baldwin to include ``gender identity'' protections in the bill. I urge all my colleagues to support the rule, support the Baldwin amendment, and support the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) for her excellent work on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, in November Vermonters and the American people demanded a change in direction in Washington and a change in priorities. The past 5 months have been an important down payment on our commitment to change. 
   Today the House takes up the third of 12 appropriation bills where we will continue making this progress of taking America in a new direction. This is a balanced bill adopting the pay-as-you-go principle enacted by this House of Representatives. 
   This Energy and Water Appropriation bill represents a bipartisan approach to our response to a growing energy crisis. We're making real changes by focusing on commonsense priorities. 
   We know we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and cut our greenhouse gas emissions. This legislation invests $3 billion in addressing global climate change. It does so by researching effects of greenhouse gases and then working on the technologies that will make a new energy future. It also focuses on the growing renewable energy industry, making an investment in energy programs that both reduce greenhouse gases and help our Nation meet its energy needs. 
   This Energy and Water bill provides a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency, renewable energy and important water projects, including $200 million towards solar, $235 million in vehicle technology to increase mileage efficiency, $146 million in energy-efficient buildings, $117 million in enhancing hydropower. 
   In addition, it invests over $5 billion, as the gentlelady from California said, in construction operations and the management of critical water projects around the entire country, including in the State of Vermont. 
   These programs are important not only when talking about the need to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and greenhouse gas emissions, but to make critical investments in new industries that can be seen across the country. If we make this commitment now, we can have a pro-growth, pro-high tech, pro-environment economy of the future. 
   In my district of Vermont, we have dozens of thriving, renewable energy companies rooted in our community and creating goods jobs. Efficiency Vermont, GroSolar, Agrefresh and NRG Systems, to name a few. 
   This is a timely bill. It invests in our energy independence and makes a down payment on the necessary progress to address climate change in our energy future. This Congress is committed to taking our country in a new direction, working in a bipartisan manner and in a fiscally responsible way. We're committed to making this an energy-independent country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. FRANK and the gentlewoman from California, Ms. WATERS, for their hard work in preparing H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. I have received positive feedback from the Regional Planning Commissioners and emergency managers in support of this bill. The Planning Commissioners and emergency managers serve on the front-line of declared disasters and work with both towns and FEMA. In fact, Vermont has recently dealt with several significant flooding events and this legislation will go a long I way to improving our response in the aftermath. This bill also provides much needed reform of the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP. 
   I also want to thank the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. BLUMENAUER, for his thoughtful amendment and working with me and Representative GILCHREST as co-sponsors. This bi-partisan amendment requires FEMA to consider modern climate science when mapping floodplains. Current flood maps do not take into account critical information beyond past flooding history. Accurate floodplain maps incorporating scientific global warming impact predictions will ensure that citizens are aware of the future flood risks in their communities and help prevent the loss of human life, property, and important wildlife habitat. Communities will be able to use these maps in considering their own land use planning and development projects. 
   I believe that the focus on global warming adaptation planning is critical while Congress also moves forward to aggressively address climate change through legislation. Adaptation includes addressing the occurrence and likelihood of more frequent, intense, and severe storms bringing our rivers and streams beyond flood stage; sea-level rise flooding coastal and tidal communities that may even be hundreds of miles inland; reduced snow-pack that is changing annual runoff and water collection; and of course the impact of hurricanes; all of which are resulting in significantly greater flooding across the nation. 
   Vermont communities like Barre or, our capitol of Montpelier are finding that surrounding rivers and streams are more unpredictable--large rain events have resulted in dramatic river and stream bank erosion that promotes flooding in nearby towns. Rivers and streams are overflowing in areas that were not typically flooded. We are finding flooding events both in and out of current flood plains where people have lost property due to sudden and unexpected river and stream rise. Many of these families are low-income and their homeowners insurance, if they have it, does not cover their claims. And of course, they don't qualify for SBA disaster assistance loans. 
   We believe that changing weather patterns require the tools for smart land use and development decision-making. Updated climate science flood mapping will help all citizens make informed decisions on flood risks and the need to purchase flood insurance. Updated flood maps will also aid communities in smart growth planning to minimize the risk of flooding to their cities and towns. 
   This amendment has received strong support by the National Wildlife Federation, U.S. Public Interest Group, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resource Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, Audubon, Earthjustice, American Rivers, Republicans for Environmental Protection, and the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Washington, Mr. INSLEE, for his two very thoughtful amendments to H.R. 3567, the Small Business Investment Expansion Act and for allowing me to cosponsor them. 
   The first amendment will help small businesses increase their energy efficiency and implement sustainable practices. The second amendment would direct the Small Business Administration, SBA, to reward small businesses that are reducing their carbon footprint. 
   Earlier this year, I offered an amendment, which the House passed, to set a 5 percent procurement goal for the Federal Government to contract with green small businesses. 
   It is critical that small businesses be encouraged to operate and to develop and supply products and services in an environmentally sound way. 
   Many small businesses are already incorporating sustainable practices into their own business, such as conserving energy and water, using sustainable products, or minimizing generation of waste and the release of pollutants. They strive to make products from recycled materials. They use energy from renewable resources such as bio-fuels, solar and wind power. Or they transport goods and services in alternate fuel vehicles. 
   We all have a responsibility to protect our environment. As populations expand and lifestyles change, we must keep the planet in good condition so that future generations will have the same natural resources that we have and enjoy now. The Earth faces many threats ranging from pollution to acid rain to global warming to the destruction of rainforests and other wild habitats to the decline and extinction of thousands of species of animals and plants. Combating these threats is essential to ensuring that future generations can live healthy lives. 
   Our small businesses embrace our Nation's entrepreneurial spirit. The Federal Government can and should serve as a model to the private sector and the rest of the world. As a Congress, we should reward businesses that are striving to be environmentally responsible. 
   Both of these amendments would greatly improve the bill before us and I ask that they be adopted by the House.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. On June 26, 2007, a storm system lasting several days was responsible for bringing heavy and torrential rainfall to eastern Kansas. The affected communities received up to 21 inches of rain within a 4-day period, resulting in devastating floods throughout the region. 
   The flooding forced at least 20 counties to evacuate and led to the destruction of more than 3,100 homes and businesses. It caused a petroleum refinery tank system to overflow into the Verdigris River, releasing an estimated 71,000 gallons of crude oil into the Coffeyville community and surrounding area. 
   This resolution expresses heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the devastating thunderstorms that caused flooding in eastern Kansas.

But whatever I say is not worth listening to when we have another member of the New York delegation, remarkable in his own right, who actually knows Mr. Sutton and I expect is going to share some of his good qualities and be somewhat silent on anything else that may not be appropriate stories about the interactions of these two terrific men. 
   So I am going to reserve my time, and when the appropriate moment comes, allow the distinguished Member from New York to speak on behalf of the merits of Mr. Sutton, where he will be forever commemorated by having his name on a post office in the great city of New York.

   Percy Sutton was the embodiment of the American Dream, and he did it as a man who grew up with the kind of prejudice that the chairman just alluded to. It is just an honor, I think, for all of us to have the kind of inspiration that a person like Percy Sutton has provided to our country, service in the military, and really the most decorated service unit in the whole war and accomplishing that against enormous obstacles. People didn't want them to serve, yet they did, and they had confidence in us and our country despite the fact many in our country did not have confidence or even respect for them. 
   Then his array of accomplishments in politics, as a civic leader, a commitment to this community. Harlem, which the chairman called a village, at many other times had really tough times, and this man had confidence that this community and the people in it had as much a future as any other American. He then acted with the skills that he possessed, the energy that he had, and made Harlem into what is now, a very vital community in the City of New York. 
   So the Committee on Government Operations, with support from both sides of the aisle, is very proud to be bringing to the House for its full consideration the naming of this post office in honor of a great American.

   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 165, which supports the goals and ideals of National Teen Driver Safety Week. 
   This resolution, which has 55 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Charles Dent on June 6, 2007. The resolution was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 19, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   Madam Speaker, road crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. These crashes are more common among young drivers than among any other age group, with one in four crash fatalities in the United States involving young people from the ages of 16 to 24. 
   The first 6 months after a teenager receives his or her license, he or she is especially at high risk of being in a car accident. Unfortunately, this risk stays relatively high until the young driver reaches 25. 
   In an effort to improve road safety and reduce crashes among young people, the Center for Injury Research and Prevention at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the State Farm Insurance Company codeveloped a multiyear teen center research initiative to help young drivers develop safe, smart driving behaviors and skills. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague Mr. Dent from Pennsylvania for seeking to support the goals and ideals of National Teen Driver Safety Week, and I urge the swift passage of this bill.

   As America knows, Mr. Glenn, Senator Glenn, is a pioneering astronaut, pilot, former United States Senator, and a true hero with a distinguished and impressive career in service to our Nation. He was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio. He entered the Naval Aviation Cadet Program in March 1942 and commissioned in the Marines Corps in 1943. 
   After completing advanced training, he joined the Marine Fighter Squadron 155 and spent a year flying F-4U fighters in the Marshall Islands. 
   During World War II, he flew 59 combat missions. After the war, he was a member of the Marine Fighter Squadron 218 on the North China patrol and  served in Guam. From June 1948 to December 1950, Mr. Glenn taught advanced flight training in Texas. He volunteered for the Korean War, flying 63 missions and shooting down three enemy aircraft. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and several other medals. 
   He has many other accomplishments that I believe we will hear about from Representative Space when he has an opportunity to speak, but he is a person widely known to Americans, Republicans, Democrats, independents, people who are active politically, those who aren't, people who revere public service in the military and in politics as one of the most extraordinary Americans of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN EAGLE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Guam. 
   It's probably appropriate that we're here saluting the American eagle because if there is anything that the American eagle represents, it's the spirit of American independence, American self-reliance, American strength. 
   In the debate we're having today about the resolution honoring the American eagle, I don't want to say the energy debate has hijacked it because in many ways, it's quite relevant. The fundamental question that this country must decide is whether we will pursue a path of energy independence or continue to go hat-in-hand to the oil-exporting countries to try to solve our problems. 
   Some of you may remember, which for me was the most vivid representation of the American energy policy, and that was a picture on the front page of the New York Times a couple of years ago, when the President of the United States went to Saudi Arabia, and hand-in-hand, as is the custom in many of the Middle East countries, President Bush and the Saudi prince walked in to have a private conversation about America's oil future. And what was going on there was not the spirit of American independence represented by the eagle. It was a spirit of capitulation where our President was imploring a foreign country to solve the problems that we face. 
   A confident country, an energetic country solves its own problems. It doesn't look to others to help solve those problems. It takes on the challenge. Energy is a big challenge. It takes on the challenge of solving those problems on its own. 
   And that's the question that this Congress faces: Will we have the self-confidence of a vigorous and strong Nation to chart a course of energy independence?     
   Now we're hearing arguments that the problem we face can be solved by drilling our way out of it, and of course, that's an argument that has been pursued vigorously since we discovered oil. But you know, there's enormous evidence that allows us to take a look at this proposition. Will more permits to drill, will more drilling reduce the cost of oil? 
   And I have here, Mr. Speaker, a chart. The first chart shows the number of wells. The number in red here, we've got the number of leases, and in this blue, we have the number of wells. Starting in 1994, there's been a steady increase of the number of leases and a steady increase in the wells drilled. And step by step by step, as leases and as drilling has increased, so has the price of a gallon of gas, from $1 up to about $4 a gallon today. 
   So reasonable people would step back and ponder the question, whether more drilling and more leases results in lower prices. History shows us, in nearly the past 20 years, that is simply not the case. 
   The other proposition is that the problem is the Federal Government is denying leases to the oil companies so that they can't do drilling, and the evidence is overwhelming that's simply not the case. 
   This chart, the second chart, shows on a pie chart, the whole circle there is the land that is available for leasing. And the green is all that's available, and the red here, or orange, is all that is open for leasing. Pardon me, I have it the opposite way around. 
   But of all of the land open and available for leasing, 79 percent is open and subject to exploitation and exploration by our oil companies. Only 21 percent is off limits. Yet, of this land where the oil companies have leases, 68 million acres where they can put metal to the ground is not under production, and there's no effort to put it under production. 
   My friends on the other side have argued that the oil companies have to go through certain environmental permits. I'm not sure you're right about that because much of that work has been done. Assuming that is the case, that's no different than what has been the requirement for the production of oil on federally-owned lands. 
   You know, there are many people who are asking the question as to whether the fix is in for the oil companies, and there's overwhelming evidence, in fact, that it is. Number one, the amount of speculation that now is core to the energy future trading markets is inflating the price at the pump, inflating the price of home heating fuel. How did that happen? Thanks to Congress. 
   In 2002, under the Tom DeLay Congress, the Enron loophole was passed at the request of that great company, Enron, that did so much for America's energy situation. Enron passed a loophole that took away any kind of regulatory oversight of the energy future trading market, and it led directly and immediately to an explosion in speculation. Hedge funds, private investors, folks who saw that they could make a lot of money on the misery of a lot of people rushed into the speculation in the oil energy markets. Now, that's wrong. There should be no speculative premium that comes at the expense of American consumers, folks trying to heat their home, small businesses trying to run a business. 
   This Congress has had an opportunity to get rid of that Enron loophole. House Democrats have passed legislation. It hasn't gotten through because of opposition on the other side, either  in the Senate or the consistent opposition of the President of the United States. 
   So what can we do if you want to be independent? One, we can get rid of the Enron loophole, wholly and completely. The second thing is that the energy companies, in fact, are hording leases, and that's a fact. There's an enormous push on this Congress to open up ANWR, and the argument is made and it has a surface appeal that if you open up ANWR, then it is going to mean a reduction in prices because the supply will go up and demand will go down. 
   A couple of problems with it. First and foremost, the oil companies have leases on 68 million acres. They're not exploiting them. Why? We don't know exactly why because they won't say. They will come in, raise their hand, take an oath, acknowledge that they're paying their executives 10s of millions of dollars, acknowledging that when one executive was retiring he was given a $400 million payday to say good-bye, but they won't tell us why they're not putting drill bits to earth to exploit the leases they have. 
   But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what the motive may be. If they keep that lease and the oil or the natural gas sits in the ground and it goes from $28 to $48 to $68 to $134 a barrel, that's sound money for those companies, and it will fatten the already extraordinary profits, $125 billion in profits for the oil companies last year, the big five oil companies. 
   Second, oil companies push hard to bring online as much Federal land for leases as possible because the Big Oil companies have been extremely successful in crowding out some of our small, independent producers, and in fact, my view is that's a detriment and a reason why this 68 million acres aren't exploited. If you had smaller, more independent, hungry, energetic companies that had an opportunity to make good money at $134 a barrel, and they owned those leases, they'd be drilling. 
   So what you have is a situation where the oil companies are doing quite fine, they really are, and the status quo serves them very well. What may not serve them so well is the self-confident Congress, the self-confident President saying, you know what, we're not going to play that game anymore. There are other ways. 
   We're going to take away the tax breaks, about $13 billion that American taxpayers are turning over to our oil companies, and that, with all due respect, is just an astonishing public policy. Our folks are paying over $4 a gallon for gas. In my home State of Vermont, we're paying over $4.25, $4.40 for a gallon of home heating fuel, and taxpayers are paying the oil companies about $13 billion in tax breaks. That's your money and mine. It's hard to see how that's justified, but the oil companies are quite happy to take that taxpayer subsidy. 
   But what they won't like is what the House is pushing, and that's a policy of energy independence, where we take those tax breaks, we steer them, as America has frequently done when there's something important for the American people, and it's taken a push from our taxpayers to get us over that initial technological hump, and that's having those tax breaks go as incentives to alternative energy sources, wind and solar, biofuels. 
   You know, if we could step back a minute and take a look at some of our friends in Europe and the leadership they're taking because of self-interest, a recognition in Portugal that investing in alternative fuel is a way to strengthen the economy, or Germany, investing in solar, Germany has less sun than Vermont. And let me tell you, I'm here to tell you that Vermont doesn't have as much sun as we need and I want. They have less sun than we do, but they are leading in solar technology. 
   So, the bottom line question is really very simple. Do we want leadership, as best exemplified by President Bush when he was with the Saudi prince, imploring the Saudi prince to rescue us from ourselves, or do we want leadership where we say we will take care of our own future, that particularly in face of what I think are unfounded arguments, that we can drill our way out, that Congress or the American government is an impediment to drilling that is available immediately for our oil and natural gas companies, and that there isn't supply that we can achieve through efficiency and alternative energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PRICE OF GASOLINE -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Perlmutter. The gas issue, obviously the price going way up is hitting people pretty hard. But it is a real metaphor in my view for the two economies we are seeing emerge in this country. We are at a time now where the stock market has never been higher. People who have significant assets have never been doing better. Large corporations are making record profits. Executives, CEOs at large corporations, have never gotten better and sweeter pay packages. 
   But the vast majority of Americans are finding that their wages are stagnant, and the prices of things that they need, daycare, gasoline to get to and from work, to and from daycare, groceries, those things are going up and concealing this so-called ``tame'' inflation. 
   So what we are having in this country is the emergence of two economies, and our goal here in Congress is to start having a Congress that stands up and represents the needs and aspirations of average folks. We give them a leg up. 
   Every time the price of gasoline goes up about 10 cents, that is like a $16 billion hit on the consumer in this country. So you think about it. We have got a chart over here that shows gas prices going up, really doubling during the presidency of George Bush. But just  take a $1 increase in the price of gasoline, that is like $160 billion tax increase that all comes out of the pockets of working Americans, the people who can afford it the least. 
   You look back at the last couple of years, what has happened when we have been talking about the oil industry are a couple of things. Number one, there has been very favorable legislation that has benefited the oil companies. At a time when the oil companies had record profits, $125 billion over 3 years, $125 billion over 3 years, at that time not our Congress, but the Congress that preceded us, the Republican Congress, gave tax breaks to the oil companies. The mature and very profitable industry got $13 billion out of taxpayer funds on top of the record profits they had received. 
   What we have done here is try to change the rules of the game and say that there has got to be a cop on the beat. It doesn't make sense for the prices to be going up on gasoline when we have seen the price of a barrel of oil go down and we haven't seen an increase in the demand, so that the laws of supply and demand are really being thwarted by the oligopolistic power of the very few oil companies that are able to manage the price and inflate their profits. 
   What we are doing is first taking back those tax breaks that went to big oil. We did that earlier on this year, hoping our friends on the Senate side join us. But, secondly, we are saying that the Federal Trade Commission should be active and aggressive in answering these questions on behalf of the American consumer. 
   Every 10 cents, $16 billion, that is a tax increase right out of the pockets of working Americans. Our responsibility to the American people is to make sure that consumers are protected so they are not getting ripped off. It is that simple. They need to keep that money in their pocket and not just be subject to the abuse of the monopoly power really of big oil. 
   So, that is a little perspective from Vermont. I will turn it over to my colleague from Connecticut, Representative Murphy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. First of all, Mr. Perlmutter is right, oil has made us vulnerable in foreign policy. A big reason we are in Iraq clearly is related to oil. I think we have to be much straighter with the American people than Congress has been. 
   We are doing two things here. One, with this legislation, the price gouging legislation, we are providing basic protection against rip-offs, and that is just the fundamental responsibility that people's government has is to make sure that the people with a lot of money, corporate power, don't use that power to rip them off. That is one. 
   Second, we have to develop an energy policy. An energy policy, as has been said, is going to give us a lot more freedom in foreign policy, not create these enormous pressures to get involved in wars that we shouldn't be involved in. 
   Secondly, it is obviously good for the environment. 
   Third, as the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) has been saying, it is good for the economy. The legislation we have to pass is not just on protecting the consumer, it is about creating a projobs, pro-high-tech, progrowth approach to addressing in a straightforward, confident way the energy challenge that we face. 
   One of the small bills that I have sponsored and you are a cosponsor of, Mr. Perlmutter, and I am soliciting more, is to make our offices carbon neutral here in Washington. When I got here, I was concerned about global warming. I checked into how much carbon pollution did I create just by turning my lights on here in Washington and Vermont, flying back and forth to my district, and then driving around. It is quite staggering: 754 tons. That is a lot just to show up for work. 
   I tried to find out how to offset that. Change the light bulbs, turn the thermometer so you don't use as much air conditioning or heat, and then invest in renewable energy that would allow a farm in southern Vermont to do a digester, a methane digester, which adds to the bottom line of farms, and all of our farms are struggling to make ends meet. We have to keep our farms in production and have local production of agriculture for the ag economy, but also for a way of life that a lot of folks in Vermont and Iowa want to maintain.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Right. What you are describing is the fact that you are going to produce your energy locally, so you are not going to have to go to the Middle East and ship it all of the way back here. The money you spend on energy are going to be dollars that stay in Colorado or Iowa. Every dollar you keep in your local economy gets circulated and multiplied. That is what creates jobs. We have to break the stranglehold of our addiction to oil. It is all about building a local economy.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I agree with you. It is very exciting and an incredible privilege for all of us to be here. And there aren't free meals and there aren't free trips and all of the things that have been abused in the past, and that cuts across Republicans and Democrats, and it's all so that we can try to do a good job and give confidence to the American people. 
   But the challenge we have is giving us confidence, giving this Nation confidence that the Congress actually has as its first priorities the needs of the American families, not the needs of the corporations that are doing really well, which is not to say get in their way because we've got to have jobs and corporations do good things and create wealth, but we have to have a commitment to building a middle class.  
   What's always been the great hallmark of American democracy has been we've had an economic agenda that has said to people, who are willing to work, that they could climb the ladder of opportunity, and we pursued policies that gave them the chance to do it. Affordable and accessible education, affordable and accessible health care, nondiscrimination, the big fight that this country had for years that ultimately we've made enormous progress on. So people, regardless of the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, their religion, they have something to offer and they want to work, they're going to have a chance to get ahead. 
   Much of what we're trying to do on ethics, I agree with you. We served in the State legislatures. We had sunshine laws. We didn't have lobbyists buying things. It's all an alien situation that has been described here in D.C., but we're trying to bring the Iowa values and Vermont values, Florida, Colorado, here to D.C., and we've got to hang on to that. But it's all in service of trying to get the job done so that we have an economic agenda that helps average people.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the openness of that committee, to let anyone with a good idea to help veterans to come in and have an opportunity to do that. Mr. Filner, Mr. Michaud, and, of course, Mr. Buyer and Mr. Miller, thank you. 
   Rural Americans have always served the Nation's armed services, National Guard and Reserves in very great numbers. In fact, though only 19 percent of the Nation lives in rural America, 44 percent of the current U.S. military recruits come from rural areas, and nearly one-third of those who died in Iraq are from small towns and communities across the Nation, Vermont very much among them. 
   And unfortunately, access to health care for many of our veterans in rural areas is limited by mileage, distance and just the difficulty of transportation. Especially true, the provision of mental health care in rural settings has historically been a challenge for all health care systems and providers, including the VA. And therefore, what we recognize in this legislation is that we need to help the VA develop innovative solutions to address the need for mental health services in remote areas, TBI being the big injury that's been discussed by my colleagues. 
   This legislation takes a significant step towards improving the mental health services available to geographically isolated veterans. It creates a pilot program where at least two mobile vet centers will provide readjustment counseling and mental health services to veterans in at least five Veterans Integrated Service Networks that have the highest concentration of rural veterans.     
   One of these covers New England and my home State of Vermont. These mobile vet centers will also provide information and outreach concerning veterans benefits and, when practicable, assistance with claims for benefits. 
   Rural individuals and their families have strong bonds and ties to their communities. These mobile vet centers will allow veterans to stay in their communities and prevent endless hours of car rides for the care they receive. 
   I urge support and passage of this legislation and thank the committee for its indulgence.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The question of earmarks really has two questions to it. But, first, why are we here having a debate about earmarks? We are because in the 12 years before the last election, the use of earmarks, something that has been around since the beginning of the Republic, exploded and it went from around $5 billion in the budget to around $13 billion in the budget. And it really raises two questions, aside from the political opportunism that may present itself in this debate. 
   The first question about earmarks is whether it is appropriate for individuals who have the most power in this Congress to take advantage of their situation to get appropriations that go to their districts. Generally, the projects that are funded are projects that are supported and worthwhile. But, in fact, in the budgetary process, it is the people who are in the right committees or have the most power that have the opportunity to get the greatest benefit.     
   By the way, that is a fairness issue just within this body, because if there is going to be allocation of resources, they should be extended for the benefit of the entire country, people in each and every one of the 435 congressional districts, people in each of the 50 States and our territories. 
   The second issue is a budgetary reform issue. If you have appropriation by earmarks, if highway projects are funded on the basis of who is on the committee or who is in leadership or who has the ear of the Chair, then it means that decisions are being made on personal relationships as opposed to public need. 
   I come from a State legislature, Mr. Chairman, where we had to wrestle with this question of earmarks. And every legislator had an immense amount of pressure on them to deliver for their district; in fact, the needs of the district were compelling and reasonable. We had to struggle with an approach that would take the limited funds that were available in our treasury and allocate them for highway projects on the basis of where the greatest need was in the State, not on the basis of who had the most clout. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this debate that has resulted in eight motions to rise, spending over 10 hours on what essentially looks like a minor and very political amendment is really not about earmarks, because there has been a complete erasing of history in the role that the other side has played in getting us to the point where we are on earmarks. 
   Also, this debate on earmarks is taking place in the Homeland Security bill, which is a bill that traditionally has not had earmarks. We could be having a debate about the MILC price support program and arguing about earmarks, but there are no earmarks that have been part of the Homeland Security bill in this Congress or, to its credit, in prior Congresses. 
   So, why is it that we are arguing about, admittedly an important issue, the question of earmarks and what impact it has on questions of fairness and what impact it has on questions of fiscal responsibility in the Homeland Security bill, that has independent integrity and importance to the people of this country, and where the history has been that there are no earmarks? 
   It would allow a reasonable observer to conclude that essentially this is about politics. In fact, it is my view and, I think, the view of most people that we really should not be injecting politics into the question of homeland security. 
   Mr. Chairman, you come from the City of New York. You, better than anyone else, know the urgency of making certain that we have our borders protected, that we are taking aggressive and effective measures to combat terrorism, to detect terrorists coming into our country, to have adequate funds and resources for our local fire departments and our local police stations. So, Mr. Chairman, the loser here is one person, it is the American people. And who wins and who loses in this political debate, whether it's the other side or our side, we will let the commentators decide. 
   We are making no progress on moving ahead on an earmark reform approach, largely because the vehicle  that the other side has chosen to use is holding hostage a Homeland Security bill that doesn't have earmarks in it, won't have earmarks in it, in the past has not had earmarks in it. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Weiner). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) to the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 781 provides for consideration of H.R. 3920, the Trade Globalization and Assistance Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled  by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. Finally, the rule makes in order a substitute amendment to be offered by Representative McCrery of Louisiana, or his designee. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by saying what we all know. Trade can be a very good thing for the economy of this country, and this Congress and this Member of Congress is committed to examining any trade agreement that is brought before this House in two ways: one, whether the terms and provisions will improve the economy of this country; and two, whether there is a capacity to share the benefits that that trade agreement will bring to this economy, across all sectors of it. 
   And what we have to acknowledge on trade agreements, and really is the underpinning of this legislation brought before the House, is that there is significant dislocation that can occur with trade. There can be winners and there can be losers, and in the adjustment to some of the consequences that have adverse impact on many of our workers across this country, we must have a substantial and vigorous and effective assistance program to help workers who are hurt regain jobs, regain employment, improve their incomes and be part of this economy and be part of the benefits, not just the downside of trade. 
   I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman Miller, Congressman Levin and Congressman Smith for their diligence in putting together a very strong adjustment assistance package that we will vote for later today. Among many others, they have been working on this bill for nearly a decade. 
   Trade adjustment assistance hadn't been started in this country until 1962; even though trade has been a very difficult political issue for this country from its inception, where there were debates about tariffs. And in our days of our history, tariffs were used basically to protect our industries and allow them to get a foothold. And then trade barriers were gradually reduced, and what we're seeing as that happens is an increase in gross domestic product and wealth, but we're also seeing an increase in dislocation among many workers, and some of that is concentrated in many of the old industrial sectors of our country. 
   This legislation recognizes that impact and is attempting to substantially increase our ability to address the dislocation. That underpinning is essential for the consideration of any future trade packages that will be brought before this House. 
   The update is long overdue. H.R. 3920 expands trade assistance to the service sector. That was denied under the previous adjustment assistance legislation, even as more and more of our economy has become service-related and even as service sector jobs are being off-shored. So this change in trade adjustment assistance is long overdue and very necessary. 
   Too often workers are not provided with the training that they need under current training assistance bill. This bill doubles the current training fund cap to $440 million. Beyond expanding coverage to more workers, this TAA improves their training opportunities, as well as the all-important health care benefits. 
   Many of the folks who have been adversely affected by trade have come from older industries with strong unions where they had substantial and very important health care benefits. This trade adjustment assistance extends them. 
   It also creates new benefits for industries in communities that have been hardest hit by creating 24 manufacturing redevelopment zones to encourage the redevelopment of communities that have been hit the hardest by manufacturing decline. 
   What this legislation starts to understand is that one of the responses that we must have strategically to the acceleration of globalization is the intensification of localization. Our economies that have been hardest hit have to rebuild in part from the bottom up using the resources that we have in those communities, keeping dollars in those communities that can be reinvested and then create jobs and wealth in those communities. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the things that has been happening over the past generation is a widening gap between the highest and lowest paid among us. According to a 2006 survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal, the case right now is that the average CEO in the United States earns 262 times the pay of the average worker. It means that the CEO earned more in one work day than an average worker earned in the entire year. 
   And we have to look at this discrepancy because one of the actual facts that has to be recognized, whatever your position on trade, is that there has been this widening gap, and historically, this country has always been its best when we've had economic policies that have shared the wealth that is generated by people working hard in this country. 
   H.R. 3920 is an important bill for our economic stability and workforce growth. It's also a bill about fairness. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from California, my good friend and colleague on the Rules Committee, for his kind words and his usual vigorous argument for the point of view represented on his side. 
   A couple of things. One, this is a good opportunity for the House to have a full and fair debate on the substance of this legislation and on the substitute. We will have that debate, we will have the vote, and we'll see which side prevails. So I am delighted that all Members of the House are going to have a full and fair opportunity to make their case. 
   Second, before we get to the specific details on what is contained in this trade adjustment assistance, there is really a bottom line that has to be acknowledged and it's this: that the road to prosperity has to be built on a foundation of fairness. What has happened in this country, despite the economic growth of 3.9 percent most recently, the highest gross domestic product in the history of the world, over $13 trillion, is that average, everyday working people are falling farther behind. 
   We have had the greatest disparity in wealth in this country since the 1920s, and there is a fundamental question that we have to answer, and it's this: Are we going to include all Americans in the benefits of a rising economy, or are we going to pursue policies that allow for the intensification of that widening gap between the very wealthy and everyone else? 
   Our party has made a commitment to the basic proposition of democratic fairness that requires everyone to have an opportunity to participate in the benefits of a rising and strengthening economy. And that hasn't happened. But what we have done with the legislation we have brought before this House is essentially tried to build that foundation of fairness and provide a new direction on our economic agenda, one that includes all Americans. 
   Let me just give, Madam Speaker, a few examples. We raised the minimum wage, something that hadn't been done in over 10 years. We had people working harder, making less, many of them paying more in taxes because of the Social Security payroll tax increases than at any time in history. In the average families, they found themselves working two and three jobs in an effort to pay the light bill, in an effort to pay the fuel bill, losing health care. 
   We increased access to college education by taking a free ride away from the international banks that were literally getting a taxpayer guarantee in subsidized profits and gave that benefit to students so that their student loans were cut in half in the interest rate, from 6.8 to 3.4. We passed the child health care, which extends benefits to working families, basically, to 10 million children throughout this country, something our kids need.     
   And these are oftentimes the children of the working poor. These are folks working hard. They would rather not have to have any help, but they can't afford health care. We passed prescription drug price negotiation. Instead of giving away guaranteed legislated profits to the drug companies, we, in the House, it's languishing in the other body, required price negotiation so that we can get the benefit of lower prices that we're entitled to because of bulk purchasing. 
   We passed many provisions that are going to strengthen our small businesses across this country because we know the small business is a job creator. And we stood up to an administration, at a time when our veterans and our soldiers are doing more for this country than in recent memory, by passing the highest increase in the budget for veterans in the history of the Veterans Administration. 
   The bottom line here is that this Congress, this leadership has made a commitment to a new direction. And the new direction is the old-time values of making certain that workers, average families, and communities that are fully engaged as American citizens participate in the benefits of our economy. 
   Trade adjustment assistance is one more brick in that foundation of fairness. We can't have trade agreements  that are tilted so that the benefits are not shared and the burdens of dislocation are not shared. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you. I really think that everything that the gentleman from Tennessee said is right. 
   The question that I ask myself at times is how is it, if we have been doing a good job and accomplishing the things that you recited, so many of the American people think we are not doing much at all, or we are doing a bad job? That is a sentiment that a lot of folks have. It's in conflict, in my view, with many of the concrete things that we have done here in the House. 
   I will tell you what I think it is. Back in Vermont, people are asking me, when are we going to the stop the war, and when are we going to change the priorities of this country so that we are standing up for the needs of average, middle-income families and not just the wealthy, not just corporations who can get legislation passed. 
   They are also asking the question that Mr. Yarmuth has presented in very stark form, when are we going to reassert our own constitutional authority and be willing to stand up to the President? I am hearing from people in my State, really good people, real Democrats, real Republicans, and they are saying even when Congress is right, it seems that they are not willing to stand up to the President. 
   I think some of the frustration is that on the war there has been no change by the President, despite the efforts of many of us in Congress, and that's a fact. 
   Number two, there has been some sense that even when we are right here in Congress, we are not willing to hold our ground. 
   I want to address both of those. 
   First of all, on the war, the bottom line reality is that the President of the United States has an immense amount of power. We have article I power, but he has executive power. Despite the fact that the people of this country voted across the country from Vermont to Ohio to Pennsylvania to California and chose a new Congress, and a clear message of that election and decision by the people was that we wanted a new direction in Iraq, the President ignored that election. 
   He then ignored that March vote of the House of Representatives where we put a date certain on ending the war, August of 2008. Think about where we would be and what kind of optimism we would have in this country if that legislation was signed by the President instead of vetoed. 
   Then the President, of course, dismissed the advice of retired generals who are critical of the war, and, of course, paid no attention whatsoever to the Iraq Study Commission. I have come to the conclusion that the President is not at all going to bend, no matter what, and we have to be willing to fight that battle with him day in and day out. 
   Second, on the priorities, there is good news. I mean, this House, oftentimes with a bipartisan vote, has shifted the priorities to middle-class needs. The minimum wage was raised. The student loan cost of interest was cut in half. Prescription drugs are going to be negotiated, price negotiations so we can lower the cost, make it more accessible to seniors, less costly to taxpayers. 
   All of this we did by returning to pay-as-you-go principles, so we are not going to bankrupt future generations. The largest increase in the veterans budget in the history of the country. 
   All of that is important. It reflects that we are actually walking the walk of trying to change priorities. It's not getting out into the public either because it can't get through the Senate or it gets vetoed by the President. 
   We are going to be talking, I guess, a little bit about children's health care. But that's an example where it was the right thing we did to insure 10 million kids in this country. The President vetoed it. We made some minor adjustments, not nickel and diming about which kids we take off of health care, passed it again, and we will be sending it back to the President. I think that's the type of thing that we need to do.  
   But I also do believe that any time this Congress has an opportunity to hold its ground and essentially embrace and accept the responsibility that the Constitution gives this Congress under article I, we have to do it, whether it's on war funding, when we believe we are right, we have to be able to weather the storm; whether it's on budgets that are going to get vetoed when those budgets reflect the bipartisan consensus in this body that they meet the needs of average people, and that they comply with our obligation to pay our bill as we go. 
   There is good news, but we also have to acknowledge that there is much more fighting to be done, and that it's time for us in the right circumstances to hold our ground, to be willing to weather the storm of criticism that will come from the White House machine and to stand up for that change and direction that I believe the people of this country voted for in November. 
   I thank the gentleman from Florida.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this open rule providing for consideration of H.R. 2638, which makes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, in November the American people asked for a change. They wanted us to do two things: one, change priorities; two, restore accountability to this government. 
   We began with a down payment by raising the minimum wage; ending the big subsidies for oil companies, instead putting money into renewable energy; requiring pharmaceutical price negotiation instead of giveaways; making college more affordable by lowering interest rates; and we supported small businesses. These were the beginning. 
   Today, we take up the first of 12 appropriation bills, and in each of these bills we must do what we promised the American people we would do; change priorities and restore accountability. 
   This bill on homeland security, brought before us on a bipartisan basis, does both. It funds the Department of Homeland Security. It was created largely in response to the tragedy of 9/11. Since its inception, the Department has been given a crucial mission, and that is protecting American soil and American lives, enhancing our overall security. They have a big job, and it is no small undertaking. 
   This Homeland Security bill addresses priorities and reflects our change, and it reflects accountability, our responsibility to taxpayers. 
   The priorities that I would like to speak to that are embedded in this homeland security bill are among the following: 
   One, it establishes as a key priority funding our first responders with the training and the equipment that they need. Each one of us knows that the first responders are the ones who are going to be there, and in each of our districts they need the training, they need the funding. This Homeland Security bill has rejected a $1 billion cut that was proposed by the administration and restores Homeland Security grants in Firefighter Assistance grants. 
   Second, it implements a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission by providing improved aviation security. This bill substantially increases efforts to purchase and install the latest explosive detection systems for checked baggage and other things that have been mentioned by the speakers. 
   Also, Mr. Price and Mr. Rogers both spoke about the need for accountability. The good intentions of protecting the homeland does not give this bill a pass when it comes to accountability. The bill mandates that all grants and contact funds be awarded through full competitive processes. 
   Finally, I want to thank Chairwoman Slaughter for leading to a sensible approach on the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. Thank you, Chairwoman Slaughter.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (VERMONTERS SPEAK OUT -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I rise to report on an effort in Vermont that honors the tradition of Vermonters speaking out on issues of conscience. Vermonters take public service, political integrity and citizen involvement extremely seriously. This is a tradition that dates back to our earliest days when Vermont became the very first State to ban slavery. 
   But with rising alarm, Vermont has watched abuse of power and a disregard for checks and balances in Washington that has occurred over the past 6 years.     
   Vermonters have such extraordinary concern, particularly with the prosecution of this war in Iraq, that many are now actually calling for the President and the Vice President to be impeached. 
   Impeachment is a dramatic position, but it reflects the collective judgment of many in Vermont that we are in extreme circumstances. Madam Speaker, I do not believe that impeachment is the answer, but I endorse the indictment of the policies of the current administration. 
   What this Nation has experienced over the past 6 years has been staggering: a war in its fifth year that was justified based on false intelligence; the politicization of our Nation's top  law enforcement agency; the cavalier disregard for civil liberties and constitutional protections; no-bid war contracts to well-connected friends; the use of signing statements to disregard the law; and the denial of habeas corpus, a basic right, for those in U.S. custody. 
   The list could go on. These and other transgressions have caused some Vermonters to rise up and promote the use of impeachment to restore accountability and curb the abuse of power. This impeachment movement in Vermont started last year in the small town of Newfane, population 1,700, by Dan DeWalt, a selectman on the town board. 
   After voting for the town clerk, the tax collector and voting whether to fund a village sidewalk project and the local school, the town then voted on a resolution to send a message to Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings. This initiative then spread from one small southern Vermont town to 40 towns across the State. 
   My own hometown of Hartland joined this call, and I've spoken with many of my neighbors, farmer, teachers, doctors and store owners, about their vote, and what they share is an outrage about the conduct of this administration and the prosecution of this terrible war. 
   Even last month, the Vermont General Assembly took up the issue. On April 20, the Vermont State Senate voted 16-9 in favor of Congress launching impeachment investigations, and while the Vermont House of Representatives defeated the resolution, it still received 60 supportive votes from Vermont legislators. And nearly 400 Vermonters representing 102 of Vermont's 251 towns came to the State House that day to voice their views. And this past Saturday, I held a town meeting in the town of Hartford, Vermont, and heard from 250 Vermonters advocating for this extraordinary measure. 
   I applaud these citizen activists who have acted in the Vermont tradition of speaking out and taking a principled stand to protect our democracy. They raise valid concerns about the actions of this administration and, if those actions are allowed to go unchecked, the threat to democracy that we face. Their concerns are well-founded. 
   But let me be clear, opinion is divided in Vermont about whether impeachment is the right remedy and whether it's the right tactic, but what motivated this effort is a commonly shared view that this administration has grossly abused its power and pursued terribly misguided policies. 
   Madam Speaker, while I disagree with the tactic of impeachment, I completely share the goal of restoring accountability and a new direction to our government. 
   Our oversight investigations in Congress have exposed egregiously substandard care at Walter Reed where we have heard about soldiers still recovering from brain surgery forced to wander the grounds to find the outpatient care they were promised. 
   Congressional oversight has documented unacceptable accounts of political interference by the administration over sound global warming science, with political appointees editing scientific reports. 
   And our probes have uncovered waste and fraud and abuse associated with the war in Iraq to an unimaginable scale, $12 billion of $100 bills flown from the United States to Iraq and then distributed from the back of pickup trucks. 
   And through our oversight and subpoenas, we are vigorously seeking to expose and investigate the peddling of faulty intelligence that the administration presented to justify their case for war.  
   And through our oversight and subpoenas, we are vigorously seeking to expose and investigate the peddling of faulty intelligence the Administration presented in their case for war. 
   We must demand to know whether the Administration's active dissemination of bad intelligence was premeditated with the intention of deceiving the American people, or was it reckless and cavalier, done to justify a decision to go to war that had already been made? 
   At every corner, step by step, Congress is methodically peeling back the layers of deception and deceit, holding this Administration accountable. We must get the facts and follow the facts. And that is exactly what is being done. 
   Madam Speaker, this pursuit of impeachment has consequences to real lives and real people. I measure every decision I make here in Congress based on whether it will hasten or delay an end to this war. Nothing illustrates this urgency more than a phone call I received before a recent trip to Iraq. The call was from a mother in the town of Brattleboro who lost her son in this terrible war. She so desired closure over her son's death, that she asked to accompany me to Iraq so she could see where her son had died. It was a stark reminder that there is no greater challenge we face than ending this war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his extraordinary leadership, along with the Chair of the subcommittee, my colleague from Connecticut, for her lead on nutrition. 
   We are in the process of changing priorities in this country. Today, the House will be taking up the 11th of 12 appropriation bills where we will continue the process of taking this country in a new direction. 
   This agricultural appropriations bill makes a solid statement of confidence in the future of rural America, and it makes a solid statement of recognition about the diversity and vitality of our rural economy. 
   Let me just mention a few things that highlight what this program is doing. 
   Number one, a strong farm economy where we have our farmers being the custodian of our landscape requires conservation; $980 million is in this bill for conservation. 
   Rural development is critical to our economy. Broadband, among other things, is a major investment in this bill, and we are treating the rural economy with broadband, much like we did with electricity. That has to be a full partner, not a second-class citizen when it comes to the development of the infrastructure that is essential to building our economy. 
   A strong rural economy is based on a well-fed country, and that means prosperous farmers. There is a record $13.9 billion for school meal programs, $39.8 billion for food stamps, and $5.6 billion for the Women, Infant and Children program. 
   There is also in this bill, as the gentleman from California has said, a major investment in nutritious food, vegetables and fruit. And I thank the gentleman from California for his leadership on that.  
   This bill and this rule is going to take America forward. A strong rural economy is essential to America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from New York, my colleague on the Rules Committee. I thank my friend from Texas, also a colleague on the Rules Committee. 
   The legislation before us is long overdue. It's about jobs, about energy efficiency and energy independence, and it's about restoring our confidence that we can produce jobs and produce energy that's clean, environmentally sensitive and strong and durable to help move our economy ahead. 
   This transition language would allow us to extend about $42 billion in tax incentives. Mr. Speaker, I'm a skeptic oftentimes on tax incentives because they are frequently given to industries that are mature and profitable at the expense of taxpayers. An example of that, of course, is the $13 billion in tax breaks that continue to go to the oil industry that has been doing extremely well with the high price of oil. 
   Tax incentives properly should be focused on emerging technologies, and emerging industries, where our country, where our companies, our small businesses can use the boost in order to develop the new technologies that will solve a problem that we have, the need for energy, the need for clean energy, and the need to create jobs and energy independence here in this country. This legislation will do that. 
   I will give just an example. In Vermont, Jeff and Dorry Wolf are two folks who moved to Vermont in 1998, and they had a dream. The dream was they could create a company that would build renewable energy. They got involved in solar energy. And their company, when they started it, at a time when this was a pipe dream, has now become one of our big companies in Vermont. It's become a leader in solar technology. It is doing work all around the country. And these incentives are critical to its continuation. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge us to pass this rule so that we can pass the underlying legislation, move towards energy independence, create jobs here in this country, and clean up our environment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, it's becoming quite apparent that our economy is in peril. The biggest casualty in this economy are middle-class families trying to hang on by their fingernails. 
   We have got a different point of view by our leadership. President Bush says that the 500-point collapse is just, quote, a correction. Mr. McCain, Senator McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. 
   The reality is that the economy has become weak, with policies that have deregulated financial institutions leading to the collapse of some of our longest-standing, historically most solid institutions like Lehman Brothers. For 8 years, the Bush-McCain economic policy has had a radical proposition that we can deregulate everything and leave everything to Wall Street, and it will all take care of itself. 
   Now American families, businesses on Main Street, are beginning to pay the price for this economic failure under the Bush administration. 
   The only way we can change our economy is by returning to the basic principle that our economic policies should all be about building the middle class.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity here to decide to make policy instead of continuing to play politics. 
   I happen to be among those who believe that we cannot drill our way out of this energy crisis, yet I support this bill that contains significant offshore and domestic drilling, and I'll tell you why. This will offer a transition fund so that we can go from an energy-dependent economy on oil to an independent energy economy. 
   What this bill will do is marry the argument that has been made on the other side that we have to have supply to get from here to there--that's true, it's indisputable--and that developing our own domestic resources is a way to help us get there. And it marries that to establishing that the revenues that will be generated will be used for the benefit of the American people to achieve the goal of energy independence, which requires two things: It requires investment in research and development of alternative energies, and it requires investment in the implementation of alternative energy projects. 
   So what you have here is a recognition that we do need supply; that's true. That's been the argument of the Republican side. Valid point. But it also recognizes that we need a sustainable financial fund in order to implement research and development in the implementation of clean energy projects. 
   This bill also cracks down on speculation, makes oil available, which will have an impact on the price of oil. It does a whole array of things that most of us are in agreement need to be done on wind, solar, biomass. 
   So, Mr. President, we can't drill our way out, but we can't get to where we need to be, a post oil-dependent economy, unless we have a sustainable energy fund that will allow us to do that. We managed to do this in Vermont when we had a fierce debate over nuclear power, and in the storage of nuclear waste, assessed a fee that went into a clean energy fund. It is now allowing schools to literally cut in half their cost of heating their schools. This is a very wise decision and allows us to work together to get something done.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1500 authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules at any time through the calendar day of Sunday, September 28, 2008. The rule is necessary because under clause 1(a), rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules, as you know, only on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, the Rules Committee must authorize such consideration. 
   This is not an unusual procedure, particularly at the end of the legislative session. In the 109th Congress, for instance, my friends on the other side of the aisle reported at least six rules that provided for additional suspension days. We are doing the same. 
   This rule will help us move important bipartisan legislation before we adjourn. Of course, all bills considered under suspension of the rules must receive strong bipartisan support in order to pass the House. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule, which will simply help us move important, noncontroversial legislation before we adjourn. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I want to respond to some of the points made by my friend from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, this process of allowing for suspensions on days late in the week, particularly towards the end of the session, is something that we have done quite a bit, generally on a cooperative basis, and there is a self-policing mechanism that applies. 
   The self-policing mechanism, of course, is the fact that to pass a suspension bill requires two-thirds vote, and the majority party does not have a two-thirds majority, so anything that's going to pass is going to require a substantial positive vote, a ``yes'' vote, from Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   It also is kind of a practical thing to do. Our session is getting extended a bit because we are trying to come to some resolution to ease the credit crisis that is afflicting our economy, and that's incredibly serious, requires us to stay as long as it takes to address that issue. 
   But many of us are not involved in the minute-to-minute negotiations, as our committee chairs are, as our leadership is. We are still on the clock, working for the American taxpayer. So if there is an opportunity to use our time productively by bringing up suspension bills that meet the two-thirds test, advances concerns of importance, if not as grave importance as the issue about Wall Street, why not take the opportunity together to move ahead on things that will be helpful to our country. 
   Also, just a little bit of history here, the Republicans, of course, were in the majority from 1994 until 2006. In the last session of Congress, the 109th session of Congress, they found themselves in similar circumstances at the end of the session. They had time that could be utilized and did, by bringing up some suspension bills. Then, as now, it did require a two-thirds vote before any suspension bill could pass. 
   I will just go through a few things. My friend probably knows all this, but I will remind him, anyway, a little education here. He was here. I wasn't. 
   I am told that on June 30, 2005, H. Res. 345 provided for a blanket suspension day on June 30, and that was pending the July adjournment of that year. The House took up a number of bills under that suspension authority. 
   Similarly, on July 28, 2005, there was a blanket suspension for suspension day. Again, the House took advantage of that. September 8, 2005, provided another day for a blanket suspension. 
   There are others. H. Res. 623 provided for suspension day on December 17. That applied to a number of pending House bills, H.R. 4519, H.R. 2520, H.R. 4568, H.R. 3402, H.R. 4579, H.R. 4525; a  Senate bill, S. 1281. There was a conference on Senate 467. It was a joint resolution providing for a fiscal year 2006 continuing resolution. 
   That was all pretty important business. It all passed with that two-thirds majority. It took advantage of the fact that many people from both sides of the aisle, who were not involved in what was the end of the session, intense negotiations on other legislation, they could use their time productively. 
   There were a couple of combination rules with suspension day authority. H. Res. 1096 waived the two-thirds requirement on December 7 on any rule, providing for a blanket suspension day. It tabled H. Res. 810, 939, 951 and 1047. 
   There was another such action on December 8, 2006, H. Res. 1102, and that waived the two-thirds rule on the December 8 proceedings on any rule and that provided for a blanket suspension on that date. There is a strong precedent here for allowing suspension authority to occur at the end of the week, rather than just the beginning of the week. Again, it's grounded in the practicality, using the time that we have, that we didn't expect to have, to advance the legislative calendar. 
   The gentleman from Florida mentioned the ping-pong procedure that has allowed this House and the Congress to pass critical legislation for working and middle class Americans. The fact is that we have utilized the ping-pong approach because of some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the Senate that have blocked motions to go to conference. 
   Incidentally, I think I probably agree with my friend that going into conference is the better way for us to try to resolve differences between the two bodies. It takes two to conference, just like it takes two to do that famous south Miami dance, the tango. I know on our side, Republicans and Democrats would prefer to be able to use the tried-and-true method of a conference committee to resolve our differences. 
   It certainly allows our body to be fully represented on both sides of the aisle, members of the conference would come from the Democrat and Republican Parties. It would allow for more vigorous debate about the differences between the legislation that's passed by the House and passed by the Senate. In fact, I think it's a little sad, and, frankly, dangerous a bit, that we don't have a conferencing process, because it really does allow the focus on the issues and allows for a fuller debate from which, in the ideal circumstances, a better solution emerges. 
   I think I am in agreement, maybe I can hear from the Member from Florida, but I think I am in agreement with him about the preference for a conference procedure. It's just not something that's unilaterally within the control of this body. That's true, whether there is a Republican majority or a Democratic majority. There certainly has to be a level of cooperation in the other body in order for the House to be able to participate in a conference. 
   So what we find ourselves, oftentimes, is confronted with a situation where the negotiating gets done at leadership level or at the chair of committee level. It leaves a good number of Members out of those final and often very critical negotiations about the final points of legislation that's in contention. 
   So maybe the Member from Florida and I can work together to try to persuade our friends in the other body to return to the tradition of House-Senate conferences. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Well, thank you. I am going to take you up on that because you are probably more familiar with that history of Spain during the preceding Franco years and the internal revolution and during the period of the republic.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. And he had to contend with that, as did all Spaniards during the period of the republic in the revolution with just this wrenching upheaval in their own society where brothers were fighting brothers and the worst of all things were happening, as they were here during our Civil War and countrymen were pitted one against another, and people were forced to deal with circumstances that were just beyond what they ever could have imagined. And then the struggle in those circumstances for people of conscience to make a decision about what was right to do when the implication of following through and doing that right could be frightening, physically dangerous to themselves, the person who was making the decision to act, but it was equally frightening about a decision not to act and what the consequences would be for other people. So I look forward to reading that. 
   I am just going to make a suggestion to you. That phrase ``man is man plus his circumstances,'' and I have to write that down. 
   But Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors. And the reason I like Graham Greene, he writes articles about flawed human beings. The protagonists in his novels are all deeply flawed people, like all of us. They have real limitations. Some of them are alcoholics. They can't control certain parts of their behavior. But what he writes about is individuals who find themselves in circumstances where they have to make decisions that require them to act in ways that ultimately may be physically dangerous to them, but where they have a capacity to respond, to see, what the moral imperative is. And then they are able, despite their flaws and weaknesses, to summon the internal courage to do the right thing. They don't do it to be a hero. They are reluctant heroes. They end up being heroes. And in some cases they sacrifice their lives. It is not that they wanted to do it or anything that they thought about as an image of themselves. In fact, they oftentimes took refuge in their weakness, by alcohol, frequently, in the Graham Greene novels. 
   But when they were confronted with a situation where they had an opportunity, by circumstance beyond their control, accidental almost, where their action could save a fellow human being or turn the tide of events in a way where more people would be spared suffering, despite their weakness, despite not wanting to do it, despite their resistance, there was something deeply moral embedded in who they were where the decision they made was for others, not for themselves. 
   Your comments about the Spanish philosopher brought to mind the reactions I have had from reading so many Graham Greene novels.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Graham Greene. I just really appreciate your remarks. 
   And I want to talk about a second topic you mentioned, the importance in a democracy about procedure. The gentleman is right. One of the things that I have admired about our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, is that I believe he does his best, it is always debatable, but I think he does his best to scrupulously abide by the procedural rights. 
   We have battles about the rule we are bringing forward and whether it is the right thing to do or not, but I agree, procedure is important. Procedure is often substance. How you design it and allow something to be taken up really affects the outcome of what will occur. 
   One of the constant decisions that we have to make, you had to make when you were in the majority and we have to make while we are in the majority, is how to get a specific question to this body for an up-or-down vote. And it requires the Rules Committee, and you know better than I do, you are much more experienced on the Rules Committee than I am, it requires the Rules Committee to decide what the question will be, to decide what amendments will be allowed. There is always an ongoing tension between the majority and the minority, and that flips as the voters decide to change the majority here. 
   So your aggression, and that is not the right word, your defense of procedure is well taken by me. 
   Before I came here I served for a period of time in the State Senate in Vermont. It is a much different situation. We had 30 members, very small, very intimate. No staff. Literally no staff. The one member of the Senate who had one staff person was the President pro tempore, and I served in that job for the 4 years before I came here. But nobody else had a staff. I have gotten to like staff, don't get me wrong, but there was something quite wonderful about the fact that the members had to do all of their own work. What it meant is that we were talking to one another constantly. And the problems that were being developed couldn't be mitigated or muted by having staff talk to staff for another member. 
   That very intense, immediate interaction I actually thought was very helpful. I know there are a number of Members on both sides of the aisle who talk, and we have this opportunity when we are on the floor voting to try to hear where each of us are coming from and what ways we may be able to find a path to getting ``yes.'' 
   But as Senate President, I had a lot of responsibility about procedures. So I did two things that were kind of unusual, and we can't do them around here, but in the small circumstances of the Vermont Senate we could. We had 21-9 majority, and I had the cooperative power of appointment. And I appointed three members of the Republican Party to serve as chairs of important committees. 
   The reason that I did that, two reasons, it just so happened that the three people who got appointed were the best people for the job. They were terrific. The second reason was it allowed us to find ways to work together because we all had a stake in the future. 
   So any time that we can work together, I want to do it. I appreciate your openness and willingness to do that as well. 
   But getting back to the question before us, mainly this question of the  suspension authority and your concern about it being ``blanket,'' I understand that. But the self-correcting mechanism here is the requirement under suspension that there be a two-thirds vote. That by definition means that there has to be a good deal of support on the Republican side as well as on the Democratic side for this suspension authority to allow consideration and for a bill considered to be passed. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I support the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act providing our first responders with a right that they deserve which has long been withheld, the right of collective bargaining. Many Americans have this right, and our first responders should not be left out. 
   In professions where working together can mean and does mean the difference between life and death for workers and citizens in our communities, cooperation in a healthy working environment is critical. 
   In my home State of Vermont, first responders have the right of collective bargaining. We are very proud of them. That right should be extended to their colleagues across the Nation. 
   Last fall I had an opportunity to participate in firefighting training at the Vermont Fire Academy in Pittsford, Vermont. I suited up in jackets, pants, and oxygen mask. And you know what I learned, the work they do is hard. The work they do is dangerous. 
   We must make certain that they feel fully entitled to represent themselves at the bargaining table for safe and decent conditions. 
   Representative Kildee and Representative Duncan, thank you for your leadership in this overdue legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentlewoman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress faces the challenge of acting on the direction of the American people, as expressed in the vote of November 2006, and that is to change the direction of this country and to restore a domestic agenda that serves all Americans. 
   We began, and again on a bipartisan basis, with 100 hours, raising the minimum wage, reversing wasteful subsidies to the big oil companies, and instead funding renewable energy, requiring price negotiations so our taxpayers didn't get ripped off in prescription drug prices, making college more affordable.     
   These measures are a down payment, but just a beginning. Today, the House takes up the eighth of 12 appropriation bills. This bill, under the leadership of Mr. Obey, more than anything else, is going to put a stamp on a new direction that this Congress is moving in. 
   It's a direction that says all Americans have to be included, not just the wealthy, not just those who can afford corporate lobbyists. All Americans have a right to affordable education, to quality health care, to safe working conditions and to a financially secure retirement. Getting from here to there is a challenge, but this is the road that this bill takes us on. 
   Let me mention just four different areas. First, the legislation restores $7.6 billion in funding to vital programs that have been cut by the administration. At the same time, it saves $1.1 billion from lower priority programs. There is a commitment here to fiscal responsibility. 
   We must invest in America's future generations, and the bill does that. 
   Second, again, I will just mention a few things that are important to us in Vermont. We have had unfunded mandates. Special Ed, No Child Left Behind are the poster childs of that. This bill increases funding for No Child Left Behind by $8.6 billion over fiscal year 2007. 
   This bill invests in vital rural health care programs, something that we in Vermont are very familiar with, by increasing funding by $307 million. That provides real services to real people with real health care problems. This bill increases funding for the vital Low Income Heating Assistance Program. That was cut in the administration proposal by $379 million, or 17.5 percent, below last year's level. That's simply not sustainable. That's going to inflict real harm on people who have no ability to control the price of home heating oil. 
   This bill is taking us further on the road of having a Congress who is committed to the needs of all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, today, the House will take up the ninth of 12 appropriation measures where we will continue the effort to take America in a new direction, where we focus on priorities of concern to average Americans throughout this country. 
   Through these bills, the new Congress is restoring our focus on a domestic agenda that helps all Americans, not just the wealthy few and not just the well-connected corporations. 
   We will make sure, as we have, that our veterans have the care they need. We'll reverse neglect in environmental protection that's been abandoned, been neglected for the past several years, and we'll fund housing programs for low- and moderate-income Americans. We will provide resources to ensure that children arrive at school ready to learn and have the health care that they need, and we will make certain that our law enforcement officials have the tools that they need to protect our citizens. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 558 provides for consideration of H.R. 3074, the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for 2008. This will be done under an open rule. This is a bipartisan bill that was presented before the Rules Committee by Chairman Olver and Ranking Member Knollenberg. It was a pleasure, frankly, to see the cooperation of these two gentlemen and the members of that committee coming together to present to the House for its consideration a very impressive plan to meet our infrastructure and housing needs in the future. 
   As you know, demographic changes and growth patterns in the United States over the next decade will continue to have a major impact on transportation networks and the need for affordable housing. This bill seeks to ensure that our Nation's transportation system is safe and efficient and that our citizens have access to safe and affordable housing. The bill does so in a way that strengthens the economy and is environmentally and fiscally responsible. 
   The bill safeguards the regional needs of our Nation by rejecting administration proposed cuts that provide air service to rural communities, and it invests in transit projects for our urban areas that will help our commuters save time and money getting to work. The bill also rejects administration cuts to Amtrak, protects national rail service, and fully funds the highway and transit guarantees set forth in the SAFETEA-LU authorization bill. 
   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recognized the need to support rural airports, something very important to people like me from a rural State like Vermont. Investments in airports, like the Rutland State Airport in Vermont, are critical to rural States and an effective transportation system. The bill includes $110 million for essential air service to continue service to small and/or rural communities as well as $10 million for the Small Community Air Service Development Program that will continue the Department of Transportation grant program to help our small communities to attract commercial air services. 
   Among other things, the committee also includes $75 million for the FTA's Clean Fuels Grant program, $26 million above 2007 for clean fuel bus technology. Public transportation companies like the Chittenden County Transportation Authority in Vermont are taking responsibility for their fleet's emissions by making investments in new, fuel-efficient, low-carbon-emitting buses; and this legislation supports those efforts. 
   In housing, the bill rejects a $2 billion cut proposed by the administration to eliminate housing programs for the poorest citizens in this country and, instead, aims to make sure that all Americans have adequate shelter. The proposed cuts that this bill would reject include deep cuts to HUD, Community Development Block Grants and programs that provide housing for the elderly and disabled. Funding is included so that anyone with a voucher will not lose it. The President's proposed cuts come at a time when fully three-quarters of households that are  actually eligible for HUD assistance are not receiving that assistance. 
   And more than 1 million low-income households across New England, including elderly, disabled and families, live in federally assisted housing. Most of these households have annual incomes of less than $8,000, and they're obviously at serious risk of homelessness. Even larger numbers of households are struggling to survive in a private housing market and are paying more than 50 percent of their income for rent.     
   The Community Development Block Grant is a valuable resource for cities and States struggling to ensure opportunities for residents to live in safe and affordable communities. It's a tool that helps our local officials do, locally, something that builds up their communities. This program has funded projects that improve the quality of life across the country, including infrastructure improvement and economic development. 
   In 2007, again using Vermont as an example, we received $8.4 million in CDBG funds. This bill provides $4 billion for CDBG grants across the country. That's $228 million above the 2007 appropriation. 
   The need to recommit to housing and transportation priorities is necessary in every State in the country. It's a priority we must address head on in this body. This bill takes a big step in the right direction. 
   I also commend the committee for including very strong language requiring HUD to incorporate strong green building and rehabilitation standards into its housing program, particularly focusing on improved energy efficiency, good for the environment, a pretty quick payoff and good for keeping costs down. While green building is relatively new, it's clearly vital to our Nation's homes and buildings, and to our country, that those homes and buildings become more environmentally friendly. 
   Finally, this bill also reinforces the link between housing and transportation. It establishes a new interagency working group to coordinate transportation and housing policies on the Federal, State and local level. 
   I again applaud Chairman Olver and Ranking Member Knollenberg for their hard and cooperative work in crafting this excellent bill, and thank them and their staffs for their attention to the needs of the people of Vermont and all States in this country. 
   I will be urging all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, to respond to a couple of comments that my friend from Texas said, this bill complies with PAYGO. It absolutely meets the commitment that this Congress made to pay the bills that go along with the legislation we propose. It is a commitment to fiscal responsibility. 
   The past Congresses, as is well known and is just factually beyond dispute, abandoned PAYGO, and it has resulted in the largest deficit of this country. That's number one. 
   Number two, there really is a bipartisan desire to keep taxes as low as possible and spending as low as possible, but this bill also reflects a bipartisan commitment to build our infrastructure, to provide our citizens with the transportation that they need and  the housing that we need. It was passed on a very strong voice vote, bipartisan work by this committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 1/2 minutes to the distinguished Chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Olver from Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I have a newfound respect for the Chair of this committee and the ranking member, Mr. Olver and Mr. Knollenberg. They have an incredibly difficult job, and that is to take the responsibility that this House of Representatives has, Democrats and Republicans, to put together a transportation infrastructure program and a housing program, and to do that when they have 435 Members of Congress tugging on their arms every day asking them to include projects in their districts because the Members from those districts sincerely believe that those are essential to the economic development and the transportation needs and the housing needs of the people who live there.     
   And they managed to do it. They came in, treated every Member of this body with enormous courtesy and patience, listened to what our requests were, and then put together a bill that was bipartisan. It was quite extraordinary. And it was a pleasure to be a member of the Rules Committee and to see these two gentlemen come up and be mutually complimentary after a hard process of allocating $50 billion of taxpayer money for infrastructure and housing improvement in this country. They are to be commended for that. 
   We then come down to the floor and we get into the back and forth about specific projects and try to pick and cherry pick examples of what is bad when it was the recommendation of the chairman of the committee that this be an open rule; so anybody who has got a problem with any particular project is going to have an opportunity to offer amendment to strike that project and make whatever arguments they want. 
   This issue of how we restore the transportation infrastructure of our country is vital. The fact is we spend too little, not too much, and it is the funding issue that is a challenge in every Congress. But our infrastructure compared to many of the countries with which we compete economically is woefully behind what the economy of our country needs and the citizens of our country deserve. 
   I applaud the work of this subcommittee, bipartisan work. And why it is that we have to beat up on the work of the committee by claiming it is partisan, Democrat and Republican, really escapes me. There is nothing partisan about meeting the infrastructure needs of our country. There may be fierce debates about the best way to do it, which projects should get funding, how much you allocate towards the air system versus rail; but the fact is we have got an obligation to improve a crumbling infrastructure in this country, and the bill that has been presented to this Congress on a bipartisan basis, under the leadership of Mr. Olver and Mr. Knollenberg, takes us a solid step forward. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule so that the House can consider H.R. 3074.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, $2.32 for a gallon of gas, $2.99 for a gallon of milk, $20 or $25 for a single day of childcare. These are real prices and, too often, real choices that working Americans face every day. 
   In Vermont, and across America, we have had a proud tradition of self-reliance and sense of community. We need to combine these two values, self-reliance on the one hand and community on the other, by rewarding work and making work pay. 
   We send a message every day to our citizens and our workers that we value work and that government has a role to play in ensuring opportunity to everyone willing to contribute. It is time we matched that message with our own leadership. 
   It is no accident that in Vermont and more than 20 States around the country, Republicans and Democrats, working together, have led in the effort to reward work with a reasonable minimum wage above our national minimum last set nearly a decade ago.  
   There are few more important tasks before us than addressing the growing economic gap between America's wealthiest citizens and low income workers. 
   Last year, millionaires were given tax breaks that put an average of $40,000 in their pockets, and yet middle class workers who earn less than $20,000 received just two dollars. Two dollars--for the whole year. That is rewarding wealth rather than work. 
   Today a full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712 annually--more than $2,000 below the poverty line for a family of two. Asking millions of our neighbors to work full time without a wage above poverty is wrong. 
   I believe that Congress must raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour to help life every minimum wage worker out of poverty. 
   Today and together, we can begin to restore a balance, by rewarding work and not just wealth, acknowledging we are all in this together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I am proud, as part of our first 100 hours, that Congress has committed to expanding higher education opportunities to more Americans. Education has always been the great equalizer in this country. With each generation doors are opened through greater access to education. 
   The health of our economy and prosperity of our middle class rests on having a highly-skilled and well-educated workforce. We all know stories of working class families struggling to make ends meet to put a child, sometimes the family's first generation, through college. It is a struggle millions of families go through, as college costs skyrocket year after year. Reducing the debt burden these families and students face is the least Congress can do to help meet their commitment and sacrifice. 
   H.R. 5 will provide a significant reduction in student loan interest rates for students who borrow under the subsidized student loan program. 
   This legislation is worthy in its intent and it is legislation I support. However, it is my hope to work with my fellow members and the distinguished Chairman of Education and Labor to recognize the important role small, not-for-profit lenders play in opening doors to more working families. I believe it makes sense to distinguish not only between large and small lenders, but those that lend on a not-for-profit basis and who reinvest all revenues into additional student financial assistance. 
   Our goal is to improve educational opportunities for students and it is a goal I know our non-profit lenders share.

   This war is the first time in American history when we have had tax cuts during a war. And if ever there is a moment in time when our country should be called upon to share a sacrifice, it is when we are sending our sons and daughters to war. 
   This amendment calls the question, it says the obvious: We can't keep paying for this on a credit card. There are costs that are going to be paid not only by this generation, but by future generations. The President has put this war on the credit card, and the irony of that is that it is the sons and the daughters of the men and women who are fighting this war who are going to pay for this.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership, Chairman Waxman, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Davis. 
   I have been listening to Mr. Davis, and he makes a good point; you have to, when you're spending $1 trillion on a war--and we're pushing that--have a good acquisition team. But that really begs the question, we have to have oversight. And there has been documented an astonishing amount of waste, fraud and absolute rip-off in this expenditure of close to $1 trillion. And that does require some simple reporting requirements. 
   Mr. Murphy's amendment, where private companies that go into contracts from $700,000, and then when the war starts over the next 4 years to $1 billion, that 10 percent cut for the owner of that company, or the owners, the public has a right to know. Sunlight is going to put some limits on how much profit is reasonable when our soldiers are working so hard for so little. 
   Secondly, when we have no-bid contracts--and these have proliferated so that they are about over $1 trillion--and the companies that have those contracts become aware of fraud, why is it not plain common sense that that company would have the obligation immediately to report to the American government their knowledge of fraud so that we can save taxpayer dollars, particularly when these involve national security contracts, oftentimes with things that are going to protect our troops? We owe them no less and we owe our taxpayers no less. So I thank the gentlemen for the work that they've done to restore fiscal responsibility.

   We have a bit of a factual dispute about the nature of this agreement. The chairman of our committee, a distinguished veteran, has made it clear that this can be in the nature of a treaty. That is what it applies to. It could implicate us in the second issue, and that is where the United States should be providing security when essentially you have a civil war. 
   The agreements and Status of Force Agreements that Mr. Hunter has described have been with countries that have stability. This is a country that has Shia fighting Shia, Shia fighting Sunni, the Kurds sitting on the side, waiting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1476 provides for consideration of H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008 sponsored by Congresswoman Maloney. This rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. It also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is entirely appropriate that today, with the extraordinary spectacle of Wall Street titans coming to Congress hat in hand asking taxpayers for $700 billion, that we take up consideration of a bill of rights for Americans who hold credit cards. It is impossible for any of us who care to observe not to see the connection between the need for stronger consumer protections in the credit card industry today and the careless, reckless dismantling of consumer protections in the housing and financial markets in the past 30 years now known by the infamous term of ``deregulation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as we know, credit serves a vital function in our economy. You cannot have a functioning capitalist economy without a functioning credit system. But the question that we face as elected representatives of the people who sent us here is whether or not we will act to provide a critical consumer protection to the credit markets and the protection to consumers who depend on them, or will we continue to leave this laissez-faire to the rules made up as they go along by the people in charge on Wall Street. 
   If this Congress had insisted on upholding consumer protections on Wall Street, if it had not simply stood aside to the proponents of the wild west, anything-goes markets that eviscerated the regulations, and instead kept consumers safe and the markets stable and strong, then we may well have averted the crisis that this House is now considering. 
   Maybe we would not be facing this extraordinary threat to the strength of the middle class who is working hard, paying their bills, but hanging on by their fingernails. 
   The challenge our economy faces now is largely a result of Wall Street abusing the credit system that we all need. And now ballooning credit card debt presents a similar threat to American consumers and possibly the markets. 
   Today, the House of Representatives will have the opportunity to adopt legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Maloney that would prevent the reoccurrence of a crisis in credit cards that is happening in our housing industry. 
   Let's just look at the situation of consumer credit as it exists today. In 2007, Mr. Speaker, 5.2 billion credit card solicitations were put in the mail, 36 solicitations per household. There are 1.22 billion credit cards in the United States. Outstanding consumer credit in the United States is approaching $1 trillion, $969.9 billion, to be precise, and the average credit card debt per household that carries a balance as opposed to those who simply use the credit card as a convenience to pay bills, that average balance is $17,103. 
   Does that sound sustainable and does this sound familiar? 
   Congresswoman Maloney's bill, H.R. 5244, institutes essential and overdue protections for the market and for the consumer by guarding against growing unmanageable debt and provides critical safeguards for consumers who have been relentlessly taken advantage of by credit card companies.  
   Specifically, the bill, among other things, ends unfair and arbitrary interest rate increases. Credit card companies raise interest rates at will, bait and switch, ends unfair penalties for cardholders who pay on time, requires fair allocation of consumer payments so that the payments are attributed to the highest interest rate first, protects cardholders from due date gimmicks, prevents companies from using misleading terms and damaging consumer credit ratings, protects vulnerable consumers from high fee subprime credit cards, and bars issuing credit cards to vulnerable minors. 
   The bill is the beginning of important reform in credit cards; the beginning of increased protection for consumers of credit card companies. H.R. 5244 is one side of the consumer protection coin.     
   The other side of the coin, which we're not taking up today but will hopefully get to, is for merchants who pay fees to credit card companies for every single credit card transaction, the so-called ``interchange fees.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, in the United States, our credit card interchange fees are the highest in the entire world, accounting for as much as 2 percent of the cost of every credit card transaction, in some cases, a good deal more. By comparison, those interchange fees in the United States are almost three times what they are in Australia, four times what consumers and businesses pay in the United Kingdom. 
   These bloated interchange fees are passed on to the consumer. The average American family, in fact, pays an extra $300 a year on items they purchase as a result of credit cards. For example, interchange fees can add more than 8 cents to the price of a gallon of gas every time you fill up. 
   I and others have introduced legislation that may be considered at some future time, H.R. 6248, the Credit Card Interchange Fees Act, which would require credit card companies to disclose their interchange rates, terms and conditions to consumers, businesses and the public. In addition, the bill would empower the Federal Trade Commission to review these rates and rules and prohibit any practices that violate consumer protection and anti-competitive laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, Chairman Conyers on the Judiciary Committee also has important legislation being considered, the Credit Card Fair Fee Act. In the next Congress we'll have an opportunity to take up the Conyers bill and perhaps the Welch bill. 
   But today we have the opportunity to take up the first step, the work of Congresswoman Maloney, where she has scores of cosponsors, where she's worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to the consideration of the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support this underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. 
   Here is my understanding. The gentleman raises, I think, a good point. 
   The Armed Services Committee is working, as I understand it, on a bipartisan Department of Defense authorization bill. My understanding is the conclusion of the people who are most responsible on both sides of the aisle for that, on our side, expect that the Senate will not participate in a conference, so it will be a single bill that would be presented to this body under suspension. 
   So my understanding is that the folks who represent us, both sides of the aisle on the Armed Services Committee, have come to the conclusion that given the way the other body is going to handle this, that this is the most practical and effective way to proceed. 
   Since it's coming up under suspension, it's going to take a two-thirds vote, obviously. So whatever the reasons are that Members may want to reject that, they're going to have an opportunity to do it. 
   I will go on if you want, but I don't want to take too much of your time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I want to make three points. 
   First, in response to the concerns expressed by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), I want to assure him, as well as my colleagues, that the Armed Services Committee intends today to file their explanatory statement. This is on the, incidentally, Duncan Hunter defense authorization bill. They want to file their explanatory statement before the bipartisan DOD authorization is considered on the floor. So Members are going to have an opportunity to read in the Congressional Record all the information that they want, including anything related to so-called ``earmarks.'' 
   Second, I want to speak to the energy concerns that were discussed by the gentleman from Texas. I understand the argument he's making. It's been made by him and his colleagues, and in fact, many of the arguments that were made were incorporated into the energy legislation that did pass this House for an all-of-the-above approach to energy, and I can appreciate that some Members here do believe that drilling is the way to go and almost the only way to go. And I can understand the political appeal that has been embraced by my friends on the other side to use every occasion to speak, whether it is on a credit card bill, whether it's on a veterans bill, doesn't matter the nature of the bill that they want to give their pitch about oil. And they've done it. We've listened, and we've passed legislation that does incorporate all of the above. 
   But the third point I want to make is this: this legislation that has been brought to the floor by Congresswoman Maloney raises a fundamentally, profoundly important question for this Congress. Are we going to stand by hands off while the credit industry, most recently exhibited by Wall Street, basically plunders our economy, picks the pockets of consumers, has their way, tramples on the rights of individuals and families, disregards the needs of the middle class, all in the name of whatever it is in and however much money it is they can make? Or is Congress going to assert its role as the representatives of the people and establish a level playing field so that people can have access to the credit that they need in a way that companies are going to make a fair profit, the old, the elderly, the people on the margin aren't going to be ripped off? 
   It's really that simple, and we can debate about what the fine points are in any kind of consumer protection legislation, and reasonable people can disagree on both sides of the aisle. But the fundamental question for this Congress is, are we going to do anything or not? And the whole reason we have this extraordinary spectacle of these Wall Street titans, billionaires, now coming in to Congress saying they're going broke and give us $700 billion, and oh, it's not for us, it's because we want the economy to work for the people who are on the dead-end side of these mortgages, why did that happen? 
   It happened because in many ways the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the executive branch of government abdicated any responsibility that it had to stand up for people who needed an active government on their side. 
   What Congresswoman Maloney's legislation says very simply is, Enough. Enough. Enough abuse. It's over; the free ride is over. We're going to have some fair rules, consumer protections. You get notice of what your bill is going to be. You can't change the interest rate arbitrarily. A contract is a contract both ways, and if there's an obligation to pay your credit card, which there is, there's an obligation on the part of the credit card company to abide by explicit terms and conditions in a contract. 
   So this legislation is a first step, in my view long overdue, for Congress to stand up and say that there are going to be some basic rules of fairness, some  basic rules of the road that are going to protect everyday citizens. Credit is essential to our economy, and that's a point my friend from Texas made and he's right, and it's a useful and important tool for individuals and families. 
   But there have to be fair rules, and one family up against a monolith of the credit card industry, there's got to be somebody on the side of that family, and that's got to be the United States Congress. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. You know, it is very elemental: you get what you pay for, you account for what you buy, you are responsible to the people that hire you, you are responsible to the voters. 
   The opportunity that I have had about addressing some of these issues of accountability, maybe I can just tell a few stories about some of the hearings we have had, because it is worse than I expected. I come from Vermont, where we don't know how to waste things. We do it over recycle, reuse, do all of those things. But, you know, I am on the Oversight and Government Operations Committee, and we have had a number of hearings. And let me just tell a few stories, because I think rather than have me give some conclusions, let people just hear what some of the facts are. 
   We had some hearings on Iraq expenditures, Iraq relief money. And the Government Accountability Office has come up with an audit that suggests that a minimum of $10 billion was wasted. But a couple of graphic examples came forward that just stunned me, frankly. One was that our Federal Reserve, at the orders of the government, sent $12 billion in taxpayer money, in cash, loaded in skids, shrink wrapped in plastic cellophane over to Iraq. Now, why did that happen? It wasn't accounted for, but it was sent over there to pay salaries for people who were working in Iraqi ministries. And of course it happened at a time when there was a desperate effort on the part of the administration to show some progress in Iraq. And one of the ways of trying to show progress is that we have these ministries up and running and we have employees who are working and doing the basic jobs of providing electricity, of dealing with pensions, and the things that are the functions of government. 
   Most of that money went missing because it turned out that some of it was literally handed out from the back of pick-up trucks in Baghdad, and it went to employees who were ghost employees. There were these various ministers in the Iraq Government who had a position of influence and saw an opportunity and they took it and made millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer money. 
   Now, you know, there is no Republican, there is no Democrat, there is no Independent who can fathom the idea of literally loading 347 tons of 100-dollar bills on C-147 transports and sending it to a foreign country to be handed out on street corners. At home, when I go to Vermont and I tell this story, I almost pinch myself because it is so astonishing that I am wondering whether it is true. Unfortunately, it is true. That is something that is happening with taxpayer dollars. 
   Another example: $57 million was spent, Madam Speaker, awarded a contract to a Falls Church company that was going to construct housing in Baghdad, I think it was outside of the airport, it was going to be for, Congressman Hodes is on that committee, so if I get some of these details wrong, you can correct me. But basically it was a housing contract that was going to provide housing for trainees of the Baghdad police. Not a bad idea. One problem: the housing was never built. The only residue of the $57 million are hundreds of mobile homes that are now parked, unoccupied, on a tract of land outside the Baghdad Airport. 
   Now, even our government got embarrassed at this. And someone in the State Department suggested that what we should do, since we had all these homeless people in Baghdad but they couldn't live there, we didn't have housing units set up, we just had these facilities, the suggestion was why don't we donate these mobile homes to the victims of Katrina. And I had the opportunity to ask the question everybody else would ask, was it their plan to move the folks in New Orleans to Baghdad or was it their plan to move the mobile homes from Baghdad to New Orleans? That actually happened, all right. 
   A third example: this isn't so much about wasting taxpayer dollars; it is about violating basic rules of political integrity really.     
   This whole question of global warming that people now recognize is real, it is urgent, and it is immediate. And I believe it is becoming a bipartisan consensus. We are not arguing whether it is true. 
   Well, we were arguing whether it was true. In our committee we had before us a press person that worked for the administration, and his job was to edit reports. Editing apparently included  taking scientific conclusions that were reached by scientists doing a scientific method, experimentation, drawing conclusions, maintaining academic integrity, and then putting them through what was an edit that was a political filter that actually changed the outcome of the scientific conclusions. And it was all intended to meet the political agenda of the administration that wanted to resist the conclusion that global warming was real, urgent, and immediate. 
   There are certain lines you can't cross, and that is one of them. The people of this country, obviously, are entitled to the benefit of honest science. Then we have to make a decision, all of us, about what to do with it, what policies should we pursue. But, bottom line, we have to have that integrity. 
   So these are just a few examples that I was exposed to as a Member of Congress serving on committees. And I think it reinforces the point that you are making because every American wants and is entitled to accountability, honesty in whatever element of the government we are working in, with our finances, with the services of scientists, and every other sector. 
   So my friend, Mr. Klein, those are a few of the experiences I have had serving on a committee here.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. It is really true. And it is not a partisan thing. I am trying to figure this out because all these things did happen on the Republican watch. And it is a Congress that I think turned its back on its responsibility. But I sometimes wonder whether that concentration of all power and a reliance on ideology meant that if you had an ideology and you had a set of facts and if they didn't fit, you would throw the facts out and stick with the ideology. But it is not a productive and winning strategy. So I have been mystified by it. 
   And, Ron, you and I come out of State legislatures that are smaller, where Republicans and Democrats tend to work together. You have this close relationship and a lot of this stuff just doesn't happen there. So it is mystifying to me how it happens here. But I think it is a lot less likely to happen now that there is a cop on the beat and that our committees are just checking under the covers to see what is going on.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Yes, I do. Every American is appalled at what was revealed, the degrading circumstances for our troops at Walter Reed. There were many things that were obviously disturbing about it, the vermin, the rodents, the peeling paint, the unsanitary conditions. 
   But that is the tip of the iceberg. What was really heartbreaking when you met the veterans was that they were completely lost and abandoned. We had people with head injuries that had very severe cognitive problems who were in an administrative morass and nightmare. They 
   were abandoned really for 4 months before anyone knew that they were there. 
   We had amputees who were a mile away from where they needed to be without prosthetics and were supposed to somehow find a way to walk to where their doctors' appointments were. The administrative breakdown was enormous, and it really reflected a culture of disregard. 
   One of the things that came out as we started investigating this situation out at Walter Reed was that the breakdown of services was very predictable because there was a substantial reduction in the number of personnel that were needed to provide the services. 
   Step one, you know that if you are having significant increased military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan, you have to anticipate you will have an increasing need for services to treat injured soldiers. 
   Two, in response to that, the government, the Bush administration, following its ideological hard line about privatization, put to bid certain services that were being offered at Walter Reed. It turned out that the government workers who were government workers had an opportunity to bid on that. They had the lowest bid. Mysteriously, and we still haven't gotten to the bottom of this, Madam Speaker, their bid was adjusted upward $7 million, not by them, but by the reviewer of bids. They then came in second, and the contract was awarded to a private company, IAP Worldwide Services. 
   Now, we don't know what the bottom-line connection is. What we do know is the following: Number one, what had been personnel of 300 went to 50. Now, it is cheaper to have 50 people on the payroll than it is to have 300, but you also don't get the job done, especially when the number of wounded soldiers is increasing. So that is shocking right away. 
   Number two, this company, IAP, had all kinds of problems, even though it received millions and millions of dollars doing Katrina relief. 
   Number three, the head of the IAP Company is a former very high executive in Halliburton, a company that I just have to say has ripped off the American taxpayer and made billions of dollars on this war in Iraq. 
   Now, how is it that there is a disposition that is so powerful that you put privatization and ideology ahead of a bottom line, the nonnegotiable bottom line that you are going to provide the services that our men and women in the service returning from Afghanistan, returning from Iraq need? It is absolutely and completely unacceptable. That shouldn't be a bipartisan thing. We ought to be doing whatever it takes to make certain that our men and women do get the services that they need. 
   Lack of accountability makes people lax. They are not looking over their shoulder knowing that somebody is going to be checking to find out if they are getting the job done, if they are ripping off taxpayers, if they are performing up to standards. 
   That is a major responsibility. We are candid with one another. We know that people are pretty fed up with government. The reason, there are a lot of reasons for it, but one of them is they don't have confidence that we are taking care of their taxpayer dollars. That gets so embedded in people's sense that they lose faith that the government will be there when there is a Katrina, when our soldiers are coming home from Iraq. Our job, together, is to restore that confidence by performance, not by talk; by accountability.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, the President's Iraq policy has been a complete catastrophe. It must be challenged. It must be changed. We must end this war. 
   The question we face is clear: Will Congress rubber-stamp a fifth year of a failed policy, or will Congress finally, after 4 straight years of lock-step compliance with an incompetent administration, compel a new direction that ends the war? 
   The President has arrogantly asserted that he will veto any measure with a timetable. Mr. Speaker, I will not support any bill without a timetable. If I had a chance to write this bill, like my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), I would bring our troops home yesterday. But I did not write this bill, so I must measure it based on three criteria: Does it impose accountability on the President and Iraqis? Does it revoke the President's blank check? Does it establish a date certain with the force of law that will end this war?     
   This bill meets each of these objectives. Regrettably if this bill fails, the war will continue, unchecked and unabated. 
   It is time for the Iraqis to accept responsibility for shaping their own future. Even President Bush has acknowledged the importance of imposing measurable benchmarks of success on the Iraqi Government. This legislation replaces Presidential lip service with congressional force of law. 
   There is a reason the President threatens to veto this bill: It is because Congress is finally revoking his blank check. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no easy way to clean up the mess in Iraq or to avert further suffering. Our obligation remains to decide, at this time and place, whether to stay the President's course or to end this war as soon as possible.  
   I will support this bill because it finally puts us on the path to end the unconscionable war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I believe you spoke for all of us on our side in putting in context the basis of this budget and the arguments of our friends on the other side. 
   I want to just add a few things about what this budget really is ultimately about. It's about real people, with real lives and real challenges, and the fundamental responsibilities of a governing body are to meet a budget and present a budget that meets the needs of its people. I want to tell a couple of stories about folks from Vermont. 
   Scott West, a veteran, of the National Guard, he lives in the town of Albany, in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. He used to drive a truck for a living before he went to Iraq. While he was deployed over in Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom he suffered very serious injuries to his shoulder, back and wrist. 
   In May the pain from his injuries got so bad he was no longer able to do his job as a truck driver. Nearly 9 months ago, Mr. West filed a claim for increased disability compensation from the VA. As of today, he has yet to have a hearing. 
   Now, the budget that we presented last year and passed, because you had foresight, has finally put in place new people to adjust these claims. We have got 1,800 new claims processors who are now going to help ensure that veterans like Scott will receive the support that they deserve in a timely manner. 
   I thank you for your leadership. That's the meaning of this budget to a man from Albany, and it's going to make a real difference to his family. 
   Peter and Irma McShane, they live in the southern Vermont town of Pownal. They are senior citizens. They live on $1,452 a month, so you can imagine how hard it is for them to make ends meet. Now it turns out that's $22 more than would be available if they were going to be eligible for food stamps. 
   So they have to scrimp and save every way they can. They get hit with this huge fuel bill. We have had a cold winter in Vermont. The budget presented by the administration cut low-income heating assistance. The budget that the committee is presenting tries to protect that, and it is absolutely indispensable to families like Peter and Irma McShane that they have the ability to heat their homes and not have to make a choice between medication and heat, between food and heat. This budget recognizes that. 
   I want to also share a letter I received from a couple from Fletcher, Vermont, in northern Vermont. Margaret Kinne and her husband. They are talking about the rising cost of health care. 
   They have worked in a woodworking business for 13 years, often 6 or 7 days a week. They don't complain about that. They like to work hard. But their insurance has gotten increasingly expensive and now their deductibles have gone from $5,000 to $10,000 to $25,000. What they wrote to me is this, this translates to me to no insurance. The administration budget would cause over a half a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that would increase the cost shift and make that unaffordable insurance even more out of reach of this family. 
   I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the tremendous work that you have done in putting together a very good budget in very tough times.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House is in session on a Saturday, a rare event. And why we do that, of course, is to finish up the work that is the culmination of the efforts of our committees that have then brought legislation to us to consider. 
   In this past week, we passed important legislation on employment discrimination, fair pay, an Iraq planning bill, Agriculture appropriations, and, very important, critical, actually, a children's health care bill. 
   Today, we are here to continue the business at hand, and that is to turn a new course for an energy future in this country that meets the needs and demands of the 21st century for a pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-high-tech approach to solving our environmental challenges and our energy security issues. 
   H. Res. 615 provides a single rule for consideration of H.R. 3221, the New Direction For Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act and H.R. 2776, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007. This will be a single rule. The rule provides a structured rule for H.R. 3221. It provides a closed rule as is customary in tax matters on H.R. 2776. 
   Today's legislation is about energy independence and creating a new economy around facing directly the energy and environmental challenges before this country. 
   This year more than a dozen of our committees began the challenging task of drafting energy legislation that, in a wide array of jurisdictions, can challenge the growing energy crisis. I certainly commend all of the committee Chairs, all of the Members on both sides of the aisle, particularly the long-term efforts of men like Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rangel, Chairman Waxman and others who have presented to us for the consideration of the whole body this comprehensive package of energy legislation. 
   Early in January, as you remember, the House passed H.R. 6. That repealed nearly $14 billion that were tax breaks granted to oil companies. Those tax breaks have been granted to oil companies at a time when they had record profits of $125 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House has made a different decision. What we have done is decided to repeal those tax cuts and invest that money instead in projects that are critical for renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives. This bill will provide long-term incentives for the development of renewable energy, and it will set the stage for a growing industry that requires investment in order to thrive. 
   One of the debates that we have been having is this: If we undertake the challenge of energy independence, will that harm our economy? This bill says that will promote our economy and create good jobs. We have seen across this country, in every State, entrepreneurs taking on the challenge of energy efficiency and energy efficiency in new technologies. 
   To give an example, in my own State of Vermont, we have a small company that began about 20 years ago, Energy Systems in Heinsberg, Vermont. They began developing technologies to help measure wind velocity for purposes of determining the feasibility of wind energy. It has emerged as one of our most prosperous businesses, creates good jobs, high-paying jobs, and it has been very beneficial to the economy of the State of Vermont, all-clean jobs, all-clean energy. 
   That example has been replicated across this country. This bill promotes that effort. The idea here in this legislation is very simple: If we make a commitment now to investing in our energy future, we can have that pro-growth, pro-high-tech, pro-environment economy. We can reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and we can protect our environment. 
   One of the potential opportunities that we have is the expansion of renewable energy development through carbon offsets. If that is going to be successful, it requires that these carbon offsets meet standards that are real, that are additional, verifiable and enforceable. 
   This legislation presented by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is going to allow us to put in place that methodology to help us offset our carbon emissions and create jobs in clean energy future. 
   There are many other parts of this legislation, since we have had 12 committees that have been involved: the Renewable Energy Worker Training Program, to help create a workforce of green jobs; the $2.5 billion investment to help rural communities, farmers and small businesses by reducing their energy costs through efficiency; the new efficiency standards for appliances, which require more efficient lighting and promotes green buildings in the public and private sector; and, of course, we have an effort under way here in Congress to green the Capitol and offset our carbon footprint by the year 2030. That is, at this stage, a bipartisan effort reflecting the mutual commitment to use less rather than more.     
   The committee has done a very good job in crafting a bill that we can be proud to support. It doesn't do everything. The CAFE standards are not a part of this, as that continues to be a debate. Renewable electricity standards are something that the body will be able to consider in an amendment that has been made in order. 
   But, taken together, all of the components of this bill mark a very serious and perhaps seminal change in the approach by this Congress towards energy, moving away from our excessive dependence on fossil fuels and moving towards a self-sustaining renewable energy future. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to finishing the job that we have started here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, there are two points I would like to make, one about the rule and one about the process. 
   I served 13 years in the Vermont State Senate, a small body, 30 members, sometimes in the minority, sometimes in the majority; and we had fierce fights about issues of enormous public concern, tax policy, environmental policy. In all of the time that I served in that State Senate, winning fights, but losing as many as I won, I never, ever saw the other side leave on an appropriations vote. Never. When you lose, you get up and you fight another day. That is what we learned. That is what all of us have learned. 
   There is a use of process here that has an effect of avoiding discussing substantive issues that are really of vital concern to the people of this country and the people that we represent. None of us can certify that the position we take at any given moment  is guaranteed to be the right one. We have to debate that, we have to listen to the other side. But we don't stop listening when it comes to our final decision, the ultimate responsibility that we have been given by the people who have elected us to stand in this well and to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' and to accept accountability for the ``yes'' or ``no'' vote that we take. 
   I do not understand, Mr. Speaker, walking out on a vote, most importantly, one involving appropriations for rural America. I don't understand the excessive use of motions to adjourn when it has no purpose, no purpose whatsoever other than to bring down the respect that the American people should have in this institution. I don't understand that. Maybe in time I will. 
   This bill brought forth by this rule is going the allow America to have a new debate on energy. It is that simple. The old approach on energy has been oil and fossil fuels. It has had a place and will have a place, to be sure. But the question is, are we going to continue with the public policy of this country, with subsidies as we have for mature industries like oil and nuclear, which in the 2005 legislation received $15 billion in taxpayer subsidies. That is real money from real Americans. Yet, as that happens, global warming expands, the price of gasoline increases. It is a dead-end policy, Mr. Speaker. 
   And the question that is going to be raised in this legislation for the decision of each and every one of us is whether we are going to turn a page on the old energy policy to a new one that is going to allow efficiency to matter. Using less, not more, saves money. The efficiency provisions in this bill will save tax ratepayers $300 billion. Whether we are going to use the power of tax incentives, a tax incentive budget to unleash the entrepreneurial skills, the engineering skills of people across this country in local communities, to harness wind, solar, renewable sources of energy, whether we are going to unleash the opportunity to create 3 million new jobs. 
   Let me say this: for all the good that is done by some of the energy policies that we have had, let's make the acknowledgment that there are many good things out there, every time a consumer in a local area, my town of Hartland, pays the light bill, most of the time that dollar that I pay gets sent hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away to a generator. And what we are trying to do in our State, what we are trying to do in many other States around the country is to have an energy policy that is going to allow consumers to spend their money locally so that the repair person that was mentioned that fixes the air conditioners, more of those people are going to have jobs. Every dollar that we keep in our local economy is strengthening our local economy. 
   Energy efficiency, renewable energy is about creating jobs, not just improving and cleaning out the environment. It is about independence and strengthening of local communities, not just shipping local money to faraway corporations. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we needed any wake-up call about why we have to turn a page and move in a new direction, it is in this morning's newspaper report about Toyota. Let me just read one paragraph: 
   ``Booming sales of fuel efficient cars helped lift Toyota to its biggest quarterly profit ever, and kept the maker of Prius Hybrid on pace to pass General Motors as the world's number one automaker.'' 
   That is not good news for us. What is good news for us is that we accept the challenge that is there, not run from it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and support this underlying legislation.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, at the outset I want to thank the dean of the House, Mr. Dingell. Last night I needed his help, and he gave it to me to help make this amendment in order. He told me a story, and it was a simple story: If you have a chance to help somebody, take it. And it is a good lesson to live by. Although, he didn't say he was for the amendment, I hope he finds the content of the amendment okay as well as being in order. And I want to thank his staff for the tremendous work they have done. 
   This amendment is very simple, Mr. Chairman. It establishes or authorizes the Federal fund to support energy sustainability and energy efficiency projects on colleges and universities campuses through grants, authorizes but doesn't appropriate. 
   Public institutions are playing a major role in this energy debate. They lead by example. Giving them the possibility of having funds to actually implement programs would be a very good thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   If a gentle breeze were to come into this room and dispel the fog of rhetoric that we've been listening to, we'd understand and return to the basic proposition that's quite simple, and that is, the budget of the United States Congress reflects the priorities of the United States Congress. 
   And what will be debated and the substance before the House is whether on the Labor-HHS budget we will appropriate and spend 2 percent more than was recommended by the President of the United States. What will be debated and decided by this House of Representatives is whether we will approve and spend 4 percent more for military construction in overdue services to our veterans. It comes to you from Chairs of subcommittees who are operating under the tight restrictions of pay-as-you-go budgeting that has been adopted by this new Congress after it had been abandoned by the previous Congresses. 
   So what do the American people have to judge us by what we do? It's this: first, we will pay for everything on a pay-as-you-go basis; second, when the President says that we're spending more than he recommended on Labor-HHS and for our veterans, we plead guilty. We're paying for it, but we're doing it because we believe it's overdue and it's right. 
   Think about the lack of investment that has occurred as a result of the clear priorities of the administration approved by previous Congresses: all Iraq all of the time and impoverishing our domestic programs, even as Americans are struggling to make ends meet.  
   The Labor-HHS budget does a couple of things that are very straightforward. It makes a fundamental commitment in the National Institutes of Health. It increases LIHEAP funding, Low Income Heating Assistance Program. Is it needed? Oil is at $93 a gallon on a barrel. 
   And on the veterans budget, this Congress has made a fundamental decision, and it's very simple again. The cost of the war must include the cost of caring for the warrior.     
   Yes, it's true, this VA budget is the highest increase that we have had in the history of the VA. Why? It's because it is absolutely necessary to meet the obligation we have to the men and women in uniform. 
   We will have an opportunity to vote yes or no. We will have an opportunity to state explicitly and be judged by the American people as to what our priorities are, and the priorities we have are to begin to renew our commitment to our veterans and to renew our commitment to basic science and investment in the people of this country.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, 1 year ago the American people went to the voting booths and voted for a new direction. This decision was not only asking for a new Congress, but asking Congress to head in a new direction. One area: Make America safer. 
   The last Congress ignored the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. This Congress is implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Our ports and skies are safer. Our first responders have better access to emergency communication. We are also recognizing very straightforward and directly that the cost of the war must include the cost of caring for the warrior, and that is why we have passed the largest increase in the veterans health care budget in the history of the Veterans Administration. 
   And finally, with cop-on-the-beat oversight, we have uncovered the scandal of tens of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse by companies like Blackwater and Halliburton that have benefited enormously from our appropriations.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee from Ohio. 
   First of all, I want to congratulate the outstanding work of the Science Committee under the leadership of Mr. Gordon and Mr. Hall. That committee has produced more bipartisan useful legislation, maybe, than any other committee so far in this body. They are to be commended. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is yet another nail in the ladder of creating opportunity and making this country competitive in the 21st century global economy. 
   I want to talk a little bit about what can happen if you have companies, large and small, that make a difference and commit themselves to training the workforce, commit themselves to participating in a local community to advance science and math. 
   We have small companies in Vermont that have done this. We also have a big company, IBM. It is celebrating its 50th anniversary in Vermont, and that will be later this summer. IBM is a major employer. It is a company that transformed itself from computers to services in a whole array of activities that has been beneficial and relied on having the best training for new employees, the best science and math. 
   That company has not only helped provide good jobs to Vermonters as well as people around the world, it has participated very actively in our State efforts to improve science and math training. This legislation is going to focus resources on that effort in Vermont and across the country. 
   My congratulations to the Science Committee for the good work that it's done and to the companies large and small across this State that have helped be a partner on these policies that are essential for the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6275, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1297 provides for consideration of H.R. 6275, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, under a closed rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   As Americans know, the alternative minimum tax was enacted in 1969 with a very legitimate intent: to ensure fairness in our tax system by avoiding the situation where very wealthy individuals don't pay taxes and to close loopholes. It is in the same spirit of fairness that we consider legislation today that will keep the middle class out of being hit by the alternative minimum tax when it was never intended that they would be caught up in its web and who have been because of inflation and because of no adjustments in the Tax Code. 
   The Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 will provide, one, 25 million Americans with over $61 billion in tax relief. Two, it offers property tax relief to homeowners and expands the child and adoption credits to parents. Nearly 50,000 families in my own State of Vermont, Mr. Speaker, will see tax relief from this legislation. 
   However, in order for the tax relief to be fair, we have to ensure that the cost of the tax relief is not simply passed on, the credit card debt, to our children, and we have already saddled the next generation with $9 trillion in debt, costing us $1 billion a day in interest payments, money that could be spent on other, much more productive things. Enacting an AMT patch today when we don't pay for it would simply shift that $62 billion burden from the middle class on to their children and their grandchildren. What we fail to pay today they will be forced to pay tomorrow with interest. 
   Furthermore, we do pay for this tax relief by improving the Tax Code. With the bill's offsets, we are closing two very large tax loopholes, one that has benefited very wealthy hedge fund managers at the expense of middle class taxpayers, and let me talk about that first. 
   The ``carried-interest'' loophole. It is a preferential rate of capital gains tax, a 15 percent rate that gets applied to income earned by many people who do financial work.     
   Right now, under current law, the income earned by many investment fund managers at a private equity firm, and hedge funds, are taxed at the lower capital gains tax rate. So you have this very unjustified situation where some of these folks who are making, in some cases, billions of dollars, pay a tax rate lower than the secretaries who work in their firms, and they do this when they don't actually put their capital at risk but manage the capital of others. 
   A second loophole that is closed in this bill stops major oil companies from receiving what is called a special domestic production subsidy through the Tax Code. As we all know, record gas prices, the record cost of a barrel of oil is resulting in oil company profits that are unparalleled in the history of this country, in some cases, as high as $11 billion in a single 3-month period. So it's clear that those companies are doing very well and that they do not need continued taxpayer assistance. 
   I commend Chairman Rangel and Chairman Neal and the Committee on Ways and Means for their excellent work on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, my friend from Texas characterizes a bill that will provide tax relief to 25 million Americans as a tax increase, and it is just flat out wrong. There are 25 million Americans. These are folks who earn between $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year, who, if we do not pass this legislation, will find themselves essentially being the target of legislation that was intended in 1969 to have millionaires pay their fair share. 
   We are talking about soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who get a job as a police officer or as a carpenter. We are talking about some our school teachers all across the country. We are talking about sanitation workers who are struggling hard on $40,000 or $50,000 a year, oftentimes with two people in that family who are working, raising three or four kids. We are saying in this legislation that we are going to protect you, because we know you need to have that money to pay your bills. 
   We also have to level with the American people. This is going to be $61 billion in tax relief for those incredibly hard-working Americans who are getting clobbered by these $4-plus gas prices. They can't fill up their tank. They have got cars or SUVs or trucks that they have to drive, and they don't have the money to get something that is a little bit more fuel efficient. A lot of them have long commutes. This legislation is going to give them the opportunity to keep a little bit more money in their pocket so they can make it from one end of the week to the other and can pay their bills. 
   Now, the question is for this Congress, do we pay for it, or do we put it on the credit card? As to what my friend from Texas is characterizing as a tax increase, let me go through it, because I think Americans have a commitment to fairness, and I think Americans know a very commonsense proposition, and that is we have all got to bear the burden. We all have to pay our share of the load. 
   There are two very glaring situations in the Tax Code, and attention should be paid to them, and it is overdue. One is this hedge fund exemption, where folks who make an awful lot of money pay at a capital gains rate. What is unfair about it? If you are a financial advisor, if you or I ask someone to help us figure how to invest our money, we pay them a fee, and of whatever earnings they get, they pay a regular tax rate just like any other American. Whatever that rate is--15, 20, 35 percent--that is what they pay. 
   If you are a hedge fund executive and you make billions, because of this provision in the Tax Code, which I am calling a loophole, they get to pay at a 15 percent rate. That is costing the treasury billions of dollars, and it is also a glaring unfairness, because you literally have a situation where the hedge fund manager who is doing the same work as another financial advisor down the street pays one rate, 15 percent, while the other person doing the same work, working just as hard but who is perhaps making less money, pays 35 percent. 
   You also have this bizarre situation where the person making this immense amount of money pays a much lower tax rate than the secretary, than the back office help in that very same firm. I think most Americans see a basic fairness, and let's have the income tax rate apply to earned income. That is what this provision does. 
   The second question is on the oil company exemption, and I am using the word ``loophole.'' What is a ``loophole''? I think, commonly, you know it when you see it. What a ``loophole'' is in this case is giving taxpayer benefit to very successful companies that do very well in what they do--explore for oil, sell it. We are taking money from the taxpayers of America to give it to major American and foreign oil companies. These are mature industries that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, and they don't need taxpayer help. 
   So this legislation provides 25 million Americans with tax relief, and it is the folks who need it. It asks other Americans, the hedge fund executives, to pay at the income tax rate, and it has oil companies foregoing what has been an incredibly good deal--tax credits that they get at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. The legislation does two things that are good and one thing that is very good in its absence. The two things that are good are one, it addresses very specifically, in a practical way, the housing crisis that has been brought on by the subprime foreclosure debacle. 
   What it does is it shares the opportunity of relief and it shares the pain of getting the relief so that we can end up at the end of the day with several hundred thousand American families still in their homes, lenders having been able to mitigate their loss, homeowners being able to keep a roof over their head, and the American taxpayer not being left on the hook. 
   It does it by recognizing we have to use existing institutions to accomplish that. It does it by acknowledging that it has to be voluntary. A lender will be in this program only when they make the practical business decision that it is a better route than foreclosure. A borrower is going to be able to make that same change and has to be able to demonstrate an ability to pay at the new current appraisal value of that property. And in the process of doing that, it means that we use the guaranty of the taxpayer, but in all likelihood, according to the CBO score, not the money of the taxpayer. 
   So it is a practical solution to a very severe problem that could only have been brought to this House for consideration with the extraordinary cooperation of both sides in the Ways and Means Committee, the Financial Services Committee, and the help of high administration officials who had significant input along the way. 
   And it would be very unfortunate if the procedural debates that we are having about process, made at the leadership level, derail what is a practical approach to solving a very serious problem. What this bill isn't, and I congratulate the Members on both sides as well, it is not a blame game about who caused this. That is for another day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, this week we received more proof from Iraq that the President's troop escalation plan is failing. 
   A senior U.S. military commander told the Washington Post yesterday that if the President really wanted to stem the violence in Iraq, he would have to send an additional 20,000 U.S. troops there, something that no American would support. But even then, it appears that Iraq will remain incapable of taking full responsibility. Iraq is in a civil war, and our troops, it is not the job of our men and women in uniform to be refereeing a civil war. 
   Last week, one of our generals put a surveillance out to determine who was laying these IEDs that are killing our troops, and it turned out to be Iraqi security forces, people who work with us by day and then were trying to kill our soldiers by night. 
   It is time for Democrats and Republicans to work together to bring the President to his senses, to change the direction of the war in Iraq.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, there's a new regulation that was in the process of being promulgated that did a practical and sensible thing for taxpayers: it required contractors who receive over $5 million of taxpayer money to report fraud when they are aware it happened. 
   At the last minute, there was an exemption that was put in so that foreign contracts were not subject to taxpayer protection. That makes no sense and flies in the face of reason. 
   By exempting overseas contracts, and this is Iraq and Afghanistan particularly, the Bush administration is sending an unambiguous message: it's okay to rip off taxpayers when you spend money abroad; just don't do it at home. 
   Not only must we stop this reckless rule, but we must have answers: What was the rationale for the loophole? How did the loophole get slipped into the proposed rule? And who advocated for it? 
   Through a thorough investigation, we will stop this rule and get some answers.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (THE DEFICIT -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my friend, Representative Sutton. This evening gives us an opportunity to take account, to look at the record, and reveal it to the American people. We are in a season close to an election, where the American people are going to have to make a decision, and it's going to be an extraordinarily consequential decision. In the fog of a campaign, there's an awful lot of rhetoric back and forth, where those who have not done much try to conceal it with claims that they did, and try to shoot down the progress that has been made. 
   Now we all know that when we get going, and we are going to solve our problems, it's going to have to be working together. We have been doing our best to do that. But what we have to do tonight is lay out what the record has been. 
   What I want to talk about briefly are two areas; one is deficit, to continue what my friend, Representative Sutton was talking about, and the other is on Iraq. The reason I want to talk about them specifically is because it is important for the American people to know what they can expect from our friends on the other side who have a clear record, and it is one that they are accountable for, but it has to be one that Americans are aware of. 
   On deficits, taking up on what you said, let me just read some quotes from  members of the administration to remind the American people of what was promised, and then lay out some facts about what actually was done. 
   ``Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term.'' George Bush, in January of 2003. ``We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits even if the economy softens. Projections for the surplus in my budget are cautious and conservative.'' George Bush, March 27, 2001. 
   ``We are holding down government spending and reforming government, and the good news is the deficit is coming down.'' OMB Director Jim Nussle, June 22, 2006. ``I don't like deficits, I don't want deficits, and I won't pretend deficits don't matter.'' OMB Director Jim Nussle, March 12, 2003. 
   ``Today's announcement by President Bush confirms that the pro-growth economic policies put in place by Republicans are working as planned to spur economic growth and reduce the deficit. Republicans are meeting our commitments to the American taxpayers by exercising fiscal restraint in promoting economic policies this create jobs, all efforts which have produced a strong economy that is working to drive down and eventually eliminate our deficit.'' John Boehner, October 11, 2006. 
   What are the facts? That is the rhetoric. What are the facts? President Bush and congressional Republicans, his allies, have turned a projected 10-year, 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion into a projected 10-year deficit of $3.4 trillion. That is a swing of $9 trillion in one Presidency. When President Bush took office, there was a projected surplus of $710 billion for fiscal year 2009. 
   President Bush's budget will create a $407 billion deficit for fiscal year 2009. That is a swing of over $1 trillion. 
   Under the Bush administration, Republicans created the five largest--one, two, three, four, five--five largest budget deficits in American history, $378 billion, $413 billion, $318 billion, $407 billion, and $438 billion now projected. 
   The first 42 Presidents, the first 42 American President's, borrowed a total of $1 trillion. That was during wars, by the way; World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, combined. That is the total amount borrowed from foreign governments and financial institutions. 
   In the 7 1/2 years of the Bush Presidency, President Bush has borrowed more than $1.6 trillion. He borrowed more in 7 1/2 years than 42 Presidents did in over 100 years of our history. 
   When President Bush took office, we had a national debt that was $5.7 trillion. During his administration, that has nearly doubled, and will reach $10.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2009. 
   This administration has presided over a fiscal train wreck, and it is creating obviously a deep hole that we have to climb out of, the American people have to climb out of, and it's a record of rhetoric of rosy fiscal scenarios with reckless policies that have caused, in a short time, 7 1/2 years, the greatest explosion in the debt of the United States government, which belongs to you and me and the generations that will come after us, that we are going to have to repay, and it will take generations to do. 
   I will yield back my time to the gentlelady from Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Well, I do have something to add. I just want to go back to the question of Foreign Affairs and the war in Iraq, and I want to do what I did the last time when I was talking about the debt, which is to lay out some of the explicit statements and promises that the administration made about this war and then lay out what the specific results have been. It's important. It's vitally important that the people of this country compare promises to results. This war, in my view, has been a catastrophe, but here is what top officials in the Bush administration said: 
   ``It is unknowable how long that conflict [the war in Iraq] will last. It could last 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months,'' Donald Rumsfeld, February 2003, a month before the war. 
   ``There's a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people. We're dealing  with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon,'' Paul Wolfowitz, former Deputy Defense Secretary, March of 2003. 
   Of course, our friend from Florida has outlined the truth that the Iraqi money is in U.S. banks. Treasury money is going over to Iraq to finance things. 
   ``My belief is we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators,'' Vice President Dick Cheney. How bright he was, yes. March 16, 2003. 
   ``It's hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would to take to conduct the war, itself, and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army. Hard to imagine,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. 
   ``I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority,'' President George Bush, Commander in Chief, March 2002. 
   ``If we're an arrogant Nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble Nation but strong, they'll welcome us [in Iraq],'' George Bush. 
   We know the facts. The war in Iraq has now lasted longer than the U.S. involvement in World War II. Four thousand one hundred fifty-five Americans have been killed in Iraq, and more than 30,000 troops have been wounded as of September 7 of this year. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found. That was the whole pretext that George Bush used to justify this war. 
   More than $600 billion has been spent, none of it on the books incidentally, all on the credit card. Some projections estimate that the war, when all of the expenses are paid, including what we have to pay to provide health care to our seriously injured soldiers, will exceed $3 trillion. 
   The Iraqi Government has now forced the Bush administration to accept something that many of us have been arguing for four years, a timetable. It took the President of Iraq to force the President of the United States to get real and to understand that what we can expect of the American taxpayer and what we can expect of the American soldier has its limits and that it's time to start asking the Iraqis to step up and to take on the burden of their own future. 
   America's military is stretched thin. There is just no dispute about this. It weakens our ability to respond to other threats. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael Mullen, has stressed that the need for more troops in Afghanistan is great, but due to the war in Iraq, they're not available. The Bush administration has grossly neglected Afghanistan and has failed to acknowledge that that is a major threat. 
   These are promises, the cavalier disregard for the hidden consequences, the consequences beyond your control when you embark on a war, on a thoughtless war, and disregard the need to build up alliances like George Bush's father did in the first Gulf war, and you cavalierly go off with promises, reckless promises, irresponsible promises by people in positions of great trust. The greatest trust that they have is that they have a duty to use due deliberation in the protection of the lives of the American people and of the American soldiers. They have to use due deliberation, careful thought, responsible analysis in committing American power abroad and in committing the lives of our soldiers abroad. They cavalierly made predictions. Vice President Cheney will go down in history as just having been totally out of touch.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 1419 provides for the consideration of H.R. 3667, the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic Study Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources, makes in order three amendments printed in the Rules Committee report, and provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Representative Grijalva, Ranking Members YOUNG and BISHOP for helping to bring this bill to the floor today. And I would like to thank the staff of the Natural Resources Committee for their very hard work on a bill that is of great importance to my State of Vermont. 
   The Missisquoi and Trout Rivers are two of the most beautiful rivers in the most beautiful State in the Nation, and that, with all due respect to the man from Washington, I claim to be the State of Vermont. These rivers are bordered by the largest and perhaps the highest quality silver maple floodplain forest remaining in our State of Vermont. They are also home to diverse animal life, including brook trout, rare freshwater mussels, and spiny soft shell turtles. It's a favorite walking, hiking, fishing area for many people in northern Vermont and, indeed, from Upstate New York and all around Vermont. 
   Additionally, the Missisquoi River is part of this extraordinary 740-mile northern forest canoe trail, which is home to some of the best flat-water canoeing in Vermont and in the Northeast. Both of these rivers are highly valued by the surrounding towns and the communities. It has great recreational areas, swimming pools, and boating. Vermont parents that grew up swimming in these rivers take their kids back there, and it's a place in Vermont of just extraordinary scenic and natural beauty. 
   The bill, as these study bills all do, provides for a study of the two rivers, and it represents a first step toward protecting Abenaki Indian archeological sites along the flood plains, protecting scenic waterfalls and gorges, and a way of life that has been in these communities surrounding the two rivers for generations. 
   Passage of the rule will allow the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic River Study Act to be considered on the floor by the full body, and I urge support of this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, my friend from Washington. We better get back to the focus at hand, because now Vermont quality beer has been challenged as well as the beauty of Vermont rivers. So we will just call this part of the debate a draw and proceed. 
   Two things in response to comments made by my friend from Washington. Number one, it appears that there are no reservations or no stated objections to the study itself that is, frankly, quite important to Vermont. This is a very special part of our State that has the opportunity with the benefit of this study to be preserved for generations ahead, just as it has been cared for and enjoyed by generations in the past. So it is a very, very serious issue to the folks in Vermont. It is just a very special place. 
   The gentleman has not raised any specific objections. His objections are more in the nature of spending time on this instead of spending time on something else. So I would urge the Members to take that into account when they are voting on the previous question. 
   Second, I will address the energy arguments. This has been the refrain on the part of our friends on the other side as a response to every piece of business that we are doing on behalf of the American people. I think it has become apparent that this has become much more of a political debate than it has been an effort substantively to solve a very, very serious problem. Let me give a little commentary about that. 
   Number one, my friends on the other side have been in control of this institution and had the Presidency and the control of Congress for the past 12 years, until this Congress, and had an opportunity to enact comprehensive energy legislation when it was quite apparent to the American people that the problem of our excessive dependence on oil was a real and urgent problem. 
   They did nothing. In fact, the energy act they passed quite astonishingly provided taxpayer incentives, tax deductions, tax credits, to oil companies that were enjoying record profits. It is a mature industry, it is a profitable industry, yet the energy policy that was pursued and failed by our friends on the other side during the 12 years they were in charge basically was to give oil companies more taxpayer money. 
   It made no sense. There was no effort to use the power they had of the majority to bring to the floor legislation that would promote alternative energy. There was no effort to take the power that they had and provide tax incentives for the alternative energy industries that we know we must support if we are going to reduce and ultimately eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I won't yield. My intention, my friend from Washington, is to respond and bring this to a close, thank you. 
   So, number one, we are hearing objections from people who when they had the power to do the things they  claim they want to do, didn't use the power they had to accomplish those objectives. 
   Number two, when we have brought forward legislation and passed it, it has been with their objection. And what they claim they want to do are many things that we did over their objection. I will give a few examples. 
   To deal with the short-term price pressure at the pump and with home heating oil, this House of Representatives passed legislation that I sponsored to stop filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and take off some of the demand on oil. That has contributed to helping bring down the price of gas at the pump by 5 to 25 cents a gallon. 
   Secondly, this House of Representatives has gotten tough on speculators. The evidence is overwhelming that part of the runup in the price of gasoline when it was heading up to $150 a barrel was because of the speculative control and influence of hedge funds in foreign trading operations. We brought to this floor legislation, and just the fact that we did it finally, when it was ignored and accepted and mollified by our friends who were in control for 12 years, has helped bring down that speculative premium. 
   There is no justification for any one of our constituents when they pay for a gallon of gasoline or a gallon of home heating oil or a cubic gallon of natural gas to have included in their price a speculation premium for profiteers, and this Congress passed legislation to challenge that, against the opposition of our friends on the other side. So we have taken very specific actions to try to do what we reasonably can do to bring down the price pressure that is ripping off the American consuming public. 
   Second, we have passed energy legislation that is comprehensive, again over the opposition of our friends on the other side. One of the things we did was provided for tax credits for the alternative energy industry. We have to do that. That is of urgent, vital economic and environmental concern to this country. 
   We passed legislation that took away the tax breaks that are going to oil companies. There is no basis whatsoever to ask the taxpayer to pad the profits of a mature and profitable industry. They don't need it. They are doing quite well without additional taxpayer money to their bottom line. 
   But the new industries, the alternative energies that my friend from Washington mentioned, wind and solar, geothermal and biomass, they do need a boost, and historically when we have been at our best is when we have had the wisdom to use tax policy in a targeted and focused way to give a boost to these emerging industries and technologies that are good for the American economy and good for our environment, and that is what we need to do. 
   We have passed this in the House several times. Our friends on the other side opposed it. Our friends in the Senate won't move on it. We are prepared to do it again. But the suggestion that has been made repetitively, over and over again, that the leadership of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives is standing in the way of energy policy is flat out wrong. It is flat out false. Why is it being offered? It is being offered for political purposes, I would suggest. 
   Now, let me tell you this: That although we have passed comprehensive energy legislation several times in this House, although each time we have done it we have had to overcome the opposition of our friends on the other side, and although every time we bring up a legitimate piece of legislation that is part of the public business that this Congress must conduct, whether it is a study on the Missisquoi River, an energy bill or any other bill, every time we do our friends try to cease the debate and distort what has happened, we are prepared, as the gentleman from Washington knows, we in the Democratic Party, our leadership is prepared to bring up yet another comprehensive energy bill that does include all of the above. 
   The fact is, on our side we have passed all of the above time and time again, against the opposition of our friends on the other side, and then it has run into a brick wall in the other body or the steadfast opposition of the President of the United States. But the gentleman from Washington is aware that the leadership is prepared to bring up yet another bill to give us another opportunity to do the right thing. 
   Let me say this: I actually think it would be great to work together with the other side. I come from a State where we shift majorities back and forth. Sometimes the Democrats were in control, sometimes the Republican were in control. I was the senate president and I was the minority leader. I learned that in order for us ever to get anything done, we had to ultimately work together. I also came to understand that neither side had an absolute claim that they were the only people who had a good point of view, who had an iron grip on truth. 
   I believe that it would be best for all of us if there was some willingness to try to work on the substance, rather than just use this as a political football, and my observation is that for whatever reason, it is tough to get to that point here in the House of Representatives in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I wouldn't yield, my friend, because I will be bringing this to a close. 
   I want to take the opportunity, as I must, when the assertions are made, falsely in my view, that the Democratic leadership is standing in the way of energy policy change, that is just flat-out wrong. The energy for energy reform has come from the leadership on the Democratic side. Frankly, it has come from the American people, who are tired of a Congress that passed off as an energy policy giving more money to the oil companies. 
   We have to make a fundamental decision in this hyper-political atmosphere of a presidential election whether we want to continue politics as usual, which in my view is a dead end, or we want to work together to achieve what we know is important for the American people, that is, short-term relief for prices at the pump, and it is a long-term energy policy that frees us from the dependence on oil from foreign countries. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, having said that, let me just close by coming back to this very important bill. It is a study. It is not necessarily important for many other parts of the country. But one of the things that makes this Congress and this country great is mutual respect. When there is a disaster in the Gulf Coast, all States pull together to help out. When there is flooding in the Midwest, all States pull together. When there is an opportunity for a small State like Vermont to take a step with Wild and Scenic River study that will help us and help our citizens enjoy the beauty of our land, I seek the help of my colleagues to let us accomplish that goal. 
   It is my request and my urging that all Members vote ``yes'' on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate the excellent work you did and your eloquent description of a beautiful river. If I have any say about it, we're going to make you an honorary Vermonter and bring you down that river and make you paddle your way from one end to the other and have you see for yourself how beautiful what you described really is. Thank you. 
   I want to respond to some of the comments. 
   Mr. Chairman, my opinion is that one of the greatest Presidents of the United States was Theodore Roosevelt. He came to the Presidency when his predecessor was assassinated. It was a time of great turmoil, social and labor unrest, a need for corporate reform, trust busting. President Roosevelt had his hands full taking on those economic challenges. 
   He was a war President. The skirmish in Cuba and the Philippines were still very much alive, and he had to deal with that as President. Very serious issues with the Supreme Court. And in the midst of all of that he still found time to be a peacemaker and was the winner of the Nobel Prize for the work that he did in bringing together the Soviet and Japanese conflict and helping those folks resolve the end of that war. 
   But Theodore Roosevelt was also a person who respected and did more, perhaps, than anyone else to protect our environment. And amidst his responsibilities, where he had to simultaneously deal with enormous economic anxiety in this country, when he had to deal with foreign affairs that involved making America a strong country and bringing together peace in other countries, he would never, ever, busy as he was, urgent as his demands were, belittle the work of the House of Representatives when they were taking up what is now being characterized as a ``waste-of-time bill'' because it involves two rivers in the State of Vermont. He wouldn't do it. He's a bigger man than that. 
   He reflects the leadership that we can provide to the American people where we simultaneously take on the challenges, as President Roosevelt did, but also pay attention to the posterity that is our responsibility to leave behind. 
   I just want to say as a Vermonter, I want to say as a Member of the House of Representatives that if we can't find time to do those things that are going to allow us in Utah, in Arkansas, in Arizona and in Vermont to save our rivers and to do what is going to preserve our country and leave behind legacies like President Teddy Roosevelt did with the National Park Service that we revere and enjoy, then we don't deserve the vote of confidence that we get from the folks who send us here. We can do both. 
   Now my friend from Utah has essentially made an argument that there is more important business to be done, as if that suggests we don't have time to do other important business about protecting and preserving our environment and having mutual respect for the particular concerns, in this case, of Vermont.     
   But it's that same comity that has allowed us to come forward and step up as Vermonters and Arizonans to help the folks in the Midwest from their flood and to respond to the gulf coast with the damage that they sustained. It's political. That's what we know. 
   The reality is our friends on the other side had 12 years in control here and their energy policy was one thing: give tax breaks to oil companies. You can't make that up. Oil companies are doing well. I don't begrudge them their profits. But why do you reach into the taxpayers' pocket and ask taxpayers to give the most profitable corporations in the world, running a mature industry, doing well, why do we ask the taxpayers to give them $13 billion? When you reveal that fact, they don't even know how to respond because you can't make that kind of stuff up. 
   So this House of Representatives, under the leadership that now is being castigated for a failure of leadership, has repeatedly passed legislation against the objections, almost unanimous, of our friends on the other side, to stop filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to squeeze out the speculative premium in the price of a gallon of gas at the pump. That can provide some short-term relief. We did that. We passed comprehensive energy reform, again, against the objections of our friends on the other side. We took away the tax breaks from the oil companies, not because oil companies are a target. They're doing important work. They know how to do their work and they know how to do it well. But why in the world would our friends on the other side want to give $13 billion in tax breaks to a mature and profitable industry when that money comes directly out of the pockets of American consumers who need that money in their pocket to pay the price at the pump? They've resisted that. They opposed it. 
   Our friends on the other side are also aware that even though we have passed legislation against their objection, it has gotten stalled in the other body, threatened with veto by the President, we're ready to do it again. Our motto is  try again, try again, and keep going because, bottom line, we want to address that problem. And we have actually been doing things in our 2 years on the watch despite their resistance when they had 12 years to get the job done and essentially caved into the interests of the oil companies. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, as a Vermonter and the sponsor of this bill, I want to object to what is really a rhetorical and political device, and that is ridiculing the importance of these two rivers to the people of my State for a partisan political argument. Energy is incredibly important and we have delivered. We've put substantive proposals on the floor. They have been debated and they have been passed. They've been stalled in the Senate or threatened with veto by the President. We're prepared to do it again. We're also prepared to reach out to the other side because we all know that in the end if we are going to be successful, we do have to work together, particularly where we have divided government. But it takes two sides, two bodies, and a President to be willing to do that, and it has not been forthcoming. 
   So I want to go back to a very simple fact. This legislation is about allowing Vermonters to have a study for scenic status on two rivers that are very precious to us, places where moms and dads have taken they are kids, taught them how to hunt, taught them how to fish, taught them how to be families, taught them responsibility. And there is a place for us and a time for us to do that as well as face these large issues like energy, like the war in Iraq, like redefining our foreign policy. So this is a very important piece of legislation to us, and I, as one Member of Congress, object to having it be held hostage to what is essentially a political game that's been going on far too long. 
   And I want to thank the chairman for the tremendous work that he's done. And, Vermonters, thank you as well.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. The question before the House today is really very simple: Will the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the world, pass legislation that guarantees access to health care for all the children of the citizens of this country? 
   Many of our States, including Vermont, have taken the lead. They answered that question in the affirmative: The children of working parents, children whose parents are doing the right thing, should have the health care they need when they need it. 
   That has been done on a bipartisan basis. Republican and Democratic Governors in my State of Vermont have supported access to health care for our kids; 98 percent are covered in Vermont. 
   Why is it that this Congress has been unable to take that step until today? We will change that. It is the right thing to do. It is good for our kids. It is good for our country. It is well within the reach of this Congress to do. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that our friends on the Republican side will join us in what will be a historic day for our kids.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just described, H. Res. 404 provides for consideration of H.R. 1427, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007, under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. As of the date required for filing, 36 proposed amendments have been printed and met the preprinting requirement. 
   Mr. Speaker, affordable housing is absolutely critical as an issue to many Americans and certainly to folks in my State of Vermont, as well as yours. Along with food, health care and energy costs, affordable housing can make all the difference in economic survival, and we must begin to take seriously the challenge of affordable housing for renters and perspective homeowners. 
   In Vermont, just to give an example, affordable rental units, we have a shortage of about 20,891 rental units, short of what we need for working families in Vermont. They need in Vermont an annual income of $29,000 to afford a statewide average two-bedroom apartment. 
   The challenge of home ownership, in addition to renting, is daunting. While many low- and moderate-income households aspire to own their own home, limited supply, rising costs and other significant barriers can make that dream out of reach. Beginning in 2005, the new construction of 12,300 owner-occupied homes in Vermont was needed to meet the demand expected in 2010, not something that most Vermonters think will be possible. 
   The average purchase price for an average single-family home in Vermont in 2000 was $144,000, a lot less than it might be in the City of Washington, but beyond the reach of many Vermonters. But 5 years later, in 2005, the average price had increased a staggering 60 percent to $232,000, and very few families have seen their paychecks rise 60 percent in the past 5 years. 
   More than 1 million low-income households across New England, including the elderly, disabled and families, live in federally assisted housing. Most of these households have annual incomes of less than $8,000, well below the poverty line. They are at serious risk of homelessness. Even larger numbers of households are struggling to survive in the private housing market and are paying more than 50 percent of their income for rent. 
   In 1995, the housing community started facing dramatic changes in Federal housing policy, including funding cutbacks, program reforms and the devolution of responsibilities to State agencies who lack the funds to meet the need. Budget cuts aimed primarily at low income people presented an enormous challenge for communities across the country. Vermont and the whole of New England region, due to its high housing cost and large stock of subsidized housing, was one of the most heavily impacted regions in the country, but by no means unique. In the past few years, we have witnessed even more dramatic cuts to the important Federal housing programs, such as section 8, again imposing enormous burdens on our local communities. 
   The crisis of affordability is not just a well-crafted political phrase. It is a fundamental fact in Vermont and around the country, and it is a problem we must begin to address, as this bill, H.R. 1427, does. 
   What H.R. 1427 does is ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate in a safe and sound financial manner and they fulfill the responsibilities assigned under their charters given to them by Congress. These government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs as they are called, support the mortgage market, and this bill establishes strong independent regulation and enhances GSE responsibilities under their mission. 
   The bill also creates the first new funding source for affordable housing since the HOME program was created in the early 1990s, and it does it without asking the taxpayers to pick up the tab. The $500 million affordable housing fund, which housing advocates in Vermont and around the country are very excited about, will be used for the badly needed construction and preservation of affordable housing. 
   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and several of the Federal Home Loan Banks have experienced considerable accounting, financial reporting and managerial problems in recent years. Unacceptable. Significant operational safety and soundness issues have arisen since 2001 that highlight the need to fortify the supervisory structure for all the regulated GSEs. This bill will do that. 
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Corporation, Freddie Mac, were chartered, as you know, by Congress in 1934 and 1970, respectively, in order to create a secondary market for mortgages and increase liquidity. 
   Through their charters, GSEs are granted special privileges not available to other private sector firms. For example, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase up to $2.25 billion of the enterprises' obligations. Additionally, GSEs are exempt from State regulation, State income tax and SEC registration, substantial benefits conferred to meet a public need of providing affordable housing. 
   In January 2003, Freddie Mac announced that it needed to revise its financial statements, resulting in a special review by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as OFHEO. 
   In November of the same year, following the discovery of accounting irregularities and a reorganization of its management, Freddie Mac announced that it had overstated its earnings by $1 billion in 2001. An investigation into that is ongoing. The company said that the error, restating its earnings by that $1 billion, stemmed from failure to properly account for derivatives activity. 
   In December 2003, OFHEO reported that Freddie Mac disregarded accounting rules, internal controls and disclosure standards, again all completely unacceptable. Furthermore, the report found that the company had misstated its earnings overall by $5 billion between 2001 and 2003, and that the Board of Directors had failed to exercise its oversight responsibility. This has got to be corrected. 
   This bipartisan bill takes an important first step to provide effective oversight of GSEs in response to the 
   lack of affordable housing that plagues so many of our communities.  
   Specifically, H.R. 1427 does the following: 
   Federal Housing Finance Agency: It establishes this as an independent regulator that oversees the safe and sound operation and mission function of the housing GSEs, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. 
   Director and Deputy Director: The FHFA will be led by a Director appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 5-year term.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1427, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007 ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the GSEs that support the mortgage markets, operate in a safe and sound manner and fulfill the missions assigned to them under their charters. 
   The bill does this through the establishment of a strong, independent regulator and through the enhancements to the GSEs mission responsibilities. The bill also creates the first new funding source for affordable housing. Since the HOME program was created in the early 1990s, it's been almost 20 years since we have put any infusion of money from a new source into a growing crisis in housing. The $500 million Affordable Housing Fund, which housing advocates in Vermont, in your State and States all across this country are very excited about, will be used by them for badly needed construction and the preservation of affordable housing. 
   Very similar legislation, as has been discussed between my colleagues from Texas and from Massachusetts, passed this House on a strong 331-90 vote last Congress, and this bill, H.R. 1427, was approved in the Financial Services Committee by a bipartisan vote of 45-19.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, three points. First, why is this an emergency? It is an emergency because the administration has never funded this war on the books. The people who will pay for this are the sons and the daughters of the men and women in the military who are now fighting it. That is wrong and irresponsible. 
   Number 2, the military has done its job. They were asked to get rid of Saddam. He's gone. Find weapons of mass destruction. They don't exist. And allow Iraq to have democratic elections. They have had three. 
   Third point, the President says ``no'' to timetables. Of course we must have timetables. How else to hold the Iraqi politicians responsible? They have to have an oil law. They have to renounce sectarianism in the security force. And the only way that we are going to stop asking our military and our taxpayers to referee a civil war and to finance it is by having the President of the United States do what he must do and say we want accountability from the Iraqi political leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Florida for her national leadership on an issue of national importance, Head Start. 
   Later today I will be joining with my colleagues, Representative Space from Ohio, Representative Hare from Illinois, and Representative Altmire from Pennsylvania to offer an amendment that will require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay special attention to the unique needs and challenges that our rural kids face to have access to Head Start. 
   This is a great program, as was described by my colleague from Florida, but there is a misconception oftentimes that Head Start is about urban America, poor kids from cities. In fact, there are many poor kids from rural America that benefit from access to Head Start, and as a federally funded national program, we know the different communities have different needs. 
   The National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, in fact, acknowledged this when it issued a report that found several issues to be particular challenges for rural America in access to Head Start: transportation, workforce, enrollment fluctuation, performance standards, health requirements and financial matching. 
   What we know is that one size does not fit all, but what we also know is the opportunity for all is an essential American goal. 
   This amendment, when it is offered, is directing the Secretary to make certain that those special challenges that our rural kids face in America are included in an execution plan so that there will be opportunity for the rural kids as well as the urban kids.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PASSING A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a comprehensive energy bill, regrettably with almost undivided Republican opposition. That was disappointing because we had a chance to  work together. In fact, this bill incorporated two things--one, a recognition that we need to continue getting the supply of oil to make it from here to there, but second, we needed a sustainable revenue source to invest in R&D and to invest in implementing alternative energy projects. The energy plan of the Republicans, cooked up by Vice President Cheney in secret, has been very good for the American oil companies, not for the American consumers. 
   So far this year, oil companies in a down economy have raked in $44 billion in profits. That's seven times the amount of profits Big Oil brought in when President Bush was first sworn into office. 
   What has the energy plan done that the President pursues or that our colleagues on the other side pursue? $4 gasoline. It's costing $2,500 more to heat your homes. 
   Mr. President, it's time for us to work together and to get our colleagues in the Senate to pass that bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (SECTION 202 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank very much my colleague, Mr. Mahoney, for his excellent work on this legislation and Mrs. Capito for her excellent work on this bipartisan legislation. 
   It is incredibly important to America's seniors, Vermont's seniors, that they have security in housing as they age. And that is a challenge because we are getting more folks older and incomes are not keeping up. H.R. 2930 addresses the issue in a timely and overdue way.     
   It improves HUD's section 202 program, providing low-income elderly households access to affordable places to live. It is the only program that provides housing exclusively for the elderly. Established in 1959, it makes capital grants and project rental assistance available to developers so they can build housing that is affordable to low-income elderly households. Over 320,000 housing units are currently available. 
   But it is not enough. There are 10 seniors waiting and in need for every housing unit that is available, and approximately 3.6 million of our seniors across the country in every State live in poverty. This bill is going to help make a down payment on what needs to be done. The U.S. population is aging; 12.4 percent are over 65, but in 18 years that is going to be 20 percent. We are going to need 730,000 units of housing. So I thank the sponsors, the leaders, to begin the process of moving forward. 
   I want to mention just in a very practical way something that Mrs. Capito said. Housing is a partnership. What it does is unleash the activities of volunteers in our communities and housing advocates, and they brought this to our attention. 
   Grand Way Commons in Vermont, opened by the Cathedral Square Corporation, is going to have a housing project that is going to help 63 families, seniors, have access to housing, and they are combining it with services from United Way, from AARP and from the Vermont Nurses Association. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote in support of moving ahead for senior housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, the basic question that we face in America is the basic question we face in Congress, and that is, are we going to turn the page on a fossil fuel-based energy policy that needs to change? Are we going to embrace an alternative energy policy that is going to allow us: A, to protect our environment; B, to create jobs; and C, to give us much more flexibility and independence in foreign policy? 
   This legislation is a step along the road of a new energy policy and a new future for this country. This is not just something that is going to do the things other speakers have spoken about, but it is a partnership with our States. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the Vermont Senate approved a very wide-ranging energy bill that's going to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The bill that we pass today will partner with that bill and work its way through the Vermont legislature by providing tax incentives that will stimulate a growing market all around the State and the country. This legislation is going to provide up to $3.6 billion in interest-free financing to help our State and our local governments finance environmental conservation and efficiency programs. 
   We all have our positions on how this affects oil. Oil is doing pretty well, $100 a gallon. Consumers aren't. We are looking for ways to provide relief, but we are looking for ways to protect our environment at the same time. 
   What this legislation embodies is a confidence that we have the technology and the intellectual strength in this country to forge a new energy policy that is renewable, that in the process can create jobs and work well with our States who are often ahead of us here on providing that leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Frank and his Committee staff, particularly Scott Olson, for working with me on this important bill to reach a compromise on issues in the bill affecting small states. 
   The legislation as a whole creates a national housing trust fund for the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of an estimated 1.5 million units of affordable housing for low-income families. Along with food, health care, and energy costs, affordable housing can make all the difference in economic survival. 
   In Vermont, we have a great need for affordable housing. While so many low- and moderate-income households aspire to own their own home, limited supply, rising costs, and other barriers can make this dream out of reach. Beginning in 2005, the new construction of 12,321 owner-occupied homes in Vermont was needed to meet the total demand expected in 2010. 
   Creating a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund is the brainchild of my predecessor in the House, Bernie Sanders, and I thank him for getting the ball rolling. 
   I am grateful to Chairman Frank for including two items I recommended into the manager's amendment. The first provision will ensure that each State receive at least one half of one percent of funding. For a State agency, there really is a funding level below which it's incredibly inefficient to administer a Federal program. There are always numerous Federal requirements resulting in a tremendous amount of work to comply. In addition, it's hard to raise the expectations of those who would potentially benefit from the program and then have very little money to deliver. 
   Furthermore, numerous social programs, including the HOME program to which this trust fund is similar, include small state minimums. For programs that are targeted at a need that is universal, it is a pretty rational argument that a mechanism should be in place to ensure that a portion of funding gets distributed  nationwide. In this case, for something like housing, it is a nationwide issue so the appropriations of Congress should be a nationwide effort. 
   The second provision in the manager's amendment says that within the participating local jurisdictions pool of funding, that each State has at least one local jurisdiction receiving funding. Currently in the bill, for a local jurisdiction set to receive less than $750,000, that amount is reduced to zero. Without this guarantee, many small cities and small States risk receiving no funding under this section of the bill. 
   I thank the Chairman for his excellent work on this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2881, FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 664 provides for consideration of H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The resolution provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and  ranking minority member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The rule makes four Democratic amendments and four Republican amendments in order. 
   H.R. 2881 is a very important piece of legislation last updated in 2003. We are here today to make very critical reinvestments in aviation. And I want to thank, on behalf of the Rules Committee, the excellent work of Chairman Oberstar, the excellent work of subcommittee Chair Costello and Ranking Member Petri. 
   This bill authorizes $37.2 billion for Federal Aviation Administration operations, $13 billion for FAA facilities and equipment, $15.8 billion for the Airport Improvement Program, and $1.8 billion for research and engineering development. The $13 billion provided for FAA facilities and equipment is significant and will work to accelerate the implementation of the next generation air transportation system. This enables the FAA to make needed repairs and upgrades. This is very important to small airports across the country, including 18 State, municipal, and private airports in my State of Vermont that were all satisfied with the work of this committee, that balanced the needs of small, medium and large airports. Quite an accomplishment. 
   I recently read the Department of Transportation estimates up to a tripling of passengers, operations and cargo by 2025. This obviously will require airports across the country to make capital improvements, as well as to make readjustments to compensate for this growth. 
   H.R. 2881 takes action to decrease delays. All of us will welcome that improvement in the current system. The funding levels will allow the FAA to replace and repair existing facilities and equipment to prevent outages and other equipment failures that are a cause of delay. 
   The bill adjusts for inflation the passenger facility charges for the first time in 7 years. These fees, essentially user fees, are used at airports all over the country to make important facility improvements that would otherwise not be possible. This has been very helpful again in small airports like Burlington in Vermont where the funding stream has made this a modern airport, very convenient for the people, and a competitive airport for the region. 
   The rule makes in order Mr. Oberstar's amendment, which includes the Essential Air Service Program, something that helps small regional airports get service that otherwise they wouldn't have. I speak from my own experience: the Rutland Southern Vermont Regional Airport has used this to provide service and help create economic growth in the Rutland County area. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the bill also takes steps towards ensuring our continued safety by increasing the number of aviation safety inspectors, funding programs to increase runway safety inspectors, funding programs to increase runway safety, and requiring regular inspections of foreign repair stations. 
   I was especially encouraged to see there are provisions within the bill recognizing the impact that the aviation industry has on the environment. This bill establishes landmark new environmental provisions to reduce emissions and energy consumption. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1338, PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Chairman, I salute you for the work you have been doing on this issue and the issue of equality for women and the issue of equality for all people, and I salute Chairman Miller for his work in Congress, for being on the verge of passing this legislation. 
   You know, it is truly shocking that we have a situation where there is a difference in pay depending on whether you are a man or a woman. You have heard the statistics. But what is even more shocking is we had a Supreme Court that probably when history is written, its most shameful decision will be denying relief to a woman on the basis of a claim that she did not know existed. The Supreme Court said that when this person had been discriminated against for years and didn't know about it, it was the burden on her to know about something that was actively being hidden from her by her employer. It is a shocking decision by our United States Supreme Court, and this Congress has an opportunity to overturn that. 
   H.R. 1338 is going to address that loophole. The wage gap that strikes women immediately upon entering the workforce is bad, and it gets worse. Ten years after college, women earn only 69 percent of what men do. The wage gap adds up quickly over the course of a career, $400,000 to $2 million over a lifetime. This discrimination can cost women security and retirement. Older women are less likely than older men to receive pension income, and when they do, they only receive about one-half the benefits that men do. It can cost a woman half their pension that would be comparable for a man. 
   Because of the wage gap, more women than men experience poverty or teeter on the edge of poverty. Seventy percent of older Americans living in poverty are women, and that is directly as a result of wage discrimination. 
   The hope of the American Dream is that people who work hard will get ahead regardless of their gender, regardless of their race, regardless of their national origin, and it is the challenge of this Congress being met by the promise of this legislation to make that American dream of equality of opportunity available to all people and to absolutely prohibit discrimination in wages solely on the basis of the gender of the person doing the work. 
   H.R. 1338 has 230 cosponsors. It is also supported by major women's and workers' rights advocates, including the National Committee on Pay Equity and the National Women's Law Center. I ask for a ``yes'' vote and unanimous passage by the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (GRANTING CONSENT TO INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from New York. 
   There is a reason, Mr. Speaker, that all of the Senators from the New England States, all of the Members of Congress from the New England States join in support of this resolution. Their legislatures and their governors all support this, as well as the legislatures and the premiers in the provinces of Canada that have been mentioned. That is because we need each other in a moment of weather disaster. 
   As the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) referred to, there was a severe ice storm in 1998 and this response that we had in those New England States, with the help of the provinces, was helpful to alleviate some of the suffering, but not all. This is fundamentally important in order that we be able to cooperate to the mutual benefit of folks in the New England region and in the Canadian provinces. I want to express my gratitude to the Foreign Affairs Committee, my gratitude to my friend from Texas. I am sorry that Texas isn't part of this because then we would really be in good shape.     
   And I want to thank Mr. Crowley and the members of the leadership staff and the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee for moving this forward on such an expedited basis. 
   The more we can cooperate to help each other, the better all of us are going to be. And as my friend from Texas would say, ``That's just the way it is.''  
   We must all do our best to prepare for the most serious emergencies that can harm our communities. As those who live in the Northeast know, extreme weather is not uncommon in New England, or in the eastern provinces of Canada. Together with our Canadian neighbors, we have endured catastrophic blizzards and ice storms over the years that have closed roads and highways, shut down power for extended periods, and stranded travelers and rural residents for days, or longer. During these events, we turn to our first responders and our emergency management professionals to provide assistance and secure public safety no matter how grave the danger, and no matter how challenging the task. 
   The IEMAMOU compact was created in response to the devastating ice storm of 1998. In January of that year, an unprecedented 3-day ice storm paralyzed portions of the northern New England States and the adjacent Canadian provinces, causing massive damage to the electrical and transportation infrastructure. Millions were left in the dark for days and even weeks, leaving more than 30 dead and shutting down normal activities in large cities like Montreal and Ottawa. Following this devastation, the governors and premiers of those regions affected recognized the need for greater cross-border emergency cooperation, and they directed their emergency management leaders to develop and create a memorandum of understanding on these issues that benefit all parties north and south of the border. The IEMAMOU compact was the result of this collaborative, international process, and now stands as a model compact for cross-border mutual emergency assistance. 
   The compact allows for international sharing of resources and expertise in times of extreme emergency or disaster. The IEMAMOU compact meets these needs with a thoughtful and forward-looking outline of how to address issues that face first responders and their managers in times of cross-border emergency. 
   This international compact provides a legal framework for cooperation and mutual assistance between the States of Vermont, New  Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the Canadian provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The compact requires each participating member, whether State or province, to formulate plans and programs to facilitate international and interstate or provincial cooperation in case of natural or manmade disaster, technological hazard, or civil emergency. 
   All members of this compact have agreed to its terms and join in requesting Congress's consent for the agreement. Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have joined the IEMAMOU compact, and many of these States have passed legislation adopting the compact under State law. The premiers of Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have similarly approved of the compact. The IEMAMOU compact has been functioning in principle for more than 5 years, as the emergency management leaders from each member State and province meet twice a year. Planning among the constituent members of the compact is also ongoing. This compact works well and should be supported by Congress. 
   The IEMAMOU compact is an international agreement between States and a foreign power, and it cannot have the full force of law without the formal approval of Congress. The U.S. Constitution requires that ``[n]o state shall ..... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power'' unless with the ``consent of Congress.'' U.S. Const. Art. 1, &#167;10, cl. 3. The joint resolution introduced today provides this necessary consent, and would give legal force to the compact. Congressional approval of this compact would also provide jurisdiction for Federal courts to resolve any disputes under the agreement. 
   This joint resolution is vitally important to the New England States and our Canadian provinces to the north. Congress should support their cooperative, international leadership in creating and implementing this unique emergency management compact. The Governor of Vermont supports this joint resolution as do the leaders of the North East States Emergency Consortium, which represents each of the New England States in the compact. 
   It is time to take action and pass this joint resolution without further delay. The IEMAMOU compact provides invaluable international cooperation and mutual assistance in times of natural disaster and extreme emergency. This compact works well for New England and the eastern Canadian provinces, and it stands as a model for emergency management planning and cooperation across this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the distinguished Chair and the good work of my friend from Florida. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Resolution 742, the rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act. 
   This important legislation protects the public's right to know while at the same time honoring the public interest in having reporters testify in certain circumstances. While news organizations prefer to have their sources on the record whenever that is possible,  we all know there are times when sources will simply not come forward without the promise of confidentiality, and that's in the public interest to get the information those sources have. Consider groundbreaking stories such as conditions at Walter Reed, Abu Ghraib, the Enron scandal, steroid abuse in the Major Leagues would not have been known to the public or the Congress without confidential sources. And over the past few years, more than 40 reporters and media organizations have been subpoenaed or questioned about their confidential sources, their notes, and their work product in criminal and civil cases in Federal court. 
   The need for this legislation was underscored when on August 13 a Federal judge ordered five more reporters from major news organizations to reveal their confidential sources in the privacy lawsuit filed by Dr. Steven Hatfill against the Federal Government. 
   If sources, including public and private sector whistleblowers, are uncertain whether reporters have adequate protection, they won't come forward in the public dialogue and important issues will diminish. 
   The shield is qualified, as it must be. If the information possessed by the journalist is necessary to prevent an act of terrorism, imminent death or significant bodily injury, or harm to national security, disclosure can be compelled. 
   While 49 States and the District of Columbia recognize a reporter's privilege through statute or common law, no uniform Federal standard exists to govern when testimony can be sought from reporters. Journalists should be the last resort, not the first stop, for civil litigants and prosecutors attempting to obtain the identity of confidential sources. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H. Res. 742 and ``yes'' on the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 741 provides for the consideration of House Resolution 734, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the withholding of information relating to rampant corruption in Iraq, corruption that is being used with taxpayer money from our country. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   Resolution 734 expresses the explicit sense of the House that the State Department, our State Department, has abused its classification authority by withholding from Congress and the American people information about the extent of corruption in the Maliki government. The resolution further condemns the State Department for retroactively classifying documents that had been widely distributed previously as unclassified and by directing State Department employees not to answer questions in an open forum.     
   Madam Speaker, we are in the fifth year of this war. We have lost over 3,700 of our best young men and women. By the time this war is over, many experts anticipate that the cost to the taxpayers will exceed $1 trillion. General Ricardo Sanchez, a retired commander, last week described the situation in Iraq as an absolute nightmare with no end in sight. 
   This war started on the basis of bogus information: the threat of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist. Hard questions that should have been asked weren't asked. The war continued for years, until November of 2006, with a Congress that was a rubber stamp for whatever it was that the executive agencies wanted. Those days are over.  
   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has been pursuing relentlessly article I powers of this Congress to accept its responsibility on behalf of the citizens of this country to ask questions and get answers; yet the State Department is refusing to allow relevant information to be disseminated to the members of that committee. 
   Madam Speaker, let me go through the history. On October 4, 2007, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing regarding the extent of corruption within the Iraqi Government. David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United States, and Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, testified that entrenched corruption in the Iraqi Government is actually fueling the insurgency, undermining the chances of political reconciliation, which, incidentally, was the whole point of the surge strategy of General Petraeus, and that this corruption is, in fact, endangering our troops. 
   The former Commissioner of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, testified that his own investigation documented at least $18 billion in money stolen by corrupt officials. He stated that Prime Minister Maliki personally intervened to prevent the investigation from continuing. 
   Each witness that day provided evidence suggesting that corruption within the Iraqi Government was tantamount to a second insurgency. Specifically, David Walker testified that widespread corruption undermines efforts to develop the government's capacity by robbing it of needed resources, some of which are used to fund the insurgency itself. Similarly, Mr. Bowen testified that corruption in Iraq stymies the construction and maintenance of Iraq's infrastructure, deprives people of goods and services, reduces confidence in public institutions, and publicly aids insurgent groups reportedly funded by graft from oil smuggling or embezzlement. 
   Judge al-Radhi testified that corruption in Iraq today is rampant across the government, costing tens of billions of dollars, and has infected virtually every agency and ministry, including some of the most powerful in Iraq. He further stated that the Ministry of Oil is effectively financing terrorism. 
   Madam Speaker, after hearing this testimony, which can only be described as shocking, the Oversight Committee heard from Ambassador Lawrence Butler, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. Members of the committee asked the obvious questions, very simple, very straightforward: A, whether the Government of Iraq currently has the political will or the capability to root out corruption within its government; B, whether the Maliki government is working hard to improve the corruption situation so that he can unite his country; C, whether Prime Minister Maliki obstructed any anticorruption investigations in Iraq to protect his political allies. Simple questions; no answers. 
   Ambassador Butler refused to answer any of these questions at the hearing because on September 25, 2007, 7 business days before this hearing, the State Department instructed officials not to answer questions in open setting that called for, basically, answers. In the jargon of the State Department, you couldn't answer a question that called for ``broad statements or assessments which judge or characterize the quality of Iraqi governance or the ability or determination of the Iraqi Government to deal with corruption, including allegations that investigations were thwarted or stifled for political reasons.'' 
   It is astonishing; $1 trillion, over 3,700 lives, a war that has no end in sight, that was based on misinformation. Now, with billions of dollars gone missing, no one is disputing this is as a result of corruption, not just bad decisions. The State Department is directing the people who have answers to deny answers to Congress and to the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, the thrust of this resolution is very simple. It is whether Congress has the right and the will to demand that it get answers on behalf of the American people about this most catastrophic foreign policy blunder. 
   In addition to preventing officials from answering questions about the corruption in Iraq, the State Department retroactively classified two reports written by the Office of Accountability and Transparency, one of the two primary entities established by the State Department to lead U.S. anticorruption efforts. So we turned the Office of Transparency into the ``Office of Obscurity.'' 
   These reports were initially marked ``sensitive but unclassified,'' and they suddenly, by fiat of the State Department, became ``confidential.'' The State Department also retroactively classified portions of a report that was released and distributed at that October 4 hearing by Comptroller Walker. It addressed the commitment of the Iraqi Government to enforce anticorruption laws. 
   As a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I and my colleagues witnessed firsthand the State Department's absolute, adamant, willful, and really intransigent refusal to testify about Iraqi corruption. That is why the committee believes so strongly in the support of this resolution. 
   The resolution states in very simple and plain language what every American, I think, believes they are entitled to. One, it is essential that Congress and the people of the United States know the extent of corruption in Iraq. Two, it was wrong, not right, but wrong, to reclassify documents that are embarrassing but do not meet the criteria for classification. Three, it is an abuse of the classification process to withhold from the American people broad assessments of the extent of corruption within the Iraqi Government. Four, the directive issued by the State Department on September 25, 2007, prohibiting its officials from discussing the state of Iraqi corruption should be, indeed must be, rescinded. 
   Madam Speaker, corruption within the Iraqi Government is unacceptable. It undermines the efforts of this country; it undermines the efforts of the honest people in Iraq to build a civil society. We have no recourse but to demand from the State Department that they tell us the facts and not withhold them because they are embarrassing and don't serve what has been a self-serving and misguided policy since its inception. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, before I yield to my friend from Massachusetts, I would like to just comment on a few of the observations and statements made by my friend from California. 
   First of all, I agree with him that Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis have worked cooperatively and extremely well. And, in fact, there was an effort to maintain that tradition here when Chairman Waxman last Wednesday delivered a copy of the text of this resolution to the minority with specific heads-up that this resolution was going to be introduced on Friday and with the request that comments or edits be provided in a timely way so that the introduction could occur on that day. 
   The edits were not presented until Monday, just before the Rules Committee meeting. So the good news here is that that cooperative approach continued. Mr. Waxman, in his usual gentlemanly and collegial way, made apparent what his intentions were, provided the language and opportunity for response, and it was not forthcoming. So that's the story. 
   The gentleman from California will have an opportunity to respond on his own time, so I won't yield at this time. 
   Secondly, the premise that on a matter of enormous public importance where it is our lives, it is our money that is imperiled, that is being wasted, that Members of Congress could sacrifice their capacity to be a representative of the people that we represent by accepting a classified briefing on something that is profoundly public in nature is flat out rejected by the committee and by most Members of this Congress. 
   When we are asked to go get a private briefing up in the Intelligence SCIF with a requirement that we sign an oath that we can't reveal anything that we learned, it means that the State Department has succeeded in its goal of keeping secret information that should be made public. So that is not simply an option that makes any sense if we are going to move ahead. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 734 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished Chair for joining us. I thank my friend from California for cooperating in this debate and giving his usual vigorous presentation of his side's point of view. I want to address a couple of things that came up. 
   One, my friend from California said basically that this is a resolution attempting to appease the Out of Iraq Caucus. And he used the word ``appease.'' 
   It is not about that. But I will confess that I am a person who is strongly opposed to this war, believe it was the wrong decision, it was based on false information, and it is the single most terrible foreign policy blunder that our country has embarked upon. But this resolution has nothing to do with that profound question. 
   What this is about is not who favors corruption. Nobody favors corruption. But it is about who tolerates secrecy. If we tolerate secrecy while we criticize corruption, don't we, in fact, condone the corruption to which we avert our eyes? 
   How will we talk about the facts? How can we talk about the facts which my distinguished colleague from California says he wants to talk about when the State Department denies us the facts? 
   If we are going to root out corruption in Iraq, don't we have to destroy the wall of self-serving State Department secrecy here in our own government? 
   It has been said on the other side that corruption is everywhere. Human nature. No argument there. But if corruption exists elsewhere and it is their money and their future, that is one thing. If corruption exists in Iraq with our hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and our soldiers and their lives, then it is our problem. And we not only have a right, we have a responsibility, Madam Speaker, to do every single thing we can to get to the bottom of it and to stop it. 
   It was also said that in Iraq it is just another government with some corruption. We owe it not just to our own citizens, our own soldiers; we owe it to our allies and our friends in Iraq to do everything we can to help those good people who are there standing up to fight corruption back here. They need our help. 
   Let me just tell you some of the testimony that Judge Radhi presented to us about the incredible peril that folks in Iraq are subjected to when they try to fight for an honest government. Judge Radhi held that position for 3 years, until he finally resigned amid repeated death threats to himself, his family, and his staff. 
   He testified in our committee that 31 of his employees had been killed, not injured, killed, as well as at least 12 of their family members. Judge Radhi's home was attacked by rockets, by a sniper's bullet barely missing him as he stood outside his office. He testified about how one staff member was gunned down with a 7-month pregnant wife. He testified about how the father of a security chief was kidnapped and then literally found hung on a meat hook. He testified about how another staff member's father was killed; and when his dead body was found, a power drill had been used to drill his body with holes. 
   These are officials who are fighting corruption in Iraq, and they are being gunned down, they are being assassinated, they are being tortured; and we are supposed to be standing idly by. 
   When we ask questions of the State Department what is going on and they take a document that yesterday was unclassified and today make it classified, that is not acceptable. The State Department anticorruption efforts have been a mess. And basically what the State Department is doing is just enough so that they can claim they are trying to do something about corruption; but basically it is status quo, as it has been since the day this war began. 
   We have to make a decision as Members of Congress that is very simple: we are real, we are serious, or we aren't. And it is about tolerating secrecy, depriving us and the American people of information that we are entitled to, that we must have in order to do our job; or it is turning a blind eye to those folks in Iraq who are standing up on our side and finding their bodies of loved ones drilled with holes and hung on meat hooks. It is not acceptable. The American people know it is not acceptable. 
   We may have an administration that disregarded the vote of the American people in November when they said they wanted a new direction in Iraq. We may have an administration that disregarded the recommendations of an eminent bipartisan group in the Iraq Study Commission. And we may have an administration that has dismissed and disregarded votes in this House and the Senate, making it clear that we want a new direction even as we struggle to find what that is. But we cannot, any of us on either side of the aisle, accept being an enfeebled Congress that isn't entitled to get the information that our Congress needs to do its job. It is that simple. 
   And that is what this resolution is about. That is what the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is about. That is what Chairman Waxman is standing up to assert and defend, and that is our constitutional responsibility. Not just prerogative, but constitutional responsibility to do what is required to defend our Constitution, to protect our soldiers, to stand up for our taxpayers, and to restore democratic tradition in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, let me thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and her staff and Mr. Chabot and the work that he has done, not just helping me on this amendment but the extraordinary productivity of the Small Business Committee. It has been an oasis of bipartisan cooperation and accomplishment in this legislative session. 
   I'd also like to thank the cosponsor of this amendment, my colleague from Iowa, Congressman Bruce Braley, a member of the Small Business Committee. 
   We've heard about the HUBZone program, that it provides assistance to small businesses located in historically underutilized business zones, or HUBZones, through limited competition contracts, sole source awards, or price evaluation preferences in full and open competitions. The Federal Governmentwide contracting goal for HUBZone small businesses is, as you know, Mr. Chairman, 3 percent. It's a very effective program. 
   Across the country, more than 11,000 firms operate and employ people in distressed areas; 56 of these are located in Vermont. Eligible areas cover more than 7,000 urban census tracts, 900 rural and suburban areas. 
   Historically, the HUBZone program has encountered some difficulties in rural areas, specifically in the way the program is defined. The current definition limits what SBA can do in looking at large areas versus small, and it makes it tough on rural States, like Vermont and many other rural parts of the Nation. 
   In Vermont, for example, the entire Northeast Kingdom is a HUBZone, as well as all of Lamoille County. Other than that, only part of Burlington, Rutland and St. Albans are in the program, and this has left out some obviously what would appear to be eligible communities in towns like Springfield, Brattleboro, Bennington, Barre, Bellows Falls, and other parts of Rutland City. 
   Small businesses critical in Vermont, just like everywhere else, create two out of every three new jobs, produce 39 percent of the gross national product, and is responsible for more than half of the Nation's technological innovation. 
   My amendment with Mr. Braley is very simple. It would direct the SBA to conduct a study on how the HUBZone program is working to reach rural areas. The study should examine how HUBZone is defined, whether that definition works in rural areas as well as it does in urban and suburban areas. It makes specific recommendations of possible alternatives to better capture eligible or needy communities that so often exist in rural areas. Not only does it call on the administration to review whether needy communities are being left out, it also assesses whether areas within the program comply with the program's original intent. 
   Mr. Braley and I urge our colleagues to support this amendment.     
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from New York. 
   This bill has many good features, and I want to speak about two. One is energy and two is children. 
   If we are going to take on the challenge of energy independence, then we have to start providing incentives, as we do in this bill, for wind, for solar, for biomass, for alternative energy and efficiencies. It is a confident Nation that takes on that challenge. It is a submissive Nation where the leader of our country goes hat in hand to a country that is not our friend and asks him to solve our problem by pumping more oil. This moves us in a confident direction of independence, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance. 
   The second is children. It is troubling I think to many of us in this country, and many of us in this body, that the gap between the wealthy and the poor has never been wider. The top five hedge fund managers last year earned $12.6 billion. The 9 million lowest income families, that was their equal income, $12.5 billion. 
   This bill finally increases the earned income tax credit for low-income families, bringing down the floor to $8,500, and 15 percent above that is going to be eligible. Do you know what that is going to mean just in the State of Vermont? 21,000 kids are going to get help. 21,000 kids. It also means 77 low-income kids from military families are going to get some assistance. This is money in their pocket where they too can be self-reliant.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 362, 10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 327 provides for consideration of H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Science and Technology. The rule waives all points of order against the bill, except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule also makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for consideration of two amendments that  were submitted for consideration. A third amendment was submitted, but was withdrawn by its sponsors. All three amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee were offered by Democratic Members. 
   H.R. 362 is a bipartisan bill aimed at improving K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education through recruitment, training, mentoring and professional development of teachers. 
   The major provisions of H.R. 362 are in response to recommendations laid out by the National Academy of Sciences in their recent report on American competitiveness. That report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' identified K-12 science and math education as the highest priority policy recommendations. This legislation intends to implement those important recommendations. The report concluded a comprehensive and coordinated Federal effort is urgently needed to bolster U.S. competitiveness and preeminence in these areas. 
   This report, initiated, as you know, by Congress, makes four recommendations along with 20 implementation actions that Federal policymakers should take to create high-quality jobs and focus new science and technology efforts on meeting the Nation's needs. Those include, one, increasing America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 mathematics and science education; two, sustaining and strengthening the Nation's commitment to long-term basic research; three, develop, recruit and retain top students, scientists and engineers, both from the U.S. and abroad; and, four, ensure that the United States is the premier place in the world for innovation. 
   According to that report, in 1999, 68 percent of U.S. eighth graders received math instruction from a teacher with no, repeat, no math certification or degree. Also, according to that report, in the year 2000, 92 percent of the fifth through ninth graders, our kids, were taught physical science by a teacher with no science degree or certification. In 2004, the United States high school students ranked 24th, 24th, out of 29 countries in math proficiency, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, obviously a situation that is not tolerable. 
   This bill makes important strides towards achieving the goals laid out by the National Academy of Sciences report. H.R. 362 will authorize $1.5 billion to be appropriated for new and existing programs within the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy that support the training and professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. H.R. 362 addresses the academy's highest priority recommendations to invest in elementary and secondary education. 
   In summary, H.R. 362 creates programs at colleges and universities to improve the training of science, technology, engineering and math teachers; increases the size and duration of scholarships provided for those fields for people who become teachers; authorizes teacher training for advanced math and science courses; establishes a National Science Foundation grant program to support teachers institutes, including summer institutes for working math and science teachers; establishes master's degree programs for working math and science teachers through the NSF; and creates centers for improving undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
   The bill also authorizes scholarships for students majoring in these STEM fields who commit to teaching in our K-12 science and math programs. 
   The legislation has very broad support among our Nation's leading education and research institutions and broad bipartisan support in this body. 
   H.R. 362 will improve teacher preparation by providing our Nation's teachers with the necessary professional development, and it should improve our students' achievement by strengthening our math and science curriculum. 
   The reason for this legislation is clear: by 2010, one in four new jobs will be technically oriented, or will involve computers. Women still lag far behind in earning computer technology degrees and working in computer technology related professions, a situation we hope to change. 
   Constituents from my home State of Vermont have expressed their belief that this legislation provides the forward-thinking policy our Nation's education system requires. 
   H.R. 362 will provide a particular benefit to rural regions because of the number of rural school districts that currently don't have the resources to get these jobs done. High school lab courses not only reinforce what is going on in lecture, but obviously capture the attention and engagement of our students. These are useful tools for our students to acquire, no matter what career path they choose to follow. 
   An additional 10,000 math and science teachers across the United States will help ensure that our Nation can capture the imagination of our young people and give them the tools they need to succeed in the careers of science, engineering, technology, and math. The bill also supports the purchase of laboratory equipment, absolutely essential to achieving these goals, that will upgrade facilities in the development of programs that integrate laboratory experience with classroom instruction.     
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 362 to invest in America's competitiveness. That is essentially what this bill is about. This bill will have a great impact on our teacher preparation, will strengthen and expand the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, and attract more of our best and brightest students into these fields. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is a step that is going to move this Nation ahead in the important areas of improving science, math, technology, and engineering. 
   It is absolutely crucial that our country remain competitive. It is a disgrace that we are 24th out of 29 countries as measured in our performance in K-12 instruction in these critical areas to our present economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to thank Chairman Dingell for his leadership on energy issues and for assisting in bringing this legislation to the floor for consideration by the full House. 
   I want to address a couple of observations by my friend from Texas. Number one, the revenues that would be generated from drilling on Federal lands  would go into the Treasury. And there are many uses and debates that can be had about whether that money ultimately should go into alternative energy, whether it should go into LIHEAP, and those will all be had in due course as part of other legislation. 
   The question that we have before us today is whether or not taking a small step that in the past has been taken by this President Bush, by his father, by President Clinton, that when it has been taken has proven to actually have a direct and immediate impact on lowering the price of gas at the pump from 5 cents to 25 cents a gallon. 
   All of us know, we're going home every weekend and we're hearing from our constituents. It doesn't matter what district we're in, it doesn't matter what part of the country we're from, folks are really feeling burdened by these ever-escalating home energy heating bills and the cost of filling up their pick-up truck and their car. And basically the question for us is whether or not, even as we have to proceed with long-term debates about our future energy policy, this Congress is going to be willing to take a short-term step that has the potential to bring down energy prices. 
   You know, we could go out and clap, but I actually think this would be more effective. History tells us that, in fact, when we've used this Strategic Petroleum Reserve as an asset belonging to the American people and suspended purchases--and incidentally, this Strategic Petroleum Reserve is nearly full, we're talking about topping it off, it's very expensive to do so now with $126 per barrel oil--that when we've done it in the past, it has actually reduced that pump price. And just two examples of what it would mean in my small State of Vermont. I talked to a trucker from Barre, Vermont; they've got a company and drive a lot. It would put $300,000 on his bottom line if the price of gas went down 25 cents. A school district in a rural area, it would be $30,000 off their bottom line if we could get the price down 25 cents. 
   No one here is suggesting that this is an answer to our energy situation. What we are suggesting--and, really, recommendations on a bipartisan basis--is that the tool that's within our reach we should use and do all we can on a short-term basis even as we debate long-term energy policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I want to answer a few questions that were raised by my friend from Texas. First of all, the question is how, when it's such a small amount of oil, 70,000 barrels a day, can suspending purchases have an impact on the price? 
   There are two things, number one, history has shown that when the Federal Government, on behalf of the consumers of this country and the small businesses, have used this Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help alleviate market pressures. It's worked, and the previous speakers have recited how it happened with this President Bush, the prior President Bush and President Clinton. We have history as a guide that says taking this action does work. 
   Second, the reason it works is that one of the problems we have in the oil market is speculation. There was legislation passed in 2002 by Congress that included a loophole that allowed the deregulation of the energy futures trading market, and there is enormous evidence, that that has allowed hedge funds and arbitrageurs and speculators to impose a premium in the cost of each barrel of oil and in the cost of a gallon of gas. 
   The fact is, if the Federal Government is showing, particularly on a bipartisan basis, that we are going to use the levers that we have, even in a short-term way, to protect the consumer against the speculator, then that has a chastening impact on speculation and helps bring the price down. 
   Third, the process. My friend from Texas is the distinguished ranking member of that committee, but this issue about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is well worn. In fact, it's been used before, as I mentioned, so it's not all that complicated. We are doing it only for the period of 2008 in respect to the wishes of the chairman. 
   The Senate has passed the Reid-Dorgan amendment by 97-1, essentially the  very same proposal that we are considering today. The bottom line is this, will we take the short-term actions that it's within our reach to take that have a proven capacity to help the consumer? 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.

   You know, they have said it pretty well. There's nothing that we can say or do that will acknowledge our appreciation for the sacrifice that the men and women of the uniformed services have given to this country. 
   What we are acknowledging here is that we have a common commitment to meeting the needs of those soldiers and sailors and airmen who return from active duty. What we are also acknowledging is that in this war, very much unlike past conflicts, our soldiers, benefiting from this extraordinary battlefield medicine, are returning with extraordinary injuries. That is what they will have to live with for the rest of their lives. 
   Many of us have had the opportunity to visit some of these soldiers out at Bethesda, out at Walter Reed. We are trying, in this small gesture, to acknowledge the sense that all of us have in Congress of our debt and our obligation and our appreciation to them. 
   Madam Speaker, next week, we are going to have a group of these servicemen and -women visiting us in the Capitol.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1908, PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 636 provides for consideration of H.R. 1908, the Patent Reform Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for five amendments: a bipartisan manager's amendment, three Republican amendments, and one Democratic amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1908 is a necessary bill and landmark legislation. The last time that our patent laws had been substantially updated was 1952, over a half century ago. Much, obviously, has changed in the United States and the world in those 50 years, and that is quite an understatement. Unfortunately, the U.S. patent law has failed to keep up. 
   Before I discuss the merits of the underlying bill, I must commend Chairman Conyers, Subcommittee Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Mr. Smith for their tireless work on this bill. It has not been easy to make the reforms that are so intricate and complex in such a complicated system, but these gentlemen worked hard with their committee and did so admirably, bringing to us a patent reform bill that is going to move America forward. 
   I would also be remiss if I did not acknowledge the tremendous contribution of Senator Leahy, who happens to be someone I am particularly proud as he is the senior leader of our delegation here in Congress. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he spent years working on the patent system and has become a driving force behind getting this legislation to the floor. 
   All of us, I believe, in this House see this bill as major progress in reflecting a commitment to the protection and support of the Nation's intellectual property. This system was built to sustain and protect the nuts and bolts of the American economy, our ideas and innovations. 
   The legislation does enjoy very strong bipartisan support. Both Ranking Member Smith and subcommittee Ranking Member Coble, who have done great and hard work, are cosponsors. It is the product of 4 years of hearings, debates, negotiations, and compromises. Since 2001, there have been over 21 hearings on patent issues at the subcommittee level, and the subcommittee chairman and ranking member sought input from, among others, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Solicitor General, National Academy of Sciences, and businesses ranging from high tech and biotech companies to traditional manufacturing and pharmaceutical companies, as well as from our university community and from labor. 
   H.R. 1908 reforms our outdated patent system, which currently encourages patent speculation, increases litigation, often harms small inventors and impedes innovation. 
   First, the legislation moves the United States into a pure first-to-file patent system. Right now the United States is literally the only major industrialized country to retain the first-to-invent system. This change from first-to-invent to first-to-file will inject clarity and certainty into the process and relieve the U.S. system of some extremely burdensome requirements such as protracted interference proceedings often costing up to a million dollars to determine which of many applicants deserves a patent and detailed record keeping. Both of these often disadvantage smaller inventors who might not have the resources to initiate such proceedings. 
   This change to a first-to-file system puts the U.S. in sync with every other industrialized country. Greater harmonization is obviously going to make it easier for U.S. inventors to secure patent rights in other countries as international patent protection becomes increasingly important to their ability and the ability of United States inventors to compete on a level playing field. 
   Next, this legislation makes important improvements to the patent system by which patents can be reexamined. By providing for reexamination of issued patents, H.R. 1908 eliminates the ability to intentionally ``game the system'' by speculating on the issuance of very poor-quality patents, nothing added to the intellectual capital of this country, but used as a device to increase private gain. This provides a streamlined alternative to costly patent litigation. This ability to have a quality check on patents that have already been issued is crucial to the integrity of the patent system as patents of questionable value can stifle innovation. 
   Companies around the country are much like some companies that operate in Vermont, including IBM, which has been a leader in the number of issued patents for the past 14 years in our State. They were awarded in 10 years 3,621 patents in the U.S. in 2006; 360 of those, fully 10 percent, came from the IBM office in Essex Junction, Vermont. That is 10 percent of their total patents from Vermont alone. They have been in business for decades, and improving the quality and security of the patent system is extraordinarily important to them, and obviously to  other individuals and companies large and small around our country. 
   This bill also allows third parties to submit documents relevant to the examination of a patent application. This provision addresses the growing concern that patents have been issued on inventions that were publicly known and in prior use to the filing of the application. This is particularly important in the newer areas of technology in fields that do not yet have a fully well-developed tradition of publishing findings such as computer systems and software and business methods. 
   Finally, this bill makes some crucial improvements to the calculation and apportionment of damages. H.R. 1908 allows for the reasonable royalty calculations that more accurately reflect the value of any invention that is being infringed. Our patent system is far too important to be behind the times. Quality patents must continue to be issued. They must continue to be protected for those who have legitimately created a new invention. 
   This legislation is a huge step in modernizing this system for decades of American innovation to come. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I close by making two comments. Number one, this bill was the product not just of exhaustive hearings by the subcommittee on a bipartisan basis. It's really been the work of a couple of Congresses. 
   The patent reform system hasn't been changed in any significant way for literally over a half a century, and the changes that have occurred in our economy in electronic communications, in telecommunications, on software, on biotechnology, on every field that has produced wealth in this country have been extraordinary, yet the patent system has been stuck in 1952 mode. 
   The process that the chairman, Mr. Berman, the ranking member, Mr. Smith, and others have had to go through to try to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the inventor community, of the corporate community, and the complexities of that have been extreme. 
   This amendment that is being presented to you reflects an open process, not an open amendment with anything and everything on the table, but the product of an open process where everybody who had a concern was actually heard, and the best effort was made to accommodate them directly with specific legislation in the bill, in the manager's or in the amendments that were offered. 
   So the committee members, on a bipartisan basis, with Mr. Berman and Mr. Smith, have done everything possible to accommodate the concerns of the inventor community, the corporate community, our modern economy and the representatives in this body who are standing up for their constituents. 
   Secondly, there was some assertion that this is an anti-inventor bill. That is absolutely wrong. This is a bill that is being endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences, by many in the university community, and by others who have, as their whole motivation, the expansion of knowledge and then the implementation of the benefit of that knowledge through a patent system. 
   So the committee has done an open process which has brought us to this point, and it has proposed changes that are 50 years in the making, that is going to strengthen and expand the rights of our patent community.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule, House Resolution 636. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, for the past 7 years, President Bush has been delivering an energy policy that has resulted in the highest increase in the cost of energy in the history of this country. Last week, the President continued his call for more of the same when he touted an old plan for domestic drilling in the Arctic that would produce a 6-month supply of oil 10 years from now. It is not going to do anything about the price at the pump now, it is not going to do anything about the price at the pump later. 
   Instead, the President is blaming congressional Democrats for not addressing the problem, but it's the President who won't suspend purchases of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which would bring down prices 25 cents immediately. It's the President who won't work with us to get rid of the Enron loophole which is enriching speculators and clobbering middle class families. 
   This year, in fact, the Democratic Congress has passed energy legislation that's getting nowhere because of being held hostage in the Senate and it has no support from the President of the United States. 
   The reality is that we have actions we can take in the short term, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Enron loophole, and in the long term, to reduce our reliance on carbon.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 876 waives a requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII. That rule, as you know, requires a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. This will allow for the same-day consideration, today, of any resolution reported on or before the legislative day of December 19, 2007. It provides for the consideration or disposition of, one, a bill relating to the Children's Health Insurance Program and a bill relating to Medicare, something that at this point is moot in view of earlier proceedings today. But it also has an application on a bill relating to the alternative minimum tax; a joint resolution making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2008, the so-called CR; and the bill, H.R. 2764, making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, the so-called omnibus appropriations bill. 
   With passage of this rule, it allows the House to move one step closer to passing this omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the government outside of the Department of Defense. That, of course, we have already completed our work on and it has been signed into law by the President. And it will provide for funding for the entire fiscal year of 2008. It will also take us one step forward towards considering and passing a patch for the alternative minimum tax, which will affect, unnecessarily and unwisely, 23 million American families. They would be subject to paying a tax that was never intended for middle-class working families. 
   All of these bills, obviously, are crucially important pieces of legislation that Congress must act on before we go home, and we owe it, obviously, to the American people to get this work done. 
   The omnibus bill is going to reject enormous cuts that had been proposed by the President in his draft budget, cuts to essential domestic priorities such as health care, education, law enforcement, homeland security, highway infrastructure, and renewable energy programs. That omnibus bill instead does invest in crucial domestic priorities: medical research to study diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, and diabetes; health care access, including programs like the Community Health Centers that provide more access to health care to underinsured Americans. Small rural hospitals will be helped. Special education, teacher quality grants, afterschool programs, and Head Start; Pell Grants and other student aid programs; technical training at high schools and community colleges; State and local law enforcement for communities across the country; Homeland Security grants to help fight in the war on terror. This meets the guaranteed levels for higher infrastructure and adds funding to our Nation's bridges. It also provides funding for solar energy, wind energy, biofuels and energy efficiency with a careful blend of new scientific investments and conservation efforts.  
   This same-day rule will take us one step closer to completing our work this year. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas. And I will respond and close. 
   A couple of things. First, let's be focused on the fact that the rule that is going to be before the House really applies to two things: consideration of the alternative minimum tax and consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill. And the rule is being brought up for same day consideration in recognition of the fact that there has been enormous work on both sides on the AMT. There is nothing new. And, in fact, the AMT bill that will be brought before the House for consideration today corresponds with the view of the minority as to that being passed without pay-fors. 
   And secondly, the omnibus appropriations bill is bringing before the House appropriations that had been passed in 11 separate appropriations bills but have now been consolidated as a result of the inability of our friends in the Senate to pass those bills individually as we did here in the House. So, there is nothing new that is coming up before the Members of the House. It's just the convenience of being able to act today rather than wait until tomorrow. 
   Secondly, my friend from Texas made some assertions about the conduct of this House in application to the rules. You know, context is everything. The reality is that virtually every piece of legislation that has been brought before the floor has received bipartisan support. Many of the items that the gentleman mentioned in the ``Six for '06'' legislative agenda, student loan cost reduction, price negotiations for prescription drugs, the restoration of the PAYGO rule, these were passed with overwhelming support on the Democratic side and substantial support on the Republican side. When they got to the other body, the Senate has been using, frankly, politics of obstruction to stop virtually anything from being considered: the filibuster, the hold. Every device available procedurally to avoid taking up a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on a question has been employed by the Senate. And there is a sense by many on our side that the criticism that my friend from Texas is making that we have not done as much as we should in Congress, despite the fact that we in the House have passed substantial legislation helping the bottom line for American families, has been an explicit strategy on the part of the other side to use every rule, every device, every procedural opportunity basically to thwart passage of legislation. And they have the full and complete support of the President of the United States in that effort, who stands behind the whole agenda with the veto pen. 
   And the President appears to many of us to be operating on a one-third-plus-one approach where, as long as he can get his veto sustained, he will be able to block passage of legislation the American people need and then accuse the Congress of not getting anything done. And I think most Americans see through that. 
   So, Madam Speaker, with the passage of this rule, the House will move towards adjournment for this year and  have an opportunity to pass the omnibus appropriations bill and the AMT fix. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and the rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his leadership. I thank the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. HOLMES NORTON, and I thank Mr. Graves for his good work. 
   Mr. Speaker, this commission is going to be very helpful to Vermont. We have in the northern tier of Vermont six counties, Caledonia, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Franklin, Orleans and Essex. It is among the most beautiful parts of Vermont. It has among the most industrious people in Vermont. But it has the highest unemployment rate and the lowest wages, about $10,000 below the national median. We want economic development in our northern counties. This legislation is going to give that impetus that is going to allow our regional economic commissions that have been providing excellent leadership but on threadbare resources the opportunity to use local decisionmaking, local ingenuity and local people committed to a prosperous economy in that region to get a leg up. 
   What is tremendous about this legislation, modeled after its predecessors, is that it is a bottom-up approach. So if we have a proposal from folks in Caledonia County that broadband penetration is going to be what they need, or if we have folks in Franklin County who are going to do an agriculture-to-energy-related project, or something with dairy and that is what they need, they are going to have the opportunity for that to become a reality. 
   This is a situation where we actually have bottom-up leadership integrated into this legislation where the Federal Government here in Washington is going to be a partner, not an impediment, to the goals, the aspirations, and the accomplishments of people back home. This bill is really about hope for the future. It is about confidence that local people in those counties in Vermont can make the best decision for themselves, and it is about Congress finally working as a partner with our local communities and local leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my colleague, the Member from Florida, and I also thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, Representative Miller and Representative McKeon. 
   This whole question of the affordability of higher education we know is a crushing burden on middle class families. And it has been made much worse, as many of the speakers have pointed out, by the credit crisis, innocent victims caught up in the consequences of credit-gone-wild in the  subprime mortgage. So I really appreciate, and I think all of us appreciate, the quick work of the committee to provide flexibility in financing that's going to be beneficial to working families across this country. 
   One of the questions that has been on the mind of many of us, I think, on both sides of the aisle, however, is whether or not when we go to the well and ask taxpayers to put more money into student aid, as we've done and as we should do, and when we make loan eligibility more generous so families pinch themselves in order to take on additional debt and students take on additional debt, the question we're starting to ask is whether or not that becomes a way in which institutions of higher education simply increase tuition. And then at the end of the day, you find that the families are increasing their debt load. Their kids are going to school, but they're graduating with a mountain of debt that's equal to the mortgage on the house that many of us, when we first bought our home, is equal to.     
   So Representative Castle had an idea, and I joined with him, to ask for the first time to get a study from the General Services Administration to see what connection exists between tuition going up as student aid, both grants and loans, increases. 
   I am pleased that the committee has seen fit to support this amendment that Congressman Castle and I are offering because we have to do two things if we're going to make college affordable: One is, we've got to make grants and loans available to our students and the families. But two, we really have to ask the institutions of higher education to do something on the cost side. And that's the intent of this amendment, to start getting information that will be available to us to consider whether enough is being done on the cost side.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1103 provides for consideration of H.R. 2634, the Jubilee Act for Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Cancellation, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule also makes in order four amendments printed in the Rules Committee report, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, structured, responsible debt relief has been proven to be one of the most effective methods of fighting global poverty. In 1996 the World Bank and the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, developed the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, or HIPC, Initiative to provide debt relief to the world's most impoverished nations. The 28 countries that participated in this program have been spending the debt relief on good things in their country for the very poor people, on education and health. In the first 10 years of the program, the IMF and the World Bank provided $62 billion of debt relief, cutting the countries' debt by an average of two-thirds. 
   The results speak for themselves. The participating countries now spend four times as much on health, education, and social services as they do on paying back debt. Tanzania, for instance, has used its money from debt cancellation to eliminate school fees for elementary school education. Think about it. The poorest countries, their kids were having to pay fees to go to elementary school, something that's not even required here, while Zambia eliminated fees for health care in rural areas. Multilateral efforts in Niger reduced debt from 76 percent of their  gross domestic product, and think about that, 76 percent of the gross domestic product was used in debt relief, in 2002 to 14 percent in 2006. With that savings Niger has been able to make investments in health and education. They've reduced the infant mortality rate, cut it in half. Primary school completion has increased from 16 to 28 percent, and access to drinkable water increased from 40 percent for the people in Niger to 69 percent. 
   The bill that this rule will bring to the floor today will build on this record of quantifiable success to expand efforts to reduce the debts owed by impoverished nations. This legislation makes debt forgiveness immediately possible for nine countries that meet the standards of the Jubilee Act. This is not a giveaway program.     
   These nations are among the poorest in the world with per capita incomes of less than $3 a day, $1,065 a year. Countries initially eligible under this legislation for debt relief would include Cape Verde, Georgia, Kenya, Mongolia and Vietnam. 
   But as I mentioned, the Jubilee Act does not give countries that borrowed money a free ride with debt forgiveness. It includes strict parameters to ensure that the participating countries: one, have transparent and effective budget processes; two, do not support terrorism; three, cooperate in international counternarcotic efforts; and, four, uphold human rights standards. 
   In addition, funds made available as a result of loan forgiveness must be directed toward antipoverty programs, and countries must publish an annual report to be accountable on how those funds were spent. 
   These criteria ensure the loan forgiveness funds are used wisely and well. They provide an incentive for noneligible countries to reduce corruption and improve human rights practices so they may, one day, become eligible for debt forgiveness. 
   Fifteen additional countries, including Bangladesh, Nigeria and Zimbabwe would be eligible for debt cancellation upon making required reforms. 
   This is the brand of leadership that America needs more of where we are doing our share, but we are working with our allies and where we are using the incentive of debt forgiveness. Many of these debts, incidentally, were taken by kleptocrats who formerly ruled in these countries, and now these countries are trying to free themselves of the yoke of this terrible leadership. This debt forgiveness program allows us, working with our allies, the IMF and the World Bank, to give them a boost. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, it must be noted that because the international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF are expected to pay the bulk of the debt relief, the tremendous improvements that can be achieved under this bill come at a very reasonable cost to the U.S. taxpayer. 
   The cost of America canceling bilateral debt for the countries initially eligible is estimated to be $197 million. That is less than what we spend for 14 hours in Iraq, just to put it in perspective. However, this bill does not actually authorize any debt cancellation. It authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations to cancel debt. Any debt cancellation agreement reached by the Secretary returns to Congress for our approval. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has scored this legislation at no cost to the taxpayers. 
   Debt reduction has been proven to be one of the most effective, both cost effective and socially effective, ways to achieve significant reductions in global poverty. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, I want to point out a couple of things. Number one, this legislation comes to you with bipartisan support from the Financial Services Committee. There was a recognition on that committee between the members on the majority and the members on the minority that this Congress had an opportunity to do something concrete, something practical, to help the most impoverished countries in this world. 
   This legislation is practical. It is going to give relief that translates into higher literacy rates, lower infant mortality rates and better access to education, and it is done at very modest expense to the American taxpayer. It also is America working with other countries and with international institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, to have a positive influence in foreign policy. It makes sense. It is bipartisan. It should be done. 
   I have to say I disagree with the suggestion of my good friend from Texas that we essentially transform this into a debate about extending the Bush tax cuts. That is a refrain we are hearing constantly that is brought up as a way of taking attention off of the things that we can do immediately in the legislation that is before us. 
   The fact of the matter is that what we have seen in the past few years under the fiscal leadership of the Bush administration is we have gone from a record surplus to a record deficit. We have gone from a point of paying down our national debt to increasing it to close to $7 trillion. 
   The reality is that this legislation is about one thing and one thing only: It is about helping countries where the daily income of its citizens is on average $3 a day. That is what it is. We can decide that we are going to take concrete action to help those countries move ahead, or use this as an opportunity to engage in a debate about whether to extend tax cuts, as is being requested by the gentleman. 
   So, Madam Speaker, by passing this proposed rule and this bill for which it provides consideration, Congress can build on this immensely successful debt relief effort we have had on a bipartisan basis and started more than a decade ago to provide relief for the world's poorest countries. It is an essential tool in the fight on the war on poverty. 
   Incidentally, it is money well spent. Much less of our money and the money of our allies is spent than when we have to engage in military conflict. The legislation represents what I believe should be the face of American leadership around the globe. I believe the sponsors of this legislation believe it will make the world a better place and make the world safer and more stable. 
   This is a good bill, a bipartisan bill. It enjoys the support not only of Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters, but of their Republican counterparts on the committee, our colleagues Congressman Bachus and Congresswoman Biggert. That is why I urge a ``yes''  vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his leadership on the Rules Committee and leadership on the Agriculture Committee in helping us work through this. 
   I want to also thank the extraordinary generosity, personal and political, with his time, Mr. Peterson, who was extremely responsive to all the concerns of the Members, and Mr. Goodlatte for his excellent work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule. First of all, two things: One, this bill is a departure from the past farm bills, and I will just give a few straight-out facts. One, commodity programs have been cut 43 percent compared to what they were in the 2002 farm bill. Two, conservation spending has been increased 32 percent. Three, nutrition has been increased 46 percent. So there is a clear change in emphasis. 
   Second, there is in this rule 33 amendments that have been allowed to be in order, including amendments that will allow this Congress to take further action, if it so chooses, on commodity reform. And that is done with the consent and the approval of the Chair of the Agriculture Committee. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this bill clearly reflects the necessity for reform and balance in the farm bill. And, number two, the rule clearly allows this body to have this as a first step and to consider more dramatic reform. 
   Finally, I want to address the MILC program, or the milk program, that is of particular concern to dairy farmers in Vermont. Our farmers in Vermont are hanging on by their fingernails. A year ago when milk prices were at record lows, they also experienced horrible weather, high energy prices, high grain prices, and the folks who hung on did so against extraordinary odds. And how they did that I will never know. But I can tell you this, and I believe what is true for us in Vermont is true for every State across this Nation: Local agriculture not only is essential to our economy, but it is essential to our environment. It is essential to our definition of who we are. And what we must do in this bill that Mr. Peterson in the committee and Mr. Goodlatte in his work begin to do is put an emphasis on local agriculture. Is it a beginning? It is just the beginning because we have to do more in the commodity program, in all of the farm policies that recognize that it is our family farmers who should be the intended folks that we are trying to help. 
   We, in this farm bill, by preserving the MILC program, are at least providing to the hardest-working family farmers a lifeline when, through forces that are completely beyond their control, they need some assistance to stay in business. And, Mr. Speaker, that is an important component of this bill, and I thank the Chair for including it.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I speak to paragraph 1 of the amendment. This is another proposed CMS rule. Bottom line is this: Our American hospitals and health care delivery system has to provide health care to our citizens. CMS plays a major role in helping us to do that and to contain costs. 
   But CMS, the government representative, has to be a partner of our deliverers, the hospitals, not an adversary. And that requires that they give more than 2 months notice, they give a heads up to the hospitals when they're going to change a rule that has the direct and immediate impact of changing revenue streams for our hospitals. 
   This amendment, paragraph 1, like paragraph 2, simply delays the implementation so that there will be a heads up, a time to respond, a time to study it and a time to implement it.

The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Science and Technology. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the Committee on Science and Technology amendment in the nature of a substitute, now printed in the bill, as an original bill for the purpose of amendment, which shall be considered for amendment by section with each section considered as read. 
   The rule authorizes the Chair to accord priority in recognition to Members who have preprinted their amendments in the Congressional Record. 
   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this open rule and the underlying bill. As this Congress is well aware, our country faces a pressing need to chart a new energy future. In the crisis of global warming, it is real, it is urgent, and it requires our immediate action. 
   Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that our reliance on fossil fuels and foreign sources of energy threatens our economic future and our international security.     
   We as a Nation must seize opportunities, not miss them, to be a world leader and promote our own domestic economy, to take steps similar to what Brazil has done and has successfully demonstrated with the reliance on increasing access to biofuels. 
   Today, the Chair of our Science and Technology Committee, the Member from Tennessee, Chairman Gordon, with the assistance of the ranking member, the Representative from Texas, Mr. Hall, are providing us with an opportunity to take a concrete step forward to increase the use and the supply of alternative renewable fuels through research and development. 
   These alternatives provide hope for reducing our impact on global warming while giving a boost to our local and national economies. The particular beneficiaries of success in building capacity for biofuels will be our rural economies, Mr. Speaker. 
   We have a potential, if we embrace it, in facing the challenge we face with energy, to revitalize our rural economies. What this bill will do is a number of things. It will fund research to make renewable biofuels more compatible with existing infrastructure. One of the practical problems that we face in making biofuels generally available is infrastructure challenges. 
   Right now, the low sulfur fuels that are potentially available can do damage to the basic pumps and tanks that are in the 160,000 gas stations across this country. Ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel has just 3 percent of the sulfur in traditional diesel. But current technology does not allow for the easy testing to ensure that this standard is met. 
   This is the second area where the bill will help, by establishing clear national standards for testing that will allow verification about what the sulfur content is in our biofuels. New low-cost testing methods will give rise to consumer confidence and create the possibility for greater demand. 
   To that end, this bill will make alternative fuel compatibility information more available to the public. You know, the expansion of biofuels is going to mean additional revenue options for local farmers, like those in my State of Vermont, and a cleaner environment with less dependance on foreign oil. 
   As gas prices rise, we are further reminded that we are held hostage by a single source of fuel that threatens our economy, constrains our foreign policy, and does damage to our environment. The most basic level, the budgets of our seniors and our schools, our farms, and our families are strained by high energy prices. 
   All of the time we are exporting dollars to import energy, we are depriving our local economies of job creation potential. This legislation takes small but very specific steps that will bring us closer to a readily available source of fuel that is local and can have tremendous potential for our local economies. 
   We are moving in a new direction. Our first step in this Congress, the 110th Congress, last month was when we stood up to Big Oil and we rescinded tax cuts that went to an industry that had been enjoying record profits, and instead put that money into research and opportunities for alternative renewable energy sources. 
   Many of us come from States that have been taking steps to focus on energy independence and clean energy sources. My own State of Vermont has established a utility called Efficiency Vermont that actually makes benefits for Vermonters by finding ways to use less energy, keeping money in our pockets. 
   We have created a clean energy fund, something in effect that we are on a start to do with the legislation we passed in the 6-for-06. We established appliance efficiency standards that when implemented can save Vermonters and other citizens from States that have joined us millions of dollars in energy costs. 
   You know, in addition to just the very practical steps this legislation is taking, having government assist in coming up with standards to measure what biofuel content is, having government help come up with research money so that we can add additives to these low sulfur, less polluting fuels, helping our small businesses, the mom and pop convenience stores that have gas pumps, and would face an expense of $30,000 to $200,000 to retrofit or to replace existing facilitates in order to be able to dispense the new fuels that our private market is producing, this is a concrete step where government is helping on the energy front, helping small business by assisting and coming up with practical low-cost ways to make it easy to dispense this fuel and get it to the consumer. 
   These are steps where the government is acting as a partner with industry, a partner with our small businesses and doing some things that require the practical and efficient application of resources of the people of this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is also another element to this bill that I think is very important for the 110th Congress. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation, presented by the Science and Technology Committee. I want to quote some remarks that Chairman Gordon made at the outset. What he said, when he took the reins of that committee as the new chairman was this: ``I made a promise that this would be a committee of good ideas and a committee of consensus. We are here to solve problems. In fact, the entire Congress is here to solve problems.'' 
   Mr. Gordon and his committee, with the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas, have presented to us a bill that has broad bipartisan support. Why? Because it is practical. It does something concrete. It recognizes we have an energy crisis that requires action, and it has found constructive ways to address that. 
   The committee allowed the process to be open for new ideas, inviting Members to present amendments. The chairman then came before the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, and asked for an open rule so as to permit Members of this body who may have amendments that will strengthen or improve this legislation to have those considered by the full Congress. 
   So what this bill does is two things: one, it presents us with a practical step that we can take that helps continue to move us in the right direction on energy independence, on reducing global warming, and on building our local economies. 
   Second, it is a model of how we can work together, the presentation of  good ideas in a bipartisan piece of legislation in an open rule where other Members are invited to present relevant and thought-out ideas that may improve this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his kind remarks about the Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter. I also thank him, as we all do, for his support on both the open rule and the merits of this legislation. 
   The bottom line here is, we are all in it together. We know that we have major problems to solve. One of them is global warming and one is energy independence. This legislation is a practical step that was brought to us by the cooperation of both sides of the aisle on the Science and Technology Committee. 
   The Rules Committee is presenting an open rule. There will be more to come. Its commitment is to fair debate, and it is going to have to balance the responsibility of making decisions about how best to allow this body to debate clearly and directly the major issues that come before this Congress. 
   We can make progress by working together. It is our goal to continue to do so. That requires that the committees be given an opportunity to do their work. Amendments are going to be brought up in committees and recommended or rejected. That was done in this case. It is going to be the commitment of the Rules Committee to make the debate on all legislation that comes before this body as fair as it possibly can be. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important step. We have to give the American people some confidence that we can take concrete steps to move ahead, and that is legislation, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year, where we are moving in the right direction. 
   What we have done on energy in less than a month is move away from an excessive and damaging reliance on fossil fuels by passing two pieces of legislation, if this passes, that move us in a new direction. That is the right thing for this country; it is the right thing for Republicans and Democrats to work together to achieve. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and on the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming ever more clear that the troop escalation plan proposed by the administration is not--is not--in our Nation's best interest or in the best interest of bringing stability to Iraq. 
   Last week, three different events demonstrated why it is absolutely essential that Congress accept its responsibility to debate the President's plan. First, the cost of the escalation: The President has advertised it to be $5.6 billion; CBO, nonpartisan, estimates it will be $21 billion. 
   Second, the number of troops required, the President is selling it, advertising it as requiring 21,600 troops. CBO estimates suggest that it will be at least 48,000 troops. 
   Next, Pentagon officials admitted last week that they do not have enough armored vehicles, armored kits and other equipment that is absolutely essential to protecting the well-being of our troops. We cannot be sending troops into battle without the equipment and the protection that they need.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, we must end this war. On November 7, when the American people spoke in the last election, from Washington State to Florida, from Vermont to California, they made a very clear decision that they want to bring our troops home. Their challenge to us is to implement that policy. 
   Americans want a new direction in Iraq. The citizens of America know that the time has come to change direction, to bring our troops home with their heads held high in honor of a job well done. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of our finest, most highly decorated members of the military, now retired, can say publicly what in the past they could only say privately. It is this: Iraq is engaged in a civil war. It is not the proper job of our men and women in uniform to referee an Iraqi civil war. 
   The citizens of our country also recognize the obvious: if the Iraqi leadership is unwilling to help itself, how can we expect the American people and the American military to do that job for them? Iraqi leaders will not spend $10 billion in funds available to improve electricity and water, yet expect Americans to spend our taxpayer dollars to do that. 
   Commonsense citizens in our country are asking an obvious question: If the Iraqi Parliament has work to do, why is it taking a 2-month vacation this summer, a vacation, when they haven't reached agreement on oil sharing, when they haven't allowed former Baathists, low level with no blood on their hands, to resume a place in that society, when they won't crack down on sectarian violence, and, Mr. Speaker, when they interfere with the efforts of the American military when they attempt to do so? 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a very clear recognition on the part of the American people, and it is this: our men and women in uniform have done their job. They toppled Saddam, they reported back that there were no weapons of mass destruction, and they did provide stability in Iraq so that they could have three elections. 
   What we face now is a White House that has dug its heels in and a President who refuses to change and adjust and provide leadership to the facts as they exist. Those facts: Iraq is engaged in a civil war, something the White House denies. Those facts: it is the job of the Iraqi political leadership and the people of Iraq to create a civil society. It is not the job of the military to do nation-building. 
   The legislation we have is going to allow us to change the direction of our policy from escalating militarily, as the President stubbornly pursues that policy, to a strategy of Iraqi self-control and stability in the region. I support the rule and the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. One of the ongoing challenges of democracy is to maintain an economy that creates opportunity for everybody, at the low end of the ladder, as well as at the top. 
   What our Ways and Means Committee has done, in two areas, is recognize that we have seen our economy start skirting so that the wealthy are doing very well, the middle class are falling behind, and the poor are barely hanging on. And in two areas, trade and taxes, the Ways and Means Committee has brought legislation that basically says we're all in it together. 
   On trade they want to have a policy that shares the benefits. They aren't just concentrated at the top, and that shares the pain. And on taxes, they're asking the question and giving us the opportunity to present a tax policy that respects work as well as capital, that reduces rather than increases our debt, and accepts the reality that one taxpayer's tax preference is often another taxpayer's tax burden. 
   What is a fact is that the gap between the wealthy and everyone else is widening. We can ignore that or we can acknowledge it. This legislation is middle-class tax relief. It acknowledges that the middle class has been working harder, paying more in taxes, getting less in government services and falling farther behind. 
   One of the things that pays for this is by going after a glaring loophole. We've heard people talk about the ``carried interest.'' But there's one other provision in here that is long overdue for remedy. It's how a corporation doing financial advising is treated differently than a partnership. 
   It was a New York Times story, Mr. Speaker, that spoke about Goldman Sachs that did great work, earnings of $3.4 billion in one quarter. They paid $1.1 billion in taxes. They paid the corporate tax rate. Good corporate citizens. A private equity partnership, the Blackstone Group, doing the same work, had revenues of $1.1 billion. They paid $14 million in taxes, or 1.3 percent. 
   This tax bill says tax fairness requires that those two entities be treated the same, that they pay their fair share before we start asking middle-class working families to pay more.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, I want to thank the Committee on Armed Services for this bipartisan legislation that all of us here in Congress are eager to support. Mr. Skelton has spent virtually his entire career in Congress making certain that the military is prepared and has the equipment it needs and it has the services they require when they come home; and his colleague who has worked very carefully with him, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). I thank you for bringing this legislation to Congress. 
   The underlying bill does two things, as you know. It creates, one, a medical case manager. Number two, it creates a servicemember advocate. The point of those two positions is to guarantee that what happened at Walter Reed won't happen again. 
   My amendment is intended to strengthen and intensify the ability of those two positions to be effective on the part of the men and women who need medical services, and it does it in two ways. One, it makes it clear to the Secretary that these two positions must be empowered to do whatever is required to work through the bureaucracy and see to it that folks get the care they need. 
   Secondly, it requires the Secretary to advertise the availability of these services to our veterans, but also to their families. As we saw at Walter Reed, it was the families who often were the best spokesperson for the veterans and our soldiers who were in need of service. So the amendment builds on what the committee has done by empowering and advertising. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to close by thanking the members of the Committee on Armed Services and their staff for working so closely with me to help write this amendment in a way that was consistent with the underlying objectives of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to just briefly close. 
   Madam Chairman, there are two issues that have been debated during the course of this proposed amendment. One is what is the proper way to try to provide new supplies of oil. 
   There is a debate here, as Mr. McKeon has outlined it, and it has been carried on in many other bills relating to energy, about the possibility of the United States drilling and capturing more oil and natural gas here in our own territorial boundaries. The premise, of course, is if we did that, we would be able significantly to address the problem, and it also has as a premise that the obstacles to drilling are what is causing us not to drill. 
   In fact, that simply is not true. There are tens of millions of acres of federally owned land that are leased to the oil and gas companies, and only 28 percent of acres on shore and only 20 percent of the acres offshore where there actually are leases left are producing oil and gas. So there is an enormous capacity already that is out there for oil and gas companies to do the drilling. Why they don't, I guess we would have to ask them. But it is hard to imagine that there is a disincentive for them to take these leases that they have, giving them the opportunity to drill, when we have got oil that hovers around $130 a barrel. So the suggestion that that is the problem I think is incorrect. 
   Secondly, the United States, and we have got to face this, we have 2 percent of the world's oil supply. That is it. Yet we consume 24 percent of the oil. So if we think that it is going to be a long-term approach to dealing with the increasing cost of oil when we are using 24 percent and we only have 2 percent of the known reserves, I think that is going to fall on its own weight. 
   The second issue really is putting aside that debate about what is the long-term, shall we be drilling or not, it begs the question of whether shouldn't we be doing everything that is within our capacity right now to give tools to local communities to save money on their energy costs and don't make the policy argument about whether we should or shouldn't be drilling be an impediment to taking the concrete step that this bill proposes to give our schools the tools they need to save money. 
   Let me just give you a couple of examples in Vermont. We have 32 schools that have transitioned to wood biomass. These are small schools, but they have saved over 1 million gallons of home heating oil. Home heating oil now in Vermont, the last bill I paid was $4.30 a gallon. That is over $4 million. That also, as my colleague Mr. Arcuri said, is a trifecta, because it reduced carbon emissions by 11,000 tons. It also provided jobs to local Vermonters who are providing the basic material that provided the energy to these schools. 
   So this is an extraordinary incentive for our local schools to try to save money. That is a burden that is immense on the property taxpayers, and this is a practical piece of legislation that allows our communities and our schools to take positive steps to reduce the bottom line. 
   I urge, along with my colleagues who have offered this amendment, led by Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter, a ``yes'' vote on this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   I first congratulate the gentlelady from New York and the gentleman from Ohio on the incredible hardworking committee that is producing more legislation that is good for the American people, and I think just about everybody else in Congress, so all of us appreciate your good work. And it is all about the fact that they recognize, as I think we all do, that small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy. They must have the opportunity to compete for Federal contracts. 
   This underlying legislation establishes broad parameters and goals to make small business opportunities available to folks in this country who have not had access to that opportunity. The purpose of this amendment is to establish a goal that will give an opportunity for businesses that are green to have access to these contracts. 
   Small businesses in my State of Vermont create two out of every three jobs, and it is critical that small businesses be encouraged to develop and supply products and services in an environmentally sound way. My amendment would take a step towards encouraging green businesses by recognizing that those practices of companies can be considered in Federal Government contracts. This isn't just because it is the right thing to do for the environment, it is because there is a growing recognition that if we take on the challenge of cleaning up our environment, it can be pro-high-tech, pro-growth policies that will accomplish that, and I urge favorable consideration.

   Extending a drug benefit to our seniors on Medicare is the right thing to do. Even in its current form, it has helped thousands of Vermonters and hundreds of thousands of Americans. 
   But when this Medicare drug benefit was first passed, a worthy extension of this good program went terribly wrong because of the wrong-headed prohibition on the Federal Government's ability to do the obvious: negotiate fair prices for the taxpayer. This program fails on its most fundamental level, cost. Failing on cost, it impedes access. 
   The lobbyists who had such an influence in writing this bill bewildered our seniors and ripped off our taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Chairman, as we know on a bipartisan basis, the cost of college is skyrocketing, and it is putting in jeopardy access to college and achievement of the American Dream for kids across this entire country. The Education and Labor Committee has taken a number of very concrete steps to try to address that. And this Congress passed a major increase in financial aid, $17 billion, over 5 years. Over the last 10 years, student aid has increased from $37 billion to $86 billion. But every time we raise a dollar in financial aid, if it is a dollar increased in tuition that is burned away, the students are continuing to graduate and swim in a sea of debt. 
   So if we are going to continue on this effort and be successful in making college affordable for average kids wanting to achieve the American Dream, we have to work on both sides of the equation. We have to address the financial aid side, which we are doing our best to do, and do it in the context of enormous budgetary pressures, and we also have to do it on the cost side. And we have to look to our university administrators to work with us to do everything that is possible to constrain the ever-rising cost of college education. 
   Many kids now are graduating with a debt that is equivalent to what was the mortgage on the first house that I bought, and they don't have the home. They do have the education. 
   This amendment is very simple. It would require colleges and universities to annually report to the Department of Education on how much of their endowment was spent each year for the purpose of containing college cost, including tuition, fees, textbooks, meals, and room and board. And it would provide Congress really with much-needed information, the same information that goes to the trustees, so it is not in any way a significant burden. 
   We have to work together if we are going to be successful in containing costs. And we have to acknowledge that we have to work on that cost side as well as on the financial aid side. So this amendment would give us information to work with colleges in trying to achieve that goal to maintain cost affordability for our kids. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I vigorously opposed the war in Iraq before it began, and now, well into its fifth year, the need for a new policy has never been clearer. The toll of this war has been devastating: more than 3,600 of our most courageous men and women killed, tens of thousands seriously wounded; the toll on civilians much higher still. And while we struggle to fund domestic priorities in Vermont, in all our States across this Nation, health care, a crumbling infrastructure, transportation, the cost of education, we now spend $12 billion every single month on this war. 
   From last November's elections, to public opinion polls, to the comments I hear from Vermonters every single day, the voice of the American people is loud and it is clear: we must end this war. And since the President refuses, absolutely refuses, to act, Congress must. Since the President refuses, Congress must make it clear that the United States will not maintain permanent military bases in Iraq. Since the President refuses, Congress must denounce the use of torture. It must finally close Guantanamo Bay. And since the President refuses, Congress must bring our troops home and ensure they receive the care they deserve when they return. 
   Mr. Speaker, 7 months ago, under the leadership of the previous Congress, a bill like this never would have been allowed to come to the floor. Now, 7 months later, today, there is an emerging bipartisan consensus that the President must be forced to change his course. 
   By passing this bill today, Congress will demonstrate with the force of law what the American people well know: it is time to end the war in Iraq. 
   I cosponsored and voted in favor of legislation offered by my colleague Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts that called for redeployment of our troops from Iraq within 6 months. I voted against additional funds for the war without a timeline. And I cosponsored legislation that would close Guantanamo Bay, outlaw torture, defend the right of habeas corpus, and prohibit the establishment of permanent military bases. 
   At the end of the day, Americans know that no action in the House of Representatives is not enough until all of our troops are returned home. This bill provides a starting point for progress towards realizing that goal. Until our troops are home, I will not stop, and Congress must not stop in its efforts to compel the President to end this war.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for establishing in the bill the Federal Milk Marketing Order Commission. It's my hope that the commission will go a long way in fixing many of the problems inherent in the current system, and it will lead, hopefully, to a more stable price for milk. 
   The milk marketing orders, like many of the agricultural pricing programs, almost dates back to the New Deal. The intent is to provide a lifeline, not a lifestyle, and a safety net, not really a subsidy. 
   But one of the problems with the system is it does not take adequately into account the cost of production. In Vermont, in the last year, in the world of dairy, we had the perfect storm: high grain prices, high fuel costs, terribly bad weather, and very low milk prices. 
   The purpose of this commission is to allow it, this amendment, to allow the commission to take into account the cost of production. 
   We must be sure that if dairy farmers, like other members of the agriculture community, are going to be able to pay their bills, the cost of production must be reflected in the pricing program.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELCH of Vermont. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished Chair. 
   There is a fundamental issue that we face in this rule, and it is this: Does Congress cede its authority under the Constitution to the executive, or does it exercise it? 
   Mr. Speaker, from a distance--I have only been here a little over a year--I watched with dismay as a citizen, seeing Congress year after year relinquish its authority, turn that over to the executive, not do its job of accountability and oversight, not do its job on trade, essentially not exercise the constitutional authority that we are custodians of, each and every one of the 435 Members who have been elected. 
   The President exercised his prerogative under a rule that was enacted by this House in 1974, but against the advice of the Speaker and against the advice of the Senate majority leader. The President did what he could do, and that is send over on his own timetable a trade agreement when it wasn't ready to be considered. 
   And the Speaker, in her judgment, and I support this, stood up for the prerogatives of this legislative branch, where we have the responsibility to be the final voice of the people who sent us here. 
   The bottom line question is: Will Congress assert the authority that it has under the Constitution? 
   We can exercise it. The best circumstances, we do it in cooperation and in consultation with the executive. But if it is unilateral, a my-way-or-the-highway approach that has been so often employed by this chief executive, then it becomes incumbent upon us to stand up and assert the constitutional responsibility we have.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, the issue here is global warming. There is a separate issue of Ethics Committee funding. It should be clear to all of us that we don't have to combine the two to let both defeat what is in the interest of this country to achieve. The crisis of global warming is real. It is urgent and it requires our immediate action. By embracing the challenge of global warming, we can open the door to innovative local approaches as we work towards solutions that are going to create jobs, improve the environment, and improve and strengthen our national security. 
   This is a very critical issue in my own State, as it is in every State. Even in a small State such as Vermont, we realize that we can and we must make a contribution towards a more sustainable local economy, a more environmentally friendly future. Meaningful Federal policy must be part of that. 
   I commend this House of Representatives' bipartisan action that in our first days we reversed those tax breaks that went to big oil companies and instead funded renewable energy. The leadership in this Congress has also set a priority on making a green capital initiative. We are going to work, I hope together with my friend from California, on greening this capital and putting our example forward as part of what can be achieved.

   Mr. WELCH of Vermont. I thank my friend from California. What that is about, we can take concrete steps. Last month my office introduced a bill that would allow us to be a carbon-neutral office by working with a couple of local initiatives in Vermont to offset the 54 tons of carbon pollution that turning on the lights in my office here in Washington and my office at home in Vermont and my travel back and forth around the State generates. 
   What we can accomplish by working together requires us to take concrete steps together. This committee, this special select committee, is something in my view that deserves bipartisan support because we have to focus the attention of this Congress on the big issue of global warming, but also on the concrete and specific steps that we can take that will reduce the damage that we do to the environment by our activities by creating jobs that will increase wealth and economic security for our country, and absolutely take steps towards reducing the stranglehold that foreign oil has on limiting our foreign policy options. 
   This is overdue and something that can be accomplished, and I commend the Speaker for her initiative in putting together this special panel that is going to help this Congress and this country make the overdue steps that are required.
