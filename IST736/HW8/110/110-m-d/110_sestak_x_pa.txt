<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (WELCOMING RABBI PETER E. HYMAN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I want to talk about Rabbi Hyman who just gave the opening prayer. 
   There is a midrash, one of the many parables, that embellish upon the Torah. In this particular midrash, there is a man from the land of Israel, a businessman, who was in another country, and when he was there, he was accused of being a spy. He was then told by the judge that he would be executed. He asked for 30 days to go back to the land of Israel and while there finish up his business and come back. The judge initially laughed, but he turned to him and said, ``My friend will sit in a jail for me, and if I'm not back, he will be executed.'' 
   The judge had to see this, and so the man went into jail. And the gentleman went back to the land of Israel and he finished his business. And he would have made it back in time, except there was a storm at sea. 
   And when he finally arrived there, the man, his friend, was about to be hung, executed. And he yelled out as he came closer, ``It is I who am to be executed, not him.'' But his friend said, ``No, you're too late; it is to be me.'' 
   They caused such confusion and commotion that the two men were brought before the king who had to see this, and after listening to their stories, he said, ``I will forgive you and pardon you on one condition, that I become your third friend.'' 
   There is nothing like a friend in life. You helped me at a hard time, at the beginning of my political career, Rabbi, but more than that, Temple Shalom in my district radiated that peace, that friendship, that loyalty to everyone, that interracial, ecumenical clergy association you headed, not just Anti-Defamation League, but anti-violence summit that you held. 
   Shalom. Thank you for being the friend you are, not just to me, but a dealer of hope to many in my district.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, entering my 31st year in the military, my single daughter, 4-year-old Alex, was struck with a malignant brain tumor. After two brain operations and given 3 to 9 months to live, we moved into a cancer ward and began a journey that has her here today and has me in the House. 
   The incident that brought me here was, her roommate that day as she began her chemotherapy was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy from Washington, DC. He was diagnosed that morning with acute leukemia, and for 6 hours we could not help but overhear as social workers came and went to see if that 2 1/2 -year-old boy could stay because his parents did not have health insurance. 
   I have been in combat. I have seen the worst of human nature. I have also seen the best of human nature. This SCHIP bill would cover 10 million uninsured Americans, that 2 1/2 -year-old boy, so that social worker does not determine whether some child is taken care of, is the best of our nature. I ask everyone to support the SCHIP bill.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3625) to make permanent the waiver authority of the Secretary of Education with respect to student financial assistance during a war or other military operation or national emergency.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DURING A WAR OR OTHER MILITARY OPERATION -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3625, an act to permanently extend waiver authority to the Secretary of Education with respect to enrollment in post-secondary institutions and student financial assistance during a period of combat or national emergency. 
   This legislation recognizes the unique and unexpected situations that military personnel face when called to active duty to serve our country, as well as situations that many face in times of a national emergency, even here at home. 
   The intent of this legislation is simple: to provide the Secretary of Education with the permanent authority to ensure that active duty military personnel are not financially harmed by the service that they perform. 
   The Secretary is thereby granted the authority to take necessary actions which include, first, protecting borrowers from further financial difficulty when they are called to serve. This will ensure that when a student withdraws from college because of his or her status as an individual called up for service, Guard, Reserve or active, or, if they are affected by a disaster, that the requirement that grant overpayments be repaid would be waived, and collection activities on a defaulted education loan may be halted for the time period during which a borrower is serving. 
   Second, minimizing administrative requirements without impacting the integrity of the Federal Student Aid program. So, for instance, certain requests that previously required written documentation may now be made orally by an affected individual or member of the borrower's family when that member may actually be, while applying for school, actually in conflict overseas. 
   Third, adjusting the calculation used to determine students' eligibility for aid for those whose financial circumstances change because the student or his or her parents are called to serve, such as when a parent was about to give a large contribution to the son's education, is suddenly called up in the National Guard, and is unable to make that commitment. 
   This bill, therefore, encourages financial aid administrators to choose to use professional judgment as the proper method of determining financial need that is most beneficial to an affected individual and to his or her family; for instance, taking into account the most favorable tax period for the student's or the parents' recording period in order to be assessed on that year's tax recording period, a grant or aid. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. Kline for his leadership on this legislation in past Congresses and for the flexibility that our men and women in the service have received because of you. These provisions have been critical to our men and women serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. In addition, these provisions will provide critical relief to those who answer the call to serve in the future, including responding to national emergencies and natural disasters. 
   I am also pleased with the additional relief provided to men and women in uniform in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which is currently waiting for the President's signature. That piece of legislation included necessary provisions that recognize military service by allowing those called to service to serve on active duty, including National Guard and Reservists, to defer payments on their student loans not only while serving but for a period of time after leaving active duty. 
   Because of unforeseen national emergencies, such as Hurricane Katrina, as well as our continued military engagement overseas, it is important that we pass the legislation before us and allow the Secretary of Education to continue providing this needed relief. Without prompt passage of H.R. 3625, the Secretary's authority to provide this flexibility will expire at the end of this week. It is critical not only for those currently receiving relief from unnecessary financial burden while sacrificing for our country, but also for those who will serve our country in the future, that these provisions be made permanent. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass the resolution.     
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   As the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) has said, I am privileged to stand up here as a former Navy officer with someone who has served so well in the U.S. Marine Corps. Someone has said that the Navy without the Marine Corps is like a coat without buttons. So it is a great bipartisan effort here on what I think is an instrumental bill. 
   As Mr. Kline knows, and why he has worked on this so assiduously over the years, when you lead men and women in combat, what you most want them to have is their head in the game. You don't want them looking back at some problems at home, at debt at home that is hurting their families, nor do you want them looking ahead into some type of future that they want to have. Their safety and the safety of their brethren, the men and women standing on either side of them, depends upon them having their head in the game. That is why this bill is so very important. 
   It is extremely important now in Iraq and Afghanistan. I compare the men and women out there and having their head in the game compared to those great patriots of the world's greatest generation, World War II. Back in World War II, the average soldier was in combat 182 days. There were horrific battles from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima to the Battle of the Bulge, but there was dwell time in between those great battles. Our soldiers, our marines over there in Iraq and Afghanistan go outside the wire every day for 15 months. There is unremitting strain upon them. In order to have a measure of relieving that, I am proud to stand beside you, sir, on this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to do what is important, recognize the bipartisan approach of this and recognize that this is the way to take care of our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, 12,000 children will be diagnosed with cancer this year; 2,000 will not make it with their cancer to the end of this year. But there's no real face to those numbers until you've had it happen to you. As my new, wonderful friend from Ohio had it with her beautiful daughter, Caroline, or I did with my 4-year-old daughter Alex, nothing in my 31 years in the military, whether it was the ravages of being in war or whether it was the challenges of a cold peace, ever prepared for me for those words ``tumor,'' ``cancer,'' the words that need to be removed from our vocabulary by eradicating it from the lives of our children. 
   When you live in a cancer ward and oncology ward, you see such hope as a child, your child, holds your hand and puts all that hope in you as a parent, knowing that you're going to make it all right. And at the same time, as you so well know, you see such hopelessness at times in the oncology ward when there's nothing else to be done.     
   I came down today to speak of you. You really do take that wonderful dictum of Hubert Humphrey to fruition, that ``the moral test of a government is how well it does take care of those in the dawn of life, the children, so that they might see the twilight of life as seniors. 
   The only sad thing about today is that you won't be here next year. In the Bible, Jonathan and David, as they departed, the two great warriors, for the very last time, Jonathan said to David, ``Tomorrow thou shalt be missed because thy seat shall be empty.'' Your seat won't be empty because you have left such a wonderful legacy behind for my daughter, so she will have a chance in the future, if it does come back. Because you all will, in this legacy, not only for her, but for so many, have given them the opportunity, those in the twilight of life, to know the dawn of life, to see the twilight of life as seniors. So thank you for her that, yes, we, as parents, can make it all right. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. And thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (CALLING FOR A TIMETABLE TO REDEPLOY FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, a little over 5 years ago I was on the ground in Afghanistan and then returned with an Aircraft Carrier Battle Group. I then took that Aircraft Carrier Battle Group into the Persian Gulf for the precursor operations just before we began that war. 
   After that war had commenced, I returned to the ground in Afghanistan 18 months later for a short period of time and saw what had not been done. We had accomplished so little compared to what might have been because we diverted our attention and our resources from our Civil Affairs Forces to our Special Operations Forces to the tragic misadventure in Iraq. 
   I speak of Afghanistan because as it becomes prey to terrorists and as the Taliban has moved back into the southern provinces, it is a poster child for why I believe we must bring about a timetable for the end of the war in Iraq. 
   That war has hurt U.S. security throughout this globe as well as here at home, yet not one Army unit, Active, Reserve or Guard is in a state of readiness that it could deploy anywhere in the world if another contingency were to occur. Never mind that we are failing to engage properly from the Western Pacific to Southeast Asia to the Middle East. 
   There is a change in our strategy that can bring about an end to this tragedy without a failed state in Iraq. That is to set a date that is certain by which we would redeploy out of Iraq, because a date certain changes the structure of incentives within that region to change the behavior of other  nations, in particular, Iran and Syria, that are involved destructively in this conflict because we are, to their delight, bleeding, bleeding profusely. 
   I asked when I was there with Senator Hagel, our highest political officer there, does Iran want a failed state if we are to redeploy? His response was no. Therefore, we must have the confidence to set a date that is certain to redeploy out of Iraq, put our troops in Afghanistan, remain in the region on our bases in Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, or Aircraft Carrier Battle Group or Amphibious Ready Group, and bring others home, so we don't degrade the readiness of our forces, but have the competence to deal with Iran and Syria, bring them together with the Iraqis as they deal with the extreme elements and we deal with the middle. 
   There is a saying in the Middle East, ``Insha'Allah,'' basically, ``God willing tomorrow.'' Tomorrow for U.S. security has been enough. A date certain, approximately a year, 9 months, to give those countries time to work with us to bring about the political decisions that must cease the civil war, to have the Iraqis step to the plate and assume responsibility in the 32 ministries that thus far have been personal fiefdoms for personal ambitions as we provide the political and military cover for them to go about their personal pursuits. This is a change that can only about be brought about not by doubling down on a bad military bet by more troops, but by enforcing a date certain within a timetable. And lastly, we should do so on an authorization bill. 
   We should never again put our troops between us and the President. Being in the military is a dangerous business, but it doesn't have to be unsafe. Our business in the military has the dignity of danger, but you must provide them the bullets and the equipment they need to protect themselves, while having an authorization bill provide the date certain by which no forces in Iraq would remain, or funding for them to remain would not be there. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time with the understanding that there is a strategic approach to end this conflict without a failed state in order to enhance U.S. security.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I rise with great respect for Mr. Skelton, but I did want to express my real hesitation and my real concern over what is occurring. 
   When I have gone and sat through this with lawyers, a lien is not a hold, and we are actually not freezing these assets. My concern is this, that here men and women who have worn the cloth of this Nation and have actually been tortured, successfully won a judgment, are now precluded by a President because the Iraqi Government, to whom we are providing $12 billion a month in terms of our natural resources, has threatened to pull out of the United States' trillion dollars of markets $25 billion. I don't think this is right. 
   There are a lot of good things in this bill that need to pass, the pay raise to the readiness. But I honestly believe the President has not taken care of those who sacrificed the most for this Nation, and I would like us to look upon ourselves as to what we are doing here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND TERRORISM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in support of this bill from a different perspective. My colleagues from Iowa and California spoke very well about this bill and its purpose. 
   For 31 years, I served in the military under laws that this Congress passed. We knew that we were allowed to kill, but we also knew that this Congress of ours, under the advising and consent agreement in the Senate, had passed a contract with me that I was not to torture. That contract was one that, if I did, I would stain this Nation, and that this Nation then would be held liable, as had been pointed out under the international law that we have accepted for my act of torture. But at the same time, I always knew that I had a contract with this Nation, a Nation of laws, not of men, and that if I were to be tortured, that this Nation would be there for me, that it would uphold its end of this law that we agreed to internationally in 1949--and that was that we would hold another country liable for that act of torture against me, someone who wore the cloth of this Nation for 31 years. 
   That contract--that this Nation is actually a Nation of laws and not of men--is what is beat into us day after day in the military. In 1996, one administration passed a law, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and said, you men, you can sue. Another administration in 2008 passed another law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and said, you men, you can, under law, sue. That someone, for whatever reason, decided that this contract with our military members would not be upheld I think is a stain on the institution of the Presidency and upon this institution of Congress if we do not uphold that contract with our warriors. 
   The best picture in the Pentagon is one across from the Secretary of Defense's office. It is of a young servicemember kneeling in church and beside him is his young spouse and a young child. And under it you can tell this individual is about to deploy again into harm's way. And there is then noted that wonderful inscription from the Bible where God has turned to Isaiah and says, ``Whom shall I send? Who shall go for us?'' And Isaiah said, ``Here am I, send me.'' 
   We don't serve a man, we serve a Nation of laws. And that's what this is really about today. I urge everyone in this Congress, both sides, and our President, who represents us as our Commander in Chief, to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, as this essential debate begins today, I am quite honored to be asked to make opening remarks at its beginning. 
   I served in our military for over three decades, entering during the Vietnam War and serving under Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and our Commander in Chief today, President Bush. I had the honor of leading men and women in harm's way, the highest honor that our Nation can give to anyone; most recently in combat, over at Afghanistan and Iraq, where I commanded an aircraft carrier battle group of 30 ships and 15,000 sailors and marines. 
   Having worn the cloth of this Nation so long, I know that duty of choice, that the citizens of this great country have about the future course of this war in Iraq is not an unpatriotic one, nor is what anyone will say in the next few days unpatriotic. 
   If my 31 years in the military taught me anything, it was that we serve in this all-volunteer military to defend Americans' freedom to think as they please and to say what they think, even if they disagree with their leaders. A democracy is based on freedom of expression, and those who join the military do so to fight, if necessary, the wars which defend that freedom, hoping that our use will be to a wise end. And that is what concerns me about Iraq. 
   The continuing use of our national treasure in what is an inconclusive, open-ended involvement within a country with long-term benefits does not match what we need to reap. It is why I am opposed to a troop surge that doubles down on a bad military debt that has been tried already. 
   We need to apply our resources elsewhere in the world, where terrorists come from, including Osama bin Laden who is still on the loose, or emerging nations such as in the Western Pacific have growing political and economic interests and, therefore, influence that may challenge ours. 
   I do not think that my extensive military experience alone gives me license to disagree with our strategy in Iraq, but just being an American who has closely watched and thought about the trade-off and benefits for our future prosperity, interest, and values does. 
   Our military is a national treasure that should not be used recklessly, nor should it be hoarded like miser's gold. It is a vital resource if we are to continue to be a force for peace and prosperity, but throughout the world. And that is why I firmly believe in a planned end to our military engagement in Iraq within the next year as the primary catalyst for change in Iraq so their leaders are forced to accept the political and military responsibility for their country, with our diplomatic and economic help, and limited military support from outside Iraq, but within the region is best. It is for our Nation's greater security that I believe this, and why I cannot support a troop surge that strains our military readiness further and, more, our overall strategic security in a war that does not serve our Nation's greater interest in this world and our future.

I often wondered and hoped during those years, whether in the fury of war or the challenges of peace, what Washington was thinking, debating wisely at length about the use of our national treasure, those men and women who wear the cloth of our Nation overseas. 
   I am concerned for U.S. security because of Iraq, a tragic misadventure that does not permit us to best address more important security challenges throughout this world. 
   Don't double down on a bad military bet by using more troops. Have confidence in our diplomatic ability to lead even with Syria and Iran, set a date certain for redeploying out of Iraq this year to serve as the leverage to have the Iraqis accept the reality of the personal consequence of not assuming responsibility for their nation. 
   That is why I will introduce legislation that sets the end of 2007 for our redeployment from Iraq to serve as the catalyst for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country so we can better address our security interests throughout this world.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I rise today also in support of H.R. 5819, a bill to improve and modernize the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program. 
   Small businesses, the backbone of our economy, bring innovation, creativity, competition and lower costs to our economy. As elsewhere in America, 70 percent of all the new jobs in my district in Pennsylvania come from small businesses, and I strongly believe our economic security is dependent upon our ability to provide these businesses with the tools and the resources they need to grow. 
   In 1982, as has been mentioned, Congress recognized the importance of retaining and increasing the innovation and research of small business by creating the Small Business Innovation Research program to stimulate technological innovations, meet Federal research and development needs, and increase the commercial success of innovation. 
   The bill we will be voting on improves the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program to ensure that small businesses receive the resources they need to continue to innovate, grow and succeed. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill will make the necessary changes to modernize these two programs. This bill will increase funding available for grants, simplify the application process, broaden technical assistance, and create a more flexible process for the 11 participating Federal agencies. It also focuses agencies on granting funding to projects with commercial viability and promising research, and it requires agencies to establish databases to collect best practices information. 
   I strongly believe that innovation is essential to the economic well-being of our Nation, and the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program make a significant contribution to our economy. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely reauthorization.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment mandates that an agency must specify in their notification that unsuccessful applicants are entitled to constructive feedback, potentially opening up the breadth of SBIR grant recipients. This is a very simple and valuable measure to increase the transparency of our Federal agencies. It would allow firms insight into a rejected application and would increase their competitiveness in the future. 
   On more than one occasion, firms in my district have voiced their concern that the SBIR program awards grants to a relatively small group of businesses. A GAO study actually reported that the 25 most frequent winners of SBIR grants, which represents fewer than 1 percent of the companies in the program, received about 11 percent of the program's awards. Further, there are many qualified applicants that apply for these programs who are unsuccessful each year, but may not know that they are entitled to feedback and an explanation on the decision. 
   Therefore, by mandating that an agency must specify in the notification that unsuccessful applicants are entitled to constructive feedback, I believe that this will allow firms insight so that they might increase their competitiveness in the future. Furthermore, this amendment will ensure accountability in our Federal agencies. 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to vote to support this simple amendment to promote transparency and future competitiveness within the SBIR and STTR programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, a little over 5 years ago, I was in the war in Afghanistan, first on the ground for a very short period of time, and then I returned in charge of an aircraft carrier battle group. I saw a just war. 
   Eighteen months later, I went back to Afghanistan, on the ground again, and saw what we had not accomplished because we had diverted our attention and our resources, our Special Forces, our Psychological Operation Forces, our Civil Affairs Forces, those and our attention were diverted to the tragic misadventure in Iraq. 
   To me, Afghanistan is a poster child for what we have failed to do, and that is to remain engaged throughout this world, to be ready here at home in order to provide for a strong defense in support of our diplomacy of engagement. 
   I am not antiwar. I am pro-security. And that is my concern, that Iraq is every day seriously degrading the strategic security of America. It is why I believe that there is a different strategy to redeploy from Iraq with a date that is certain, one that is out there in order to change the behavior of those nations in that region, give them a different incentive to work towards stability so that as we redeploy over a fixed timetable, we will leave behind a state that is fairly stable and that is not failing. 
   I believe, having been in Iraq with Senator Hagel and having traveled throughout that country, that my belief is only reinforced that we can no longer provide the political and the military cover for the Iraqi leadership that has failed to step up to the plate, that has failed, being in control of 32 ministries in Baghdad, to stop pursuing personal ambition, establishing personal fiefdom as our soldiers provide them not only the military, but the political cover, not to take the challenging decisions that they must take. 
   But I also believe, beyond that it is wrong to double-down on a bad bet by putting more troops into what is a civil war and that our military cannot resolve, the best military in the world, I believe a date certain also changes the incentives, the structure of incentives to change the behavior of Iran and Syria. 
   Everywhere Senator Hagel and I went in Iraq we heard that Iran has undue influence. Yes, they do. We're bleeding, bleeding profusely. But when I asked our senior political leader there, if we were to redeploy, does Iran want a failed state? The answer was, no, they don't. With a date certain and the confidence the United States should have, having dealt with the Soviet Union, having dealt with the People's Republic of China, bringing it into the world's community, we should have the confidence to deal with Iran and Syria. Bring them together to work, with a date certain as their incentive toward working on the extreme elements in Iraq as we work in the center to bring about an unfailed state that can only be brought about by a date that is certain to redeploy. 
   It took us 6 months to redeploy from Somalia, a much smaller contingency of forces. We have over 100,000 civilians in Iraq, in addition to our troops. I believe that the Democratic leadership, working with the Republicans, should work towards what the President said. We will not have an open-ended commitment. With a date certain, working together, we can, on an authorization bill, a bill that establishes a date beyond which no funding would be permitted for troops within Iraq, while we use appropriations bills to continue to fund our forces so that we do not ever again, as we did in the last month, place those forces, those whom we serve with, wearing the cloth of our Nation that we sent to war, that we never again play a game of chicken between us and the President. 
   Being in the military is a dangerous business. It has, as someone said, the dignity of danger. It does not, however, have to be unsafe. Fund them fully with a date that is certain in our authorization bill by which we must redeploy, with enough timeline that the nations there can be brought together under U.S. leadership to bring about, by the only possible means that it can be done, diplomacy, strong diplomacy, as we remain in the region on our bases in Amman, Qatar, Bahrain, carrier battle groups, disengage, reengage in Afghanistan as well as here at home and elsewhere around this world in order to bring about a stronger security for America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month which does take place this year during May. 
   The Asian American Pacific Islander, AAPI, community is, as was already noted, a very culturally and ethnically diverse community with a very rich heritage in the United States of America. The AAPI community, as was noted, is composed of over 15 million people across the United States and is one of the fastest growing minority groups in America. It represents nearly 5 percent of my Seventh Congressional District in Pennsylvania, and without any doubt plays a very vibrant part of the rich cultural fabric of my district. 
   The AAPI community has also made significant contributions in developing our Nation. As was just noted in this brief exchange, there were many leaders, which I saw in my nearly four decades of military service from this rich community, whether from the Philippines, Japan, China, or across to India or the United Arab Emirates from being leaders in education, to fostering business and economic development, to promoting arts and media, and to helping develop innovative breakthroughs in health care medicine technology. 
   In 1978, a joint congressional resolution was established which had the Asian Pacific American Heritage Week finally come about. The first 10 days of May were chosen to coincide with two key anniversaries: The arrival in the United States of the first Japanese immigrants on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869, bringing together two parts of America, and I hope in more and more all the world. In 1992, Congress expanded the week finally to a month-long celebration. 
   Therefore, I am proud to join my colleagues in celebrating the rich heritage of the AAPI community that I see every day in my district and to recognize the contributions of the community during Asian Pacific Heritage Month.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424 for three simple reasons based upon my experience in the U.S. military: 
   First, today we're seeing 17 percent of those who wear the cloth of our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan returning with post-traumatic stress disorder. And over one-third are returning with a mental disorder from anxiety to depression. They will feed into our society. How can we not give them the same parity as we do to those who are double amputees and we give prosthetics? 
   Second, again in the military we put money in in order to prevent a greater crisis. We were the insurance for this Nation. Presently, we spend up to three times the cost, indirect cost of mental illness as it would take for the treatment. How can we not pursue this, both for the good of the individual and the cost-benefit for our society? 
   And the third simple reason is, I honestly do believe in the ideals that Hubert Humphrey said. The moral test of our government is how well it takes care of those in the dawn of life, the children, those in the twilight of life, the elderly, and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the disabled, the handicapped. I'm sure he would have included in that the mentally disabled, the largest disability in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I joined up in the military during the Vietnam conflict, and at that time, and still today, we don't have human resource departments in the U.S. military. You tend, as a young division officer, to take care of the challenges that your young men and women have, and their families yourself, whether it's an eviction notice or whether it's a health issue, or whether it is, as thousands at that time and through the eighties used to have to go out and get their food stamps in order to continue their quality of life, you took care of them. 
   This bill takes a significant step, I believe. As Mr. Rangel insinuated, it's a small step, but it is a significant step. I say that because the most moving picture I have ever seen in the Pentagon is one that is across from the Secretary of Defense's office. It's of a young servicemember kneeling in church and alongside of him is his wife and a young child. And under it is this great saying from the Bible, where God turns to Isaiah and says, ``Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?'' and Isaiah replies, ``Here am I. Send me.'' 
   We send them, and we need to welcome them when they come back. The commissary bags also used to have on them, ``The hardest job in the military is a military spouse.'' What this bill does is takes care of the cost of life. But it also is significant that it takes care of the cost of loss of life. Because what distinguishes this profession from anyone else's is that it has the dignity of danger about it, where the loss of life may occur. 
   So in this bill it ensures if an employer still wants to, even after a death of a servicemember, contribute to his retirement plan, he can. It also then permits the spouse, having lost a servicemember, can actually then place this military gratuity benefit into an IRA without any penalty. It does much for our servicemembers; that lets them take combat pay, for example, and place it towards earned income so that they can move into the middle class as an earned income tax credit. 
   In my mind, this is an excellent bill that has come out, and it has bipartisan agreement. But the reason I think this is so important today is that our servicemembers returning from overseas, 19 percent of them have post-traumatic stress disorder, 33 percent of them have a mental challenge, from depression to anxiety. 
   This war is different. In World War II, the average soldier went into battle 182 days. He had time to rest in between major battles to get his nerves back in shape. Our soldiers in Iraq go  outside the wire every day for 15 straight months into a combat-like situation. They are a strong generation, but this war is different. 
   So therefore as we keep that in mind for those who say, Here am I, send me, we should also keep in mind that what we are doing here is when the great warriors Jonathan and David departed for the last time in the Bible, Jonathan turned to David and said, Tomorrow there shall be a new moon and thou shall be missed because thy seat shall be empty. 
   This seat should never be empty. It should be filled with a legacy of what they have done for this Nation. This bill, in my mind, takes a step, a small but significant step to remembering that these men and women who have served this Nation should continue to be welcomed home by us with a legacy of thanks that this bill does. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   When General Akhromeyev came from the Soviet Union to visit the United States when the Soviet Union was breaking up, Admiral Crowe took him to many places, including an aircraft carrier. When he departed the aircraft carrier, he was asked by Admiral Crowe, Chairman of Our Joint Chiefs of Staff, ``What most impressed you?'' He turned to him and looked him in the eye and said, ``Your enlisted man.'' 
   It is why General Washington, when he established the very first ribbon in the United States Army, a piece of purple ribbon which is today's Purple Heart, dictated that that award would only be given to enlisted men. The enlisted servicemembers are the heart of our military, and this bill is focused upon them. They are the ones who say, ``Here am I. Send me.'' 
   I commend both sides of the aisle for recognizing who most deserves being remembered for the sacrifice to this Nation. It is the enlisted man and woman.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Thank you for yielding. I wanted to also speak about Iraq and our U.S. security. 
   I've always felt that Iraq is a tragic misadventure. I can remember being on the ground for just a short period of time, 2 months after the war in Afghanistan began, and I saw what needed to be done. I brought an aircraft carrier battle group back, 30 ships, 15,000 sailors, Special Forces, SEALs, Marines. And then I went back on the ground 18 months later in Afghanistan and I saw what had not been accomplished because we diverted our attention, our resources, Special Forces, psychological forces, civil affairs forces to Iraq. 
   I have always believed that not only is Iraq a tragic misadventure, but there is a strategy by which we can redeploy out of Iraq and not leave a failed state.     
   I have never believed in doubling down on a bad bet, and that is what we have done by this most recent surge of forces into Iraq. The last 2 months have proven that. We have had more U.S. casualties among our forces than any 2-month period back to 2004. 
   There is only one solution to Iraq, and that is not by continuing to flow forces there. It is by setting a date that is certain, a specific date by which everyone knows we will redeploy out of Iraq. I believe that this date certain, much like a tax policy here in the United States, is something that can begin to change the structure of incentives within Iraq and about the surrounding countries so that their behavior in Iraq, as well as in the critical Nation's of Iran and Syria, changes. If we are to set a date certain, the Iraqis will begin to understand that no longer will we continue to provide a political and a military cover for their 32 ministries in their government, that each is headed by an individual that is bent not upon Iraqi ambitions but personal ambitions to ensure that they consolidate as we provide them cover for their personal fiefdoms. We should let them know that we will no longer let them pursue these ambitions; that they must step up and assume personal, professional responsibility for the challenging political questions that must be addressed. 
   When Senator Hagel and I went together to Iraq, we had the most senior Shia and Kurd leaders tell us that the reBaathification law, which would welcome back in the Sunnis, was something that was not only not important, but in their minds, it was appeasement. When will they begin to make the political decisions, to make the political accommodations to begin to reconcile their country so there can be stability? A date certain, at a certain length of time, my bill has said, for the last 4 months, at the end of December, is the one remaining leverage that we have in that region to also turn to Iran, who is involved destructively with Syria in this war, making us lead profusely while we are there, to change their incentives so that they understand that if we no longer keep this top on a simmering pot, that they will have to deal with the stability that will ensue. 
   There are 4 million Iraqis that have been dislocated from their homes, 2 million of which have overflowed the borders. The Iranians and the Syrians do not want to have the remaining refugees come over their borders so that they have to deal with that instability. And, second, they do not want a proxy war between these two allied nations, Shia, Iran, on the one hand; and Sunnis, Syria, on the other, as they then would be left fueling different religious factions, a proxy war between themselves if we are not there. If the United States has the confidence to lead not just with its military but with diplomacy in that region, bringing Syria, Iran together to understand that the term ``insh'Allah'' that is so well known in the Middle East, God willing, tomorrow, will no longer be accepted by us. Give them a date certain by which we should redeploy, because we also need to remember the length of that time cannot for us be tomorrow. 
   It took us 6 months to redeploy out of Somalia with a much, much smaller force. In Iraq, we have 160,000 troops and over 100,000 U.S. civilians. It will take us some months. But under a date certain, we can leave behind a strategy that can leave an unfailed state as we redeploy within that region to our bases in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, carry a battle group into Afghanistan and many to come home because we have an army that does not have one unit that is ready to deploy anywhere in this world from home because they are in such a low state of readiness. 
   As I conclude, I ask this Congress, the Democratic party, to ensure they pursue the strategy that will leave not an unfailed state but a state that is stabilized to some degree as we work with the regional nations to also understand to never again put our troops between us and the President. 
   Being in the military has the dignity of danger. It is a dangerous business, but it doesn't have to be unsafe. We must do this on an authorization bill, not an appropriations bill. The moneys  should flow for the safety of our troops as we do an authorization bill, set a date certain, 6, 9 months from today, and safely redeploy our troops as the one remaining leverage for those nations in that region to come together under U.S. confidence so that we can leave that nation, build up our strategic security again and focus on the rest of the world and here at home. And I am very grateful for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I watched the world change during nearly four decades in the Navy, having joined up in 1970. I have been almost everywhere. Several decades ago I went to China and to the United Arab Emirates when they were not the powers they are today. 
   The strength of our international trade is absolutely crucial to the economic prosperity and global competitiveness of our Nation. But there are consequences of globalization, and we must address them if we are to remain and have a fully skilled workforce that can continue to compete. 
   This is why trade adjustment assistance is so important. It ensures the transition of the workforce that is negatively impacted by trade to step back and to receive the tools that prepare them to reenter the workforce at a higher, more skilled, competitive level. Good for them. Good for America. 
   The substitute amendment removes this focus on ensuring a more wealthy economy because of a retrained workforce. It actually caps retraining funding at $8,000, less than all but one State. This, when economists state that if our competitive ability, based on an innovative, skilled workforce, does not change, China will be the number one economy by 2050 and India number two. We will be number three. 
   As service workers have grown to be a more significant part of the economy than they were when the initial Trade Assistance Act was passed in 1962, it is vitally important that we invest in their retraining also. 
   The substitute amendment would actually remove these workers, needed to be re-skilled for our economic future, from the bill. And at a time when health care premiums have risen as a not-so-hidden tax, 70 percent in the last 6 years, the substitute amendment does nothing to fix the flaws in the old Trade Assistance Act that precludes families from receiving the health care tax credit for which they are eligible. 
   In short, having visited the UAE and China decades ago, and seeing them now, there is no question that a small investment in a healthy, educated and retrained workforce is needed to preclude our economy from being number three. 
   We want the same quality of life our forefathers had when they invested in the GI bill, and this is no different. This is a small investment so we give the quality of life we had to our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. I am here to speak about Iraq. Americans are tired of this war, but at the same time they want to secure the best of the situation for the perception of security not just in that region but globally. 
   I watch the Republicans and our concern as Democrats is that they believe that our military might provide a solution in Iraq. I look at my party and my concern is that we need to stop the impure opposition and to begin to help craft, to help author an implementable, comprehensive Middle East/Persian Gulf security plan. But to do that, we obviously need a union with our Republican brethren. 
   I honestly believe that when people talk about taking care of our troops, the belief is not that we use them in war when necessary but where and how we use them. There are the elements right now to begin to come together in a union to craft a comprehensive end to this tragic misadventure that can meet the goals of both sides. 
   First, we have an army that is strained and by next April we will be at the point of almost irreparable harm for some years to come. Second, we know that in order to redeploy that army out of Iraq, it will take time. When the Soviet Union left Afghanistan with 120,000 troops, it took them 9 months and because of the ill preparation, 500 died on the way. We have 160,000 troops, 100,000 contractors. We must work well to get them to redeploy safely. They can only take in Kuwait two to two and a half brigades at a time. Forty combat equivalent brigades are in Iraq. The math comes out to a minimum of 18 to 24 months. 
   Third, because of that time line we can use the last arrow in our arsenal we have not used, diplomacy. The road out of Iraq is through Tehran, Iran. If we have the ability as we slowly redeploy to bring together Iran to work for stability, we can have a comprehensive solution to this conflict.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (A BIPARTISAN WAY AHEAD -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, there is a bipartisan ``way ahead'' in Iraq if viewed in terms of progress for America's security and not solely Iraq's, with a strategy that focuses on our natural interests in this conflict, not just the interests of Iraqis. 
   Our troops have served our country courageously and brilliantly, but our engagement in Iraq has degraded our security, pushing our Army to the breaking point so that it cannot confront other pressing security concerns at home and abroad. My military service as a 3-star admiral, having led an aircraft carrier battle group in combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and served as Director of the Navy's antiterrorism unit, convinces me that an inconclusive, open-ended involvement in Iraq is not in our security interests. 
   Ending this war is necessary, but how we end it is of even greater importance both for our security and our troops' safety. These two considerations, our security and our troops' safety, are the dual catalysts for a bipartisan discussion to end this war. 
   First, America's security. Our Army will rapidly unravel if redeployment from Iraq does not begin before spring, 2008. Today, 40 percent of all U.S. Army equipment is in Iraq. There is no Army unit now at home in a state of readiness able to deploy anywhere another contingency might occur in the world. 
   Second, the safety of our troops. Redeployment from Iraq will be lengthy. Moving 160,000 troops and 50,000 civilians and closing bases are logistically challenging, especially in conflict. To ensure our troops' safety, it will take at least a year, probably 15 to 24 months. The ``long pole in the tent'' is the closure or turnover of 65 forward operating bases. Conservatively, it takes 100 days to close one forward operating base. It will be important to balance how many to close at one time, with calculations about surrounding strife, and the fact that Kuwait's receiving facilities to clean and package vehicles for customs and shipment back to the United States can handle only two to 2 1/2 brigade combat teams at a time, with the fact that there are currently 40 brigade combat team equivalents in Iraq today. 
   Redeployment is the most vulnerable of all military operations, particularly because this one will be down a single road leading from Iraq to Kuwait, ``Road Tampa.'' Such vulnerability is why, in 1993, after ``Black Hawk Down'' in Somalia, it took 6 months to extract our 6,300 troops safely and only then after inserting an additional 19,000 troops to protect their redeployment. 
   And what of Iraqi stability in the aftermath of our redeployment, which affects the region and, thus, our security? Because the redeployment of troops will take a long time, we can have a bipartisan approach to Iraq's security. To do this, we Democrats must turn from pure opposition to this war and an immediate withdrawal and begin to help author a comprehensive regional security plan that accepts the necessity for a deliberate redeployment. 
   In turn, the Republican leadership must accept that the U.S. Government  must also work diplomatically with Iran and Syria during this deliberate redeployment. While these two countries are currently involved destructively in this war, according to our intelligence community, these nations want stability in Iraq after our departure and, therefore, can play a constructive role. 
   I have consistently argued that a planned end to our military engagement is necessary and that such a date certain deadline would force Iraqi leaders to assume responsibility, providing Iran and Syria the incentive to prevent violence otherwise caused by our departure. 
   Our troops could either return home or deploy to regions such as Afghanistan, where terrorists pose a threat to our security, while others remain at our existing bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and on aircraft carrier and amphibious groups to ensure our interests in the region as we did prior to invading Iraq. 
   Because our Army must either start a lengthy redeployment or risk unraveling, we have the catalyst for a bipartisan agreement to end this war with a stable Iraq if we also work with Iran and Syria to meet this goal. However, this opportunity for a bipartisan congressional approach to convince the President to use diplomacy to bring about a stable accommodation in Iraq once our troops redeploy will undoubtedly require an initial redeployment deadline that is a ``goal'' instead of a ``date certain.'' Therefore, despite my continuing belief that a date certain is the best leverage we have to change Iraqis' and regional nations' behavior, when faced with the otherwise assured consequences of a bipartisan stalemate on resolving the tragic misadventure in Iraq, this compromise is needed for America's security.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. This past weekend I had the opportunity with an 82-year-old airman to sit down with him and awarded him, after some work had been done, with the Distinguished Flying Cross. And he so proudly opened up his charts and the maps that he had flown over Europe back in World War II. 
   And as a Navy officer, I came to realize the quite close bond we had as he proudly then pointed to his log book and said, this was the ship, as they called their aircraft, that we were on during those missions. 
   But what I want to speak about is that wonderful passage in the book by Tom Wolf, ``The Right Stuff.'' In it, as he talks about aviators, he spoke about how they take off and they fly, and often, particularly as the 50s, 60s and 70s occurred, they would often find themselves, all of a sudden, at some critical moment, where through their skill, their determination they managed to pull themselves out of a dangerous situation at the last yawing moment. 
   But then Tom Wolf went on and he said that's not really the key to these men and women. He said, then they took off again the next day and did the same thing, and the next day and the next day, and every day after that, just like clawing up a pyramid, never knowing each time whether they would or would not be able to pull it out at the last crying moment. That, Tom Wolf said, is the right stuff. 
   So I rise in commemoration of the Air Force and in a very joint way who has done so much for the security of our Nation. Without a question, they have the right stuff.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, ending this tragic misadventure in Iraq is necessary but insufficient. How and the means by which we end it is of even greater importance, both to the safety of our troops and to our overall strategic security. 
   First, our troops. It took us 6 months to extract 6,000 troops out of Somalia after Blackhawk Down, and we inserted 17,000 personnel to guard the retreat. We have not only 160,000 troops in Iraq, but over 100,000 civilians. We must ensure their safety, and that will take approximately 1 year. 
   Second, that time line of a year is actually the change in strategy that will ensure that we have an aftermath, if we pursue diplomacy with Iran and Syria, to bring about an unfailed state. Recently the intelligence community said Iran does not want a failed government. Therefore, we must approach the end of this war with a strategic approach working with the Republicans. This is our country's war, because the aftermath of its consequences are so great and it requires a strategic end.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Thank you very much. I may be the one slowing us down tonight because I'm 50-something in a 30-something group. 
   This is wonderful. If I might speak, I'm really honored to be asked to say a few words on the last day of the Month of the Military Child. 
   In the Pentagon, across from the Secretary of Defense's office is the best painting in all of the Pentagon. It's of a young servicemember kneeling in church. And next to him is his young spouse and his young child. And under it is that wonderful saying from the book of Isaiah where God turns to Isaiah and says, Who shall I send? Who will go for us? And Isaiah replies, here am I. Send me. 
   But really, what that picture depicts is the family that actually is saying, here we are, send us. 
   I got to know, joining up in 1970 and on, a lot of those families. We don't have, in the military, a human resource department where you outsource problems or challenges. So you sit with them when they're in debt and help to balance their checkbook, or you sit there with them trying to make sure that they get the proper care in the hospital. You get to know the families very well. 
   And you get to know them in another way during long deployments. Back then, in those early 1970 days, you'd sit there as a young man came up after leaving port and receiving a letter, or getting a letter at sea from another ship as it passes from ship to ship, from his wife that says, Johnny's okay after the operation. But he didn't know about the operation. Maybe in the next port of call, 30 days later, the letter would come in that said, want you to know Johnny had a broken leg. It's okay. He'll have an operation next week. 
   Or go ahead 3 1/2 decades or so, and how I could sit there and, with technology, record over the Internet and read each evening to my daughter, who was, during this, while gone from her for about a year, during the war and would be able to read to her a book so that she'd go up to the TV and just kiss it. Even today, 7 years later she goes up to the TV if I'm on and kisses it. 
   I bring those up because I think what people in the military learn is that when authority or responsibility passes, and you come home, that what's really left is the infinite tenderness and caring of a loving family. 
   And yet, we also recognize in the military, in words that were more reflective of its time, three, 3 1/2 decades ago, that on the commissary bag, shopping bags of each of the military or the Navy complexes would be a saying, ``Navy wife, toughest job in the Navy.'' 
   Or as 70 years ago, the wife of a Chief of Naval Operations said in a poem, a Navy wife remembers. When crying seems likely, just laugh it away. 
   I bring those up because what sets our military apart from our professions, as someone once said, is it has the dignity of danger. And the character that our men and women who serve in the military show and triumph which didn't begin in theories. It really begins in those places from whence we come and the people who made us who we are, not just our communities, but in particular our families. 
   And I bring that up because today as was brought out here, is every war is different. World War II, our veterans, on average, had about 182 days of combat. Horrific combat. Battles like Normandy or Guadalcanal. But there was some dwell time in between those battles, time for your physical nerves to adjust, which has a major impact upon your mental state, and time for your mental state to readjust. 
   In Iraq, however, our soldiers go outside the wire every day for 15 months, into a combat-like situation, and then they come home for 12 and go back again. And then come back to families where 19 percent of them face Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 33 percent have a mental challenge from depression to anxiety. 
   So as our families say, here we are, send us, it's never been more vital than now to recognize that if this Nation still wants its families to say here we are, send us, we, more than ever before, I believe, owe it to our veterans to take care of them and their families in the ways that have been laid out much better than I could have by my colleagues. So thank you for speaking tonight. 
   It's a wonderful brotherhood and sisterhood I lived in for many years that finds the grandest sepulchre of all, a home in the hearts of brave men and women. But again, when all that passes out there, what's left is that family. And whatever we can do for them, from now and forever, is the most arduous responsibility I believe Congress, in this time of war can be charged with.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, even for those convinced the surge in Iraq is a mistake, the manner in which we implement a decision to leave that country is critical to our Nation. Therefore, any Congress mandating a new security policy through force of law owes a careful explanation to the country why and how it is to be done, including dealing with what would occur in the aftermath. 
   However much Americans may agree with us a desire to reduce U.S. forces and withdraw them from Iraq quickly, this Nation must face the alternative of what will happen in the region once that redeployment is done by a force of law. 
   We must remember it took us approximately 6 months to withdraw a small number of troops just from Somalia. We have 160,000 troops in Iraq and over 100,000 contractors, but the time line of about a year that is needed for a safe redeployment also works well to protect our regional interests in a strategic approach to end this war. It provides the time needed for a strategy of regional accommodation to take effect with Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia,  a strategy that rightly relies upon the long-term interests in a stable aftermath. Therefore, ending this war is necessary but insufficient.

   Americans may be tired of this war, but as a group they still expect it to be brought to an end that salvages as much as possible from the situation and protects our broader interests in the region and the world. 
   This strategic approach is not just about ``getting the troops home.'' Rather, the important concept to pursue is a strategic redeployment from Iraq that enhances our security by giving us the leverage to begin to unify Iraqis and bring about a regional accommodation that works toward that nation's stability. 
   However much Americans may desire to reduce forces in Iraq quickly, this Nation must still face the aftermath of what will happen in the region after redeployment by the force of law. And while some may try to characterize this as President Bush's war, it is the whole country's war in terms of how its consequences will affect us. For example, a careless redeployment due to haste most endangers our 160,000 troops and estimated over 100,000 civilian contractors in Iraq. 
   Withdrawal is when military forces are at their most vulnerable, something our Nation paid heed to when it took the 6 months necessary to redeploy less than 10,000 troops safely from Somalia in the 1990s. In Iraq, there is one road to Kuwait for thousands of convoys and much planning left to do for such a redeployment to occur safely. 
   And some ideas for a drawdown will prove less viable than some assume. For instance, maintaining residual forces to train Iraqis may well not work for the safety of U.S. troops embedded in an Iraqi military whose loyalty is suspect at best and fighting motivation questionable. Would we then need to retain large combat forces for their protection, and if so, how many? 
   Let's therefore understand the full limitations of such ideas before supporting them without careful strategic thought. 
   Such strategic considerations suggest that the precise shape of a strategy to redeploy matters a great deal. Responsibility should be assigned: To the Iraqis to assume accountability for their country; to regional nations to demonstrate accommodations towards  stability; and to Congress for the consequences of the aftermath which it will have dictated. 
   A realistic timeline of a year that is needed for a safe redeployment of our troops also serves well to protect our regional interests. It provides the time needed for a strategy of regional accommodation to take effect with Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, a strategy that rightly relies upon their long-term interest in a stable aftermath. 
   But in the end, we most importantly must make it clear that we will not be made hostage to the permission of our Iraqi friends. This is the crux of the strategic approach to enhancing our global strategic security: That while Iraqis will have ultimate say over their country, we as a Nation need to send a strong message that we are no longer willing to support it in a futile pursuit. 
   Only by a date that defines the end of our open-ended commitment can we force the Iraqis and regional nations to assume responsibility in working towards a stable Iraq. We will then, in the eyes of the world, leave with the Iraqis and regional nations having clearly helped choose the aftermath by their decisions or indecision. 
   We cannot afford an inconclusive, open-ended involvement within a country where the long-term security benefits do not match what we need to reap, and where the trade-off in benefits of not focusing elsewhere is harming our strategic security, including a significant negative impact on the readiness of our Armed Forces here at home. Nor can we afford a nonstrategic approach to the end to our involvement in this war, also undermining our future strategic security. Rather than leading to a spiral of violence, redeploying from Iraq under a strategic timeline of a year will serve as the necessary catalyst for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country, with regional nations then interested in ensuring stability when the United States is outside that nation, but remaining with strength in the region. 
   The needed accommodation will only come about when the Iraqi political leaders are forced to take the difficult political steps required to cease the violence in their country, such as building cooperation among competing sects and sharing oil revenues among all regions in Iraq. And regional nations' incentives, particularly Syria's and Iran's, change toward stability when the United States is no longer there in the midst of a civil war. And these nations will have to bear the consequences of further strife, with refugee flows to their countries and the possibility that these relatively allied nations could then be joined in a proxy battle to their detriment. 
   Ending this war is necessary but insufficient, and Mr. Speaker, how we end it and by what means is of even greater importance for the troop's safety and our own security.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Chairman, there are 8,500 autistic children in the U.S. military. Only 700 get intervention help. Part of the reason is that they, military families move every 2 to 3 years, and if they try to apply to their States into the right intervention help, they don't have enough time to get that.  
   The other problem is the TRICARE program has in place what's called Echo, where they get, after they wait quite some period of time, 1 hour of help each day. The American Academy of Pediatrics says it should be 5 hours minimum a day, and the National Research Council says 8 hours minimum a day. This amendment, amendment 10, merely says at this time let's give them at least 2 hours a day. 
   And then, because of Mr. Skelton, because of Congresswoman Davis, because of Congressman Snyder, this amendment is here today. Also in the bill is a study to see if we can't place them under standardized TRICARE plans so they can get everything that they need. 
   I very much appreciate your help, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I stood here a year ago and borrowed time from the other side to speak with my good colleague from Georgia against an amendment from my good colleague from Massachusetts that had defunded this school. 
   This school is everything you say it is. It has come a long way since the days of the School of the Americas. And I told the story of how I pulled into, during my 30 years in the military, one country where young officers got underway with us. And as the officers left, one of them said to me, You treat your enlisted different than we do. And I said, What do you mean? He said, You treat them as though they're equal to you. And I said, Well, they say ``yes, sir,'' ``no, sir.'' He said, No. You treat them as though they're equal human beings. We don't. 
   That's what's good about this School of the Americas. They're exposed to us, Americans. 
   But I took two other things away that day. That young man was attracted to us. Even though they respected the power of our economy and our military, he admired the power of our ideals. That's what is good about being attracted to our ideals. 
   I believe also in transparency because the second thing is I learned in this those 30 years that I did not work, even though I took orders from the Commander in Chief of this Nation, I worked for the public citizens of this country. They deserve to know how I was doing my job, whether it was leading men or women into harm's way or whether it was whom I was working with as long as it was safe for them. 
   I do believe that 40-some years of having told who these individuals were to change it, it eludes me why now it is a danger. I support the ideal of transparency. It was attracted into my ship that day, and that's why I always support this School of the Americas now that I know it's WHINSEC because of the good it can do in teaching transparency to those elsewhere.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, first I want to acknowledge my esteemed colleagues Congresswoman Schwartz and PATRICK MURPHY, and I very much respect what they're trying to do for the citizens of their districts. 
   However, I have stood in this Chamber and watched Representatives COSTELLO, OBERSTAR, ANDREWS, and many others try to bring about transparency to the Federal FAA and to resolve the chaos that is presently in our air traffic management systems. 
   We have had an FAA that has covered over the safety violations at Northwest and Southwest Airlines, letting 117 planes fly with safety violations. NASA has said there are twice as many near midair collisions than that FAA is reporting, with an 11 percent increase on near runway collisions last year over the previous year. I bring that up because I have also watched in  my district, which is near both of my esteemed colleagues. 
   And the FAA has now, after a period of time studying one option, has said that they will now no longer have aircraft take off from Philadelphia International Airport and stay over Delaware River, but they will now turn over my citizens, whom I care just as deeply about, at 500 feet. 
   The statistical studies that have been provided to the FAA that they have ignored means that the children under those aircraft will lose 1 year of education between pre-K and high school and they will be at the highest risk of the number one killer disease in America, cardiovascular disease. And when the FAA Administrator was asked what is the cost of this? she answered to Representative Andrews, ``We don't know.'' We don't know the financial cost nor do we know the social cost. 
   That is why the Government Accounting Office is investigating this one option. The study is due out this summer. There are 12 cases of litigation from four States that are trying to stop this option. 
   Therefore, I want to work and intend to work to stop this, but I am standing here today because I believe no option should be taken off the table until a comprehensive Federal, local, and regional air traffic management plan has been conducted, and then we should work together, joining together, so that no one will be advocating at Willow Grove any civilian airport nor should they be flying over my district. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (IN REMEMBRANCE OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL MILTON H. MEDENBACH -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I wish to honor a proud American and because it is my sad duty to announce the loss of Lieutenant General Milton H. Medenbach, superintendent emeritus of Valley Forge Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, who died this morning, January 16, 2007. 
   Lieutenant General Medenbach turned 99 on December 31, 2006, and had been a member of the Valley Forge Military Academy & College faculty and staff since the fall of 1932. General Medenbach is a 1929 graduate of the Johns Hopkins University, where he was commissioned a secretary lieutenant, infantry (TANKS). 
   He also attended the University of Marburg in Germany and was a student of military government at the University of Virginia and Yale University during his active military service. He held a doctorate from Gettysburg College. 
   Upon the completion of his fellowship at the School of Diplomatic Service of the Austrian Foreign Office in Vienna, Austria, in 1932, he came home and joined the Valley Forge faculty as an instructor in the Foreign Language Department and as a tactical officer in  the Commandant of Cadets Department. 
   On leave from Valley Forge during World War II, General Medenbach served as Secretary of the General staff of the Army Air Corps Tactical Training Command and the Air Corps Training Command and later, in North Africa, Italy, France, Germany and Austria as a military government planner and officer under Field Marshal Alexander and General Eisenhower. 
   Following active duty, General Medenbach returned to Valley Forge and served in the Pennsylvania National Guard. His many decorations included the Legion of Merit, the European Service Ribbon with two battle stars, the American Defense Ribbon, the Meritorious Service Unit Award, and the Pennsylvania State Guard Reserve Distinguished Service Ribbon. He was also listed in Who's Who in America. 
   During his Valley Forge service, General Medenbach served in or assisted in the establishment of practically every department of the institution as an associate of the founder, Lieutenant General Milton G. Baker. He held the post of adjutant and chief of staff, as well as deputy superintendent, and served for more than 30 years as the commandant of cadets. 
   He became the president on the retirement of General Baker and retired as superintendent emeritus in 1971. More recently, he served the school as volunteer historian and archivist and as the vice president and secretary of the Chapel Foundation Board of Directors. 
   During the many years of his long service, General Medenbach was the driving force in establishing the high standards of character, personal discipline, drill, ceremonies, and individual fitness that have been the hallmarks of military excellence at Valley Forge. 
   It is with great sadness that we mourn his passing, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family at this time, as we thank him for his service.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, through my 31 years in the military, I came to understand throughout this world how much we are respected for the power of our military, for the power of our economy, and admired for the power of our ideals. 
   After I became head of the Navy's antiterrorism unit after 9/11, I came to truly understand the value of data mining facilitated by eavesdropping properly done. But I relearned the lesson I had learned at the White House as Director of Defense Policy, as intelligence officers came forward to the President, that seldom does one need a one-armed intelligence officer. In their gray world, it is often on the one hand, but on the other hand. Therefore, you often press for more intelligence. When I went into Afghanistan with the CIA and we had millions of dollars to buy loyalty on that ground, we wanted all the intelligence. But I know the FISA system, and that is giving to them the ability to give it. 
   What we did is we met with my colleague from the Navy, Admiral McConnell. We facilitated the ease by which we could do this. The bill we voted on last night is the right bill. It gives the proper balance. It gives the ability to the President to come and do his intelligence seeking, even coming later if he must, to the FISA court. 
   My concern is what Benjamin Franklin said: Those who give up liberty for the sake of security deserve neither liberty nor security.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, this is a tough bill. We found out after Vietnam that, instead of rotating our forces, if we had just stayed there with the same force, as we did in World War II, our fighting would have been more effective and less lives would have been lost. But this war is different. 
   We found out in World War II that, on average, a man in that combat did 182 days of combat, horrific combat, but 182 days on average. In this war, in those 15 months, our men and women are overseas in Iraq. Every day of those 15 months those men and women go outside the wire, into combat. This is a different war. 
   I am taken, first and foremost, by the reports that more are coming home with post-traumatic syndrome. I am, second, taken with our constitutional responsibility to make rules for the government and regulation of our armed services. And then third, I'm taken by the waiver, the national security waiver that is placed within this bill that our national command authorities, the President and the Secretary of Defense may waiver for national security reasons the requirement to send troops forward if they have even been home less than they were in combat. 
   Our national command authorities every day must approve every deployment. They must, therefore, only turn to us and say it is a national requirement that they must redeploy less than they have been over there in Iraq.     
   This is a different war, and I am glad to see we are taking seriously our responsibility to provide for the rules,  the regulation, the government of our armed services in what is truly a different war and yet give our President the right to ensure that the risks are weighed for a national security waiver.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, H.R. 3. While I am about to  talk to a personal story, the issue of stem cell research is not just personal, it is much more than that. 
   A year and a half ago, I retired from the U.S. Navy as my then-4-year-old daughter, Alex, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She is here today thanks to the wonderful medical treatment that she received from our Nation's doctors and nurses including high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell infusion. 
   The medical coverage I received from our country as a military member allowed my daughter to receive the best care it had to offer, the care every American child should have access to. And that is why I ask to speak to this bill today above all others. 
   The best of medical care today may not be good enough for tomorrow. Take a case such as my daughter's: there is a chance that brain tissue may be harmed by the very treatments intended to save young lives. 
   Why would we preclude the medical promise that stem cell research offers for tomorrow's recuperative treatment or cure, not just for my daughter, but for all those Americans whose lives are inflicted by serious disease, or who now pass prematurely from us when they might not? 
   Embryonic stem cell research may mean that every day 3,000 of our loved ones affected by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or diabetes or spinal cord injury might have the quality and the full time of life they would not otherwise have. 
   I thought about life every day as I lived in the pediatric oncology ward at Children's Hospital, just down the street from here. I always wondered if the children there would have a chance to experience life to its fullest. 
   I understand debates, and I respect those couched in moral terms; but when the bargain we are offered is the opportunity that a child might live, how can we not strike that bargain? 
   I would hope that we would not let young or old lives be shortened by the worst of plagues, which is, ``what might have been'' for them. For the promise of life, its quality, is the congressional tasking we are most charged with to promote the general welfare. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (IRAQ AND U.S. SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I commanded an aircraft carrier battle group of 30 ships off Afghanistan during the war from the Indian Ocean. We were told one day to take those 30 ships into the Persian Gulf, which some thought would be the running start to the Iraqi war. 
   Of those 30 ships, 20 of them were not United States' ships. They were Japanese. They were Australian. They were Italian. They were Greek. There were many other ships from throughout this world. But when we entered through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf, none of those ships came with us except the British and the Australians. At that time, I knew that this war in Iraq would be a tragic misadventure. 
   Two months after the war in Afghanistan commenced, I was actually on the ground in Afghanistan. I saw for a very short period of time what needed to be done in order to bring about a successful resolution of that conflict. 
   After the war in Iraq was over and I left my carrier battle group, I was on the ground again for a short period again in Afghanistan and saw what had not been done, because we had diverted not just our attention but our resources, our PSYOPS forces, our special forces, our civil affairs units to Iraq. To me, Afghanistan is a poster child, as it is pre-terrorist and the Taliban have shifted into the southern provinces again and what Iraq has done to U.S. security worldwide. 
   So, therefore, I believe that the only strategy that we can pursue for success in Iraq is to have a date that is certain by which we will redeploy out of Iraq. We have to do this for two primary reasons. 
   First, a date certain changes the structure of incentives within the countries that are in that region to change the behavior. Iraqis need to step up to the plate, understanding we will not be there providing political and military cover to pursue the personal fiefdoms within the ministries of Baghdad's governments. 
   Also, Iran and Syria are involved destructively in this war. Once they know that we will not be there, they have an incentive to work for stability. They do not want the more than 4 million refugees that are dislocated within Iraq, and some have already filled our borders, to continue to overflow it, if we are not there to contain that instability. 
   Second, they do not want a proxy war between these two allied nations, Syria, Sunni and Iranian Shi'a. If we are not there, they do not want to fuel a proxy war between themselves as they support different religious factions. 
   But there is a second reason why we must have a date certain with sufficient time to redeploy our troops. 
   It took us 6 months to redeploy out of Somalia, a much smaller force. In Iraq, we have 140,000 troops and over 100,000 civilians. No one should ever try to redeploy those troops, and what is the hardest military operation to do is withdrawal, when they are most vulnerable in a short period of time. 
   We must have a date certain as a strategy, as the only leverage remaining to change the behavior of nations within that region to work for stability and to have our troops, those who wear the cloth of this Nation, that we sent there to have a redeployment that can be safe. 
   I ask this Congress to think the next time, as we must work for an end to this open-ended commitment, that we do so with sufficient time, as my bill said, by the end of December 31, but on an authorization bill, not an appropriations bill, where we again would be forced to vote, as I had to, for the safety of our troops versus the need to redeploy from Iraq, under a strategy which can leave behind an unfailed state. 
   To bring about greater security, an authorization bill is needed. Being in the military is a dangerous business. It has the dignity of danger. It should never be unsafe because we are forced in an appropriations bill, with a short period of time, to not provide the resources for our forces. 
   I therefore say that it needs to be an authorization bill with a date certain to bring about a greater security for the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, much has been said about how we got into this situation, although someone said it best, I thought: too little oversight, too much greed, too little understanding. 
   But there are several things we do understand. There is no single cause for why we got into this housing crisis, so there is no single solution. 
   But second, we must act now. This March, there was a 57 percent increase in the number of defaults than the previous March a year ago. And of all of the adjustable rate mortgages that will be reset this year to a higher interest rate, 80 percent are the subprime category. Those subprime categories are at a delinquency twice that of a fixed rate. In short, even before the interest rates go up, we have so many people who are already in trouble with their loans. 
   Third, and most importantly, this is not just about the homeowner or the mortgage lender, this is about all of us. What we have seen is not just harming the housing and manufacturing industries, it has seeped over into the bond market for municipal bonds and even for education to where, because of the exposure of bond insurers, we cannot have bonds that are being given in these categories. So, therefore, I think very highly of this bill. 
   I think this bill is done in the right way. It is providing relief to actual, real people, those living in homes, not speculators. Second, it steps over and it doesn't give any bailout to lenders. It says you must write down your loans and you must pay into a reserve fund and do closing costs. 
   Most importantly, it has the government reaping the rewards when the houses inevitably go back up in value. I think this is great for the economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask one thing to consider as we go forward. I am taken by incentivizing people to come forward. And as someone on the other side said, incentivizing them even by being exposed to more risk. The CBO said that out of the 2.8 million foreclosures expected to occur if nothing happens between now and 2013, about 500,000 loans will be refinanced.  
   CBO believes that many original and secondary lenders will be reluctant to participate. 
   This is a problem that must be addressed. To be most effective, I believe that there must be greater incentives for the original lien holders--who take the haircut up front--to have the option to share in some portion of potential profits on resale. 
   For those lenders willing to take a bigger piece of the risk upfront (beyond the 85 percent of current market value limit in the bill), there should be added incentive to participate in the upside potential. 
   Overall, I support this bill because it addresses many of the issues that need to be solved quickly. But I believe that more needs to be done to provide proper incentives to ensure that lenders, who will play a critical role in the economic and housing recovery, will fully participate, and I am prepared to work with the Chairman and House leadership for an appropriate resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. I appreciate that from my colleague from New Hampshire. 
   I want to comment upon what all three of you brought out, and I thought brought out well. I would like to speak about it from my experience. 
   I remember being on the ground in Afghanistan 2 months after that war began. I had the opportunity during a very short period of time to see what needed to be done. I left, brought back an aircraft carrier battle group for that war. Then we brought that battle group into the Persian Gulf for what we thought would be the starting run of the Iraqi conflict, and thinking what a tragic misadventure this would be. 
   Those words were brought back to me as I thought about them 18 months later when I returned on the ground in Afghanistan and saw what had not been accomplished when I had known what had to be done. Because we diverted our attention and our resources, our Psychological Operations Forces, our Special Operations Forces, our Civil Affairs Forces and the attention of this Nation from Afghanistan to Iraq. 
   To me, Afghanistan is prey to terrorists now once again as the Taliban regain control in parts of the southern provinces. And as we look inserting more forces back into Afghanistan, it is a poster child for what Iraq is really about. 
   Iraq is a conflict, a civil war that has hurt our strategic security, and Afghanistan is merely a poster child for how the rest of our global security, as well as our homeland security, has suffered. 
   There is not one army unit here at home, not one, Army, Guard, Active Guard or Reserve, that is in a state of readiness, that is committed to deploy anyplace in the world, as was said earlier, to any contingency elsewhere, from Korea to the Western Pacific, to help our other forces. Nor are we engaged in this world where the true center of gravity, strategic gravity for the United States is over the next decade, the Western Pacific, nor in Southeast Asia, nor in the Middle East. 
   We have walked away from a strategy of engagement in this world as we have narrowed down to a conflict that is a civil war in one country. We need to step back and look at Iraq. Not as itself alone, but as a piece in our strategic template of how we look at the security environment across this world. Therefore, we need a change in this strategy. 
   It is not about getting out of Iraq, as you well said. It is not just about returning our troops home. It is about a proper redeployment of our forces in order to enhance the security of America. 
   I am not anti-war. I am pro-security. And the Democratic approach to this is one that recognizes and should recognize with the Republicans, because we need them and they need us, to define the end of what President Bush said on 10 January would not be an open-ended commitment. 
   We need to define that end as a certain date, a specific date, approximately a year, that says to everyone in that region that behavior now has the incentive to change, because we will no longer be in Iraq providing the political and military cover for this civil war to continue to simmer as the politicians in Iraq, failing to step up to the plate because they are pursuing their personal fiefdoms, their personal ambitions in the 32 ministries that they run, as we provide their security. 
   And of great importance is Iran. When I was there with Senator Hagel  a few months ago, everyone talked about the undue influence of Iran. Why not? We are in there bleeding, and that country wants us to bleed profusely. But if we were to set a date certain and to lead with confidence and engage Iran and Syria, to bring them to the table, our most senior political leader, U.S. political leader in Iraq said in response to a question, Iran does not want a failed state if we redeploy. 
   It may not want the government we want, but it does not want a failed state. It doesn't want the 2 million Iraqi refugees there that have not already overflowed Iraq's borders to continue to flow over Iran's. Nor does it want a proxy war between it, the Shi'as in Iran supporting the Shia in Iraq, and the Sunnis in Syria supporting the Sunnis in Iraq. Once we are out, they don't want that war to ensue. 
   So, what this future plan is to be about is a redeployment to enhance America's security by focusing where we need to in this world, beginning with Afghanistan, and a readiness here at home to bring it back up, to remain in that region on bases we already have and had before the conflict with troops there in Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, with a carrier battle group and amphibious ready group, and then deal with strength as we safely redeploy over a year's period, approximately. Because it took 6 months to redeploy out of Somalia with approximately 8,000 troops. 
   We have got 160,000 in Iraq and over 100,000 U.S. civilian contractors to safely redeploy. As we do this with a date certain and incentive to change the behavior of the Iraqis so they step up to the plate, knowing they must assume responsibilities, it brings the Iranians and Syrians together, with us remaining in the region, to have a strategy that leads to diplomacy, so that there is an accommodation for a non-failed state. A region we have our interests in, we will remain there, and a state that has brought the parties together under the incentive of a date certain to work towards stability. 
   I appreciate being able to make these comments which tonight's discussion I believe have really pointed us towards a strategic approach to a date to redeploy.

   Mr. SESTAK. If I may add onto comments made by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Klein), the lack of a strategy of engagement by this administration where it became focused and stuck in Iraq has hurt our security tremendously. We outsourced our leadership during that period of time to others. 
   North Korea went to China. We gave Iran to the European Union. And I can't tell you who we gave the Middle East to. 
   Let's step back and look at what has occurred. A conflict in the Middle East where our Secretary of State stopped by for a photo-op and continued down, in the midst of that conflict, to Southeast Asia for a conference. 
   Iran, bent now upon a nuclear weapon. And North Korea, as you referenced, during that period of time as they called General Powell back, who tried to continue the negotiations that the Clinton administration had left the Bush administration with an agreed framework not to have a nuclear reactor continue to produce fissile material. And a missile moratorium. They now at least have seven more nuclear weapons, if they care to build them.     
   And they've exploded one of them. And they've broken the missile moratorium and only belatedly have they actually gone back now and agreed to the same agreement that the Clinton administration had. 
   Iraq is such a tragedy. Iran, when General Ikenberry was leaving, our three-star general from Afghanistan, he was asked, does Iran work toward our interest there? The answer was yes. You want stability in Afghanistan. It doesn't want the Taliban there or al  Qaeda. So we step back and say engage, engage with consequences Iran, Syria, give them a date that we won't be in that state of Iraq and they with Iraqis and Saudis and Jordan must step up so we can be about this world and ensure our security elsewhere. That's what this debate is about.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak for a few minutes about Iraq. Every Member of the House brings their experience with them. Mine happens to be 31 years in the military, including leading men and women in war. I have operated with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, entered the DMZ in North Korea, dealt with the Iranians at sea in the Persian Gulf. 
   When I saw us about to go into Iraq, I was concerned. I felt it was a tragic misadventure, not because of Iraq solely by itself, but because of what it would do to our strategic security around this globe. 
   I flew with my battle group over Iraq just prior to the war, after having left the war in Afghanistan. I have always been taken in the military by the power of our diplomacy, the power of our diplomats, because they are the ones who often have prevented us from having to use our military. I honestly believe there is a way to redeploy from Iraq that does not mean just getting out nor just bringing the troops home. Those are the wrong words. 
   Iraq is a set piece in a strategic environment around this world that the United States has interest in. And there is a way to end this tragic misadventure, to redeploy out of Iraq so we might place our men and women where they need to be in Afghanistan, the western Pacific, and here at home to improve the readiness of our Army that has not one, not one active Guard or Reserve unit that is in a state of readiness to deploy anywhere to any other contingency in this world. 
   And that strategy is really brought about by changing the behavior, in particular, of Iran, who I have operated with at sea, and Iraq and Syria, and the other nations in that region. We will not do that by doubling down once again on a bad bet with a surge of military forces. I know. I have watched it happen before. 
   This can only be resolved by a strategy that sets a date, a date within a year by which we will redeploy out of Iraq, because that date is not just for ending this war, it has the value of a different strategy to leave an unfailed state, as Iran, recognizing that we will no longer be in that state, but we will remain in the region at our bases that we do have in Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates; and our carrier battle group and our amphibious ready group in that region because we have interests there. 
   But by that date we change the behavior of Iran who does not want to deal by itself with the 2 million Iraqis who have been dislocated from their homes and have yet to overflow their borders, as 2 million others have. 
   And Syria, that is Sunni, does not want as it fuels, after we leave there, a civil war, would be fueling the Sunnis against the Shia that the Iranians might be supporting. Neither nation wants a proxy war. 
   If we work diplomatically with a date certain, because they don't want us to remain in that nation, we have the ability to bring to the table the interested parties who can work on the extreme elements in that nation, Iran and Syria; and we deal with the center, the government of Baghdad, with a date certain that makes them recognize they must also step up to the plate and assume responsibility for the country which they have done and presently have to do as we keep a lid politically and militarily on a simmering pot. 
   There is a strategy which I believe we need to pursue, Republican and Democrat together, that sets a date of approximately a year, which gives us time to safely redeploy. Because, remember, it took us 6 months to redeploy out of Somalia with only about 8,000 troops, when we have 160,000 in Iraq with over 100,000 U.S. contractors. We need time to safely redeploy with a strategy that works to bring Iran and Syria to the table because they have interests in accommodating stability as we remain in that region because of our interests, providing air cover if necessary from above, from bases outside or Special Forces from outside, as we begin to address our other security interests around the world and here at home.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I was assigned to the Pentagon the day 9/11 happened. It was very obvious, sitting there at dead center, that the world had changed. We in the military used to like away games. We liked our wars over there. Suddenly we had a home game and things had to change. 
   A few days later, I was appointed to be head of the Navy's antiterrorism unit. Shortly after that, I was on the ground in Afghanistan flying in with a fellow from the CIA with a suitcase filled with millions of dollars. I wanted the best insurance, the best intelligence. But I felt I always had that because I had worked at the National Security Council, where in counterproliferation and antiterrorism efforts there, I was able to see that whether it had been President Reagan, President Clinton, or the first President Bush, FISA provided that ability. 
   I like this bill. It is very similar to the Senate bill. If someone in Saudi Arabia is talking to someone in Germany and it routes to the United States, we can listen in without asking questions. 
   I remember being in the White House and being frustrated, because if somebody was doing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we couldn't, under FISA, get a warrant for them. This bill fixes that. 
   And then I step back in emergencies. This bill fixes it in an emergency situation that you don't even have to ask permission; you can just do it. And it extends from 3 days of having to come to the court till 7 days. And then even if the court takes another 30 days, keep listening. Thank you for that. 
   But the real differences come down to what I think is important, because every day I was out there for 31 years in the military, I wasn't just fighting an enemy or trying to deter him; I was fighting for an ideal, the ideal of which America is founded upon, the rights of civil rights. Therefore, I honestly believe what we have done in the telecommunications companies and discussing immunity should be done by the proper branch of government, the judicial branch, a court, the FISA Court. Then if everything was not awry, then we can say, under the provisions of the previous law, they have immunity. 
   And then I would like to also point out that it is very important to me that we have oversight on reports that are coming, and they must come to the FISA Court to explain the procedures they will follow. That type of oversight is what I followed for. In short, I will never forget being over there in charge of my carrier battle group, fighting in Afghanistan, that what I was fighting for was security, number one, properly balanced with civil rights. This bill  does do that. I wouldn't vote for it any other way unless it did.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I asked to speak this evening on SCHIP, the bill that was passed today. Unfortunately, I was unable to be there during the day here on the House floor during the debate, but I wanted to speak about the importance of it to me personally and why I think it is important to this Nation. 
   Two years ago this month, or just around this month, having served 31 years in our military, my 4-year-old daughter, my only daughter, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and given 3 to 9 months to live. We began a series of brain operations and then chemotherapy. 
   Down the street in Children's Hospital, we began that treatment, and about January when we were done and began to think about what to do with the rest of my life, having then retired from the military to live with my daughter on an oncology ward, it became very important to me to remember what I saw when we began that chemotherapy treatment. 
   We were in a small room like anybody else who has been in a hospital. We had a roommate. It was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy here from Washington, D.C., who had entered the hospital that day because he had been diagnosed with acute leukemia. 
   And for about 6 hours as my daughter was undergoing her first chemotherapy, vomiting about, as I remember, 19 times that day, we could not help but overhear through this thin curtain that separated the bed from my daughter's social workers who came and went, working with the parents of that young child to see if he might remain there in the hospital to be treated for his cancer. And they had to do that because he was uninsured. 
   Here I had been in the navy for 31 years, and the one time I had a personal challenge, and I had many professional challenges, this Nation gave my daughter an opportunity. 
   I took her pathology slides everywhere, Children's, Mass General, John Hopkins, Children's in Philadelphia, and then we sought the best out to give her an opportunity, having been challenged for just 3 to 9 months to live. 
   I went away to an 11-month war and never worried that my daughter and my wife would be taken care of. I don't understand how that young child, 2 1/2 years old, sitting in that room next to my daughter did not have the same opportunity. Where was the Nation for him? 
   So, therefore, I just rose to speak today that why I entered the race for Congress after 31 years in the military was not, as many assumed, because of the Iraqi war, that tragic misadventure, but rather, it was to give every child the same opportunity mine had. 
   Hubert Humphrey said it well: The moral test of a government is how well it takes care of those in the dawn of life, the children; those in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the disabled, the handicapped. 
   But for me, it was more personal. This Nation was here for me. I owe it. And I intend to pay it back by continuing to work for programs like SCHIP where that young 2 1/2 -year-old boy, uninsured, had to wait for the social workers to convince an administration that he might have the opportunity to live. 
   That's why SCHIP to me is so important.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (OVERRIDE THE VETO OF PRESIDENT BUSH -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on whether to override the veto of President Bush on the Defense authorization bill. He vetoed this bill because, within it, it permitted a servicemember who had been tortured in the first Gulf War to not only successfully sue the Iraqi Government, but having won that case, to be able to be given what the court awarded him or her. 
   I am concerned and fear that tomorrow this House will vote to recommit to send that bill back to the House Armed Services Committee and to put a waiver in that bill which will permit President Bush to be able to overrule a court that has now awarded, as it has, a servicemember, having been tortured, the judgment that that court gave of Iraqi monies that are held here in the United States. 
   The reason for that is the Iraqi Government has threatened to pull out of the United States $25 billion that it has invested over here. Every month we put almost $12 billion into Iraq in addition to those that wear the cloth of this Nation. 
   This is a good bill in many ways, providing a pay raise of 3.5 percent that is needed for the men and women that serve our Nation, but I do not understand how this President nor how this Congress could ever permit a man or a woman who has worn the cloth of this Nation in a war to have sued successfully, having been tortured, as law permits, to now not be permitted to gain the judgment that a court has given him or her merely because the Iraqi Government, obligated under international law for anything that prior governments in Iraq or any country that another successive government has succeeded to be responsible for merely because that government has threatened to take out of this country $25 billion. 
   We should vote to try to override this veto with the many good things in this bill. Many of us talk about taking care of our men and women. How can those who have not only come close to giving the ultimate sacrifice by torture, and who have continued to serve this Nation as they have come home, not be successful in being given what the court has provided them in their judgment?

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of this amendment, to encourage more individuals to become Head Start and Early Head Start teachers, and to provide a way for existing Head Start teachers to improve their skills and education. 
   This amendment is just building upon the efforts of someone that I have grown to very much respect, Congressman Tierney, who has been working on this issue for years. 
   Specifically, this amendment proposes loan forgiveness of up to $10,000 for Head Start and Early Head Start teachers upon completion of a bachelor's degree, who will commit to working in a Head Start or Early Head Start program for at least 3 consecutive years. 
   Earlier this spring, I held my district's first education summit, bringing together over 300 educators, experts, and citizens. We discussed the need to provide and retain high quality Head Start teachers, who serve our country's most disadvantaged, low-income children. 
   Head Start teachers are so critical at the time of a child's cognitive reasoning development, and this amendment recognizes this by ensuring that more than 55,000 Head Start teachers have the means of getting their bachelor's degree by forgiving their student loan burden. 
   As we call for increased qualifications in the Head Start workforce in H.R. 1429, with 50 percent Head Start teachers nationwide now to hold a bachelor's degree by 2013, we should also provide the means to help them reach this goal. This amendment offers one way of helping current Head Start teachers upgrade their qualifications, as well as to encourage future and current students to enter this important field of teaching. 
   The rising cost of higher education is a concern for many, and repaying student loans is often too burdensome for these teachers, particularly when one realizes that Head Start teachers' average annual salary is only approximately $24,000 a year, forcing teachers not to go on to receive advanced degrees, or else to leave the profession in order to repay their student loans. 
   This amendment will help to ensure that we are able to recruit and retain a high quality workforce for our Nation's Head Start programs. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this critical amendment to help our children's future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, I retired from the U.S. Navy after 31 years in our military, serving our Nation during the challenges of peace and in the fury of war, including commanding an aircraft carrier battle group of 30 ships and 15,000 sailors in combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Having worn the cloth of this Nation for so long, I know that our military is a national treasure that cannot be hoarded like miser's gold if it is to be a force for peace and progress, but nor can it be used recklessly. And now, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I am conscious that war is a shared responsibility in our Constitution between the President and Congress, as are the respective responsibilities of the executive and legislative branches to ensure U.S. security, and to provide for our common defense. 
   My experience leads me to be concerned for U.S. security because of Iraq, a tragic misadventure that does not permit us to best address more important security challenges throughout the world. My experience also says don't double down on a bad military bet by using more troops as the President has proposed, when an increase has not worked before; have confidence in our diplomatic ability to lead regional negotiations for stability, even with Syria and Iran; and, set a date certain for redeploying out of Iraq, this year, to serve as the necessary leverage to have the Iraqis accept the reality of the personal consequence of not assuming responsibility for their nation. 
   What concerns me about Iraq is the continuing use of our national treasure in what is an inconclusive, open-ended involvement within a country where the long-term benefits do not match what we need to reap, and where the tradeoffs in benefits of not focusing elsewhere is harming our future prosperity, interests, and values. 
   We need to apply our resources elsewhere in the world, where terrorists come from, including Osama bin Laden, who is still on the loose, or where emerging nations such as in the Western Pacific have growing political and economic interests, and therefore influence, that may challenge ours. 
   An alternative strategy is just what is needed, because remaining in Iraq means less security and a greater strategic security risk for America. It negatively impacts the readiness of our Armed Forces and hinders our ability to adequately focus on other security priorities here at home and throughout the world, including the global war on terror and regional challenges from Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iran to the Western Pacific and Middle East regions. 
   The fact is we have fostered a culture of dependence in Iraq, and it is time for Iraqi leaders to be responsible for their own country. They must make the difficult political compromises that will stop the civil war we are refereeing and bring about stability. We cannot do this work for them. Nor is that wonderful phrase I heard often when deployed to that region throughout the years, Anshala, Bugra: God willing, tomorrow, good enough any longer. 
   So, yes, I will vote for this resolution, because sending more troops to Iraq and remaining there indefinitely will only increase the dependence of the Iraqis on America, both politically and militarily, at a time when they should be shouldering increased responsibility for their country, while impacting our degraded military and strategic security readiness further. 
   But I also believe we need to go a step further and pursue an alternative strategy, which is why last week I introduced binding legislation setting the end of 2007 for our redeployment from Iraq. The rationale for doing so is clear: Redeployment from Iraq will enhance our security by allowing us to properly address other potential challenges around the world, and by allowing us to resolve the concerns about the readiness of our Armed Forces here at home. 
   Rather than leading to a spiral of violence, redeploying from Iraq will serve as the necessary catalyst for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country, with regional nations then interested in ensuring stability when the United States is outside that country, but remaining with strength in the region. The needed reconciliation will only come about when the Iraqi political leaders are forced to take the difficult political steps needed to cease the violence in their country, such as building coalitions among competing sects, ensuring minority rights, balancing power between provincial and central governments, and sharing oil revenues among all regions in Iraq. And regional nations', particularly Syria's and Iran's, incentives change toward stability when the United States is no longer in the midst of the civil war, and these nations will have to bear the consequences of further strife, with refugee flows to their countries, and the possibility that these relatively allied nations could then be joined into a proxy battle to their detriment, as one is primarily Sunni and the other Shia. 
   Only by a strategy of setting a date certain, a deliberate timetable for redeployment, are we able to create a catalyst for the political leaders in Iraq to acknowledge and accept that they must undertake the difficult political steps necessary to cease the sectarian violence, as they understand that they otherwise would bear the consequences of not assuming the responsibility for their country. 
   Iraq is not the central front in terrorism. Rather, it is a result of our leadership forgetting the age-old axiom that ``successful generals win, then they go to war.'' In short, we did not accurately plan before we went into Iraq, and we should redeploy.  
   The only way is to use our redeployment as the catalyst for Iraqis and other regional nations to accept their responsibilities for a relative peace. U.S. interests in the world do not  include pouring endless amounts of our national treasure of lives and money into elusive, endless goals when there is an alternative strategy, and when we have so much else to achieve in this world.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, from when I joined up during Vietnam to when I retired last year from the military, I always watched with respect how when human nature can be at its worst in a war, in actual combat, that there were still rules of law that set the boundaries beyond which individual actions would be held accountable. 
   I also watched during those decades with interest as contractors became a more significant and important part of our military and its operations. But I viewed with concern the men and the women that we began to assign to military security operations in this latest conflict. 
   I say that because even though I know a number of them and served with them, they were now outside those rules of law. I think that this bill is an important step within a war zone to take them back within the same standards of accountability. I speak to this because there are in the military ``forces'' and ``force.'' Our force is lethal. Our forces are comprised of individuals, and something we pride ourselves out there, which is often indistinguishable from civilians in a country we are, is that these forces, lethal on one hand, are also the GI that carries that candy bar and puts the ideals of America first and foremost.     
   So that's why I rise in support of this bill for the accountability that it brings, and I believe this is a first good step which should have been done earlier. But I also speak in support because it takes us another step hopefully towards another action that needs to be taken. 
   I remember speaking to the colonel after the four individuals at Blackwater were found outside Fallujah, and as they came back and had the remains, he said to me, ``If only they had called me, I could have told them that that road was not secure that day.'' 
   And so, as war changes, it is important to bring not just better coordination but the accountability of the rule of law which have always bound our military well, that there are individual actions which cannot be outside those boundaries or they will be held accountable. 
   I praise you much for bringing this bill here today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, the completion of the human genome project 5 years ago made it possible to identify specific genes that trigger diseases later in life. However, out of at fear of losing their jobs or their health insurance, studies have shown that many Americans forego the potential health benefits of genetic testing. 
   While involved in a course at the University of Pennsylvania on genetic discrimination, the position paper Dr. Ruth Cowan's students presented to me reemphasized that this concern of genetic discrimination risks stifling further scientific advances in genetic based research. 
   No genetic nondiscrimination laws in health care, such as in my State of Pennsylvania, may mean foregoing cures based upon genetic research. With a young daughter who underwent treatment for a malignant brain tumor recently, I understand why, as scientific technology advances, discrimination cannot grow with it, or we harm not only the quality of life, but life itself. 
   With State laws varying in how to maintain the privacy of genetic information, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will set a national standard and take the first step toward advancing the scientific and health benefits of genetic research and protecting the genetic privacy of Americans. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, when 9/11 happened, we, as a Nation, realized that, while we used to like away games, we liked our wars over there, suddenly we were confronted with a home game, a danger right here in America. And so the discussion over the last few weeks over the wiretapping capability of the United States is absolutely critical. I know. I headed, after 9/11, the Navy's Antiterrorism Unit. 
   When the bill came over here from the Senate, we asked for what we should have done. Time to address two important issues. One, what's the proper oversight that we should have on those who wiretap? An Inspector General, a report to Congress and to the Surveillance Court. And second, amnesty. Do we give someone who has broken the law, the telecommunication companies, amnesty for facilitating wiretapping? We may. But first let us know, before you give someone amnesty, why they did it and what they did. 
   In short, right now we're operating under the same rules as President Reagan had, as the first President Bush and the second President Bush had for 6 1/2 years. Now we need to compromise on both sides to ensure that our security is balanced with proper civil rights.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, when I joined the Navy during the Vietnam War, we had one destroyer in the Persian Gulf. And a few years later in the early 1970s, we had our very first embargo of oil, blockade of oil of the United States when OPEC, which today controls 42 percent of the oil resources, shut off the spigot. Shortly thereafter, in the Navy, we moved an aircraft carrier battle group into the Persian Gulf where it has remained ever since. 
   Including during the war, the tanker war in the 1980s where we convoyed oil tankers back and forth, and as we did so and I did so, I just questioned all the time, Why are we doing this? Can't we act? I watched from the mid-1980s as the amount of oil imports from overseas increased from 27 percent to 60 percent today. We are en route to 70 percent by 2025. And $7 trillion we have lost due to these price disruptions and these price manipulations by those overseas. 
   Do we expect the price to go down like it did after the 1970s? I'm not so sure, unless we take action. Because now we have China that just this past year passed us as the number one emitter of bad air emissions at 22 percent of all bad greenhouse emissions. This is a China that in the next decade wants an Ozzie and Harriet home for everyone in its populace. In one decade that will take as much energy that we have used as a world in the last two centuries. 
   As I sit back, I believe that this bill is late. It should have been done before. It should have had these incentives for us to manufacture energy-efficient appliances; to have working families then be incentivized to purchase them; to have production tax credits in order to have affordable energy, solar power, and geothermal energy. 
   I speak here from the experience of being out there. This is a military security issue. This is an energy security issue but also a military security issue, a national security issue. 
   And on FISA, if I might speak, I headed the Navy's antiterrorism unit. I was in the White House working terrorism issues. This bill is about efficiency, not effectiveness. We are as safe today as when President Reagan operated under FISA as the first President Bush, as this President. I know. I was on the ground in Afghanistan. I wanted that intelligence. There is no way I would even vote in order to do what we are doing on FISA if I didn't know the men and women who wear the cloth of this Nation are not as safe today as they were a year ago.

And this Nation, because of my military service, gave me the best health care possible for her to have an opportunity, her roommate was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy diagnosed with acute leukemia whose parents did not have health insurance and social workers had to discuss whether that boy would, with my daughter, have an opportunity to live into life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill for three reasons. First is the cost. As my colleagues have previously said, we should have raised from these private agencies at least $44 million to $63 million to date. In fact, it has only been $25 million, with a sum cost of $51 million. 
   Second is the more cost-effective way that another agency, the IRS, might do this. We know that they have collected this year alone $5.3 million from the Automated Call Service. Imagine if we had not decreased the number of IRS officers from 8,500 during the nineties down to only 5,200 today and we had put the money into them or into the Automated Call Service. That 20-to-1 return that the government gets far exceeds the 4-to-1 return of private agencies. 
   Third, however, after 31 years in the military, it pained me to see us outsource our security operations to  private agencies in Iraq. At times there is abuse, not dissimilar to what we hear today, such as seniors and those in Iraq being called. In fact, a senior couple was called 150 times, five times a day. Then we learned they had the wrong number. 
   Mr. Speaker, I therefore rise in support of this bill because of the cost-effectiveness of the IRS and because of the abuses that can occur if it is not within a government agency.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member. 
   For the past 10 years, the FAA has been working on the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan area airspace redesign project. In the time that I and Representative Andrews from New Jersey have been working on this issue, it has become increasingly clear to us that the process by which it was conducted is deeply flawed. We are gravely concerned that the FAA has failed to conduct an accurate cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the full cost of this project, including social costs such as the impact of noise on the educational development, health, safety, and property values to dense residential communities, including many in Delaware County in my congressional district, as well as Camden and Gloucester Counties in Representative Andrews' congressional district. 
   As the 2005 Department of Transportation Inspector General report and as former FAA Administrator Marion Blakely indicated to us, the cost effectiveness and operational efficiency gained by the airspace redesign is still largely unknown, and, quite frankly, ``the juice is not worth the squeeze.'' 
   I would like to thank my colleagues Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello for supporting a Government Accountability Office study to provide a comprehensive assessment of the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan area airspace redesign, including its cost, schedule, estimate reliability, environmental impact, and lessons learned for improvement. This is particularly important since GAO provides an independent cost-benefit analysis of this plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, when I heard that the President vetoed this bill today, I asked to speak. 
   After about three-and-a-half decades in the U.S. military, I owe both Republicans and Democrats a lot. About 2, 2 1/2 years, little over 2 years ago, my daughter, 4 years old, was struck with a malignant brain tumor. I'd never had a personal challenge in my entire life, having only gotten married 9 years ago. I'd had a lot of professional ones, but after three brain operations, chemotherapy and radiation, she's here today. I thank you all for that because I had the best health care plan in America. 
   We took a pathology slice at Johns Hopkins, Mass General's Hospital. We took it everywhere. We took it to the ends of the Earth, and you gave me that health care plan. 
   But I will never forget living in Children's Hospital oncology ward down the street, and there was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy the day my daughter started chemotherapy after her brain operations, and for 6 hours my wife and I could not help but overhear, because you all have been in those hospital rooms, social workers come and go to talk to the parents of the young 2 1/2 -year-old boy from Washington, DC, who had been diagnosed with acute leukemia that morning, to see whether that young boy could stay and have the same opportunity my daughter had because of you. 
   So this is the reason I got into the race for Congress a little less than 2 years ago. I owed you. I owed this Nation. You gave me an opportunity to have my daughter be here today. I didn't get in for Iraq. I got in for this bill. While it may not be perfect, neither was TRICARE, and I would just ask everyone to truly think about the opportunity to give our children, every child, this young boy, the same opportunity you gave me and my daughter.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill for two goods that are within it. The first has to do with our servicemembers, those that have become disabled because of their service. This bill, for the first time, gives priority, even if it's just one company that is veteran-owned and has the service-disabled owning that company, even if there are other competitors. I think this is extremely important, particularly in this time of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.     
   I say that because in World War II, on average, our soldiers had 182 days of combat. In between horrific battles of Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima or the Battle of the Bulge, there was dwell time in which our servicemembers had time to rest before the next onslaught. 
   In the war in Iraq, our servicemembers go outside the wire every day into combat for 15 months. We are seeing a higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder coming back than we have seen in any war. Some say over 30 percent. That will feed into our society. 
   So that this bill addresses the fact that our society owes something to those who wear the cloth of this Nation, particularly in such a challenging war, I speak up in support of it. 
   The second is women business owners. The fact that the goal has been for years that 5 percent of all Federal contracts will go to women business owners, we have only met the goal of 3.4 percent. I believe this bill goes a large step towards helping those, particularly the economically disenfranchised, to be able to have industries that are underrepresented, to now have the competition remain with women business owners. And if they are substantially underrepresented, it can then open up to those women business owners who are not economically disadvantaged. So I speak up in support of this bill both for veterans and for women.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, H.R. 1. 
   If 9/11 taught us anything, it is that the leadership we most need in this Nation today is not a leadership to lead us out of a crisis, but rather a leadership that prevents such crises from ever happening. 
   Today is about offering such leadership. As a Nation, we have been fortunate to have wars away from our shore, ``over there.'' But after 9/11, we saw that we now face a war here at home. And 2 1/2 years ago a bipartisan commission provided 41 recommendations to prevent another attack on U.S. home soil. 
   Few argue that the commission's recommendations are wrong. But so far their implementation generally rates Fs, Ds and incompletes. And so this legislation ensures that we will win at home by having a homeland defense that says to our adversaries, Today is not your day. 
   I had the honor while serving in the military of leading our youth in harm's way overseas. But 5 days ago, I became responsible for a new set of citizens, the constituents of my district. When I think about how to serve them best, and to turn their hopes into accomplishment, our foremost duty is to provide for their security this time here at home. 
   Our Nation needs the tools to be secure: training that can prevent a crisis and first responders with seamless communications among Federal, State, and local levels. 
   Today as we debate, we are reminded of what John F. Kennedy once said: ``The hour is late, but the agenda is long,'' which is why we must act now to implement these long overdue recommendations. 
   So as we look at ourselves in the national mirror and say we are better than this, we can and we must change for a more secure America. We then can look our constituents in the eyes, Mr. Speaker, knowing that we did turn their hope into accomplishment here at home. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE BILL VETO -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. I appreciate the opportunity to speak. What occurred in this defense bill by the veto of this President I honestly think is almost unprecedented. Take Vice Admiral Stockdale, the senior prisoner of war in North Vietnam. When he was asked, Did you ever think that you would return to the United States, he said, I never lost faith in the end of the story, that I would prevail, that I will win at the end and return to my home, to my home, America. 
   If there is anything I learned in the military, and as I went about the world those 31 years in the Navy, we are respected for the power of our military, respected for the power of our economy. We are admired for the power of our ideas. 
   My wife, who worked on a project for the office of Missing in Action/Prisoners of War in the office of the Secretary of Defense, she speaks Russian, and so she went to Russia to dig a bit to see about how they were going about their archives in Russia, looking for records of those that we may have lost or we are still missing, potentially, even back to World War II, Korea, the Korean War, Vietnam. The Russian general said to her, Why do you care so much in America about those you may have lost long ago? 
   Here we have men and women who wear the cloth of this Nation. They went to war for this Nation in the first Gulf War. They were tortured, close to giving the ultimate sacrifice, and they came home. Under the rule of law, which this Nation stands for above everything else, the rule of law and its ideals, they correctly won judgment against the Iraqi Government that is, as you said before, obligated for the prior Iraqi Government's actions. And the President vetoed a bill, not because it would have any harm on the reconstruction efforts of this government, but because they threatened this Government of Iraq to pull $25 billion out of our trillions of dollars of markets in the economy, $25 billion. 
   We spend close to $12 billion a month for our war in Iraq. Two months. These men and women gave something that's priceless, the opportunity that their lives might be given in support of this Nation. I wish this Congress had voted to try to override that veto. I thank you, above all else, for submitting this bill that we will have another attempt to right this wrong. 
   We are very fortunate that there are those who recognize that great portrait that sits across from the Secretary of Defense's office. And there is a young servicemember in this picture, that is kneeling in church with his young family next to him. It's very obvious he is about to go away for another 6 months, 8-month deployment, leaving home again. 
   Under it is this wonderful saying from the Book of Isaiah, where God has turned to Isaiah and says, Whom will go for us, whom shall I send? Isaiah replies, Here am I, send me. Here am I, send me. 
   How we treat those who somehow grow up in America to go and say, Here am I, send me, how we treat them in their adversities when they return home I honestly think will either continue those to say, Here am I, send me, or it may damage it. In this case it was wrong of this President, and I thank you so much for trying to prevail in the end with this bill.

   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and hope that we would override the President's veto today. This will cover 3.4 million uninsured children. The number is almost too large to comprehend. 
   I had the opportunity to live in an oncology ward several years ago with my young daughter. There was a young boy, 2 1/2 years old, with acute leukemia, who had to listen, or, rather, his parents were listening, as social workers came and went to see if he could potentially be covered, because they did not have health insurance, covered to receive the care my daughter was receiving. 
   As we enter what is possibly a recession, I see that number growing. This is something not morally right for these children. It is also a necessity for our economic betterment, to have healthy, productive individuals. I urge my colleagues all to vote to override the President's veto, for this Nation and for our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about increasing support and funding for the Child Care and  Development Block Grant and the Head Start programs. We know these two Federal programs provide critical resources to support our Nation's children, educators and working families. 
   At a time when almost 12 million children under age 5 are currently in child care, the resources for their care and early education continue to be stretched after 7 straight years of nearly flat funding. The stagnant support for these programs has caused thousands of children to lose child care assistance, and fewer children today attend Head Start programs than 6 years ago. 
   The Child Care and Development Block Grant and Head Start are proven programs that lead to increased cognitive and social development. The programs greatly improve the ability of children to succeed in school. Increased funding will also promote greater employment among parents through less time missed from work, higher incomes, and reduced rates of turnover. 
   In my State of Pennsylvania, over 522,000 children under age 6 need care because the parents are hard at work trying to provide their children with opportunities for success. That is why I support increased funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Head Start and Early Start programs. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member. I very much appreciate your support on this bill, and I rise to speak highly on it and thank, in particular, my colleague Mr. John Hall who is also an original cosponsor. 
   I believe this bill has a lot to do with enhancing global competitiveness of American small businesses. In fact, in May I held an economic summit in my district in partnership with the U.S. Export Assistance Center in Philadelphia. The day's program aimed to provide business owners with information about the resources and services provided by the local, State and Federal governments. The panel that day particularly focused on how to help local small businesses export their products to foreign markets, as well as on how firms interested in expanding their businesses overseas could obtain trade financing. 
   I was extremely encouraged by the number of small business owners interested in expanding their business into overseas markets during this summit. However, this should come as no surprise since small businesses make up 97 percent of all exporters and have contributed greatly to the growth of exports overseas. 
   There is promise in the economic impact of trade among small businesses. For example, with assistance from the Philadelphia Export Assistance Center, Nielsen-Kellerman, a small business in my district that designs and manufactures waterproof electronics for use in the rowing industry, worked with trade specialists to expand globally and since 2001 has signed nine dealer agreements in Germany and has successfully sold products in Southeast Asia, Europe, Central America and the Middle East. The firm continues to utilize the Export Assistance Center for business counseling and guidance to further expand their business overseas. 
   However, I also saw during my district's economic summit that small exporters also face numerous challenges, such as higher transaction costs, than do big business. They assume greater risk than larger exporters, and they experience burdensome customs requirements which limit their access to foreign markets, impeding small firms from maximizing their full potential to expand their enterprises. 
   This legislation not only addresses the need for a focus on assisting in overseas trading by calling for an annual trade strategy to increase exports but also, Mr. Speaker, enhancing the level of export assistance by increasing access to capital and establishing programs for trade adjustment assistance to help small firms adjust to ever-changing global economic conditions and demands. 
   I believe the SBA Trade Act is comprehensive legislation that is critical to the economic security of our Nation and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I have served this Nation in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The first was a just war; the second was a tragic misadventure. 
   After 31 years of military service, I ran for this office. I have never deviated from believing that a date certain to redeploy from Iraq is the only strategy which can change the incentives for the Iraqis, the Iranians and Syria, to change their behavior and to work for a non-failed state in Iraq. But I have run the Navy $67-billion-a-year warfare program. And I understand that money is only so fungible, and we will run out. 
   There is a greater good than me, than my office, than my caucus, than this Congress, and that is those that still wear the cloth of this Nation in Iraq that we Americans sent to fight for us. 
   I cannot vote to place their security between us and someone we hope might blink, because I do believe, however, after this, that I have great faith that there are those Americans on both  sides of the aisle that will work towards ending this open-ended commitment for their security and America's.

   I grew up in the military, and I bring this point up, from the Vietnam days until last year, and we were used to having investigations, outside investigations, whether with Milai or whether it was recently the USS Cole.  
   But during that entire period of time, 30-plus years, I learned that the best leadership is leadership by example; that type of leadership where others want to emulate your standards. 
   My question, therefore, is, how can this Congress look across the Potomac River at the Pentagon, to those men and women who have served 30 to 40 years in the cloth of this Nation and say, you cannot work for any company, including General Motors, if they have more than $50 million of contracts, and then not do the same to ourselves where Congressmen can walk out this door today and work for a lobbying firm, proscribed from certain activities, but work and get compensation. 
   If not us, why them? Why them, if not us?

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Speaker, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks against the United States, I was sent on the ground for a short period of time to Afghanistan. As a Navy admiral, I saw what needed to be accomplished. Eighteen months later, I returned on the ground and saw what had not been done because we tragically changed the focus of our attention and our resources to Iraq. 
   Now, Afghanistan has become once again prey to terrorists and the Taliban have moved back into the southern ungoverned regions and the provinces. 
   Because of this failure to have our legal or political or security structures there that we were trying to support be established, we were unable to have economic activity, the education take root so that we would be able to harness the efforts to have livelihoods established and an infrastructure in place, to overcome what General Eikenberry, our U.S. commander who was the NATO commander earlier last year said, ``Where the road ends, the Taliban begin.'' 
   Secretary of Defense Gates has recently said that we will place 3,000 troops into Afghanistan because of the possible spring offensive of the Taliban. That is too little and way too late. 
   We have to be able to bring the infrastructure into those ungoverned regions so the Taliban once again cannot provide a safe haven for al Qaeda, that is presently in a safe haven because of this tragic misadventure in Iraq, within Pakistan. 
   But more to my point today, I do not understand the criticism of a very good Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, that the United States wants to point at NATO and say you have not met your commitment in Afghanistan when, in fact, potentially a little known fact is that the United States itself has not met its own requirement for trainers and mentors of the Afghanistan National Army and the Afghanistan National Police. In fact, we are 63 percent short of our goal. That's 2,400 troops. 
   It all began in Afghanistan. And if we are to look back there 2 years from now and another tragedy would have been planned by the al Qaeda in another safe haven, whether Pakistan or Afghanistan, how can we say, as a senior commander said, ``In Iraq we do what we must; in Afghanistan we do what we can?'' 
   The right strategic template is as Winston Churchill said, ``Sometimes it's not enough to do your best; sometimes you have to do what is required.'' 
   It is required to ensure that the education, the economic activity, the wells, the reconstruction can be accomplished, but you can only do that in a secure enough environment. That, again, is one of the tragedies of this misadventure of Iraq.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, this August and September students will be returning back to their colleges and universities. It's a great time. And yet we're reminded by the comments on either side of the aisle that they're not going to be immune from the unique challenges that face us in the realities of our own homes elsewhere in the cities and suburbs of America. The tragic shootings at Virginia Tech, which ended in the death of 32 people, or the shootings at Northern Illinois University, where 24 people were shot and six died, emphasizes the importance of this issue of campus safety. 
   As my colleague mentioned, the Department of Education noted that between 2004 and 2006 there were not only 8,000 forcible sex offenses, 9,000 aggravated assaults, 3,000 cases of arson, but also 37 homicides on the colleges and universities of what we like to think are our ivory towers. 
   We also know that between one-fifth and one-fourth of female students will become the victim of a completed or an attempted rape--usually by someone they know--during their undergraduate careers, and yet less than 5 percent of the cases are ever reported. 
   The National Advisory Council on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism notes that each year there are over 1,700 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 who will die from unintentional alcohol-related injuries, including motor vehicle accidents. That's why this resolution is so important, originally introduced by a colleague on the other side of this aisle in 2005, and the idea of a national nonprofit organization in my district, Security on Campus--King of Prussia, Pennsylvania is their home base--founded by the parents of which you noted, my colleague, by the parents of a 19-year-old college freshman, Jeanne Clery, who was raped and killed in her bed in college. 
   In 2007, 150 colleges came together from 42 States and the city of Washington, D.C. to participate in programs on campus security; this was up from 50 the year before. This year, we expect over 350 colleges to come together. This is not the step, but it is a step towards eliminating an issue that we all have cared about, that of our children and their security, particularly when they are there to have education security. 
   I urge all my colleagues to show their concern for the safety of the more than 15 million students we have in this great Nation of ours. And I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

   It is not just about ``getting out of Iraq.'' It should be about redeploying out of Iraq so that we can better ensure U.S. security elsewhere, as we leave Iraq with relative stability. 
   The resolution we will soon vote on is today's stalking horse, with merit, but with less of a strategic plan for a successful end than the last Iraqi resolution, despite times that are now more dire in Iraq and, therefore, also for us. We need both the Republicans and a new strategy so that we can successfully end this conflict for our betterment. I see the key as President Bush's statement that our commitment is not open-ended. We, therefore, now need to define how to end it, together.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of this bill because it would change our strategy in Iraq towards the successful outcome, while ensuring that America will be more secure. It  does so by providing, most importantly, a date certain by which we will not be in Iraq, approximately 9 months from its enactment, that serves as the sole remaining leverage we have to change the structure of incentives in that country and in the region toward stability. 
   Presently, the Iraqi ministries are personal fiefdoms where the leaders pursue their personal ambitions while we provide them political and military cover in what is now principally a civil war. 
   Political reconciliation. How? When their very top Shia and Kurdish leaders recently told Senator Hagel and me that the re-Baathification law is only appeasement to the Sunnis. But our U.S. leaders in Iraq say it is critical to success and stabilization. 
   A date certain finally forces the Iraqis to make the difficult political compromises they are presently avoiding; more importantly, it changes the incentives and therefore the behavior of Iran and Syria from being involved destructively in this war because we are bleeding towards working for stability. 
   As our top political leader in Iraq said, Iran does not want a failed state if we depart.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, for nearly a century, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, has been fighting for the civil rights and dignity of people of color. As a result of their efforts, our great Nation today can boast of a society more diverse, productive, prosperous and hopeful than any in history. 
   However, today's hope is a far cry from the violent segregation and discrimination that inspired Mary White Ovington, William English Walling and Dr. Henry Moskowitz to meet in a small room of a New York City apartment and commit the fledgling NAACP to the most important social movement in our national history. Today, the spirit of those brave and patriotic founders lives on in its leaders, like Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn, president of the Media, Pennsylvania NAACP chapter in my home district. I rise today to congratulate Dr. Duval-Flynn for her vision, intelligence and dedication. She leads a chapter of the NAACP born of a violent act in the early 1920s and committed to making Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a 21st century community where people of all colors and creeds live together as neighbors, friends and first-class citizens. 
   In my first year representing the Seventh District of Pennsylvania, the NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, featured an article titled ``Woman Warriors, Female Combatants Sacrifice Lives for Country.'' That article gave me cause to consider all of the extraordinary women and men of color I had the privilege of serving with during my 30 years in our Armed Forces. For that privilege and honor, I owe, and our Nation owes, a personal debt of gratitude to Dr. Duval-Flynn, Mary White Ovington and countless other members and leaders of the NAACP. 
   As W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in his first editorial page of The Crisis in 1910, that voice of the NAACP ``will stand for the rights of men, irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American democracy, and for the reasonable but earnest and persistent attempt to gain these rights and realize these ideals.'' No truer words can be spoken than on this birthday of the NAACP. I am proud, therefore, to know and work with this one remarkable leader, Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn, in my district as with many others in my district and with the NAACP who gave us leaders such as she. 
   Founded on February 12, 1909, the NAACP is the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. It has worked successfully with allies of all races who believe in, and stand for, the principles of civil rights on which the organization was founded. 
   The NAACP's legacy includes historic events as well as distinguished leaders, as I mentioned, W.E.B. Du Bois, but other civil rights leaders such as Rosa Parks and Medgar Evers and Thurgood Marshall, who served as special counsel for the NAACP when he argued the historic U.S. Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark victory for equality that outlawed segregation in our schools. Our obligation to African Americans and all Americans is to honor the accomplishments of the past by acting in a substantive manner to improve their lives in the future. 
   Thank you, NAACP; thank you, Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn; and thank you for the time this morning, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. Chairman, as someone who wore the cloth of this Nation for 31 years, few things are as important to me as our obligation to support those who fought for our country. Our men and women in uniform serve selflessly on our behalf, and it is our foremost duty in Congress to do everything in our power to ensure that they have the care and the treatment they deserve, as they are, and they will remain, our most important recruiters in our volunteer Armed Forces of the future.

   With that in mind, recent reports about the conditions at Walter Reed were quite sobering to who we believe we are. I am as, if I am not more, responsible as anyone. I should have known better and looked more because of my 31 years of service. 
   But the Armed Services Committee has now looked closely at this issue and taken a significant step forward in reporting H.R. 1538 to the House. This is a bill that will address concerns regarding the adequacy of the treatment received by our servicemembers returning home from Iraq. 
   While we are all familiar with the images of soldiers who have returned home maimed as a result of an IED, it is another range of medical challenges that are increasingly being seen as a signature disability of the war in Iraq, mental health disorders and the invisible psychological trauma of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   According to a Pentagon study released last year, 35 percent of Iraqi war veterans received mental health care during the first year at home. Twelve percent were diagnosed with a mental health ailment. 
   Left untreated, the more recognizable symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares or flashbacks, can ultimately lead to other problems, including drug and alcohol abuse. 
   At a time when science has shown that mental health and physical health are inseparable, we cannot overlook the integral role that mental health care plays in the proper medical care of our servicemembers and veterans. 
   This past Sunday, I attended an event hosted by the Military Order of the Purple Heart for the VA Medical Center in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, and spoke to several of those who work with and treat veterans with PTSD. They emphasized to me their concerns about the level of resources, attention, and the scope of care available to those who need mental health services. 
   This is an issue we cannot simply ignore because the challenges of mental illness are interwoven with the other challenges that we are confronted with in every corner of our society. And that is why I was honored that Representative Kennedy held with me a forum in my district on mental health and substance abuse last month, where,  among other things, Congressman Kennedy spoke of the importance of properly addressing the needs of veterans and servicemembers. 
   As a Nation, we will never be fully healthy, never fully productive, until we eliminate all barriers to good mental health care for all our citizens, and especially those who have put themselves in harm's way to serve our country. 
   This amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood that personnel in combat will develop post-traumatic stress disorder or other stress-related psychopathologies, what we might call psychological Kevlar. 
   Prevention, how nice. No, how necessary. It is what we do in the military. Successful generals win. Then they go to war. 
   This is what we must do to ensure that our soldiers are properly prepared, not just physically with the right Kevlar but, also, thanks to the knowledge developed through the peer-reviewed research called for in this amendment, with the proper psychological Kevlar. We must treat both physical and mental care of our troops the same. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF IRAQ ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF AMERICA IS NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Shortly, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come before the House and the Senate to provide an update on the military and the political situation in Iraq. That is my grave concern, that once again we will have placed a man who is responsible for the security, the military security only, of Iraq, in the position, in the singular position, of determining the national security policy of the United States and the public's perception of it, when what is needed, what is direly needed, is a comprehensive assessment of the national security of America and the impact of the strategy we have in Iraq upon it. So in fact it is the questions that General Petraeus cannot or should not answer that are the most important ones. 
   For example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be asked directly, what is the impact of Iraq upon the military's readiness to deploy and meet the required timelines of its various war plans, when in fact today it cannot deploy its forces, its army, in order to protect the 28,000 men and women who wear the cloth of our Nation in South Korea from an attack on the timelines required by North Korea against the South? 
   And while before Iraq we actually trained on multiple areas of warfare, for the past 3 years your army has only been training in counterinsurgency. The Joint Chiefs of Staff must address the impact of 3 years of its army training only in one warfare area and being unable to meet any timeline of any war plan by its army in America's arsenal of war plans. 
   Then, in the long term, the impact of 42 percent of our men and women who we are recruiting today being less capable than ever of being able to operate  and maintain the systems of our weaponry in the future as they can in the past 3 years. 
   Second, it is not the general or the ambassador who should come here to speak about Iraq's security, but rather our intelligence agencies that must address the question about whether the Iraq strategy has improved our overall efforts in the global war on terror, with Afghanistan once again prey to terrorists, and the Taliban having gone back into the ungoverned regions to protect them, and General Hayden, head of the CIA, having said that al Qaeda now has a safe haven in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. What is the impact of a strategy in that unstable region that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has described as ``in Iraq what we do what we must, but in Afghanistan, we do what we can.'' 
   Officials from the State Department likewise must address the impact upon our allies of this war in Iraq and our relationships with them and the efforts to achieve other diplomatic goals, remembering that when we went into Bosnia, 50 percent of the coalition troops were non-U.S., and when we went into Iraq 5 years ago, less than 7 percent of the troops that entered that country were non-U.S. 
   And then the Treasury, how can they explain the impact of what all economists agree are now almost $2 trillion to $3 trillion as the cost of this war in Iraq? When Iraq is awash in oil revenues, why are we using taxpayers' dollars? 
   Therefore, the questions that General Petraeus can and should not answer comes down to, he should not be the one to tell us how long and at what cost before we change our strategy. It is only if Congress changes the forum for this general to come before us to say and hold up a national mirror, this is the impact of Iraq upon our overall national security strategy, and if it is not working and if it is negatively impacting it, we must therefore change the strategy. 
   I believe it is against the spirit, as a man who has served in the military 31 years until I entered Congress, to have a military man placed in the position to determine singularly, when he is only responsible for the security of Iraq, to then determine without everyone else there the right strategy and course for America's national security. 
   We must have that debate. Is the strategy working? Is it harming our overall national security? If it is, change the strategy.

   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I rise in support of it because this is the sole reason I ran for Congress. I owe this Congress. I owe this Nation for what it did for me. A lot of people think because I spent 31 years in the military that I got in because of Iraq. I did not. It was this bill. 
   In my last year in the military, my 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, my sole daughter. She was given 3 to 9 months to live, and my entitlement from the Federal Government gave her an opportunity to be here today. 
   But during that period of time, there was a young boy, Lance, 2 1/2 years old, who was, as she began her chemotherapy, my daughter's roommate. And that first day he was there, we listened as the parents of that child sat with social workers for 6 hours who came and went to see if that young boy would be given the same opportunity, the same entitlement as an American citizen, my daughter, had. It is for Lance that I got in this race. 
   I owe you because my daughter is here today because of the medicine that you voted for as a military member. I would like to see every young child in America have that one opportunity my daughter did, to have the opportunity to be a productive, healthy child and contribute to this Nation. 
   So thank you for the opportunity to speak today and thank you, both sides, for giving me the chance for my daughter and, hopefully, Lance in the future to be all they can be. I appreciate it.

A young 2 1/2 -year-old boy, where we listened and could not help in that small room hear social workers come and go for 6 hours as they tried to determine whether that young boy, struck with acute leukemia, whose parents did not have health care, would have the same opportunity as you gave my daughter; that this Nation gave them the time for not just quality of life but for life.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (SBA ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished chairwoman from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support a piece of legislation to enhance two critical Small Business Administration entrepreneurial development programs, the Small Business Development Centers and the Service Corps for Retired Executives. 
   Serving as the Representative in a district that has been historically driven economically by vibrant local small businesses, I greatly appreciate and support the entrepreneurial development assistance that the SBA provides. 
   We know that entrepreneurial development programs work. Businesses who receive SBA entrepreneurial assistance are twice as likely to succeed. And for every Federal dollar spent on entrepreneurial development, $7 are generated in increased tax revenue. 
   But in the past 3 years, due to changes in our ever-changing globalizing economy, my district has lost 607 small businesses and one out of five manufacturing establishments. This is a trend that I am committed to reversing through fostering entrepreneurial development and creating the right set of conditions to help businesses flourish, stay and be attracted to my district, and I believe that supporting effective small business entrepreneurial development programs is a key part of that strategy. 
   In 1980, Congress established the SBDC program to foster economic development by providing management, technical and research assistance to current and prospective small businesses. As you know, SBDCs provide services which include assisting small businesses with financial, marketing, production, organizational, engineering and technical problems and feasibility studies. 
   SBDCs serve Americans with a desire to start their own venture but who lack the technical expertise associated with starting and running a successful business, and in the past decades, SBDCs have provided assistance to millions of entrepreneurs across America. 
   The SBDC program also represents the effective and efficient use of allocated Federal moneys through public/private collaboration. To that end, SBDCs are funded by matching moneys provided by State legislatures, foundations, State and local chambers of commerce, public and private universities, vocational and technical schools and community colleges. In fact, sponsors' contributions have been increasingly exceeding the minimum 50 percent matching share, signifying greater participation among such groups and institutions. 
   This is why I feel especially fortunate to have several Small Business Development Sub-Centers located at local universities, such as Widener University and the University of Pennsylvania, which provide critical business resources and technical assistance to small businesses in and around my district. 
   I would like to stress that the core SBDC program has been extremely effective, but there are certain operational improvements that can be implemented to increase the flexibility of SBDCs. 
   To that end, changes proposed in this legislation will ensure the quality of grant recipients to host SBDCs; help SBDCs maintain their autonomy from undue SBA interference; protect the confidentiality of SBDC clients; ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent as efficiently as possible by not using SBDC funds except for the sole purpose of business development; and allowing exemptions to the current cap on non-matching portability grants in the event of federally designated natural or human caused disasters.     
   In addition to these operational changes, it is important to strengthen the SBDC core program, which successfully navigates entrepreneurs in managing their business, by establishing specific grant programs that will allow SBDCs to tailor their services. 
   For instance, the Capital Access Initiative would establish grants to assist entrepreneurs in processing loan applications and obtaining private equity. An Innovation and Competitiveness Initiative would establish grants to allow SBDCs to become technology centers, to help market technologies and advanced projects to manufacturers. A disaster recovery program would establish grants to allow SBDCs to assist and coordinate the Federal response for small business disaster victims. 
   The older entrepreneurial assistance program will target older Americans  interested in transitioning to become business owners, while the Small Business Sustainability Initiative will promote the development and implementation of energy-efficient and clean energy improvements and technology. And an Affordable Health Care Initiative will help small business owners provide affordable health care insurance options to their employees, as the chairwoman mentioned. 
   As I also spoke about, a second program which this legislation will address is SCORE, which provides entrepreneurs with free counseling assistance by former executives. SCORE provides a valuable service to small businesses, and I believe it will be even stronger with a provision to actively recruit volunteer mentors who will then provide a greater reflection of the social and economic diversity of those who will utilize SBA services, such as women and underrepresented minorities. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this important bill, which will greatly enhance the business development resources available to America's small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (SBA WOMEN'S BUSINESS PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Speaker, as a husband, a father of a young daughter, the proud brother to 6 sisters, and having served alongside dedicated women in the military, I have seen first-hand the role that women play in economically strengthening American society. And this is why I rise today to support H.R. 2397, the SBA Women's Business Programs Act of 2007. 
   Despite their significant contributions, women who work full time, year round, still only make 77 cents for every dollar made by their male counterparts, and women business owners, particularly those from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, face significant challenges resulting from inadequate community resources. Such resources include lack of access to capital, training resources, and networks of assistance. 
   Today, women-owned firms are one of the fastest growing, successful small business sectors. The number of women-owned firms has increased at nearly double the rate of all firms, and those with socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds have grown at twice the rate of their counterparts and 6 times the rate of all U.S. firms. As the number of women entrepreneurs grows, particularly those from underserved communities, I believe it is critical that women have adequate and appropriate resources to prepare them for success in the marketplace. To that end, H.R. 2397 proposes to expand the agency's commitment to the Women's Business Centers (WBCs). 
   WBCs provide in-depth, substantive, and outcome-oriented counseling, training and mentoring, resulting in substantial economic impact as measured by successful business start-ups, job creation and retention, and increased company revenues. They also provide financial, management, and marketing assistance to women small business owners. 
   H.R. 2397 supports the growth of women small business owners by expanding entrepreneurial development assistance, particularly in low-income areas. The legislation dedicates funding to the opening of new WBCs in underserved areas, while implementing new benchmarks to ensure centers that continually receive funds are meeting performance requirements. These metrics, which include information on clients served and fundraising plans, will help to preserve resources for centers that have demonstrated success helping women entrepreneurs while promoting the expansion of assistance centers into underserved areas. 
   H.R. 2397 is important legislation which promotes economic security for America's women, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESTAK. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of this amendment to increase the number of Federal contracts granted to small businesses by addressing a practice known as contract bundling, which has allowed Federal agencies to award mega-contracts, contracts so large they cannot possibly be performed by a small business. This amendment will ensure that more large contracts will be reviewed as to their appropriateness to be bundled and potentially broken into smaller pieces more suitable for small business. 
   The goal: enhancing taxpayer savings by a more efficient and effective use of our resources by helping the Federal Government meet its statutory goal of small business contracts, which it presently does not. 
   Presently, the bill's current definition would prevent too many large contracts to be exempted from a bundling analysis as to their appropriateness for access to small business. This amendment will help reduce these exemptions by eliminating the monetary threshold for nonconstruction Federal contracts to be reviewed. Additionally, bundled contracts that ``substantially transform a good or service,'' referring to contracts that use a new, innovative contract process, are currently exempted from bundling analysis. 
   This amendment would mandate that in such cases measurable, substantial benefits must be demonstrated to the government in terms of quality, performance or price. If that cannot be shown, a bundling analysis must be completed. 
   This amendment, by also explicitly requiring that a bundling analysis be performed for new work and construction contracts, as opposed to just previously performed work, will also close the loophole that has been used by agencies to avoid unbundling contracts. 
   Let me give you an example of why addressing contract bundling is important to not just small businesses but also to efficient and effective use of our Nation's resources, particularly in new or transformational requirements that our Federal agencies increasingly contract for. 
   Gestalt, a small business located in my district, recently competed in an Army contract, which they competed for against a very large defense corporation, to fix the Defense Readiness Reporting System. 
   Right now, we have in the military a fairly arcane system, where obtaining detailed, up-to-date, instantaneous information on the readiness of our military and its units is challenging at best. What was required was a much more dynamic system that could present in real-time the readiness of our forces, in this case, the 5,000-plus Army units we have, which can greatly impact a commander's decision in what has become a fast-paced, battle space environment where speed of decision is so highly valued. 
   The large defense corporation said it would take 3 years to complete the project, while the smaller firm then did it in only 7 months. From my time as a vice admiral responsible for executing the Navy's annual $67 billion worth of warfare requirements and programs, I know there is a tendency, because of ease of execution, to want to go to a large corporation and have them subcontract their bundled program to other vendors. 
   The result, unfortunately, is particularly worrisome at a moment when we need to transform not just our military but many of our other federally funded efforts. The speed and agility that more entrepreneurial small businesses often can provide in a fast-paced, globalized and continuously changing world are key to rapidly meeting new, evolving requirements of our Nation, particularly in such transformational areas as software and information technology. 
   It is, therefore, inefficient and ineffective to our competitive edge to deny entrepreneurial small businesses direct access to the real requirements of the customer, the U.S. government, and it is also harmful to our interests to have large corporations bundle certain contracts so that only derived requirements are available to the subcontractors, these derived requirements having to be interpreted by sub-vendors or be interpreted to them by the large corporation, a middleman, adding complexity, time and misinterpretation, rather than streamlining, to the Federal contracting process. 
   In short, undue bundling of contracts cost the taxpayers money. More, this inefficiency leads to less effectiveness. By unbundling work requirements, this amendment will create new opportunities for small firms, expanding the government's access to more qualified contractors. Increased competition because of more fair access will lead to lower prices and to the improvement of the quality of goods and services procured by the Federal Government. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this critical amendment, not only for the Nation's entrepreneurial small businesses but for a more efficient and effective application of our Nation's resources 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today our country faces significant labor shortages in occupations that are vital to our educational, health and, therefore, our national security. 
   I thank Chairman Miller and ranking member, Mr. McKeon, for their efforts to expand the professional areas of recognition where there is a national need which is critically important as we attempt to ensure an adequate workforce for services that are vital to all Americans. 
   In this vein, I believe the list of health occupations for which national need exists must also include physical therapists. Recent reports have shown that our country does not have an adequate number of physical therapists to meet our growing needs. 
   According to the American Hospital Association, therapists represent the occupation for which the greatest percentage of vacancies exist in our hospitals across our Nation, at an 11.4 percent vacancy rate. This is at a time when the demand for physical therapist employment is projected to grow 27 percent within 8 years, even as 58 percent of our hospitals are reporting in 2006 that therapist recruitment was more difficult than the year before. I, therefore, believe it is imperative we add physical therapists in the area of national need to ensure the Secretary of Education has direction to provide loan repayment to physical therapists. 
   Compounding this challenge of our national need for physical therapists exceeding our supply are already 31,000 servicemen and -women who have returned home from the war in Afghanistan and Iraq to recover from wounds sustained in the service of their country. 
   Physical therapists will, therefore, continue to play an integral role in rehabilitating our Nation's veterans as they cope with injuries from the battlefield. To ensure the proper care and recovery of those who have sacrificed their well-being to protect us, we must address our shortage of physical therapists. 
   This amendment to include physical therapists as individuals in an occupation of national need, supported by the American Physical Therapy Association, is a necessary and practical measure to attract students to this profession. The loan repayment incentive of up to $10,000 for students who obtain a graduate degree in physical therapy which results from designating physical therapy as an area of national need will encourage more students to enter the profession and help alleviate these growing vacancies. 
   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that highlights this issue of utmost importance for everyone, but also including the veterans who are returning from our wars overseas. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESTAK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, Congress has worked hard on legislation to improve the access, affordability, and transparency of our higher education system. Reforms that improve transparency in college costs and the student loan industry are a priority of this legislation, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member and their staffs for their hard work on these important efforts. 
   However, I also believe we need to call attention to the barriers and the lack of transparency among colleges, specifically regarding the transfer of academic credit between postsecondary institutions. Today, students take increasingly complex pathways to achieving their postsecondary degree. Over 40 percent of students attending a college or university transfer at least once before they complete their undergraduate degree. However, despite increases in student mobility, institutions have not adjusted with substantive changes in the manner in which they oversee and articulate the transfer of college student academic credit. 
   There are significant consequences for failing to provide students with a better understanding of how, and which of, their courses qualify for credit in other postsecondary institutions. A student's inability to transfer credit may result in longer enrollment, more tuition payments, and additional Federal financial aid. In fact, it is estimated that transfer students incur costs of well over $5 billion per year. National data indicates that, on average, transfer graduates take about 10 more credits and 3 more months to complete their baccalaureate degree than nontransfer graduates. And some transfer students have even been forced to spend up to an additional year in an institution to obtain a degree because their earned academic credits do not transfer. These students expend money taking courses at one institution that will not result in academic credit at another. One of the most problematic consequences of our current system is the loss of students who are or may drop out of college due to the costs and complications of transferring their academic course credit between schools. It is clear that the credit transfer process, to the extent that it delays students' progress, can affect the affordability of postsecondary education, the time it takes students to graduate, and the number of those who do actually graduate. 
   I believe it is time for institutions to develop new strategies to improve gaps in credit transfer agreements and facilitate transparency of credit equivalencies between institutions. 
   My amendment encourages States and public institutions of higher education to develop management systems for course equivalency, transfer of credit, and articulation. The cost of transferring between institutions demand the utilization of new techniques to reduce the financial impact and obstacles facing students. I believe that this amendment provides an approach and a necessary alternative for institutions to consider when developing credit transfer agreements, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESTAK. I can be and am disappointed in this bill we will vote on today, intended to reduce U.S. troops in Iraq. It aims to begin the reduction, but leaves an unspecified limited presence of troops in Iraq by a deadline of April 1, 2008, a level of troops and their missions to be determined by President Bush. 
   It does no harm, but how much good? One might say it is a step in the right direction even with such significant limitations, but I have concern. Congress is, as it should be, close to ending this tragic misadventure; however, ending this war is necessary but insufficient. How we end it and by what means is of even greater importance for our troops' safety and our own security. A Congress intent upon mandating such a new security policy through force of law owes a careful explanation to the country why and how it is to be done, including dealing with what would occur in the aftermath. We don't do that here. 
   I will vote for this bill for it does no harm, perhaps some good. But I will do so reluctantly, for it does little to define the how and why within a strategic approach of a date within a year that we can redeploy from Iraq and leave behind the possibility of an unfailed Iraqi state. We owe such an explanation since it is us by force of law that will end this tragic misadventure.
