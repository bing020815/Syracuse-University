<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are here today because the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 includes a trigger. That trigger is exercised when general fund revenues, as opposed to trust fund revenues, premiums and payroll taxes, exceed 45 percent of the Medicare program. 
   Once the Medicare trustees determine in two back-to-back reports that the 45 percent threshold will be crossed within 7 years, the administration must submit legislation ``eliminating excess general revenue Medicare funding.'' 
   The trustees submitted their first such report last year, projecting that general revenues would fund 45.07 percent of Medicare in 2013, the last year of the 7-year window. This year the trustees issued a similar warning, and the administration sent Congress a bill to keep general revenues below 45 percent through 2013. According to CBO's analysis, the administration's bill will hold general revenues below 45 percent until 2014 by charging higher premiums to Medicare beneficiaries who make above a certain income level. 
   Instead of enacting the administration's proposals, the House and Senate enacted last week into law the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 over the President's veto. CBO calculates that this new law will keep general revenues below the 45 percent threshold through 2014, just as the administration's bill would have. So substantively and for all practical purposes, we have met the trigger's financial requirements, and we have made this issue moot for the rest of this Congress. 
   I support the rule before us which would turn off the Medicare trigger for the remainder of this Congress. I find, as the chairman of the Budget Committee, the legislation we have just enacted ``eliminates excess general revenue Medicare spending'' and complies with the Medicare law's financial test. Consequently, there is no need or reason to exercise the trigger.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal stimulus package. 
   We face mounting evidence that the economy is faltering and in sectors like housing, clearly losing ground, and many Americans are hurting as a result. Unemployment has spiked from 4.7 to 5.0 percent in one month; retail sales actually fell in December by 0.4 percent from the prior month, and last week the Federal Reserve made an emergency cut of 75 basis points in the Fed funds rate, the largest such reduction in 25 years. Across the country, Americans are feeling the effects of a slump in our economy, and if we want to avert or mitigate the effects of a recession, we need to act, and act now. 
   In hearings and discussions over the last 2 months, the consensus has emerged that fiscal stimulus is needed to complement monetary policy, and it needs to meet three criteria: it needs to be timely, targeted, and temporary. Timely means taking effect quickly to boost the economy; targeted means getting dollars into the hands of households more likely to spend it quickly; temporary means that it has only a short-term impact on the Federal budget so that it does not add to our long-term fiscal deficits. The package before us meets all these criteria. 
   There is general agreement that the fiscal stimulus needs to be roughly 1 percent of GDP. Two-thirds of this package goes to individuals and amounts to approximately $100 billion; one-third goes to business and amounts to about $50 billion to begin with, but since this stimulus comes in the form of accelerated depreciation, most of it will be recaptured over the life of the depreciable asset. If the two-thirds allocated to individual taxpayers is spent and helps avert or mitigate a recession, then it too may be recaptured to some extent, because a full-fledged recession could add $150 to $300 billion to the budget's bottom line, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   This package is a practical step to boost the economy, to bolster confidence, and to give a hand-up to millions of hard-working Americans. As with any compromise, no one got everything that he or she wanted in this package--but it is critical to get a bill enacted  quickly in order to help the economy and our people without undue delay. I could name several features I would like to add or modify, and there may be other aspects that we may need to address in later legislation, such as an extension of unemployment insurance. If the Senate adds that, and the administration concedes, I will gladly vote for it. But moving quickly to boost our economy and fend off a recession matters most. 
   I think the bill coming to the floor today is likely to be the best agreement we can strike with the Bush administration if we want stimulus to come quickly and be effective. The package clearly meets our criteria of being timely, targeted, and having only a temporary cost to the budget. 
   I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. Madam Speaker, I want to commend President Bush, Speaker Pelosi, and Ranking Member Boehner for their bipartisan leadership in compromising on this economic stimulus package, and in their generosity and sense of fairness in making these economic relief measures extensive to the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico. I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague and friend, Congressman Jos&#233; Serrano. His leadership and sense of fairness was key in our inclusion in the economic stimulus package. 
   Puerto Rico is in dire need of this economic stimulus package. Although this measure is intended to avert a potential recession in the U.S. economy after several years of strong growth, Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession for the last 2 years. Our economy is in a ``perfect storm'' scenario with recurring fiscal imbalances caused by uncontrolled government expense, dramatic tax increases, and misguided economic development strategies of the local state administration, resulting in higher unemployment and reduced consumer confidence. 
   Residents of Puerto Rico pay the same Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes as our fellow citizens in the States. Payroll taxes are especially regressive in the case of Puerto Rico since the per capita income on the island is only one-third the national average. 
   My constituents are hurting badly, so it is imperative that the assistance that this economic stimulus package provides be channeled directly to those in need, the individual taxpayers, and not to the state government that has repeatedly mismanaged our resources. If at the end, this legislation provides for the Secretary of the Treasury to make a block payment to the territorial governments, including Puerto Rico, the Secretary must retain the capacity to guarantee our citizens that they will receive their payments in a timely fashion and for the correct amount. We are not asking for special treatment, I am only asking that our workers be treated on the same terms as their fellow citizens in the States.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and sections 204, 206, and 207 of S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues with the aggregate levels set by S. Con. Res. 21. This comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. 
   The second table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2008 with the ``section 302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act because the point of order under that section applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. 
   The third table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for each authorizing committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations made under S. Con. Res. 21 for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure.  
   The fourth table gives the current level for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 206 of S. Con. Res. 21. This list is needed to enforce section 206 of the budget resolution, which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that: (i) are not identified in the statement of managers; or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, 
   I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2007 and for the five-year period of fiscal years 2007 through 2011. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and sections 401 and 501 of H. Con. Res. 376, which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the House under H. Res. 6. This status report is current through January 1, 2007. An additional report will be filed to reflect any changes in committee jurisdictions. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues with the aggregate levels set by H. Con. Res. 376. This comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2007 because appropriations for those years have not yet been considered. 
   The second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for discretionary action by each authorizing committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations made under H. Con. Res. 376 for fiscal year 2007 and fiscal years 2007 through 2011. ``Discretionary action'' refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement section 311(b), which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311(a). 
   The third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2007 with the ``section 302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is also needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. 
   The fourth table gives the current level for 2008 of accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 401 of H. Con. Res. 376. This list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution, which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that are: (i) not identified in the statement of managers or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution. 
   The fifth table provides the current level of the nondefense reserve fund for emergencies established by section 501 of H. Con. Res. 376. The table is required by section 505 of the budget resolution, and is needed to determine whether an increase in the reserve fund, allocations and aggregates will be necessary for any pending legislation that contains emergency-designated discretionary budget authority.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. I thank the gentleman for the compliment and wish I could accept it, and I am glad to have the time to explain what is before us. 
   The budget summit in 1990 ended up with a 5-year deficit reduction plan and a kit of budget process rules known as the Budget Enforcement Act of 1991. Among these process changes was something that we have come to call the PAYGO rule, or pay-as-you-go. 
   Basically, the pay-as-you-go rule provides that any increase in entitlement benefits has to be paid for by a new revenue source, and that any cut in taxes has to be offset by equivalent cuts in entitlements or by equivalent increases elsewhere in the Tax Code. In other words, entitlement increases or tax cuts have to be deficit neutral. They cannot worsen the bottom line. This is the basic principle of PAYGO; a common-sense, truly conservative principle. 
   PAYGO was originated by Democrats, but it was embraced by the first President Bush in 1991, in the Budget Enforcement Act. It was adopted by President Clinton in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993. It was confirmed again by Clinton and by this Congress in a bipartisan way in the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. It was even endorsed by the second President Bush in his 2001 budget submission: Reinstate PAYGO. That is what the President requested. 
   But the Bush administration soon found that if we did that, it would get in the way of its huge tax cut agenda, and that was its driving force behind all the budget policy of this administration. So in 2002, even though it had worked, demonstrably worked, and brought the deficit down, in 2002, the Bush administration and this Congress, under Republican leadership, allowed the PAYGO rule to expire. 
   PAYGO had been renewed three times. From 1991 to 2001, it was the law of the budget. It worked. But it was allowed to expire. The result was a deficit that soared. President Clinton handed over to President Bush a budget that was in surplus, in surplus by $236 billion the year before President Bush took office. By 2004, without the PAYGO rule, without the strictures of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1991, the surplus was gone, wiped out, replaced by a deficit of $413 billion. That was a swing of more than $600 billion in the wrong direction. 
   In an effort to diminish these debts and to rein in the deficit, Democrats tried repeatedly over the last 6 years to reinstate the PAYGO rule. And Republicans, just as repeatedly, rebuked us at every turn. Today, with a new majority, we want a new commitment to fiscal responsibility. We want to pay as you go. We want to quit stacking debt on top of debt. 
   The statutory debt, on the watch of this administration, has increased by 60 percent, 60 percent since President Bush took office, more than $3 trillion in new debt. This is not a sustainable course. Nobody in this House would rise to support this course. So let us reverse course. Let us start today. Let us enact something that worked for 11 years, the PAYGO rule that was adopted first in 1991. 
   Today, we add two new rules to the rules of the House, section 402 and section 405 of title IV in the package before you. The original PAYGO rule was statutory. It set up a scorecard on which tax cuts and tax increases, entitlement cuts and entitlement increases were all entered. At the end of the fiscal year, the tally was taken by the Congressional Budget Office, and if there was an adverse balance, it had to be rectified. If it was not rectified and removed, then it would result in across-the-board abatement or sequestration cuts. 
   Why not just reenact the statutory rule, since that is the form that worked? I wish we could. But it is not at all clear we can pass a statutory change or reenactment of the PAYGO  rule in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed. And it is even less clear, and extremely doubtful, that the President would sign a statutory PAYGO rule if it reached his desk. 
   So what we propose today is the art of the possible. What we propose is a House rule, setting up a point of order to any PAYGO violation. We also correct here the practice of using the reconciliation process, an extraordinary process in order to do things, that would worsen the budget deficit. But I want to focus mainly on the PAYGO result. 
   The ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan, and I look forward to working with him, he is a good man who knows his stuff, and I look forward to a good relationship, but I have to take exception when he says this rule does not reduce the deficit. By itself, it may not. But it establishes in the rules of this House a commonsense, truly conservative principle that when the budget is in deficit, deep deficit, at the very least, we should avoid making it worse. We should avoid entitlement increases that are not paid for and we should avoid tax cuts that are not offset. 
   This rule is not immutable, it can be waived or modified, but it establishes a strong working presumption in favor of fiscal responsibility and it holds accountable every Member who votes otherwise. 
   Mr. Ryan claims this bill will set a double standard favoring higher spending. But in truth it is a double-edged sword. It applies to entitlement increases as well as tax cuts. So if you want to start the 110th Congress on the foot of fiscal responsibility, the right thing to do is to vote to reinstate PAYGO. Vote for this package and its fiscal responsibility provisions.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding and thank all of you for participating in this Special Order tonight. You know, we tend to think of ourselves as urbanized, even in the Southeast these days. But in South Carolina, my State, and even more so in North Carolina, agriculture is critically important as part of our total economy. In South Carolina, 46,000 full- and part-time jobs are supported by agriculture. That is 22 percent of all the jobs in our State; $15.1 billion in income is attributable to agriculture, 17 percent of the State's total income. 
   I could go on to show that even now in the 21st century, we in the Carolinas and throughout the Southeast still have a lot of agriculture, and we are critically dependent upon it. Our farmers and our people throughout the Southeast are faced with just about the worst drought I have seen in I don't know when. And it keeps getting worse and worse. I went to Marlboro County, probably one of the most agricultural counties in the 14 counties I represent. I couldn't believe what I saw. And it hasn't gotten any better since then. Soybeans that never develop. There is no pod. Cotton that is barely worth getting out of the fields. Hay, peanuts, pastures, you name it, they are all suffering. It is basically at the level of being catastrophic unless we can help and help soon. In Marlboro, back in September, the threshold for the Department of Agriculture in declaring a crop or an area a disaster area is 33 percent crop loss. Marlboro County in September, 2 months ago virtually, at least 6 weeks ago, had 67 percent of its crop already damaged. It is worse by now I am sure. I represent 14 counties, small-town counties, proud counties, but still dependent on agriculture, and 13 of those 14 counties were included recently in a disaster declaration from the Secretary of Agriculture. That is how widespread the disaster situation is. 
   Our Commission of Agriculture estimates that in South Carolina alone, the losses are going to equal $500 to $600 million. Now, most people don't know it, but most farmers today, responsible farmers, carry crop insurance underwritten and subsidized by the Federal Government. But it is not enough to cover their losses. It is partial recovery, but it is not nearly enough. The existing law requires, allows disaster relief and other forms of relief to farmers who have suffered from natural disasters, provided that they planted their crops or harvested their crops before February 28, 2007. Unfortunately, that applies to very few of our farmers in the crops that they plant. Consequently, they have next to no coverage, next to no protection from disaster relief that some farmers in other parts of the country would enjoy. 
   Basically what we would like simply to see happen is for our farmers to be cut into the same program of relief that other farmers are enjoying by virtue of existing agriculture law. That is what we are asking for. And there's several different ways to do it. Supplementals will be coming through here with capital improvements in various parts of the world, Iraq, Afghanistan; we could afford something in those bills for our own farmers. The farm bill itself will be coming back here in conference report. Maybe there is some way we can adjust it to provide for us. The Agriculture appropriations bill has not yet been passed. There are lots of opportunities. 
   We are here tonight to say we need the help of everyone, beginning with the administration. The Bush administration could initiate this process by requesting in the next supplemental some sort of assistance for these farmers, as was done and should have been done for the farmers suffering from wild fire on the west coast and, by golly, that will be a big first step and help us finish the process, carry the ball across the goal line here in Congress. 
   We are here tonight from all over the Southeast to bring the same message to the Congress, to the country and to the Bush administration. We are hurting, hurting bad. And if we don't get some sort of relief, it is going to be devastating for our farmers. 
   Thank you very much for the time you have yielded.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 370, I call up the Senate Concurrent Resolution (S. Con. Res. 21) setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2008 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2007 and 2009 through 2012, and ask for its immediate consideration. 
   The Clerk read the title of the Senate concurrent resolution.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say from the outset what we said yesterday in the debate of this bill. But let me refer to third parties, independent, disinterested third parties like the Concord Coalition. They took a look at our budget, and they said unequivocally, and I'm quoting, ``Thus, to be clear, the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' 
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, excellent analytical work, they took a look at our budget and they said, ``The House budget does not include a tax increase.'' 
   And then, finally, the Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institution, independent, disinterested said, plainly, simply, ``This budget would not raise taxes.'' 
   We have included in the budget resolution not one place, but twice, in different parts of the resolution, our wholehearted endorsement, our commitment, our pledge, our determination to see that these middle-income tax cuts are preserved and enacted and carried forward when they expire per their terms. 
   The budget resolution does not cause them to expire. They were designed to expire, written to expire when they were offered and passed. At that particular time, that was part of the provision.     
   In addition, I am making clear again that our budget resolution allows all of the deductions, credits, exemptions and exclusions that are provided in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. All of them are provided and allowed to stay in place this year, next year, and for the next 4 years. So there is very little disagreement about us except I am wondering about the arithmetic. 
   Budget resolution motions to instruct are nonbinding. They are a valid part of the process. But they do present a problem. They single out specific elements of a budget resolution without looking at how one goal, such as tax reduction, interacts with another goal, such as deficit reduction. In that respect, what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have offered is a resolution that calls for support of all of the tax cuts they laid out plus a surplus of $96 billion. 
   Could I ask the gentleman from Wisconsin, what does this assume about the bottom line before the tax cuts? How big a surplus would you have to have in 2012 in order for there to be, after taking these tax cuts, a $96 billion remaining surplus?

   Mr. SPRATT. It's my understanding, roughly speaking, that the cost of these tax cuts, the revenue impact of these tax cuts, in the first year was about $180 billion. If you take that kind of charge against the surplus and still have a surplus left of $96 billion, then you've got about a $276 billion surplus in that year.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, in response to the last speaker, if we support this resolution, it's because we originally provided in our budget resolution, in two different aspects of our budget resolution, our full, wholehearted support for these middle-income tax cuts. We still have, I will have to confess, concern about your arithmetic here, but we supported it in the budget resolution we filed, which passed the House. We endorsed and pledged that we would seek to the extension of the 10 percent individual tax bracket, the child tax credit, research and experimentation tax credit, all of these things. Read the resolution. They're there. We were there before you were, saying that, over the next 3 or 4 years, we need to see that when December 31, 2010, comes along, these tax cuts will survive and be preserved. We are committed to that, black and white print, budget resolution.

   Mr. SPRATT. No. I'm talking about statements in our budget resolution which state emphatically and clearly, ``It is the policy of this budget resolution to preserve, defend and protect the middle-income tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003, which will expire in 2010.'' 
   Now, we do believe, and this also is in our budget resolution, we believe in the PAYGO principle. We believe that the Tax Code is full of deductions and credits and exemptions and exclusions, and you can go through a closet cleaning in the Code and come up with enough offsets to provide for the extension of many of these tax cuts, maybe not all but many, without any adverse impact on the bottom line budget deficit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. There was a provision that allowed for reserve accounts so that we could provide for these tax cuts. But basically we took the position that this decision does not have to be made now, and indeed it can be better made closer in time to December 31, when we see what is the bottom line then. How much debt have we accumulated? What is the total deficit? What is the forecast for the future? At that point in time, we can consider the tax cuts, extension of them. 
   By my understanding, if you extend all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that expire on December 31, the cost over 10 years is about $2 trillion. That's a big decision. We think you should make it deliberately and closer in point of time to when these tax cuts actually expire. 
   Let me say also that not only did we put these tax cuts and state our support for them in the budget resolution, but in addition, when the tax cuts were passed in 2001, we either had substitutes or occasionally voted for independent free-standing provisions like the marriage penalty relief. Democrats were there when that passed the House. I voted for it the first time it came up and voted for it again repeatedly. In our substitutes, we had a 12 percent bracket and then a 10 percent bracket. We had a child tax credit, which we continually increase, and we had the R&E tax credit extension. We had expensing for small businesses. Many, if not all, of the things you are talking about here we voted for, maybe not on your bills but on our bills because these are tax policies favoring middle-income Americans for whom we think tax relief is well in order. 
   Secondly, we have a problem still with the arithmetic that you've got here.     
   According to my information, looking at CBO's most recent report, the Social Security surplus for 2012 is $255 billion. If you want to stay out of Social Security, you have got to have a surplus of at least $255 billion, a unified surplus of at least $255 billion, am I correct?

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, on the other hand, if you look at the surplus you are claiming, $96 billion, and also provide for these tax cuts, my information is that these tax cuts have a revenue impact of at least $180 billion.  That would mean in the year 2012 there has to be a bottom line surplus of $276 billion before the tax cuts are taken.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I have here a copy of the President's budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2008 published by the Congressional Budget Office. If you turn to page 6, you will see that the cost of the tax cuts, extending the tax cuts, which the motion proposes, the cost or the revenue impact of that in the year 2012 is $231 billion. That is what CBO says. 
   If you now add $96 billion to that, the surplus that year must be $327 billion. The surplus, $327 billion. Last year the deficit was $248 billion. If we move to a surplus of $327 billion in the year 2012, that requires a movement in the right direction of $575 billion which is hard to believe.

   Mr. SPRATT. The point, I am sure, is you are supportive of all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. You are limited by procedural rules to only dealing with that which is in the scope of the two resolutions. But, in fact, I am sure you are supportive of that. If that is true, you have to acknowledge that the number is $231 billion. That is the revenue impact of extending all of the tax cuts. If you add 96, which is the surplus you project, you get a big, big number. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, this goes back to something that our President called fuzzy math. And if I seem hung up on the topic of math, it is because arithmetic is important when you are putting together a budget. 
   What they are telling us is they can run a $96 billion surplus in the year 2012 even though they are taking tax cuts that will take $231 billion in revenues out of the Federal Treasury. It is a stretch, to say the least. That involves assuming that we will have a surplus in the year 2012 of $327 billion. 
   How far from that are we today? Last year we had a deficit of $248 billion. If  we are to move to a surplus of $327 billion by the year 2012, there has to be a movement in the right direction, a positive movement of $575 billion. Let's hope it happens, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. 
   They then say and just said we are raiding Social Security. How absurd can you get? Here it is right here. The Social Security surplus is $255 billion. They do not even claim more than $96 billion on the surplus. If they left the tax cut out, they would indeed have enough bottom line, 96 plus 231, to cover the surplus, but they haven't done that. 
   Here on the bottom line, the back of an envelope, is a simple chart that I bring down to the well with me every time I talk because we need to be reminded. When President Bush came to office, the national debt was $5.7 trillion. Six years later, the national debt is $8.8 trillion, an increase of $3.1 trillion over the last 6 years. That is a 60 percent increase in the debt of the United States. We have not seen anything like it since the Second World War. 
   Are we worried about fuzzy math? You better believe we are because this is the consequence of it. What the Republican budget resolution would have done had it been adopted is it would have extended again and again the policy of borrow and spend, leaving the tab to our children. 
   Here is what the tab looked like, in addition to the $8.8 trillion: You can cut taxes today, but what you leave in the wake of what you have done is a debt tax, the one tax that has to be paid because it is the amount of money we have to levy and raise every year to pay interest on our national debt, which is obligatory. It cannot be avoided. It has to be paid. 
   Here is the difference between interest on the national debt, which is well over $200 billion, headed to $300 billion within the foreseeable future, and look what it does to other priorities, things that are pressing and important like veterans health care, homeland security, and education. All of those things are dwarfed by the increase in interest payments on the debt. 
   This is a debt tax we have to pay today. All Americans have to pay it. Our children will have to pay it because of our irresponsible fiscal policy. This is why we need to clear up this fuzzy math and put the country back on a firm path to fiscal responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. For the clarification of Members, let me give you my take on what is before us right now. This motion to instruct conferees calls for us to recede, back off the revenue levels in the House amendment and insist on, listen to this, policy statement in section 401 of the House amendment. That is our budget resolution, the Democratic budget resolution. 
   It is the place in our resolution where one time we have insisted, pledged our support for the extension of these middle-income tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. That is paragraph A. It is hard for us to disagree with the enforcement of the language that we put in the budget resolution in the first place. 
   Secondly, paragraph B, insist on the lowest possible levels of revenue within the scope of the conference. 
   It is hard to tell what that level might be, whether or not it is consistent with the one above, but we certainly will give some consideration to that. 
   And finally, set forth a unified surplus of at least $96 billion in fiscal year 2012. I hope we can do it, but you have heard me go through the arithmetic out here, and I think it is a reach to even imply that these three variables can be integrated and solved in this one multi varied equation. 
   If you can do it, fine. If you can come out of all this still having these tax cuts and still having a $96 billion surplus, great. But I have to tell you, I think it is fuzzy math. 
   But we are wholeheartedly in support of the middle-income tax cuts that are enumerated here. Indeed, they have been lifted straight out of the Democratic budget resolution, and that is why we are supportive of them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Let me thank both the chairman and the ranking member for this gracious yielding of time but, in addition, for the excellent work they have done on this bill. As they know, there is a bone of contention in the bill where we have had a disagreement. It is called MOX fuel. I think it's a good idea. For some time we've had an understanding with the Russians that they and we would build MOX fuel disposition plants so that we could take weapons grade plutonium and convert it into reactor fuel, burn it and dispose of it so it would no longer be usable for weapons. This bill took the President's request of $333 million and basically cut it in half to 167. But when I sat down with the chairman, he pointed out to me that there were prior-year balances that would augment that amount of money and, all in all, there was a total of $698 million available which would be enough to move the project forward in the next fiscal year. Unfortunately, when we explored those unspent balances, we found that the numbers were a bit out of date, according to the Department of Energy, and that the available funds would add up to only about $326 million, which is about half of what is needed for the project next year. 
   So I rise simply to say that in conference or somewhere along the way before this finally becomes law, we would like to reengage about the amount of money that is available for the MOX plant. I'm not offering an amendment today. I know it would be defeated. It would also be ingratitude for the work that the chairman and the ranking member have already committed to work with us on this project. 
   But I do say, number one, I appreciate your efforts and, number two, we'll visit this number in conference with the conferees if at all possible. 
   There are some other issues here, the H Canyon, there's $85 million taken out of it. It's the only plutonium processing line of its kind we have operative in the country today. That money may render it difficult to operate it through the rest of the year. And there is also a question of where the pit disassembly process will be located. I understand that has been resolved and will be resolved with an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher). 
   Let me thank the chairman and the ranking member for their assistance in this matter and say that we still have some work to do on the adequate amount of money for the MOX fuel plant before the bill is ready.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Chairman, the bill before us has been vastly improved over the bill sent to us, and all of those improvements are still here. But this bill was waylaid in the Senate to add unrelated matters, which is not a good way to legislate, and I do not defend it. 
   But the major adds extend expiring tax cuts, which we would extend anyway in time, and to fix the AMT to keep it from coming down on middle income Americans, and sooner or later, we would adjust the AMT. In regular order, we would offset those tax reductions so that they do not add to the deficit. This bill contains only partial offsets, but there is remarkable improvements to the code here. 
   For example, one shining example, this bill closes a gaping loophole and saves $25 billion, a gaping loophole in the tax code, which has long allowed managers of hedge funds to shelter their income in places like the Caymans and dodge taxation. 
   One final point. Throughout, this has been called a $700 billion bailout, but we should bear in mind three points: first, $700 billion will be the gross cost if all of it is drawn down. The net cost should be a lot less. 
   I support this bill, and will vote for it again. I congratulate the chairman for the fine work he's done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2009 through 2013. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and sections 301 and 302 of S. Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues with the aggregate levels set by S. Con. Res. 70. This comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. 
   The second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for each authorizing committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations made under S. Con. Res. 70 for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and fiscal years 2009 through 2013. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure. 
   The third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 with the ``section 302(a)'' allocation of discretionary budget authority and outlays to the Appropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee shortly will be distributing this section 302(a) allocation among its subcommittees, creating 302(b) suballocations. At that time, a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act will become applicable to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. 
   The fourth table gives the current level for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 302 of S. Con. Res. 70. This list is needed to enforce section 302 of the budget resolution, which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that: (i) are not identified in the statement of managers; or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, no one comes to the well of this House today with any relish or enthusiasm. This bill is as unappealing to those of us who will vote for it as it is to those of us who will vote against it. The President has sent us an unprecedented request for $700 billion and asked for its immediate consideration. 
   The request came to us--all three pages--much like two bookends with contents to follow. When we read it, we found that the President sought a massive grant of money accompanied by a sweeping grant of authority. The President asked for speedy action. The people asked for diligence and deliberation, and that's what we have given them over the past 8 days. The result is a vastly improved bill. 
   If you think that $700 billion in one fell swoop is too much, as I do, the bill before you addresses that concern. It splits the funds into three stages and makes the third tranche of $350 billion subject to a vote of disapproval by Congress. In any event, everyone should understand that the cost of this bill is not $700 billion, as CBO has told us in testimony. The bill's cost would be substantially smaller than $700 billion. The cost would be the difference between the amount spent by the government and the amount received in earnings and proceeds when all the assets are finally sold. The CBO expects that ``since the acquired assets will have value, the net impact will be substantially less than $700 billion.'' 
   If you think, nevertheless, that the financial industry that benefits from this bill should ultimately pay for the losses it causes, as I do, then this bill offers a mechanism to accomplish that. And though the recoupment is not as ironclad as I would like, the principle is there embodied in the bill. 
   If you think that a grant of this amount calls for extraordinary oversight internally and externally, this bill is replete with oversight. If you think that the whole regulatory system needs to be overhauled, this bill initiates the process. 
   If you think that executive compensation should be capped, as I did, then this bill has limits and controls, and though they are not nearly as strict as I would like, they are present, they will be enacted and they can be built upon. If you want equity sweeteners for risks the government is taking, to cushion the downside losses and to give us a piece of the upside gains, this bill provides for warrants to go along with the notes, bonds and mortgages that we will be taking. 
   There is a lot that's better about this bill after almost 100 pages of substantive changes. But the question remains, is this bill necessary? Is this the best way to inject credit liquidity into our markets? Should we even shore up insolvent firms? 
   I can't answer that question definitively, but I have to listen when Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, answers it by saying: ``This is the most significant financial crisis of the post-war period. I see the financial markets as quite fragile ..... Credit will be restricted further. It will affect spending; it will affect economic activity; it will affect the unemployment rate; it will affect real income; it will affect everybody's standard of living ..... Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress. Action by Congress is urgently required to avert what could otherwise be grave consequences for financial markets and for our economy.'' 
   Ben Bernanke is an accomplished economist who has made a life-long study of economic crises. He has no axes to grind, and he is not given to exaggeration. When he warns that the situation is dire and that the cost of doing nothing could be catastrophic, we have to listen. Indeed, we ignore his advice at our peril--the peril that this crisis will become a wider economic debacle. 
   Many Members like me come from districts that are rural and made up of small towns. We tend to think that we are far removed from the ripple effects of a crisis like this. But when we get up on a Monday morning and find right in our yard that Wachovia has been acquired at the instigation of the FDIC, we know that the crisis can reach us all sooner or later unless we act now and act decisively. 
   I urge support for the bill.

Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for this opportunity to say something on behalf of my constituent, John Reid Justice of South Carolina, my good friend, my constituent, my trusted counselor, whenever we had or I had any questions or any issues about criminal justice, because he was the expert. 
   Madam Speaker, John Justice was almost elected to Congress himself. But in the middle of his campaign, he did what duty called him to do. He was in the National Guard, he took 2 weeks out for summer camp, and never quite caught up. But for that, he might have been here sponsoring legislation like the very bill before us which is named after him. 
   But providence had a better role for John Justice. He became a prosecutor. We call them solicitors in South Carolina, not district attorneys. He became a solicitor for nearly 30 years, and he became a model solicitor. Others looked to him, admired him, and followed his example. The better part of  his professional life, he was the prosecutor in the Sixth Judicial Circuit of South Carolina. He was, as I said, a model prosecutor, so much so that the National District Attorneys Association elected him, from Chester, South Carolina, as president not long ago, just before he died. 
   In addition, he was a model prosecutor. If you could have seen his funeral, you would understand when I say the entire law enforcement community in South Carolina turned out to pay honor to this splendid fellow. He would have been proud to know that this bill bears his name, particularly because of its substance, not just because of the honor, but because of the substance of the bill. He would be proud to know that he was having some part in helping young lawyers afford the crushing burden of student loans. 
   So on behalf of the friends of John Justice, who knew him well and practiced with him, on behalf of his family, on behalf of all those who worked with him, I want to thank the committee for naming this bill after him and for honoring him in this very special way. 
   I urge support for the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, budgets are about values and vision. Where your treasure is, the Bible says, there also is your heart. But if you cut through all of the arcane detail, all the numbers, it is hard to find the heart in the Ryan resolution. 
   Buried in this budget resolution, if you dig deep enough, are some enormous cuts exceeding anything that has ever been proposed, much less passed, in the past, particularly with respect to health care, in which people are totally dependent. These cuts are so extreme, so deep that they go to the reality of this whole resolution. It turns on these cuts, and the real question is whether or not they are politically or practically possible. 
   These cuts are dictated by an extraordinary process called reconciliation. Here is what the cuts amount to: Our committee, the Budget Committee, if this resolution were adopted, would be dictating to the Energy and Commerce Committee, with jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, cuts of $97 billion over the next 5 years. 
   With respect to Medicare, this committee, if this resolution were adopted, would direct that the Ways and Means Committee go back to Medicare and cut another $153 billion out of Medicare or, if they couldn't get that much out of Medicare, cut it out of the safety net programs that are in the province of the Ways and Means Committee, shredding the safety net for SSI, for TANF, and other programs. 
   Altogether, the cuts in the health care entitlements in this resolution come to $266 billion. And not just the health care entitlements are in jeopardy.     
   Education and labor, $4.9 billion. Where does that come from? Student loans, Pell Grants. 
   Natural resources. You heard Mr. Dicks a moment ago. Where does that come from? Clean water, Environmental Protection Agency, conservation. $22 billion less than we provide over 5 years. 
   Education, $46 million over 5 years for Function 500 less than we provide. There is a huge difference. 
   But it also goes to the veracity, the practical reality of this resolution, and begs the question: If cuts of this enormity have never been proposed before, why do we believe that they would be enacted now? 
   Instead, we have a sneaking suspicion that when all of these cuts are put together, we are going to be right back where we have been for the last 6  years, that is, deeper in deficit. That is because in addition to making spending cuts that total $278 billion, the same reconciliation instructions call for tax cuts, tax decreases, of $447 billion; and when you net the spending cuts against the tax cuts, you get an impact of $168.5 billion on the deficit. It makes it worse. 
   If this budget resolution would come back to the House as a concurrent budget resolution with these provisions, we would invoke the rule we passed on the House floor to the effect that you cannot abuse the process of reconciliation and use it for the purpose of worsening the deficit. It can only be used to improve the deficit, to use these extraordinary powers to improve the deficit. 
   That is why we say the Ryan resolution should be defeated. We think it is a sham. We don't think it will achieve its stated purposes. We think it will put us right back on this track of debt accumulation in which we have seen $3.1 trillion added to the national debt over the last 6 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, here is the Ryan resolution on the back of an envelope: look at what it does for reconciliation, because it does it elsewhere within the budget proposal. 
   Mr. Ryan proposes crippling, emasculating Medicare and Medicaid totaling over $250 billion, $278 billion altogether in hypothetical, wholly impractical, and unlikely cuts. But what is the net effect? Because at the same time and in the same bill he lowers taxes, has a tax cut of $447 billion. The net effect is an  increase to the deficit of $168 billion. That is why we have with this kind of arithmetic, why they have added $3.1 trillion to the debt of the United States. 
   Alternatively, we offer the base budget, the Spratt resolution, the Democratic resolution. It moves to balance by 2012, it leaves in place all of the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. They will be in place in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010; and it leaves until the future the decisions as to whether or not and to what extent to renew these tax cuts when they expire, not because of this resolution but because of the way you wrote them, in the year 2010. 
   We fully fund defense. We don't have a lot of left over, but we husband our resources to do more for education, more for science and innovation, more for veterans health care, and more for SCHIP which barely ranks an honorable mention in their budget. It is the centerpiece of our effort this year to see that more American children will be covered by the program known as the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Otherwise, we restrain spending, and throughout our budget resolution, we apply religiously the rule we adopted this January, the rule of pay-as-you-go. So that for every mandatory spending increase we make possible, we provide that it has to be offset by mandatory spending cuts elsewhere. 
   We protect the tax cuts, as I say. We present a good budget resolution. I say vote for the Spratt resolution. Vote for the Democratic resolution, and vote resoundingly ``no'' on the Ryan resolution. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for debate on the amendment has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I have to return to South Carolina to attend the presidential primary debate and the dedication of the library at Shaw Air Force Base. As a result, I will be unable to cast my vote today for H.R. 249, to restore the prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros. If I were able to cast my vote, I would vote in favor of H.R. 249, as I have done in the past 109th Congress, rollcall vote 199. 
   In the 109th Congress, I joined Representatives Rahall, Sweeney, and Whitfield in offering an amendment to the Department of the Interior Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006 to ensure that none of the funds made available would be used for the sale or slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros. Our amendment passed the House by a vote of 249-159. 
   The number of wild horses is dwindling. Just a century ago, 2 million horses roamed the west. Today, the combined number of wild horses and burros is less than 30,000, demonstrating that these animals need more protection.  
   I hope that others will join me in supporting this and other legislation to end the slaughter of our American horses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, 
   I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and sections 204, 206 and 207 of S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues with the aggregate levels set by S. Con. Res. 21. This comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. 
   The second table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 with the ``section 302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act because the point of order under that section applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. 
   The third table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for each authorizing committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations made under S. Con. Res. 21 for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure. 
   The fourth table gives the current level for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 206 of S. Con. Res. 21. This list is needed to enforce section 206 of the budget resolution, which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that: (i) are not identified in the statement of managers; or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I welcome the prospect of peaceful cooperation and trade between the United States and India on matters of nuclear power. I voted for the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 because I thought it was a foundation on which we could build an energy relationship with India, one that would be mutually beneficial and, at the same time, reassuring to the international community. 
   Seeking energy solutions for the world's rapidly developing countries, India among them, is an admirable cause. But nuclear nonproliferation is also an admirable, compelling cause, and I am not frankly convinced that the bill we're considering on this fast track, with 40 minutes of debate, will promote India's nuclear energy goals without creating exceptions, gaps, and ambiguities that could hamper our efforts to police and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and materials. 
   Many serious questions need to be answered with respect to this legislation. Chief among them are questions like these: How well do these agreements comport with the letter and spirit of the Hyde Act and the Atomic Energy Act? Does the bill take the right course in constraining India from breaching the worldwide moratorium to undertake nuclear testing? Does the bill indirectly encourage India to enlarge its arsenal of nuclear weapons by allocating nuclear materials from reactor fuel to warheads? Does it provide international safeguards? 
   Mr. Speaker, it appears that the President is bent upon a hurried approval of this agreement. Frankly, I can find no convincing reason to treat this issue in such a hasty manner, particularly as we enter the waning hours of this session preoccupied with other issues. 
   The Atomic Energy Act contemplates a continuous 30-day period of congressional review, calling clearly for due diligence on issues of this gravity. I say we should abide by this solemn requirement, and if necessary, work our will and make improvements to the legislation before us. 
   The President may want us to move with dispatch, but the American people, on matters of this importance, want us to move with diligence and deliberation. Due diligence takes time and effort. In this instance, if we adopt this bill, we are not applying either.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 207, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service. I thank my colleague from New Mexico, HEATHER WILSON, in particular, for her partnership and collaboration in helping to bring this bipartisan measure before the House. I want also to recognize the outstanding leadership of the cochairs of the Air Force Caucus, CLIFF STEARNS of Florida, SAM JOHNSON of Texas, and JIM MARSHALL of Georgia for their participation. 
   Sixty years ago in July, President Truman and Congress distilled the lessons learned in World War II into landmark legislation known as the National Security Act of 1947. On September 18, the Armed Forces were reorganized under a Department of Defense, and the Air Force was established as a military department coequal to the Departments of the Army and the Navy. 
   The question of whether air forces should be a service on their own separate from the ground forces arose long before it was resolved in the National Security Act of 1947. Over a period of 40 years, airmen earned that recognition, beginning with the Aeronautical Division's earliest exploits in 1907, followed by the derring-do of the Army Air Service in World War I, and then by the superior performance of the Army Air Corps, later the Army Air Forces, in World War II. America's airmen performed well; so well, in fact, that when battles were fought in the air, they were won decisively, making air superiority a standing assumption. 
   This tradition started during World War II, with aviators like General Doolittle. During the war in North Africa and Europe, General Eisenhower and General Spaatz, as commander of the Army Air Forces, worked well together. General Eisenhower came to appreciate the capabilities of air power and the role of the Air Force in achieving victory. He called General Spaatz, ``the best operational airman in the world,'' and became persuaded that the Air Force should exist alongside and equal to the Army and the Navy. Ike compared this arrangement to a three-legged stool, where each leg is essential to the whole. It's a principle alive, well, and working today. 
   Since its origin, the Air Force has stayed abreast of our national security requirements, adding missiles to aircraft, and through a long cold war, deterring any attack upon our country. The Air Force is typically called when we need to gain air superiority with troops and materiel, when and wherever the need arises. Its airlift and tanker capabilities give us the advantage of remote presence. Its satellites supply us with surveillance and communication capabilities that are the gold standard, surpassing anything that any other country in the world possesses. Not only has the Air Force achieved a technical overmatch against our adversaries in the air, but in space and cyberspace as well. 
   In today's Air Force, over 700,000 ``Total Force Airmen'' are at work as we speak, exercising vigilance, reach, and power around the world. They are operating intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft and spacecraft, supplying early warning, real-time intelligence, and situational awareness to the war fighters on the ground. They are a critical presence in the battle space of Afghanistan and Iraq. They are lifting cargo and passengers, and using refueling assets to build air bridges, projecting power, and sustaining the fight. 
   Although the hardware tends to get the headlines, it is the people who make it work and who make the Air Force what it is. When General Horner came home from the Persian Gulf in 1991, I asked him who were the unsung heroes, and he answered without hesitation, ``Well, for one, it is our NCOs; their quality has literally gone out of sight.'' I was reminded of what General Horner said when I was at Shaw Air Force Base not long ago and met with the Fighting 20th and its wing commander, Colonel Post, along with airmen and women, many of them about to deploy. They will be part of some 35,000 other airmen deployed around the globe. Because of them and others like them, we have the best Air Force in the world, bar none. 
   This concurrent resolution is our way, as Members of Congress and citizens of this Nation, of expressing our appreciation, of recognizing the United States Air Force, its leaders and airmen, for consistently proving their worth to our Nation and helping make this the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
   Let me conclude with the resolving clause: That Congress remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force in serving and defending our country on the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as an independent military service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2669 (the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007), a bill that is good for students and good for the Federal budget. Our budget resolution for fiscal year 2008 included reconciliation instructions for the House Committee on Education and Labor to cut its spending by $750 million by 2012, and this bill more than fulfills that target. In fact, this reconciliation bill will reduce the Federal Government's budget  deficit by $2.8 billion over the next 5 years while investing billions of dollars in making college more affordable for millions of students. 
   One of the first actions of the 110th Congress was to institute a tough pay-as-you-go rule in the House that requires all changes to mandatory spending and revenues to be offset so that they do not lower the budget's bottom line. The rule was necessary to help restore fiscal balance, and it requires Congress to make tough choices about priorities. This bill adheres to the pay-as-you-go rule--with net savings of $2.8 billion over the 2007-2012 period and even greater savings over 2007-2017--while also providing needed improvements in student loans and grant aid. 
   Like previous reconciliation bills, the College Cost Reduction Act includes some new resources that are more than offset by cuts elsewhere. All of the new resources in the bill will make college more affordable, either by lowering the cost of loans--up-front or through forgiveness after graduation--or by increasing the amount of grant aid available. But none of these resources will increase the deficit: the bill not only complies with our pay-as-you-go rule and the reconciliation directive but actually reduces the deficit by $2.8 billion over the next 5 years. 
   To pay for these student benefits, the bill reduces the extra subsidies that the government pays to banks. These reductions are similar to those in H.R. 5, which passed the House in January by a bipartisan vote of 356-71, and to the subsidy cuts in the President's 2008 budget proposal. But the student loan business will continue to be an attractive one for banks, which are still guaranteed to receive 95 percent of unpaid principal on any defaulted loan and still receive a subsidy from the Federal Government on each loan they provide.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5, COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule providing for consideration of the College Student Relief Act. This bill is good for students, it is good for the budget, and it is deserving of our support. This bill will help make college more affordable to students who need it most by cutting the interest rate in half on subsidized student loans. 
   College costs, as we all know, have risen dramatically. In the last 5 years, the cost of attending a 4-year public college increased $3,095, or by 34 percent. Interest rates the students pay on college loans have also risen this year to a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. This combination of factors makes attending college more expensive, if not impossible, for some of today's high school students. 
   This bill, the bill before us, takes a long first step towards making college more affordable. Each year it cuts the interest rate that undergraduates will pay on the standard subsidized student loans until that rate is cut in half to 3.4 percent in the year 2011. At the same time, the bill we have before us will save the Federal Government by reducing the deficit by a significant sum. 
   That is why this bill meets all of the tests laid down by the pay-as-you-go rule which the House adopted on January 5. That rule requires that direct spending or mandatory spending be budget neutral or deficit neutral over 6 years, 2007 through 2012, and over 11 years as well, 2007 through 2017, which is as far out as our cost estimates run. This bill is more than deficit neutral or budget neutral because it actually reduces the deficits in most years, saving $1.5 billion in 2007, $65 million over 6 years, and a total of $7.1 billion over the next 11 years, 2007 through 2017. 
   So, overall, this bill helps students get a good college education while helping us reduce the deficit. It meets the requirements of PAYGO. It is a bill and a rule that deserves our support. 
   I would urge every Member on both sides to vote for this rule and vote for the rule that enables it to come to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I offer an amendment that would strike the provisions of section 1224 in the bill. It would replace those provisions with language requiring the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress regular updates of the National Intelligence Estimate with respect to Iran's nuclear capabilities, present and prospective. 
   As offered in committee, section 1224 imposed a multiplicity of reporting requirements, including all sorts of data from the Department of Defense. Mr. Reyes offered a perfecting amendment culling out many of those requirements and calling for a new commitment to readiness throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. 
   Rather than proliferate reporting requirements, my amendment cuts to the heart of the matter, Iran's nuclear capabilities, and calls for regular, periodic reports. What it seeks is basic: a sober analysis of a gravely serious matter in a proven format, the National Intelligence Estimate. This report is gleaned from all 16 parts of our intelligence community, and the job of fusing that data, and drawing the right conclusions, is assigned to the National Intelligence Director, a position created by Congress by the unanimous recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   We need an assessment, but we need an assessment that is rigorous and objective, pulling no punches, analyzing seriously all issues surrounding nuclear weapons and fissile materials in Iran. And, fortunately, we don't have to invent that vehicle. It exists already in the form of the National Intelligence Estimate, like the NIE of last November, 2007. It satisfies this requirement. And my amendment ensures that this requirement continues to fulfilled, not ad hoc, but at regular intervals, for the benefit of Congress. 
   My amendment simply places responsibility where it already rests by law and uses a reporting process that is  well established. Why reinvent the wheel? The appropriate vehicle for an ongoing objective of analysis is an updated NIE, not an independent, redundant, parallel effort, overseen by DOD. 
   There are many good reasons for having unity of command here, but one is simply this: By consolidating analysis in the NIE, we discourage the temptation to ``forum shop,'' look for agencies that will be favorably disposed. 
   My amendment allows for many of the points of inquiry in the bill's existing language, including input from our allies. But it focuses the NIE on near- and mid-term implications rather than on speculative far-term projections, and it does not rush to a military response as a presupposition. 
   My amendment leaves in place the bill's current requirement to provide Congress 15 days' written notice when major developments in the nuclear weapons program are detected. But the bill shifts that burden from the Secretary of Defense to the President. 
   This amendment, the amendment I offer, is truly, Madam Chairman, a perfecting amendment. It improves the language of the bill, and it helps section 1224 fulfill its stated purpose. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SPRATT. Let me say to the gentleman, I don't expect this to be the last iteration of this bill. It is the third already. If there are issues of clarity, issues of definition, we will revisit those issues and work them out in conference towards a common purpose here. 
   I do think this bill advances the process. I think it is better than the previous two bills, and we are building towards a conclusion we can all accept. You can count on my cooperation to that end. 
   So I thank you for your observations. We will be visiting this topic again. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Franks amendment. This amendment would increase fiscal year 2009 funding for the Missile Defense Agency, MDA, by $719 million, backing up the bill to the level of the budget request. The administration asked for $9.3 billion in fiscal year 2009. This represented an increase of $680 million above the 2008 level. 
   With prudent reductions and selected increases, this bill authorizes $8.6 billion, a substantial sum of money for the Missile Defense Agency, which is roughly equivalent to the level of current spending. We provide for increases in funding for systems that are geared to current threats, like the Aegis BMD and THAAD systems that the combatant commanders have told us they need and need now. At the same time, we make prudent reductions in longer-term, less-mature vehicles like the Multiple Kill Vehicle and the Airborne Laser. 
   We don't know, looking at this amendment, that the money can really be executed, spent wisely. Even if we do, we have to ask where is this money coming from? We find when we look that the $719 million is coming out of RDT&E, which is tantamount to saying that MDA, missile defense, is over and above more important than the UAVs, more important than the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the FCS, the Army's Future Combat Systems, and the Navy's DDG-1000. A whole host of other systems that will depend on adequate funding will be denied that funding by the $719 million hit which this amendment would impose upon those particular systems. 
   This is a balanced bill. The cuts and adjustments have been made to it so we that could come up with a system that covers our comprehensive needs. Missile defense is just one of many. They have all been judiciously done, and we should not disrupt the pattern of this balanced bill by making the cuts that the gentleman would propose. 
   So I urge everyone to take a close look at this, but to stick with the committee chairman's very careful and very balanced view.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, the package before us will be modified tomorrow to include provisions that reinstate a practice that was followed throughout the 1990s in the budget process called pay-as-you-go. 
   Pay-as-you-go was first instituted in 1991 as part of the Budget Enforcement Act when President Bush, the first President Bush, was the President of this country. Pay-as-you-go simply provides that if you want to cut taxes when you have a deficit, you can't make the deficit worse; you have got to offset those tax cuts either with entitlement cuts in an equivalent amount or with tax increases elsewhere in the Tax Code. And, if you want to enhance an entitlement, you have to pay for it with an identified revenue stream. 
   Our friends across the aisle are trying to imply that this PAYGO rule is a sham. I will simply say to you that our  PAYGO rule is the art of the possible; it is what we can do at the present moment, and that is we can amend the rules of the House today and tomorrow to include two new PAYGO rules which we have provided for and which have been published. 
   There is some dispute as to whether or not the baseline against which to measure increases and decreases is going to be something that we can manipulate in the Budget Committee. I would simply invite everybody to read the language of the rule, and they will see that in this particular case, the Committee on the Budget is bound to turn to the Congressional Budget Office, which is traditional practice, and to use the recent baseline estimates supplied by the CBO consistent with section 257 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. That is what the rule provides. We go to CBO for the baseline, we determine whether or not the extent to which there will be an increase in spending or decrease in revenues. It is a CBO function based upon the latest baseline. And any other construction of this is a false construction. 
   Now, some may say this is just a rule of the House, it can be waived by the Rules Committee because, as the other side well knows, points of order of this kind traditionally have been mowed down by the Rules Committee. But this is the best we can do with a rule of the House. We can later come back and make a statutory change, but it will be good to know if our opponents on the other side who support such a change.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 14 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, today we take up the budget resolution. Passing it, like many things in this House, is never easy, and sometimes contentious. But it is crucially important if we care about fiscal soundness and the future of our country. 
   Our country faces right now a host of different challenges: the specter of recession, a crunch in the credit markets, rising unemployment, declining family income, constant inflation in the cost of health care, aging infrastructure, and a porous safety net. And that is not to mention the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, costing us close to $200 billion this year, and even more dearly in human lives and wounded. 
   The President's budget for 2009 does little to turn this tide. In fact, the policies of the last 7 years have created some of these problems and compounded others. Eight short years ago, in 2000, our budget was in surplus, big-time surplus. In that year, we had a surplus of $236 billion. Having worked for years to bring the budget to this status, we warned the President and our colleagues across the aisle not to bet it all on a blue-sky forecast; but it was to no avail. 
   The President's economists looked out 10 years and saw nothing but surpluses, $5.6 trillion in all. We worried that if these rosy projections didn't pan out, we would be right back where we had been, deep in deficit.     
   Well, the President told the country, in effect, that we could have it all, guns, butter and tax cuts, too, and never mind the deficits. 
   I'll have to admit it looked as though we were sitting on an island of surpluses, but, in truth, we were surrounded by a sea of debt, of long-term unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare, coming due just over the horizon. 
   Seven years later, under this administration's policies, those surpluses are history. They're gone, vanished, replaced with record deficits and mounting debt. 
   This one chart here which shows in tabular form the increase in the debt over the last 8 years, says it as simply as we can on one piece of paper. When the President came to office, the debt of this country was $5.7 trillion. When he leaves in a few months, it will probably be close to $10 trillion, more than $4 trillion in debt accumulation on the watch of the Bush administration. 
   The budget we take up today is no grand solution, I'll grant you that, but it moves us in the right direction. It restores fiscal responsibility, but not to the exclusion of other values that  we hold dear such as our children's education and their good health care. And that's why, right off the bat, we part company with the President's budget and with Mr. Ryan's substitute. 
   We think Medicare is one of our country's crowning achievements, so we reject his cuts that would emasculate Medicare, in the President's budget, $556 billion over 10 years, and we reject his cuts in Medicaid, $118 billion over 10 years. 
   The Ryan substitute over 5 years would cut Medicare by $253 billion by our calculation, and Medicaid by $116 billion. We can't vote for that. 
   We would not wipe out the Social Services Block Grant or cripple the Community Services Block Grants as the President proposes, because we have seen in our own communities the roles they play. They hold up the safety net in an economy where it's sorely needed. And with fuel prices at record highs, the last thing we would slash is LIHEAP and low-income home weatherization. These are minimum benefits for Americans with maximum needs. 
   Ten years ago when we first ran a surplus, we resolved in both Houses to use some of that surplus each year to double the resources of the National Institutes of Health, the NIH, over a period of 5 years. We reached that goal in a bipartisan way, only to backslide year by year in this administration. In our budget this year we stop the backsliding at NIH, and we restore the President's cuts at the equally important Centers For Disease Control. 
   Our budget targets other resources to strengthen our economy and our society. We invest more in innovation, more in energy, more in infrastructure, and we provide $7.1 billion more than the President for education. 
   To move our country one step closer to health care for all, we facilitate up to $50 billion to expand SCHIP, the children's health insurance program, consistent with PAYGO, requiring that the costs be fully offset. We also accommodate fiscally responsible relief from the alternative minimum tax in order to shelter those middle-income taxpayers for whom it was never intended. 
   To make America safe, we fully fund defense, and we keep our promises to those who have fought for our defense, providing $3.6 billion above current services for veterans health care. 
   Now Mr. Ryan puts another billion on top of that in his budget, but he also puts in function 920, this is budget esoterica, but he puts in function 920 a call for $400 billion in undistributed cuts. One of those cuts would likely be that apparent increase in veterans health care. 
   Although we fix the AMT for another year, providing a tax cut of $70 billion to middle-income Americans, our Republican colleagues will accuse us of raising taxes. You've already heard it. The fact is, our budget doesn't raise taxes by one penny. But don't take my word for it. Stop by the manager's table right here on the House floor and read the letters that we've received from groups like the Concord Coalition, or look at the posters that we just posted here. 
   Here's what the Concord Coalition says: ``Allowing some or all of the tax cuts to expire would not be the result of Congress raising taxes; it would be the result of sunsets that were included when these tax cuts were originally enacted to avoid the level of fiscal scrutiny that PAYGO is designed to ensure.'' That's what the Concord Coalition has to say about our resolution. 
   If you want to see more, turn to section 501 in our budget resolution, title 5, section 501, and we enumerate, from item A through H, child tax credit, marital penalty relief, the 10 percent bracket, estate taxes, extension of research experimentation tax credit, extension of the State and local sales tax deduction, extension of the deduction for small business expenses and it goes on. These are the tax cuts that we embrace and commit ourselves to seeing renewed when they do eventually expire. 
   We believe that tax relief can come in a deficit-neutral tax bill in some cases, and we offer the AMT as an example. On more than one occasion, high-ranking officials in the Bush administration have testified before our committee, and when they're asked about the AMT and its impact on middle-income taxpayers, they've insisted that they could fix the AMT with changes in the Tax Code so that there would be no net loss of revenues. 
   For example, in February 2006 Josh Bolten was the director of OMB. He told our committee that the AMT could be corrected in the context of overall deficit-neutral tax reform, his words. 
   In February 2007, his successor, Rob Portman, told the Budget Committee, ``Our budget assumes it will have a revenue-neutral correction to the AMT.'' 
   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, has taken the same stance, but Mr. Rangel has delivered. He's put a revenue-neutral bill on the table to kindle the debate. The Bush administration asserts it 
   too has a plan, but has failed to follow through by disclosing any plan of its own. 
   One of the first steps that we took in the 110th Congress was to restore the pay-as-you-go rules that had helped us in the 1990s turn record deficits into record surpluses. This resolution fully complies with the PAYGO rule. 
   Partly because we've held mandatory spending in check with PAYGO and, at the same time, kept domestic discretionary spending close to the rate of inflation, this budget returns to surplus in 2012. Our bottom line beats the President's budget going away. Between 2009 and 2013, our net deficits are $262 billion. Over the same period the President's net deficits are $674 billion. And using CBO's latest forecast, our budget should be in surplus by 2012 in the amount of $178 billion. And from 2012 through 2018 our cumulative surplus should reach $1.4 trillion, all told. 
   Now we could have used the lion's share of those surpluses to offset the revenues lost to renewal of expiring tax cuts, and surpluses of $1.4 trillion would indeed offset a huge amount of revenues forgone. We chose instead to leave those decisions to a time closer to December 31, 2010, when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. But when the time is right, if those surpluses materialize, they can be used to offset the renewal of numerous expiring tax cuts, disproving our opponents' claim that we don't intend to renew and extend any of the expiring cuts. 
   In our resolution we also provide $940 million for program integrity, much of it going to the Internal Revenue Service for audits and compliance. The Commissioner told us not so many months ago that there's a huge tax gap, maybe $500 billion, between taxes owed and taxes paid, the so-called tax gap. If we can close that gap just a bit, we can raise tax revenues without raising tax rates. These funds can likewise be used as offsets. 
   So there are many ways to look at tax cuts in the code. And what we are saying here is that we should use the next several years, before the tax cuts expire, to do all of the above so that we will have the revenues to renew many of these tax cuts and restructure the AMT in keeping with PAYGO principles. That's simply what we are proposing. 
   Our budget parallels the President's budget with respect to national defense. It funds the basic defense budget at the levels the President requested for 5 years, but does not include supplemental funds beyond the $700 billion sought by the President. The President's budget for 2009 does include a $70 billion item which the Pentagon calls a placeholder. To compare our budget to the President's budget, apples to apples, our resolution includes a $70 billion placeholder equal to the President's request for overseas deployments and activities in theaters that include Afghanistan and Iraq. This budget resolution is not an authorization bill. It's not an appropriations bill, and therefore, it cannot prescribe how much should be spent for these activities or specify where the funds should be spent. Those decisions are left to the authorization and appropriation process, in committee and on this floor. These funds, however, can be used for whatever purpose the Congress eventually chooses in authorizing and appropriating legislation. 
   When we set out to do this budget, our overriding objective, Madam Chairman, was a balanced budget, because we're appalled at the amount of debt being left our children, and at our stature in the world as the greatest debtor nation. But we want more than arithmetic balance; we want our priorities balanced; we want a budget that does more for our children's education and their health care as well, a budget that  makes our workers more competitive and our scientists more innovative. 
   We want to revive America, restore our fiscal soundness, reclaim our future. This budget is just one step, but it's one step in the right direction. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I have sat here all afternoon, and last week through the markup, listening to this mantra about tax increases, all of which is a fabricated argument, and could not and cannot avoid the conclusion that to some extent this is a red herring. 
   It's a way of distracting attention from the real problems at hand, a way of avoiding discussion of a $236-billion surplus, which is where our economy and our budget stood in the year 2000, the year before Mr. Bush came to office, the $4 trillion in debt added by the Bush administration over the last 7 years, over median family income which has fallen under the Bush administration, avoiding discussion about a debt-burdened economy, which is losing steam near a recession and a dollar, a mighty dollar, which is plummeting, avoiding all of that so that we can talk about something that is not going to happen. 
   First of all, we made it as clear as we possibly could that we have endorsed, embraced and pledged to see continued the middle-income tax cuts which are included in the 2001-2003 tax cuts. They add up for the renewal over a 5-year period of time to $230 billion. If we follow our budget resolutions we have laid out, we will have a surplus in 2012 of $178 billion. 
   By 2018 the cumulative surfaces will be at $1.4 trillion. If we choose then, and we are not making the decision now, but if we choose then that will offset the extension of most of the taxes, most of the tax cuts that were adopted in 2001 and 2003. 
   We have put that in black and white, title V policy, policy on middle income tax relief, and we have laid out from item A through item H the different tax cuts that we support and are pledged or seeing renewed and extended. We can't make it any clearer than this. 
   Let me say something else for anybody listening wondering whether or not his taxes are about to shoot up and whether he should go cash in some stocks and bonds and get ready for this huge tax increase, it's not coming. Even if we adopted something that called for it to happen, it would have to go through Ways and Means. It would have to go through Senate Finance. It's a long way from ever being passed. 
   We simply say in our budget resolution, as we get ready for 2010, let's see if we can't have a conservative budget that will move us toward surplus so that some of that surplus, at least, can be used to offset some of these tax cuts. Let's see if we can't put some money into program integrity with the Internal Revenue Service and shrink the tax gap so we can use some of the money there, raise tax revenues without raising tax rates, use some of the money thus gained to offset some of these tax cuts when they come up for renewal. 
   Go through the code as we did in 1986, give it a good closet cleaning. It needs a scrub down as an accretion of the deductions and credits and exemptions and preferences, all of these things. If we muster our efforts, if we marshal our efforts, we can do and lay the basis for the renewal of many of these tax cuts in 2010. 
   But we primarily delayed the decision about those tax cuts in 2010 on the basis that we need to know more. What will be the state of the economy? Will we still be in two different theaters, Afghanistan and Iraq, fighting a war that is costing $12 billion a month? Will we still have an enormous deficit or will we be in surplus? 
   Better that we determine it than guess at it now. We are simply saying we would lay the basis. First of all, we would lay down the principle that we would protect these middle income tax cuts. Second, we will put the budget in place to begin generating surpluses so that they can afford the renewal of some of these tax cuts. 
   That can be done in this budget resolution. We are not pushing the biggest tax increase in American history. I don't know even where the numbers arrived from in the first place. I don't think it's supportable, but it is totally fantastic. It's an argument that is a complete red herring and a complete deviation from what we are all about today. 
   We should be talking about the savings rate in this country, about what deficits are doing to our economy, our country, and our standing in the world. There is plenty to talk about that is relevant. This subject is not because it's not about something that is about to happen. 
   Mr. Chairman, I now yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I can return all the compliments that Mr. Ryan paid to me. He's a pleasure to work with, and I have great respect for him. 
   But there's one thing he didn't mention at all in his presentation all afternoon and that is his budget substitute. And I think one of the reasons he didn't do it is that it won't bear scrutiny. 
   If you look at the Ryan substitute, the Republican minority substitute, you'll find, if you look very closely and know where to look, something called function 920. Now, function 920 is the catch-all. When you can't assign some expenditure or revenue raiser somewhere else, you put it in function 920. It means really we haven't yet completed the job. 
   When you look at 920 in this case, the minority has assigned $817 billion in undefined savings or at least $405 billion in discretionary spending cuts which are undistributed. They haven't been assigned to the Veterans Administration or to the Defense Department or to the Transportation Department. They are undistributed cuts, $405 billion. I've never seen in all my years in the Budget Committee, anything that has a function 920, this catch-all in cuts of $405 billion. 
   But in addition to that, it calls for $412 billion in mandatory savings. Now, we don't know for sure where mandatory savings are coming from, which  programs are in jeopardy. But when Ways and Means is directed to reconcile $253 billion over 5 years, the Energy and Commerce Committee is directed to reconcile $116 billion over 5 years, we know the resolution has Medicare and Medicaid in its bore sights and the likely cuts are substantial. $368 billion. We've never done anything that approaches that magnitude at Medicaid and Medicare cost reduction. Indeed, during the Gingrich era, Republicans were pushing something of that size. It never got off the ground, and it wouldn't here either, let me tell you. So that's unrealistic. And the 405 is unrealistic because the work hasn't been done. 
   And then finally Mr. Ryan calls for, in his resolution, $1.2 trillion in tax cuts over the next 5 years. If you extend these tax cuts out, and you consider what he's doing, he wants to extend all the expiring tax cuts and, on top of that, also repeal the alternative minimum tax, just repeal it. The likely impact on revenues is about $2.5 trillion over 10 years, which blows a big hole in the bottom of the budget. And I don't think that's realistic either. It certainly isn't realistic if we're in earnest about seeking a budget that will balance. And so here, buried in the budget resolution, which he's not mentioned all afternoon, are three major problems with his budget resolution. He hasn't done his work. He hasn't distributed the cuts. And I'll tell you what that does. When you have $405 billion in function 920 undistributed, you can say to the veterans who come to you, we've got $1 billion covered for you. You can say to others, with plausible deniability, oh, you won't be cut, you won't be cut. But in truth, $405 billion is 20 percent of nondefense discretionary spending. That's where the cuts are going to fall every year at 20 percent. I don't believe it's going to happen. I don't think therefore that what he's presented is a valid, reasonable, defensible alternative to the budget resolution, and it strikes me as passing strange that we haven't discussed it all afternoon. 
   Now one final shot across the bow, one final statement about the mantra we've heard all afternoon. We do not propose to implement, in this budget resolution, any tax cuts whatsoever. We're laying down the policy as clearly as we know how in title V on middle-income tax relief, and specifying very clearly and pledging ourselves very, very committedly to the enactment, preservation and extension of these tax cuts. That's the policy of this budget resolution. Everyone should bear it in mind. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Walz of Minnesota). The gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) each will control 30 minutes on the subject of economic goals and policies.

   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, Under section 308(b)(1) of S. Con.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (INTRODUCTION OF THE REVEREND RON JACKSON, GUEST CHAPLAIN -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, today's opening prayer was given by the Reverend Ronald B. Jackson. Reverend Jackson serves as the minister of East Gaffney Baptist Church in Gaffney, South Carolina, a pulpit that he has filled with distinction since 1989. 
   Reverend Jackson's ministry is based in East Gaffney Baptist Church, but not confined there. He has a television ministry in Greenville and a radio ministry in Gaffney. He is a prominent preacher, for sure, but he is also a pastor who has been recognized for service throughout the Southeast. He has established, for example, a foundation to help needy ministers and their families called the Parsons' Pantry Fund. 
   Three years ago, Governor Sanford awarded him the Order of the Silver Crescent, our State's highest award for volunteer service. 
   Reverend Jackson has spread the gospel from the Second Baptist Church of Great Falls, South Carolina, where he was called to the pulpit, to Bethel Baptist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and even to Bourbon Street in New Orleans, where he was assistant chaplain, before coming home to South Carolina and eventually settling in Gaffney. 
   Reverend Jackson is married to Karen A. Jackson. They have two children, Kimberly McMillin of Inman and Bryan Jackson of Gaffney; and three grandchildren. Karen also has a son, Brock Burgess, of Gaffney. 
   On behalf of the House, I want to thank Rev. Jackson for his inspiring prayer and the Speaker and Rev. Coughlin for asking him to open today's session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This budget resolution which we present today did not come easily. It comes from months of hard work, hearings, and negotiations. The end product is a good budget, not perfect, I will admit. Not complete but worthy of support. Indeed, it requires our support if we do not want the process to fail again, as it did last year when no concurrent resolution was passed and only two of 11 appropriation bills were enacted. 
   This budget moves us to balance over the next 5 years. Along the way, it posts smaller deficits than the President's budget. It adheres to the pay-as-you-go principle and contains no new  mandatory spending that is not paid for, and it funds ``program integrity initiatives'' to root out wasteful spending, fraud, and tax evasion. 
   Within this framework, our budget does more for veterans' health care, more for children's health care, and more for education. Here in a nutshell are the basics of this budget: 
   This budget comes to balance in 5 years and runs a surplus of $41 billion in the year 2012. Contrast that with the President's budget, which remains always in deficit. This budget allocates $954 billion to discretionary spending, or about $75 billion more than this year, of which about $50 billion is for national defense. This total includes $450 billion for nondefense discretionary, or about $23 billion more than this year. 
   This budget not only abides by the PAYGO principles, it extends them, establishing a Senate PAYGO rule and calling for statutory PAYGO as well. 
   The concurrent resolution before us, like the House resolution, sets defense spending at levels the President requested, though it targets resources to the troops and conventional forces. It provides more for homeland security than the administration requested, and it funds the recommendations of the9/11 Commission. So it is strong on defense, internal and external. 
   This budget does all of the above, and I would emphasize this, it does all of the above without raising taxes. The tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 all remain in force, unaffected in any way by this resolution. As originally written and enacted, most of the tax cuts expire on December 31, 2010. In our budget resolution, we separated out the middle income tax cuts and made it the policy of our resolution to extend those tax cuts when they expire.     
   In this concurrent resolution, we go even further. We install a trigger that facilitates the extension of these tax cuts so long as the House waives its PAYGO rule and so long as the tax cuts extended do not exceed 80 percent of the surplus projected by OMB for the year 2012. 
   This budget's basic objective is to get back to balance. That is the bottom line. In such a budget, we can't have everything we want, but we do believe that some promises should be kept above all others, for example, the promises we've made to our veterans. This resolution increases funding for veterans health care in 2008 by $6.7 billion, 18.3 percent above the current year. 
   We also do not believe that children's health care and education should be sidetracked while we seek to work out ways to balance the budget. This budget accommodates an increase of $50 billion to expand the Childrens Health Insurance Program, so-called SCHIP, and cover millions of uninsured children. This budget also provides $4.6 billion over current services for education, job training and employment services. That includes more money for No Child Left Behind, for special education and student loans. 
   Lacking any other arguments, our friends from across the aisle, our Republican adversaries, will claim that this budget resolution raises taxes, as they have repeatedly and wrongly. Let me answer that claim emphatically. This budget does not raise taxes by one penny. Period. Not by one penny. 
   On the contrary, the 2008 budget resolution accommodates the extension of the middle income tax cuts, pays for a 1-year patch to prevent the AMT from coming down on middle income taxpayers, and calls for reform of the AMT, consistent with PAYGO principles, to save middle income taxpayers from this stealthy tax. 
   This budget is fiscally sound, a solid framework, is balanced from the top line to the bottom, and I urge support for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to the majority leader, let me set the record straight with respect to revenue flows. 
   If you look in the Congressional Budget Office projections of revenues in the budget, you will see that for the period 2008 through 2012, cumulative revenues are projected to be $15.3 trillion. If you subtract 176 for that to account for the agreement we've made with the Senate, which will facilitate the adoption and extension of the middle income tax cuts adopted between 2001 and 2003, then our number for total revenues, according to CBO is $14.828 trillion. The President's budget, total revenues are $14.826 trillion. We are $14.828 trillion, the President is $14.826 trillion; $2 billion difference. This is the biggest tax increase in history? Give me a break. 
   And how about the Republican's own revenue stream. You start from the same baseline. They have to use CBO numbers too. $15.3 trillion. Deduct from that $447 billion, which they have in tax cuts during that period of time, the baseline number for them becomes $14.556 trillion. That is a difference of $272 billion over 5 years, less than $50 billion a year over that period of time. This is absurd. This has gone on and on and on, as the speeches claim, and we will refute it every time it's raised today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland, the distinguished majority leader.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   We can't have this debate without having a few charts on the floor, and it always bears reminding what's happened over the last 6 years because it is truly a fiscal phenomenon. 
   When President Bush came to office in 2001, he had an advantage that few Presidents in recent history have enjoyed, a budget in surplus. I'm talking big-time surplus, $5.6 trillion by his estimate, over the next 10 years, $5.6 trillion. That was the year 2001. In the previous year, a Clinton year, we ran a surplus of $236 billion. 
   By the year 2004, under the stewardship of this administration and this Congress, because Republicans controlled the House, controlled the Senate and controlled the White House, under their stewardship, the $5.6 trillion surplus was converted to a $2.8 trillion deficit, enormous swing of $8 trillion in the wrong direction, and that $236 billion surplus in the year 2004 became a deficit of $412 billion. 
   Incredible, but that is what we have had for the last 6 years. That's the record over the last 6 years which cannot be denied. Here it is right here. 
   As a consequence of the deficits that have been run, this simple little chart that I bring down here again and again, because it bears reminding everybody what's happened over the last 6 years, shows that when Bush came into office we had a debt of $5.7 trillion. The debt today is over $8 trillion, $8.8 trillion. That means there's been an increase in the national debt of $3.1 trillion, and if we continue upon the fiscal path that this administration has taken, by the time they leave office the debt of the United States will be $90.6 trillion. 
   Look at the accumulation of debt over this 8-year period of time. We've never seen anything like it. These are the people who would criticize what we are doing.     
   Now, there has been a lot of talk about tax increases. Let me show you this little chart here, because it shows graphically, and emphatically, something called debt service. The increase in the interest on the national debt that has to be paid, talk about entitlement reform, this is the one true entitlement. It's obligatory, it has to be paid. Interest on the national debt has increased from about $156 billion a couple of years ago to $256 billion, and it's on its way north to $300 billion in a short period of time. This is a debt tax. 
   Yes, you may have cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but, because you have borrowed to make up for the loss of revenues and added to the debt of the United States, you, we, our children and their children, will be paying this debt for years to come, and compare this huge mountain of debt service, interest on the national debt, to other priorities. 
   Education, the light blue block; veterans health care, the green block; Homeland Security, the blue block, all of them are dwarfed by interest on the national debt. So here is the debt tax that you have left us owing, left our children owing, left generations to come owing. 
   This is the debt tax that will have to be paid because it simply cannot be cut. That's what we are struggling with today because of the fiscal management of this government over the last 6 years.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good budget. I would be the first to say it is not a perfect budget, but I would be the first to argue that it is worthy of our support. 
   Indeed, I think it requires our support if we don't want to see the budget process fail abjectly once again, as it did last year under Republican control when no concurrent budget resolution was ever enacted, passed, and only two of 11 appropriation bills were passed. 
   The bottom line, this budget moves us to balance over the next 5 years. Along the way, it posts smaller deficits than the President proposes, it adheres to the pay-as-you-go principle, which is the rule of this House, contains no new mandatory spending that is not paid for, and it funds five program integrity initiatives to root out wasteful spending and fraud and tax evasion. 
   Within this framework, it does more for veterans health care, far more, more for children's health care, far  more, and more for education, lots more. 
   Here in a nutshell are the basics of the budget: This budget runs to surplus of $41 billion in the year 2012. Contrast that with the President's budget which is always in deficit. This budget not only abides by pay-as-you-go principles, it enhances them by establishing a new Senate PAYGO rule and calling for reinstatement of the statutory PAYGO rule as well. This budget does all of the above, I will say this emphatically one last time, does all of the above without raising taxes. 
   The tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 remain in full force and effect, unaffected in any way by this budget resolution. As enacted and originally written, most of these tax cuts expire on December 31, 2010, and that has nothing to do with our budget resolution. 
   But in our budget resolution, we identified all of the middle income tax cuts, many of which we supported at the time passed, and we made it the policy of our resolution to extend these tax cuts when they expire. 
   In this concurrent resolution, we go even further. We install a trigger that will facilitate the extension of these tax cuts so long as, number one, the House waives PAYGO; and, number two, the tax cuts extended do not exceed 80 percent of the surplus projected by OMB by the year 2012. 
   This concurrent resolution in other respects sets defense spending levels that the President requested. Why is spending so high? It contains $145 billion in supplemental expenditures. 
   And let me say one thing about the argument one of the leaders of the other party made on the House floor just a few minutes ago about the amount of debt that is being added to the national debt. What we are talking about is taking a big battleship and turning it around slowly. We have inherited the basics of this budget. Much of the spending that we are carrying forward was dictated over the last 6 years. The same for the revenue flow of the budget we are undertaking. It is going to take time to turn this big battleship around. But as we do, the best we can do is, number one, have a concurrent budget resolution with the binding effect of budget law for the first time in a long time; and, secondly, this concurrent resolution which will put us back on the path to a balanced budget. 
   For those for whom a balanced budget is something of a moral imperative because of the debt we are leaving our children, the right vote today, the only vote today is the vote for this budget resolution, and I commend it to every Member of this House, Democrat and Republican, and urge their support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, 
   I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and the five-year period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act. This status report is current through September 5, 2007. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current level of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues for the fiscal years 2007 and 2008, and the five-year period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 with the aggregate levels set by S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008. This, comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal years 2007 and 2008 because appropriations for those years have not yet been considered. 
   The second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for spending by each authorizing committee with the section 302(a) allocations made under S. Con. Res. 21 for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement section 311(c), which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311(a). 
   The third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 with the section 302(b) suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is also needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. 
   The fourth table gives the current level for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 of accounts identified for advance appropriations under Section 206 of S. Con. Res. 21. This list is needed to enforce the budget resolution, which prohibits advance appropriations that are: (i) not identified in the statement of managers or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, more than a year ago, in meetings with Chairman Peterson and the Ag Committee staff, the Budget Committee made it clear that the new farm bill had to stay within the CBO baseline for the current farm bill. Policies could be added or altered, but the aggregate cost could not exceed CBO's current baseline. We based that position on the so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' rule. Pay-as-you-go requires that any new legislation, in the form of mandatory spending, be fully offset, that it not exceed the current baseline. 
   In this instance, with the new farm bill, which about to come from conference, it appears that the farm bill will be complied with the fiscal year 2007 baseline but perhaps not fully complied with the fiscal year 2008 baseline. I have not seen the numbers yet. 
   CBO produces many baselines, and for a time the House PAYGO rule was ambiguous about the proper time for switching to a newer, updated baseline. Over time the House Budget Committee, in consultation with the Parliamentarian, came to an agreement to use longstanding scoring principles. These principles or guidelines allowed the Budget Committee discretion so that we could choose the appropriate baseline. This principle evolved over many years as a rule of practicality. It was founded on the rationale that we should not change the rules in the middle of the game or the middle of the legislative process or, in this case, in the middle of a complex conference. This rule was applied in 1996 to the farm bill passed then and again in 2002 to the farm bill which was passed then. Once again, the underlying idea is to avoid changing the rules in the middle of a contested process that is complex and protracted enough already. 
   The House PAYGO rule, the rule which we adopted in January of 2007, does set a limit to it. It does say that the latest baseline can and should be used until such time as the Budget Committee reports a budget resolution. The Senate has a different rule. The Senate PAYGO rule also sets a limit. It proposes that the last baseline be used until a conference report on the budget is adopted.     
   So there is a significant disagreement in the position between the two rules in the two bodies. As part of the resolution of all the differences in the conference, this too has to be resolved. 
   Much of the farm bill about to come before us was hammered out in 2007. The bill passed the House and passed the Senate and the conferees on all sides believed that the final package would emerge certainly no later than March of this year. The Budget Committee determined and informed the conferees that any farm bill would have to be scored against the FY07 baseline up until the Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. 
   The budget resolution was passed on March 7. Our committee staff informed the conferees that the baseline for measuring compliance with PAYGO would now be the fiscal year 08 baseline. In rendering that advice, we didn't resolve or really consider the pertinent problem. As I said earlier, the rules require that the conferees use the March 07 baseline until the Senate adopts the conference report on the budget for fiscal year 2009. This makes sense because then you will have something done definitively by concurrent budget resolution passed in both Houses. And the purpose of a conference is to resolve disagreements between the two Houses. 
   Here, we have such a disagreement, as I said earlier. Either we use the FY07 baseline or we use the FY08 baseline. We can't use base because there is a significant difference between the two. It seems fair and reasonable to me to use the FY07 baseline since so much of this conference agreement was written with the FY07 baseline as the yardstick, and to revert to FY08 would require more protracted negotiations and maybe no conference report at all. 
   I have to say to you I could argue you this either way. But I believe on balance that this is a good application, a proper allocation of the baseline rule, and certainly the rule of practicality in this instance.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, every year the Budget Committee has one all-important task, and that's to outline a budget for Congress to follow. Today, we do just that as we pass the conference agreement on the budget for fiscal 2009. The Senate passed the conference agreement just yesterday. 
   Passing a budget is never an easy task. This, in fact, will be the first time in 8 years that Congress has passed a concurrent budget resolution in an election year. Our conference agreement charts a new course. It returns the budget to balance reaching a surplus of $22 billion in the year 2012 and staying in surplus through 2013. Our budget adheres to pay-as-you-go  because we believe in it. It embraces middle-income tax cuts and holds non-defense domestic discretionary spending to an increase of about 1 percent over inflation.     
   Our budget begins by undoing the damages done by the President's budget to services that people depend upon. 
   Take Medicare and Medicaid, for example, pillars of medical care for millions of Americans. The President would cut Medicare by $479 billion over the next 10 years and Medicaid by $94 billion. We reject those cuts. We restore Medicare and Medicaid to current services, and we accommodate adding up to $50 billion more for the Children's Health Insurance Program, fully offset, to reach the millions of children who are eligible but not yet enrolled in CHIP. 
   The President proposes $18 billion in cuts over 5 years in new fees on military retirees and veterans, actually increases in fees of $18 billion. We reject those fees and add $3.7 billion above current services to the veterans' health care system. 
   The President even digs into education, cutting Function 500, education, training, employment and social services, not only next year but over the next 5 years by $32.7 billion. We reject the President's cuts in education and, in particular, his elimination of 47 educational programs. Instead, we make significant increases for education every year over the next 5 years. 
   Our budget supports not just investments in education as such, but in research and development and science and innovation, through NIH and NSF and other entities, providing substantially more than the President requested. 
   Finally, since strong countries are made up of strong communities, we believe that law enforcement grants and community development grants and transportation grants are part of the Federal role. We, therefore, reverse the President's deep cuts in the community development and social services block grants and in LIHEAP and law enforcement, and our budget invests in the Nation's infrastructure. 
   Because this budget upholds all of these priorities, it has drawn support from dozens of nonpartisan groups, from the AARP to the American Legion to the American Hospital Association. All of them and many more have sent us letters of support, and I encourage my colleagues to support it as well. 
   We face in this country not just this budget deficit, not just a trade deficit, but an energy deficit that is on the minds of us all. Read the President's budget, however, and you will find little that's new about skyrocketing energy costs, renewable energy, clean fuel technology, conservation, and efficiency. What you will find are heavy hits on LIHEAP, the one program that helps families weather the high price of fuel oil, heat their homes in winter and cool them in summer. Our budget restores LIHEAP to a level that's $3 billion above the President's budget. And for funding development of alternative fuels, renewable energies, and other energy initiatives, our budget provides $7.7 billion. 
   As I mentioned, this conference agreement extends tax cuts to help middle-income families caught in the current slump. For example, we protect 20 million middle-income households from being hit by the alternative minimum tax, 20 million Americans for whom it was never intended. We accommodate the extension of the middle-income tax cuts, the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent individual income tax bracket. 
   Our colleagues on the other side will claim, however, that this budget raises taxes. Let me say emphatically, this budget does not raise taxes. But don't take my word for it. Here's what outside experts say. 
   The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: ``The conference agreement does not raise taxes.'' 
   The Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institution: ``The budget would not raise taxes.'' 
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: ``This year's budget does not include a tax increase.'' 
   There is one other criticism our colleagues across the aisle may make but cannot sustain as to this conference agreement. In terms of national security, we provide the same dollars as the President's base budget requested, except that we call for better stewardship and better priorities, such as nonproliferation, supporting nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and materials, maybe the most menacing threat facing us. 
   If anything, our conference agreement protects the homeland and internal security more than the President's budget because we reverse his cuts in local law enforcement and firefighters and the Coast Guard and the first responders. Most important of all, we do everything that I have cited within the context of a balanced budget. 
   When President Bush took office in 2001 the budget was in surplus by $236 billion. His economists looked out over 10 years and saw nothing but surpluses, $5.6 trillion in all. President Bush told the country we could have it all, guns, butter and tax cuts, too, and never mind the deficit. Now, almost 8 years later, we see the disastrous consequences. Under the fiscal policies of this administration, the Bush administration, our national debt has mushroomed, increased from $5.7 trillion in 2001 to $10 trillion in 2009. 
   Since the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate and the White House during much of this time, they cannot escape responsibility for these abysmal fiscal results. 
   Faced with these grim facts, what does the President's budget propose for 2009? More of the same. He is still in effect saying that we can have the guns and the butter and the tax cuts, too, and that deficits don't really matter because foreign investors will keeping buying our Treasury bonds. 
   In contrast, the budget before us is a step in the right direction. It may not be the grand or final solution, but this budget moves us in the right direction, enforcing fiscal responsibility, though not to the exclusion of other values that we hold dear. 
   I urge support for this conference agreement by all Members of the House. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SPRATT. I yield myself 30 seconds before yielding to the gentleman from Texas. 
   Let me just make clear, this budget moves us to balance in 2012. And the fact of the matter is, the plain history of the matter is that when the Republicans took the White House in 2001, the budget the year before was $236 billion in surplus. By the year 2004, they had made that surplus advantage to where we had a deficit of $412 billion, a swing of $648 billion on their watch. They controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, they controlled the White House; and they've added $4 trillion to the national debt. 
   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's newfound concern for the budget deficit, but let me remind him from 2001 through 2007, his party controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House and accumulated a record debt and record deficits, and it takes a long time to turn this battleship around, but that's what we do in this budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and rise to support the resolution and to talk about something the President seldom mentions, the cost of the war in Iraq. In deciding what we should do, cost is not the determining factor, but it is considerable, and with costs overall approaching $500 billion, it has to be a factor. 
   During the first Persian Gulf War we had real allies, Britain, France, the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, and our gross cost was around $80 billion in current dollars. But Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States contributed in kind about $16 billion, and allies like Germany and Japan and Saudi Arabia contributed in cash around $60 billion, so the net cost to the United States was a mere $4 billion. 
   Because we had allies willing to share the burden, the cost of the first Gulf War was minimal. But in this war our President was able to enlist only one major ally, Great Britain, and he chose to go it alone with a motley coalition. That is one reason this war is proving more costly than the first, in lives and in dollars. 
   So far, over 3,100 service men and women have been killed in action; so far, over 23,000 have been wounded in action, many of them grievously; and so far, Congress has appropriated $379 billion for the war in Iraq. 
   As we speak, two supplemental appropriation bills are on deck. One is to cover operations in Iraq for the rest of fiscal 07, and it provides $100 billion to the $70 billion provided last year. The other supplemental is to cover operations in Iraq during fiscal 08, and it provides $145 billion. These bills, when passed, will push appropriations for the war in Iraq over $600 billion. $600 billion. When the 08 supplemental is added to the 08 base budget, these two will push appropriations for fiscal year 2008 alone to $643 billion. In constant dollars, that is more than we spent at the peak of Korea or Vietnam. 
   In a few weeks we will enter the fifth year of our engagement in Iraq. You would think after 5 years spending would come down. But spending over this time has not come down, it has gone up. Three years ago, 2004, the Pentagon was obligating money for Iraq at the rate of $4.8 billion a month. Today the Pentagon is obligating money for Iraq at the rate of $8.6 billion a month, and considering the supplemental for 07, with $170 billion, and the surge in Baghdad, the obligation rate will probably rise to $10 billion a month by the end of this year. 
   To support this surge, the President has called for five brigades, 21,500 additional troops. He sends a supplemental of $3.2 billion to pay for these troops. The CBO says, how about the support troops? How about the staff? This will cost billions more. 
   CBO has also looked out 10 years and tried to figure what future costs might be. By its estimation, future operations in Iraq and Afghanistan together could come to $824 billion between 2008 and 2017. Mind you, this assumes that the troops deployed in these theaters will be declining from a little over 200,000 today to a steady state of 75,000 in 2013. 
   If future costs are split 75-25, then over the next 10 years that is another $600 billion in store for us. Surely, surely at this juncture, as spending surges head upwards to more than $10 billion a month, surely we should ask whether we want to raise our commitment of troops and thrust them into a civil war with no clear exit, no timetable for completion, and, worse still, an urban war. 
   The Pentagon will say they can't see past 2008 and they don't know what the budget is for the outyears, and they will probably dispute this end state of 75,000 troops in the two theaters 10 years from now. And I hope they are right. 
   But there are other costs, the cost of ``reset,'' of refurbishing or repairing our equipment, which our commanders have told us could easily be $60 billion to $70 billion. And I haven't talked about the toll on our troops and their families, where some will soon be going for their third tour. The dwell time between tours is now 1 year instead of 2 years. 
   Whenever you go into the field to visit these troops, you have to be impressed with their attitude, with their readiness to serve and their willingness to sacrifice. I have always come away from these experiences saying thank God there are such Americans. They deserve our admiration and support, but they also deserve something else. They deserve not to be asked to do  what Iraqi troops and Iraqi police should do themselves. 
   For the past 2 years, the Bush administration has said to us just forebear, just wait, because we are training Iraqi forces, and as soon as these forces are stood up, ours can be stood down. Well, 118 Iraqi battalions have been stood up, and none of ours have been stood down. 
   In the Defense Authorization Act for 2006, Congress enacted this policy into law. We called for 2006 to be a year of transition. The resolution before us embodies that notion. The resolution heeds that advice. It does not call for pulling out our troops. It does not call for cutting off our funds. It says simply but solemnly that we disagree with the surge of our troops, thrust into what the Intelligence Estimate has called ``self-sustaining sectarian violence,'' especially when there are more than 118 Iraqi battalions trained to take on that task. 
   It is time for them to stand up and us to stand down, and Baghdad is a good place to start.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   If you listen to our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about ballistic missile defense, you'd never know that we have spent in today's money at least $125 billion since the days of Spartan and Sprint in the 1970s. This bill continues spending, continues that trend at a very robust level. 
   Sure, it does provide for cuts of $764 million, but it leaves in the bill $9.5 billion, and I would challenge the gentleman to find any other system in this bill which is funded at a level more robust than $9.5 billion. I don't think he will find it. 
   This bill provides, with the $9.5 billion, for the Patriot system, a PAC-3 system, a theater system, a tactical system, vitally important, provides $1.4 billion. That's $500 million more than the current year. It will buy Patriot PAC-3s for two additional battalions. 
   Aegis BMD, the Aegis cruiser, the adoption of the Aegis BMD by the Aegis cruiser, $1.1 million. That's an increase of $78 million over the current year over the budget request. 
   The ground-based midcourse interceptor, which shows the most near-term promise for becoming a truly ballistic missile defense intercept system,  $2.3 billion for the GMD. It will buy 10 GMD interceptors to be placed either at Ft. Greeley, Vandenberg or maybe in Europe. 
   The THAAD is finally achieving its promise. It's our best tactical theater system. The THAAD is funded at $858.2 million. That's enough to buy two additional THAAD firing units. 
   The kinetic energy interceptor, our boost phase system, is funded at $177 million. It's in its earliest phases, but it looks like the most promising technology for boost-phase intercept. 
   Multiple kill vehicles, yet they're cut by $42 million, but that leaves $223 million for a new technology. 
   Space tracking and surveillance, they're cut, cut by $75 million, but that's because we are going to launch two satellites and then see what they can do. And if they do what they're supposed to do, if they meet their specifications, we will launch about seven more, but we're not going to buy and launch those seven more until we know what the two demonstrate what they can achieve.     
   That's a sensible cut, as are all of these cuts. They are very discriminating cuts. The airborne laser is a good example. This system has been cut by $250 million to $300 million. That's enough money to maintain the system as a technology demonstrator, which is the likely course that this system is going to run anyway. 
   It has missed numerous milestones for development purposes. They are not throwing the system away. They are going to convert it from something that's likely to be put in the force in the near term to something that we can extract the technology from and then decide whether we want to go further with it. 
   But you have to ask yourself if this system, which is missing its milestones and looks like it cannot attain the promises that were initially made for it, is costing $500 million a year, shouldn't we consider some small cut in it in order to place the money elsewhere? 
   These are discriminating cuts. They leave the program robustly funded. This amendment should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, long past due, but a good bill in many respects, particularly in the application of this bill to the nonproliferation of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. 
   In the debates, Presidential debates, between President Bush and Senator Kerry, there was one subject on which both candidates found common ground: They both agreed that the gravest threat to the United States is terrorists armed with nuclear weapons or crude radiological weapons. That may be the gravest threat facing us, but you wouldn't know it from the application of resources in the Defense budget today. 
   The 9/11 Commission, looking at what we have done, gave us a ``D,'' a ``D,'' on efforts to restrict access to weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. There are tons of weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium scattered about the world. For example, under the Atoms for Peace program, enriched uranium was leased or lent to countries around the world to be used in their research programs. Much of that nuclear material, some of it fissile, is loosely secured, some by no more than a chain link fence and a junkyard. 
   Graham Allison, who was the dean at the Kennedy School at Harvard, wrote a book about this subject and entitled it ``Preventable Catastrophe'' as if to emphasize, on one hand, the dire threat and, on the other hand, the fact that we are not necessarily doomed to this fate. The first thing he recommended is, we have got to keep nuclear materials secure and away from the reach of terrorists and rogue states. 
   This bill assembles the best of various bills and amendments that we have debated in committee, sometimes on the floor and in conference, occasionally with success, more often than not for one reason because we haven't been able to get all of our members out of the Rules Committee. But here in a nutshell is what we would do: Set up a director for nonproliferation, we need somebody who can direct this effort, oversee it, seek the funding for it and fight for it; speed up the removal of nuclear research materials or, where they can't be removed, enhance their security; expand the so-called Proliferation Security Initiative, by which the United States can seize nuclear materials on the high seas outside the United States and coordinate such interdiction with other countries; and expand the so-called Cooperative Threat Reduction program, better known as Nunn-Lugar. In cost-benefit terms, this may be the best money we have spent.     
   To date, we have deactivated 6,000 warheads, 500 ICBMs, 400 ICBM silos.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement on H.R. 2669. I am proud to say that this is a reconciliation bill which originated with the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008. 
   This is also a happy occasion where good policy for education is also good for the budget's bottom line. This bill will reduce the budget deficit. That's right, it will reduce the budget deficit over 5 years by $750 million at the same time that it invests in human capital and makes colleges more affordable for millions of students. 
   I am proud to see this outcome, proud to have gotten the ball rolling in the Budget Committee to start the process, and I commend the chairman who has taken this bill from January to September, passing it step by step through the House, through the Senate, conferencing it, in no small part due to the reconciliation status it enjoyed in the Senate, and I hope that the whole House will note the support that it has gotten. This is a solid, substantive bill for college students. I hope the conference report will pass handily in both Chambers and I hope the President will take note and sign this bill into law.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement on H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I am proud to say that this is a reconciliation bill, which originated with the budget resolution for fiscal 2008. This is also a happy occasion where good policy is good for the budget's bottom line. This bill will reduce the budget deficit at the same time that it invests in human capital and helps make college more affordable for millions of students. 
   The conference agreement complies with our budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, which instructed the House Committee on Education and Labor to cut spending under its jurisdiction by $750 million by 2012. By passing this measure, the House maintains the tough pay-as-you-go rule and the rule barring reconciliation bills that increase the deficit, a rule the House instituted for the 110th Congress in January. These budget rules require Congress to make tough choices to meet priorities while restoring the budget to balance, and the House has insisted on enforcing these rules in every case. 
   This reconciliation bill is a stark contrast from those enacted by Republican-controlled Congresses. Every Republican reconciliation directive since 1994 has resulted in reconciliation packages consisting primarily of huge tax cuts that increased the deficit. In contrast, this reconciliation bill is better than budget-neutral; over fiscal years 2007 through 2012, it results in budgetary savings of $752 million. 
   In addition to making a net reduction in the deficit, this bill makes improvements in student loans and grants, paid for by cuts in subsidies to student loan lenders. It provides more than $20 billion in new resources to make college more affordable by lowering the cost of student loans or by increasing the grant available. For example, by 2012 the bill increases the maximum Pell grant to $5,400, a 33 percent increase over what the maximum grant was when the 110th Congress was sworn in. The bill also cuts by 50 percent the interest rate that students pay on subsidized student loans. 
   To offset the cost of these student benefits, the bill reduces subsidies that the government pays to banks. These reductions are similar to those in H.R. 5, which passed the House in January by a bipartisan vote of 356-71, and to the subsidy cuts in the President's 2008 budget proposal. 
   I commend the committee, and its able chairman, Mr. Miller, for moving this bill step by step from January to September, passing it in the House and conferencing it. I hope that this bill will pass handily in both bodies, and I hope that the President will take note, and sign this bill into law immediately.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, the Alternative Minimum Tax was not meant for middle-income Americans, and here in the House, we, as Democrats, have proposed and twice passed legislation that would prevent the AMT from coming down on 23 million taxpayers for whom it was never intended, without increasing the deficit. That's important to us as Democrats, which is why we believe in the Pay-Go principle. Last month, we passed a bill showing that you can patch the AMT, comply with Pay-Go, and not add to the deficit or to the tax burden of middle-income Americans. 
   We were not the only one proposing such a solution. In February 2006, the Director of OMB, Josh Bolten, testified that the Bush Administration believed the AMT ``can be corrected in the context of overall revenue neutral tax reform.'' In February 2007, OMB Director Rob Portman said: ``Our budget assumes that  we will have a revenue neutral correction to AMT.'' And in March 2007, Hank Paulson told us the same. 
   But what the Bush administration proposed, they have not supported. Their counterparts in Congress voted down in the Senate an AMT fix consistent with Pay-Go, and forced the issue before us, an AMT patch that works for one year, but adds $50 billion to the deficit. 
   We all agree that we must stop the AMT from coming down on 23 million middle-income taxpayers. That's why I and most of this House voted twice to fix the AMT the right way, the way the Bush administration once itself supported, with offsets that kept the fix from worsening the deficit. 
   As chairman of the Budget Committee, I proposed an alternative idea, consistent with Pay-Go. What I proposed was that we postpone designation of the offsets necessary to keep this bill deficit-neutral until such time as we dealt with extension of expired or expiring tax deductions, such as the research and experimentation tax credit. At that point, we would require that the offsets for this bill be passed before any such deductions, credits, exemptions, or preferences be extended. 
   This idea won support among many of my caucus, including our leadership, but in the end, not enough support to warrant its being offered. I regret that it was not, but I would remind everyone that this bill only buys one year of absolution. The same issue, the impact of the AMT on middle-income taxpayers, will have to be addressed again within months as we prepare and implement the budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. I hope we take a page from this year's experience and fix the AMT the right way next year, without impacting middle-income taxpayers, but also without impacting the deficit.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 6 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it bears remembering that 8 short years ago the budget of this government was $236 billion in surplus. Since 2001, we have experienced, on the watch of this administration, the largest deficits, nominal deficits, in American history, and an accumulation of debt that's enough to blow the mind. The debt of this country was $5.7 trillion when Mr. Bush came to office. When he leaves office, it will be $10 trillion. So that explains why we are skeptical, if you will, and even more skeptical and dubious when we look at the substitute resolution that has been brought to the floor, about which the leader barely spoke until he got to the very end of his presentation a few minutes ago. 
   To find the real numbers in this resolution, the leader said that this is addressed to deal with a spending problem, not a revenue problem. So as we look through the spending side of the resolution, we have to go all the way to an obscure account called function 920 Allowances to find where the real action is. 
   Now, this function is typically an allowance function where we have things we haven't decided how to assign yet and put into allowances because we know it is a catch-all account until some decision is made as to how to treat it. 
   Typically, therefore, you find smaller amounts in this account; but in this particular case, in this particular resolution, $817 billion in additional cuts are called for. 
   If you look at the Republican resolution, initially it seems to be providing current services for just about every function. But then you get to function 920 and you see that what has been provided is taken back. And when you ask where these cuts are distributed, who bears the brunt of $817 billion in cuts over a 5-year period of time, there is no real answer because they're unallocated. We've heard them say they've added a billion dollars to veterans health care; but once they begin allocating the $817 billion, that billion dollars is likely to be wiped out. 
   The same can happen to defense and nondefense programs. We can't say, because $817 billion is left unresolved tucked away in this account called function 920. This is the first black hole in this budget. 
   This budget then goes on. You can do a little arithmetic and figure out that $405 billion is assigned to cuts in domestic discretionary spending, $417 billion is assigned to mandatory cuts. Mandatory cuts are entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid; and if you look at the accounts here, you will find that basically it appears that the Ways and Means Committee is being directed to save $253 billion, is presumably out of Medicare; the Energy and Commerce Committee is being asked, told, directed to save that $116 billion out of Medicaid. These are not just small cuts, minor adjustments that you would normally find in function 920. These are emasculating cuts for programs that are critically important.  
   Then when we come to the reconciliation provisions, we find that the Republicans' substitute anticipates at least another $1.1 trillion in tax reduction. How that's allocated, we can't tell for sure; but the tax cuts have to be reconciled against the mandatory spending cuts. When you do that, what we find is the tax cuts equal $1.1 trillion; the mandatory spending cuts equal $412 as a $739 billion addition to the deficit. It worsens the deficit rather than improving the deficit. That's the second black hole in this particular budget. 
   Reconciliation actually works as a problem instead of improves it. We know that the other side intends to repeal the alternative minimum tax after 3 years. We know also that they intend to extend the tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003. The total of these would come to $2.5 trillion easily over a period of 5 to 10 years; and if that's the case, the third hole, the third hole that this resolution leaves is a big hole in the bottom of the budget. 
   So what we've got here is work that is not really a completed product. It is not a finished product because function 920 leaves $817 billion still to be distributed, still to be determined. By whom? Apparently by the appropriators or someone like this, but not today on the floor. When you vote for this today, it has tremendous consequences. 
   Let me just offer one illustration of what the consequence might be. 
   After the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, which are truly sizable, they are starkly large, there is a cut called for of $115 billion in savings by the Education and Labor Committee. Now, where would the Education and Labor Committee go to get such cuts? They would go to student loans. 
   We have just done something phenomenal. In last year's budget, we were able to make some rearrangements and reduce the interest rate over time and subsidize student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. A phenomenal accomplishment. This indicates that the reduction in interest would be abolished, reversed, as one way of achieving that direction to save $115 billion. 
   We just passed a College Cost Reduction and Access Act. One of the things it did would take Pell Grants up to $5,400 over time. That, too, would have to be repealed in order to meet $115 billion. 
   So watch out for the black holes. Watch out for the things that won't easily appear as you read the language here. If anyone votes for this, we are voting, in effect, in my opinion, to go back to where we were over the last 7 years in a period of endless deficits and mountainous debts. This is not the way to go. This is not good work. This is not a finished product, and we should not support this as an amendment to the base bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   We have heard throughout this debate the charge repeatedly that we are raising taxes by as much as any tax increase since the history of time. The charge won't really bear itself out. But let me just turn to third parties. Don't take it from me, let me turn to third parties who have a tremendous interest in the Federal budget and in the deficit in particular. None is more respected or more truly nonpartisan than the Concord Coalition, and here is what the Concord Coalition says: 
   ``Allowing some of the tax cuts to expire would not be the result of Congress' raising taxes. It would be the result of sunsets that were included when those tax cuts were originally enacted to avoid the level of fiscal scrutiny that PAYGO is designed to ensure.'' 
   Now, I have a chart here which is a replica of our famous eye chart to test your visual acuity. I am not sure whether you can see it, but the bottom line is instructive. We will reach surplus, starting from a CBO baseline, our budget will take us to surplus by the year 2012. That surplus will continue throughout time, 2012, 2013. And if you total that surplus up between 2012 and 2018, the total amount you get is $1.4 trillion. 
   Out of that $1.4 trillion in surpluses, a lot of money can be derived if we so choose to offset tax cuts. And toward that end, we have pledged ourselves as specifically and explicitly as we possibly can in the budget resolution before you in commitment to the middle-income tax relief. And anyone who has any doubt of this should come and read this paragraph in our budget resolution itself, not in the report, it is in the budget resolution itself, which says the following: 
   ``It is the policy of this resolution to minimize the fiscal burdens on middle-income families and children and grandchildren, to provide immediate relief for tens of millions of middle-income families who would otherwise be subject to the AMT, the alternative minimum tax,'' and, by the way, we provide a 1-year patch. Talk about tax cuts, we have got a tax cut, and it is offset in our bill. 
   To extend the child tax credit we commit ourselves; to extend the marriage penalty relief, we commit ourselves; to eliminate estate taxes on all but a small fraction of estates, we are committed to that; to extend the research and experimentation tax credit, we are committed to that; to extend the deduction for State and local sales taxes; to extend the deduction for small business expenses; to enact a tax credit for schools. 
   This resolution assumes that the cost of enacting these policies is offset by reforms within the Internal Revenue Code that promote a fairer distribution of taxes across families and generations and economic efficiency and higher rates of tax compliance. And we  put money in the bill for program integrity, for the IRS to bear down and try to close the tax gap. 
   When you take what we can reap from doing that, it may not be as great as it would seem since the tax gap is estimated to be $500 billion, when you add to that the $1.4 trillion in surpluses per our projection of our budget, you have a lot to work with, not just for tax relief, but for other things as well. Debt retirement, the retirement of the baby boomers, all of these things will be demanding. 
   That is why we put this decision off until a later time. It is not pressing now. It doesn't have to be committed to now. The tax cuts don't expire until December 31, 2010. In the interim, nobody's taxes are going up because of what is done here on the House floor today, and nobody's taxes are going down, because it doesn't work that way. 
   Over time, we think that we have got a partial solution here. If we can simply adhere to the budget that we are proposing in House Concurrent Resolution 312, we believe that we can produce surpluses along this bottom line, a substantial portion of which can be used to offset tax cuts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Mr RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to who has the right to close. There seems to be difficulties about that. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from South Carolina has the right to close. 
   Mr RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, for purpose of closing, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, like Mr. Ryan, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the staff on both sides: Tom Kahn, Sarah Abernathy, Ellen Balis, Arthur Burris, Linda Bywaters, Barbara Chow, Marsha Douglass, Stephen Elmore, Chuck Fant, Jason Freihage, Jose Guillen, Jennifer Hanson-Kilbride, Dick Magee, Sheila McDowell, Diana Meredith, Gail Millar, Morna Miller, Namrata Mujumdar, Kimberly Overbeek, Kitty Richards, Diane Rogers, Scott Russell, Marcus Stephens, Naomi Stern, Lisa Venus, Greg Waring, Andrea Weathers, and interns Les Braswell and Tina Shah. 
   We have had a fast track on which to bring this resolution out of committee onto the floor to passage. Without their assistance, long nights, weekends, you name it, we certainly could not have done it. We certainly could not have done it without the presentation we put on the last 2 days. To them, I am deeply indebted for all of their help, both sides of the aisle, my staff in particular, which I think is one of the best committee staffs of any committee on the Hill in either House. 
   If I had a chart of my choice, I would have a counterpart to Mr. Ryan's chart, which said, can we afford the Democrats' tax? It would say, can our children afford the Republicans' debt tax? Because the legacy of this administration, 8 years, is nearly $5 trillion in additional debt, a phenomenal increase in debt that will have to be borne by our children. 
   When I say that our first objective in taking on this budget was to move it to balance, that's not some economic goal. That's not some green eyeshade objective. That's because I think we are morally wrong in leaving this mountain of debt to our children and our grandchildren.     
   If I had a chart, it would say just that, because I would assign the blame, the primary blame, to our Republican colleagues for the last 7 years. 
   We have brought to this floor a budget resolution, the base bill on which we will vote. After we vote on the Ryan amendment, we will vote on the base bill. I would ask for a vote against the Ryan amendment and for the base bill, H. Con. Res. 312, which is the Democratic-reported budget resolution. 
   We set as our first objective balancing the budget within a reasonably foreseeable period of time. The day we chose was 2012, and we hit that day. In fact, by our calculations, using CBO numbers, we will have a surplus that year under certain assumptions of $178 billion. That surplus will grow as time moves on; and by the year 2018, we will have accumulated $1.4 billion in surpluses. Now, I know they will be dissipated and used for other purposes, but I am suggesting here and have been suggesting that is one of the ways that we will pay for the tax cuts, particularly the middle-income tax cuts to which we have explicitly committed ourselves. That is one way we will make certain that they are cared for and extended. 
   Secondly, even though we are committed to balancing the budget, we are also morally committed to doing other things that shouldn't be held up or put aside while we try to bring our books in order, one of which is the education of our children. The President's budget basically flat funds education for the next 5 years. 
   I am proud to say that our budget provides $7.3 billion, $7.1 billion more than the President requested in his budget for the education of our children. 
   And watch out for education when they begin to, if you adopt the Ryan resolution, when they begin to distribute these undistributed, unallocated cuts, because education is right there in the bore sights. 
   Secondly, veterans health care. Of all of the promises government makes, the promises we make to our veterans ought to be upheld. And right now we have an increasing caseload. Therefore, we are proposing $3.6 billion over and above current services in order to pay for the additional case loads. 
   CHIP, children's health insurance. I am proud to claim a little paternity there. I was involved in 1997 when we created the program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Now we are saying that we can balance our budget and still balance our priorities by seeing that our children, all of our children who don't have health insurance, can get health insurance. We provide for that. We provide for that in this budget resolution. 
   Finally, we provide for innovation, competitiveness, energy, research, things that will keep our economy on a competitive edge. For all of these reasons, we think we have brought to the  floor a good budget resolution which is worthy of the support of not just the Democrats on this side, but Republicans as well. It moves us toward balance, and it has balanced priorities. It is good for America and good for our economy. 
   I, therefore, request a vote in favor of the Spratt resolution, H. Con. Res. 312, which is the base bill and against the Ryan resolution which, if it were adopted, and I don't think it will be, but were it to be adopted, it would displace our bill. Vote for the base bill, H. Con. Res. 312, and vote to do these things that are so important to our economy, our country, our families, and our children. This is a good bill and I commend it to you for your support today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FY 2008 AND FY 2009 AND THE 5-YEAR PERIOD FY 2009 THROUGH FY 2013 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2009 through 2013. This report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act and sections 301 and 302 of S. Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature. 
   The first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues with the aggregate levels set by S. Con. Res. 70. This comparison is needed to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which establishes a point of order against any measure that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. 
   The second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for each authorizing committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations made under S. Con. Res. 70 for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and fiscal years 2009 through 2013. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which establishes a point of order against any measure that would breach the section 302(a) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure. 
   The third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 with the ``section 302(a)'' allocation of discretionary budget authority and outlays to the Appropriations Committee. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act, which establishes a point of order against any measure that would breach section 302(b) suballocations within the Appropriations Committee. 
   The fourth table gives the current level for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 302 of S. Con. Res. 70. This list is needed to enforce section 302 of the budget resolution, which establishes a point of order against appropriations bills that include advance appropriations that: (i) are not identified in the joint statement of managers; or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on March 13, we passed the budget resolution. It's a good resolution. It moves the budget to balance by the Year 2012 and, along the way, it accumulates less debt than the Bush budget. It limits spending to a reasonable level. 
   But I can truthfully say that this bill does more for education, more for the environment, more for energy, more for science and innovation than the President's budget or the Republicans' resolution. And also, critically important, it avoids the deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid that are provided for, called for in the President's budget. And it protects the middle income tax cuts; provides AMT relief for middle income families for whom it was never intended. 
   Therefore, we have the outline of a good budget for the coming fiscal year, and we need to pass it, send it to conference, bring the conference report back. We have an excellent chance, I think, of passing the first conference report, back to back, since the year 2000. 
   What my friends on the other side of the aisle have introduced is, to my way of thinking, a distraction, a red herring. ANWR is never mentioned in our resolution. And to my recollection it was not mentioned in your resolution. So the topic here is wholly out of the scope of the resolution on either side, particularly ours, and wholly outside the jurisdiction of our committee. We don't assume ANWR revenues, we don't preclude ANWR revenues because we don't have the authority to prescribe that. 
   The most we can provide for in a budget resolution is a certain revenue floor, a certain amount of revenues be collected over the year to be applied against the expenditures that we broadly distribute in something called the 302(a) section of our bill and the 302(b), providing for 302(b) allocations. 
   So this budget resolution, this resolution to instruct, motion to instruct conferees, goes off on a tack that is totally different from what the resolution's all about, what the committee's jurisdiction is. If you want to debate this, there's another forum for debating it. There's another committee, the Resources Committee. 
   We don't have the authority to do what you would call upon us to do. We don't take a position for ANWR or against ANWR in the budget resolution because it's not the place for that kind of policy resolution. There are other places here for that to be established. 
   So we've got a good budget resolution. We do not need this resolution, this motion to instruct conferees, to do anything towards balancing the budget. You've got a very nominal sum of money in here when it comes to a 5-year period of time. 
   And one question I would leave with you, is you call for an increase in negative budget authority and outlays. If I didn't know what that meant, I wouldn't know what it meant when I first saw it on the printed page here. But I would take it that not only does oil revenues fall under this rubric, but so would forest products, national parks and things of that nature. 
   So it's not clear exactly what you're calling for here. I can only say it's a distraction. It's a red herring, it's not needed, and it does not really belong in the budget resolution process. 
   I retain the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, let me say again, but say more emphatically, what I said at the outset, and that is that ANWR is never mentioned, never mentioned in the budget resolution, never mentioned in the report that accompanies the resolution. So it's wholly out of scope; it has nothing to do with the budget resolution before us, And it's also outside the jurisdiction of our Budget Committee. The jurisdiction over this drilling in Alaska, or wherever in the continental United States, belongs to the Resources Committee, not to the Budget Committee. So if you want to do what they're proposing to do here, you're in the wrong place before the wrong committee with the wrong proposal. 
   Revenues from ANWR are not provided for in this budget resolution, they're not precluded in this resolution. The Budget Committee does not have the jurisdiction, as my good friend, Mr. Ryan, knows to tell the Ways and Means Committee or any other committee that has the power to produce revenues exactly how to do it. We simply tell them how much, not by what policy. We don't make policy prescriptions as to revenues in our committee. We simply tell the Budget Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, or the other committees that have the capacity to raise revenues or offsetting receipts, or what we have here called negative budget authority. 
   In addition, if you read the cryptic language of this resolution, you will find it doesn't mention oil, or ANWR either, anywhere in it. You have to make some mighty extrapolations to get to the conclusion that this is talking about ANWR drilling and ANWR oil. It simply says we should issue instructions to increase negative budget authority, which could apply, in my estimation, to selling parkland, selling other assets of the United States which would be negative budget authority just like the revenues coming from a lease for drilling in ANWR. 
   In any event, this is a red herring when it comes to the resolution before us. It has nothing to do with our budget resolution. Our budget resolution should be looked upon on its own four legs, and let it stand or fall on those merits. I think we've got a budget resolution. 
   As I also said at the outset, we come to balance by the year 2012. And along the way we accumulate less debt than the President's budget. We limit spending in a reasonable fashion, but we provide more for education, more for the environment, more for energy, more for science and innovation than the President's budget. We protect the income tax cuts for middle-income Americans, we provide tax relief from the AMT for middle-income Americans, for whom it was never intended. 
   This is a good budget outline for our country and will move us over time, if we adhere to it--and we do adhere to the PAYGO rule throughout the resolution--if we further adhere to it, it will move us to a balanced budget within the foreseeable future. 
   Therefore, we do not have to vote for this motion to instruct conferees. It's not necessary. We need to go to conference and come back next week with a conference report that we can put to work so the House can get on with its business. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (AUTHORIZING FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL ADVOCACY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for H.R. 6083. This bill authorizes funding for a national training program, which is focused on State and local prosecutors. The funding this bill authorizes will be an important step toward ensuring that State and local prosecutors from across the country can have the training they need to be skilled, effective, and more professional prosecutors. 
   Originally, H.R. 6083 would have authorized $6.5 million per year for 5 years to fund the Ernest F. Hollings National Advocacy Center, the NAC. The NAC is a joint venture of the Department of Justice and the National District Attorneys Association, which is located on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina. 
   The NAC is a unique facility created specifically to train Federal, State, and local prosecutors in advocacy skills and management. Since 1997, 22,000 prosecutors from across the country have benefited from this program, which makes it a vital resource for the professional education of our State and local prosecutors. The classes and other programs at the NAC strengthen a prosecutor's advocacy skills by offering a wide range of specialized subjects, ranging from child abuse to gang crime to cyber crime and identity theft. 
   Over the years, operations at the NAC have relied mostly on congressionally directed appropriations. Recognizing the value of a national advocacy center, Congress has consistently seen to it that this support is available to NDAA for services at the NAC. But this year-by-year funding has led to uncertainty in the budgeting and operations of the center, and a cut in funding in recent years, or at least the threat of it, has put this program in doubt. Classes have been canceled, educators have been laid off, all of which is evidence of the impact that unstable funding has had on the programs and, indeed, the NAC's ability to continue fulfilling its mission. 
   I intended H.R. 6083, as originally written, to be a step away from this perennial end-of-year funding crisis. I wanted to ensure also that State and local prosecutors nationwide could receive the training they need through a broad curriculum. However, with my concurrence, during the markup of H.R. 6083, the bill was amended. In its current form, the bill creates a grant program for comprehensive training, for which national nonprofit organizations, like the National District Attorneys Association, can compete. 
   In addition, the authorization has been lowered from $6.5 million to $4.75 million per year over a period of 5 years. This was done in response to suggestions from Members of the Senate that it would increase the bill's likelihood of being accepted unanimously there. 
   This bill enjoys broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. Cosponsors on the bill come from all parts of the country: California, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and of course, South Carolina. It also has the emphatic support of the National District Attorneys Association. 
   I want to express my great appreciation to the committee chairman, Mr. Conyers; to the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Scott; and to the Judiciary Committee staff, particularly Mario Dispenza, for working with dispatch and great diligence so that H.R. 6083 could be reported out of committee and placed on the suspension calendar. 
   Once again, I urge all my colleagues' support for training our State and local prosecutors, making them more professional. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6083. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. SPRATT. I thank the gentlelady for the generous grant of time and I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of the America's Historical and National Legacy Study Act. 
   This bill authorizes studies into the suitability of 10 sites as candidates for the National Park System. It is the first step towards preserving some of our most important historical sights and some of our most precious national resources, many of which are vulnerable to development unless we act, and act now. One of the 10 sites is located in the heart of my district, the Battle of Camden. 
   I introduced the Battle of Camden Study Act in the 108th Congress, and I am thankful that Congress is now finally considering it as part of this National Legacy Study Act. This site has been a national historic landmark since 1962, but it does not enjoy the support and protection offered by being an official unit of the National Park System. 
   The Battle of Camden was fought on August 16, 1780, and was a crushing defeat for American patriot forces. Indeed, some regard it as the high watermark of British supremacy in the Southern colonies. So it's fair to ask, if this battle was such a crushing defeat for the American patriots, why should we commemorate it at all? 
   Well, to start with, this battle was lost by General Horatio Gates. The hero of Saratoga was a political favorite in the Continental Congress, and after the fall of Charleston, the Congress sent him south to command what remained of our forces. Congress appointed Gates without consulting Washington, who would have sent Nathaniel Greene.  
   Gates came and drove his ill-provisioned troops into battle even after discovering that Cornwallis had reinforced his ranks the day before with fresh troops from Charleston. The result was a rout, a disaster, and a retreat to Charlotte led by Gates himself. 
   For its part, the Congress learned from this bitter experience its proper role in assigning general officers, and years later that principle was built into the Constitution. In replacing Gates after the Battle of Camden, Congress deferred to Washington and Washington dispatched Greene to the Carolinas. 
   With Charleston and then Camden subdued, Cornwallis began a drive north to mop up resistance with Major Ferguson on the west side of the Broad River and General Cornwallis on the east. 
   The Battle of Camden left new doubts about local militia, and how reliable or effective they could be, other than to harass British troops. But as Cornwallis' forces moved through the upcountry, they learned the Carolina patriot militia could not be taken lightly. 
   As Ferguson made his way through the foothills of the Blue Ridge, he threatened to apply ``fire and steel'' to anyone who refused allegiance to the crown. Settlers from over the mountain got the message. More than a thousand mustered at Sycamore Shoals for a fight with Ferguson. On October 7, 1780, they found Ferguson encamped on the top of Kings Mountain; and after settling on tactics, they attacked systematically. In less than an hour, Ferguson was dead, and hundreds of his troops were also dead, wounded or taken prisoner. 
   Kings Mountain is widely regarded as the turning point of the Revolution in the South, but we cannot fully appreciate its significance unless we understand its context, the Battles of Camden and Charleston. 
   Three months later, Morgan would meet Tarleton at Hannah's Cowpens, just 15 miles from Kings Mountain. Tarleton's defeat at Cowpens and Cornwallis' pursuit of Morgan into Virginia would eventually lead Cornwallis to Yorktown in total defeat. 
   The Revolutionary War was a very near thing which could easily have gone either way, and that's why the Battle of Camden is so essential to understanding the Revolutionary War. The Continentals and the patriots may have lost that battle, but they learned from bitter experience and came back to fight and win another day. 
   I thank the committee, in particular Chairmen Rahall and Grijalva, Ms. Bordallo, and my good colleague from South Carolina, HENRY BROWN, for including the Battle of Camden in your bill; and I encourage every Member to vote for the adoption of this fine piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. CON RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, this rule simply makes in order a motion to go to conference on the House and Senate budget resolution. That's all it does. 
   The budget resolution, in turn, frames all that we will do in fiscal year 2008, next year; and it helps keep the process fiscally disciplined as we move forward. Usually, this procedure is accompanied by, expedited by, unanimous consent. In this case, we couldn't be assured of unanimous consent, so we are, instead, moving forward with the rule. 
   Now, naturally, we in the House think that the House-passed budget is a better expression of our goals. But both resolutions to be resolved in conference, both are Democratic products, and we think both are vastly better, far better budgets than the Republicans offered this year or last year, for that matter. It's a matter of record. Last year the Republicans failed to pass a concurrent budget resolution. They couldn't get the two Houses together. 
   When we came back here in November, we had to finish up the unfinished work. Only 2 of 11 appropriations bills were passed, partly because they didn't have the framework of a budget resolution in which to proceed. 
   Just weeks ago, we had the Republican budget on the House floor. It fell 60 votes short of a majority, way behind. So unless we do what we are doing today, we are going to find ourselves shortly in the same situation we were last fall when the work was undone at the end of the year. 
   Both budgets, both the House and the Senate budgets, have this goal. Both budgets are designed to bring the budget back to balance by the year 2012. The House resolution carries forward, I'm proud to say, carries forward our commitment to pay-as-you-go. And the Senate resolution includes a pay-as-you-go rule of its own. 
   There are a number of initiatives, it's true, in this bill. A number of new initiatives. One is the Children's Health Insurance Initiative, but none of these initiatives, including CHIP, will be undertaken, none of them will be undertaken unless there are offsetting revenues or offsetting expenses to make them budget neutral so they do not have any impact on the bottom line. 
   This budget resolution and the Senate resolution both contain program integrity measures requested by the President, augmented by us in our budget resolution to crack down on wasteful spending. We're proud of that. We want to see that money appropriated. We want to see some that could be saved on wasteful sending. 
   Both budgets, and let me emphasize this, both budgets support middle-income tax relief. We'll say it again and again and again. It bears repeating because it's absolutely true. 
   The House budget resolution sites in its text income tax cuts that were passed in 2001 and 2003, and it supports, not in one place, but two, wholesomely supports the extension and renewal of those tax cuts past 2010, when they will all expire. 
   Now, let me make something clear. This budget resolution for the next 4 years does not take a thing away from any taxpayer. The tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 remain unaffected, remain standing and in place. 
   In addition, let me make clear that when the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 expire at the end of 2010, it's by design. That's the way you wrote the resolution. That's the way you wrote the bill that passed it. And we do not propose anything here in this bill about not renewing those tax cuts when they come up. We simply say that's a bridge we will cross when we get to it. 
   But in the Senate, Senator Baucus has offered an amendment that will require a vote before the year 2010 to renew those middle-income tax cuts that sunset in the year 2010. The Baucus amendment limits these tax cuts to $180 billion in annual revenue reduction, the amount of the surplus that is anticipated in 2012 in the budget resolution.     
   In the meantime, let me say again, all the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 were provided for, allowed and in place under this budget resolution. It is completely specious to say that we have raised taxes by one dime. Completely specious. 
   If you don't believe, let me say once again or let me show you in writing what Mr. McGovern just introduced. Here is the Concord Coalition. Nobody would dispute their bona fides or their unpartisan character. Here is how they sum up their analysis of our budget resolution: ``Thus to be clear, the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' That is the Concord Coalition.  
   Next is the Brookings Institution, Hamilton Project: ``This budget would not raise taxes.'' An independent group, no axes to grind. That is their opinion. 
   And, finally, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: ``This claim is incorrect. The House plan does not include a single tax increase.'' 
   Those are three outside organizations with no axes to grind. They looked at our resolution. That is the judgment they rendered on it. 
   Now, let me move on to say that both the House and Senate budget resolutions meet the President's request for national defense. They protect our country, and they exceed the President's request for veterans' health care. Funding for veterans' health care in our resolution is 6 billion bucks, $6 billion, above the 2007 level and more than $3 billion above the President's request. 
   Both budgets are also designed to reduce the deficit and bring the budget back to balance, as I said earlier. That will decrease our reliance on foreigners who buy our debt. Since 2001, foreign ownership of Treasury bonds has more than doubled to $2.2 trillion, making our economy vulnerable to global markets and the whims of foreign investors. 
   If I could see this chart next to show you the total debt accumulation under this administration. On the back of an envelope, this shows you what we are about, what we want to avoid. When this administration came to office, the national debt was $5.7 trillion. In the last 6 years, they have added 60 percent to that sum, $3.1 trillion in additional debt. And as a consequence, the national debt stands at $8.8 trillion. This is what Republicans have produced. This isn't about claiming or argumentation or anything else. This is a matter of record. You can look it up, from $5.7 to $8.8 trillion. 
   Finally, this budget resolution maintains the priorities that we Democrats stand for and are proud of. We put families first. We put children first by investing in health care; child care; education; Head Start; and as I said earlier, tax relief to middle-income families. Both budgets, both budgets, plan huge steps, and this is one of the great initiatives we hope to achieve in this Congress, huge steps to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program so that it covers most of the 9 million children without health insurance in this country, and we propose to do that with offsets so that there will not be a dime of the cost of that added to the bottom line. 
   In summary, Mr. Speaker, in short, this rule will make in order the steps necessary to send our budget resolution to conference so that they can move us forward on a fiscally responsible, fiscally disciplined path. 
   I urge support for this resolution so that we can move forward with the budget process.

   Mr. SPRATT. I would say to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, and I mean that compliment, I return the compliment, that I nevertheless vigorously disagree with some of the points you just made. 
   Facts are stubborn things, and the fact of the matter is that during the Clinton years, on average 237,000 jobs were created every month over an 8-year period of time. The Bush record is half that amount, if that. During the past month, you're leading with your left making that point at this point in time because during the past month job growth was just 88,000 jobs. 
   Secondly, with respect to Medicare, we know that Medicare has to be dealt with, but you know as well as I that this is not the forum. We need a much bigger group. We need the administration involved in the process. It is a very difficult undertaking to make the systemic changes that are necessary. And before we commence those negotiations, we need to do what President Clinton required in 1997, everybody needs to put some ante on the table. Everybody's got to have some skin in this game to be a player in this process of trying to diminish the cost of the health care entitlements to the United States. It has to be done, but this is not the correct forum for doing it. 
   The gentleman's budget resolution, I believe, cuts Medicare by $250 billion.

   Mr. SPRATT. If I could reclaim my time, it takes a bigger forum than the Budget Committee provides. It takes more participants than just the Congress. Everybody has got to be a player in this game to make it happen in a significant way because it has got to involve, as you and I know, systemic change. No question about it. 
   And, finally, PAYGO. We are proud of the fact that we adopted the PAYGO rule in 1991, and it contributed significantly to the fact that over a period of 8 years during the Clinton administration the bottom line of the budget got better every year for 8 straight years to the point where we had a surplus of $236 billion under the Clinton administration resulting in part from the Balanced Budget Act of 1993 and 1997. $236 billion we handed over to President Bush. By the year 2004, between 2001 and 2004, we went from a surplus of $236 billion to a deficit of $412 billion. That happened on your watch. The Republicans controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, they controlled the White House. There is no way you can escape responsibility for what happened in those circumstances.

   Mr. SPRATT. PAYGO is never applied to discretionary spending. It would be very difficult at this time to do it when every year we have an end run around discretionary budget with the President's supplementals for Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be very difficult to cap discretionary. 
   Your party, on its watch, allowed PAYGO discretionary spending caps, all of those constraints in 1990, to expire and did not renew them. The main reason you didn't was you knew if we had a double-edge PAYGO applicable to tax cuts as well as mandatory increases, you would be unable to pass additional tax cuts as part of your agenda.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, three times in recent months, officials of the Bush administration have come before our committee, and when asked about the AMT and its impact on middle-income Americans, for whom it was never intended, they have insisted that they could fix the AMT with changes in the tax code, such that there would be no change in revenues. 
   In February 2006, Josh Bolten was the Director of OMB. He told the Budget Committee that the AMT could be ``corrected in the context of overall revenue-neutral tax reform.'' 
   In February 2007, Rob Portman was the Director of OMB. He told the Budget Committee that ``our budget assumes that we will have a revenue-neutral correction to the AMT.'' 
   Rob Portman was followed by Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and he said essentially the same thing. 
   The difference between these officials and Chairman Rangel is that Charlie Rangel has delivered. Mr. Rangel has put a revenue-neutral bill on the table, and to boot, extended a few popular tax concessions about to expire, such as the R & E tax credit, while adding few new ones, such as the exclusion of gains on the foreclosure of taxpayers' homes. 
   Mr. Rangel and his committee deserve credit for bringing this bill to the floor, and for preventing the AMT from coming down on 23 million taxpayers, mostly middle-income; and they 
   deserve credit also for sticking to the pay-go principles that we have steadfastly applied for the last 9 to 10 months. 
   Our Republican colleagues ask why we have to fix the AMT in way that is compliant with our pay-go rule. If you really need an answer to that question, consider these facts: The Bush administration inherited a $236 billion surplus and by the year 2004, turned it into a $413 billion deficit. As a result, the national debt of the United States reached $9 trillion last week. $3.2 trillion of that debt has been incurred on the watch of this administration, and by the time it leaves office, the total debt accumulated will hit $4 trillion. 
   That's why we apply pay-go and require offsets: it's one way to slow down the build-up of debt while working off enormous deficits. 
   So, this bill is fiscally responsible, and fair for two reasons: it brings tax relief to middle-income Americans, and it does not pass the tab on to our children and grandchildren as a mountain of debt. 
   So, vote responsibly. Vote Rangel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 9 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, H. Con. Res. 99 is not the full and final solution, but it is a good solution. It moves us in the right direction towards a balanced budget. It moves us to balance in 5 years, as a matter of fact, by 2012. It posts a smaller deficit than the President's budget over 5 years. It adheres to PAYGO, and it contains no new mandatory spending that is not fully offset. 
   It also includes program integrity initiatives to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the Department of Health and Human Services and in the reporting of taxes in the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have listened to this resolution described both in our markup in committee and today during the debate on the rule. I think you have to bear in mind what our critics have said, in terms of where the criticism is coming from, because the party that is opposing this resolution and criticizing this resolution is the same party that took a surplus of $5.6 trillion between 2002 and 2011 and turned it into a deficit of $2.8 trillion during this same period of time. 
   As a consequence, we have heard a lot of talk out here today, but the truth of the matter is, with respect to taxes, their bill imposes on future generations, our children and grandchildren, an unerasable tax called a debt tax, because they will be servicing the debt of the United States for years to come. 
   Let me show you just a few charts to illustrate what I mean. 
   First of all, the chart showing the debt of the United States that has increased since 2001 when Mr. Bush took office. This is a simple chart, but it contains an enormous amount of truth. 
   When Mr. Bush took office in 2001, he came to office with an advantage that few American presidents have ever enjoyed, a budget in balance, in surplus by $236 billion the year before. Within 4 years, he had driven that surplus of $236 billion into a deficit of $418 billion; and, as a consequence, the debt when he took office, which was $5.7 trillion, today is $8.8 trillion, having increased $3.1 trillion over the last 6 years. 
   We have never seen a debt accumulation like this, certainly during any normal period of time. Except for the Depression or Second World War, we have never seen, except for those periods, any kind of accumulation of debt that approaches this. And if we continue on this path, if we continue on this path, then we will see the debt, by the time Mr. Bush leaves his presidency, at $9.6 trillion, as opposed to $5.7 trillion when he came to office. 
   Net interest on the national debt is today $170 billion. That is the debt tax I am talking about. This is the debt service that our children and their children will have to pay for years to come. It is a debt tax that is indelible, almost permanent, unless we can do something to turn this budget around and start reducing our debt, instead of accumulating mountainous debt year in and year out. 
   The budget that we bring to the floor today fully funds the President's defense request, and we husband what little is left over for some centerpiece initiatives which we strongly support as Democrats. 
   First of all, we created in 1997 a Children's Health Insurance Program. The authorization for it runs out this year. We would propose in our budget resolution to reauthorize the CHIP program, Children's Health Insurance, and add $50 billion to the program so we cover most of the children who are eligible for coverage in the United States. 
   The second point: With respect to education, we think the education of our children, of today's workforce, is critically important as never before in American history; and we think it would be shameful to cut back for education. But for 3 straight years President Bush has sent us a budget that would cut the Department of Education, this year by $1.5 billion. 
   If you take Function 500, which includes elementary and secondary education and student loans and workforce investment and Trade Adjustment Assistance Training, the Bush administration requests $3.6 billion next year  less than this year; and in 2012 the request is $8.6 billion below current services. That is for training our workforce. That is what this administration is willing to invest in the education of our children. 
   We feel differently, and strongly differently, and we provide $8 billion to $9 billion more than the President and, over 5 years, $46 billion more than the President provides for education and job training and related activities. 
   We also call for a long-term fix in the Alternative Minimum Tax. The President has told us twice that they can take the Alternative Minimum Tax and, within the context of the Tax Code in a revenue-neutral manner, change the Alternative Minimum Tax so that it will not extend to middle-income families for whom it was never intended. They have told us that, but they are yet to do that. 
   We are saying in this budget resolution to the Ways and Means Committee, given its jurisdiction over taxes, and to the administration, we need to fix the AMT. 
   You will hear, as you have heard earlier today, a lot of talk about this being the biggest tax increase in American history, which is absolutely absurd. The Democratic budget resolution which I am presenting right now, introducing, which we will discuss tonight, does not raise taxes, period. The budget resolution that we bring to the floor tonight in no way affects the tax cuts that were passed in 2001 and in 2003. It leaves those tax cuts in place for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. 
   What we do assume is the same revenues that CBO projects in its current baseline. If you look at the CBO baseline and the OMB baselines, you will find they virtually converge. There is about a 1.2 percent difference between the two of them, as this chart right here will easily show you. 
   All this palaver about taxes and the biggest tax increase in history, this is the difference between our revenue projections, the green bar, and theirs, which is blue, 1.2 percent over a 5-year period of time. 
   Looking at this budget in its whole context, three outside groups which are vigilant overseers and advocates for good, sound fiscal policy, the Concord Coalition has said, ``Thus, to be clear,'' this is how they sum up their letter, ``this budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' As plain as you can put it, from a group that is truly disinterested and independent politically. 
   Then we have got the Brookings Institution, the Hamilton Project. ``This budget would not raise taxes.'' ``This budget would not raise taxes.'' 
   Finally, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, they took a look at our budget and they said, ``This claim is just flat incorrect. The House plan does not include a tax increase.'' 
   What the House plan does do is allow the tax cuts that were passed in 2001 and 2003 to follow their course. They will expire on December 31, 2010. Not because of this budget resolution. It doesn't have a thing to do with the expiration or extension of those tax cuts. But, in 2010, those tax cuts expire of their own volition, because they were so drawn, designed, intended by those on this side of the aisle, the Republicans. They were designed to expire on December 31, 2010. 
   What we are simply assuming in this budget resolution is that that decision will be taken when we reach it. When we have to cross that bridge, we will cross that bridge. We will know then what our deficit is in 2010. We hope we will have a surplus by that point in time; and if we have a surplus, we will know whether or not we can offset it against the extension of some of these tax cuts. 
   I will say this and will say it repeatedly: Read this budget resolution. Give us a fair shake. And you will find in two different places prominently inserted, this resolution says we endorse, we support, and we will seek the renewal of the middle-income tax cuts that have been passed since 2001 and 2003, the marital tax penalty, the child tax credit, the 10 percent bracket, State tax reform. All of these things we embrace and we pledge ourselves to the extension to see when they expire, as they will, they will be duly renewed. 
   We will have this debate continually throughout the night. It will be brought up again and again and again. But I want to say one final thing: This budget resolution does not raise taxes, and it does not cause the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. They expire of their own volition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, before yielding to the gentleman from Texas, I yield myself 1 minute to reply.  
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman will acknowledge that they have requested in their budget resolution $278 billion in reconciled tax cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, student loans and a number of different areas. He is faulting us for not joining in this endeavor. That is partly because, number one, we don't agree with his specific cuts. But number two, having so-called saved $278 billion, there is then enacted by reconciliation directive to the Ways and Means Committee $447 billion in tax cuts. 
   So the net effect is not to use entitlement cuts for reform, but to actually add to the deficit $168.5 billion. 
   Mr. Chairman, I now yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.

   Mr. SPRATT. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   While the gentleman was on his extended sabbatical back in California, he missed the heyday of our experience here under the Clinton administration and seems not to know that during those years the average job creation was 237,000 jobs per month. By comparison or by contrast, for the Bush administration comparable figures are 68,000 jobs per month. 
   Now, you can fudge that number by starting to count in August of 2004, claiming that it doesn't apply until then. But if you go back to January of 2001, the average per monthly increase for the Bush administration is 68,000 versus the Clinton administration which was 237,000. 
   Furthermore, the Clinton administration every year had a better bottom line in the budget. Every year, the deficit got smaller and smaller, to the point where, in 1997, we had a surplus for the first time in 1998 in 30 years; and in 2000 we had a surplus of $236 billion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, before yielding to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) let me just say once again that this budget resolution leaves in place all of the tax cuts implemented in 2001 and 2003. Had we wished, we could have repealed those tax cuts. It leaves them in place in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The year 2010, December 31, those tax cuts expire their provisions, because they were written and designed to expire by the other side, by the Republicans. That is what happened to them. 
   This present resolution does not trigger their re-elimination, it doesn't trigger their determination. It doesn't decide either way. By its open volition, by its own terms, these tax cuts will expire on that very day unless they are renewed. 
   For the purpose of renewal at that point in time, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we will have a surplus of $450 billion, and those surpluses, over time, according to our projection, according to this budget resolution, will build to $1 trillion. If we so choose then, depending on the situation, we can so choose, then, to apply these to all or some of the renewable tax cuts. But that decision can be reached and made then better than it can be now. In the meantime, the tax cuts stand for the next 4 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thought I had seen it all, until I just saw the cartoon. What we have seen tonight is a sort of unrelenting attack for 3 hours on a straw man, a demonized version of this particular budget resolution. Because if you read it, you read it in vain in search of any particular language or place where these tax cuts are terminated or extended. That decision, as we have said, has been left open until a better time when we know better where we stand. 
   If we had wanted, if we had wished, we could have repealed all of the deductions, credits and exemptions passed in 2001 and 2003. We did not do that. They remain in effect this year, next year, 2009, 2010. Then they expire on December 31, 2010, because that is the way they wrote them to expire, in order to diminish the size of the tax cuts somewhat and shoehorn them into the budget situation, which would only provide for so much tax expenditure reduction. 
   I have also heard it said out here something about defense spending. Let me mention to you one little anomaly we haven't brought up tonight. But in order for the other side to say they are spending more than us on defense, I guess, I surmise, they have added $38 billion to budget authority, BA, for national defense. But, at the same time, they have taken $60 billion out of the outlay stream. That is the real money that is outlaid, that is spent by the Pentagon. 
   So they have taken $60 billion away from our troops in the field by their assumption about outlays, if it were efficacious; and, in fact, it is not efficacious. You can't control outlays. So they have an anomaly like that in the middle of the budget. 
   So I don't think it behooves them to criticize our budget resolution or to make it something that it isn't, because they have got things there in their own budget resolution that won't bear scrutiny and require explanation. 
   But the tax cut, let's get down to the bottom line, this budget resolution does not raise taxes. It allows all of the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 to remain in place until they expire December 31, 2010, and leaves for then the decision as to what to do about their renewal.

   Mr. SPRATT. Before yielding to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), let me read from three letters we received in our committee. One is from the American Legion with respect to our support for veterans' health care. 
   ``The American Legion and its 2.8 million members applaud the Budget Committee,'' that's us, Democrats, ``for the budget resolution recommendation of $43.1 billion in funding for veterans' health care. That is our recommendation.'' That is the American Legion speaking. 
   The DAV says, ``The budget recommendation coming out of the House will make a real difference in the lives of America's sick and disabled veterans. This is important if our Nation is at war.'' 
   And the Veterans of Foreign War, the VFW says, ``The members of the VFW stand firmly behind you in support of your strong advocacy for this Nation's veterans.'' These letter go on and on and on. We had a press conference yesterday where they endorsed our budget resolution because of what we provide for veterans' health care, the biggest increase in veterans' health care funding in the history of the organization.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have been treated to a show tonight featuring a one-trick pony. Every Republican who has come to the well of this Chamber has come with the same mantra, the same slogan, alleging wrongfully that our budget resolution would raise taxes. We have repeatedly explained why, only to have them keep coming to the floor basically on the belief if they say it often enough, maybe somebody will believe it. 
   Here is one thing you can believe. There is no conjecture in this. These are matter of fact. As Casey used to say, you can look it up. You can look it up. There is the debt of the United States, $5.7 trillion before President Bush came to office. Here is the debt of the United States today, $8.8 trillion. That arithmetic is very simple and very straightforward. It's a $3.1 trillion increase of debt of United States on their watch. This isn't conjecture, this is a matter of record. 
   I will just show you this chart one more time, because it shows that the revenue flows that we are projecting, based upon CBO's base-line certification of projection of revenues is essentially the same as the President is assuming in his budget from OMB, there is a 1.2 percent difference. This is the so-called biggest tax increase in American history. The President is right where we are, 1.2 percent difference between us. 
   Now, why all of these shenanigans? Partly it is because this is a red herring. They don't want to talk about really what is in their budget resolution. It's their resolution they will have to pass tomorrow. They bear the burden of truth and persuasion. You would think they would be talking about it. 
   But deep down in that resolution, you have to dig hard. You will find the same thing in the Agriculture Committee. This year they are to renew and reauthorize the farm bill. We want you to reconcile $9.85 billion in cost reduction in the agriculture bill. It will be awfully hard to get that farm bill out if that reconciliation is implemented. 
   They say to Labor, which has student loans, Pell Grants under its jurisdiction, you can cut $4.9 billion. Where from, student loans? No where else to go. 
   They say to Energy and Commerce, with Medicare and Medicaid in its jurisdiction cut $97.539 billion over the next 9 years. Judiciary and our law enforcement programs, cut $3.5 billion  dollars; Natural Resources, already strained, huge backlog for our national parks, cut $4.7 billion; Transportation and Infrastructure, about to run short of funds for our highways, cut $4.2 billion; Ways and Means, with all kinds of safety net programs, this is an instruction to Ways and Means, to cut $153 billion. 
   Now, this is done under the name and guise of balancing the budget. But what's the bottom line? They also tell Ways and Means to cut taxes by $447 billion. 
   When you net the $447 billion tax cut against the $278 billion in reconciled spending cuts, the result is $168 billion more to be added to the deficit. That is why they are talking about this other subject. That is why they wouldn't talk about their own resolution. Our resolution will stand on all fours. Our resolution is a good resolution. It's not the best, but it is doggone good. 
   It brings us to balance by 2012. It fully funds defense. By the way we don't have any shenanigans with the outlays. We don't short up guys in the field $67 billion in outlays. When we get through paying and providing for defense, which is a big item there, is not a lot left over. We husband our resources. We say to our veterans, by golly, you deserve what you are talking about. We give the biggest increase in history, $5.4 billion over current services for veterans health care. 
   Education, we think it's critically important. We genuinely believe in it on this side. We provide $9 billion more than the President for education next year, over the next 5 years, we provide $46 billion more for education than does theirs. 
   Children's health insurance, it's going to expire this year. What they propose will not even allow us to insure the children now on the program. We want to not only renew it, but expand it. We also want to pay for it. So we say to those who advocate SCHIP, its expansion, if you pay for it, you can go up to $50 billion in expanding the program. That is in our budget resolution. 
   Why do they want to put this red herring out there? To keep us from talking about these things that the American people really care about, the health of their children. They should. 
   We don't have any Medicaid cuts, and we don't have any Medicare cuts. I will tell you, because I have been at this business of the budget for a long time, in 1990 and 1991 Democrats voted for budget measures that truly reduced the deficit and had some restraints on Medicare and Medicaid in them; 1997, the same thing; 1993, with Mr. Clinton, the same thing. When we knew that it was going to improve the bottom line and not be used simply to offset another of their tax cuts, we were willing to pay for Medicare and Medicaid reduction. They have not been able to or willing to. 
   Finally, as to taxes, we have no tax increase anywhere in this resolution, none whatsoever. For that matter, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, particularly those middle-income tax cuts, which we list and enumerate, not once but twice in our resolution, we fully protect them and leave them in place, full force and effect, this year, next year, 2008, 2009 and 2010. 
   They only expire then, not because of anything in this budget resolution, but because when the Republicans first wrote those tax cuts and passed them, they put that sunset date in there in order to diminish the size and shoehorn these tax cuts under what was allowed under that budget resolution. 
   We have got a good budget resolution. It will stand on all fours. It brings the budget to balance in 2012, encourages less in deficits and depth than the President does. Furthermore, we have got a track record to talk about. 
   When President Clinton came to office in 1993, there was a deficit of $290 billion. Every year thereafter, every year thereafter, the bottom line of the budget got better, to the point where in 2000, there was a surplus of $236 billion. That is what happened on his watch. 
   President Bush came to office with an advantage few preceding Presidents have enjoyed, a surplus of $5.6 trillion projected by his own economists. He has run that into a deficit of $8.2 trillion. We haven't seen a reversal like that since the Great Depression. That was not the President's fault in the 1930s. 
   This is the record they have to rely on. The record we have to rely on is the record of the Clinton administration, which balanced the budget in the year 1998 for the first time in 30 years, and built up a surplus of $236 billion, which we turned over to Mr. Bush. 
   We will discuss this further tomorrow. But what we offer is a responsible budget resolution that reaches responsible results but is balanced well in its priorities. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired. 
   The gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) each will control 30 minutes on the subject of economic goals and policies.

   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, 
   Under sections 211, 301(b), and 320(a), of S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record a revision to the budget allocations and aggregates for certain House committees for fiscal years 2007, 2008, and the period of 2008 through 2012. This revision represents an adjustment to certain House committee budget allocations and aggregates for the purposes of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, and in response to the bill H.R. 3963 made in order by the Committee on Rules (Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007). Corresponding tables are attached. 
   Under section 211 of S. Con. Res. 21, this adjustment to the budget allocations and aggregates applies while the measure is under consideration. The adjustments will take effect upon enactment of the measure. For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, a revised allocation made under section 211 of S. Con. Res. 21 is to be considered as an allocation included in the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. 
   I will be frank to say that I think the time lines are too tight, the details are too sketchy; but I recognize this resolution for what it is. It is not a general order or master plan for the redeployment of our troops in Iraq. This is simply a way to frame the debate with the President over how we can most effectively reduce and redeploy the 170,000 troops now on duty in Iraq. We are, after all, in the 5th year of this war. 
   So far, 3,611 Americans have given their lives, 27,000 have been wounded in action. We have spent $450 billion through May, and continue spending now at a rate of $10 billion a month. Had we the foresight 3 years ago, 4 years ago to see these costs, the War Powers Resolution would not have secured 100 votes in this House. 
   Opponents of this resolution claim that we are encroaching on the powers of the President as the Commander in Chief. Those who think that should read the resolution and read it carefully. 
   First of all, it does not call for an immediate withdrawal. It allows 4 months for the reduction in forces to begin. Second, it does not call for withdrawal at all. It calls for a reduction of the  number of troops deployed or transition to a limited mission. Third, it spells out the limited missions. These include force protection, diplomatic protection, pursuit of terrorists, training of Iraqi forces. The resolution, far from interfering, defers to the President, allows the Pentagon to decide just what is the minimum force level for the mission it specifies, provided it justifies its decision. 
   For the past 3 years, the President has assured us that we would stand down American troops as soon as Iraqi troops stood up. Well, that is essentially what this resolution does; 135 Iraqi battalions have been trained. Many may lack things like logistics to make them freestanding fighting units, but surely this is a capacity we can supply over the next 6 months or even longer through embedded advisers who will remain after April 2008. 
   This resolution sends the Iraqi troops the message that we are not in their country, Iraq, indefinitely, and that the day is fast approaching when they must take responsibility for the security of their own country.     
   For the past 2 years the President has told us that benchmarks or milestones have been laid down for the Iraqi government to accomplish. This week we received a progress report on those metrics showing few measurable gains. 
   So here's our dilemma: Our presence in Iraq, with 170,000 troops, allows the Iraqi government an ability to operate, the freedom of action it would not otherwise enjoy absent our support. But the Iraqi government has exploited that security to avoid doing the very steps that are necessary to its becoming a true government of national reconciliation, which commands the allegiance of all Iraqis. 
   Yesterday the Deputy Director for Analysis in the Office of National Intelligence told us, ``current political trends are moving the country in a negative direction.'' One way to make Iraqi leaders take the reins of their own government, establish their government, is to announce reduction of our forces in front-line combat troops and their transition to a limited mission and make it clear that our commitment to their country is not open-ended. 
   Three or 4 months ago, we were told by the administration it was going to undertake a new strategy, a new plan for securing Iraq called a surge, concentrated primarily in Baghdad. We now have the early results from that. We were told we would know in 3 or 4 months. Three or 4 months have passed, and we've only seen casualties increase. There have been some successes, sure, and we're thankful for them. And I hope it succeeds. But we need a new strategy. We do not have one, and this calls for a rethinking of everything. And for these reasons I will vote for this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPRATT. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We are in the midst of a recession, which is not your garden variety business down-cycle. This recession started with the collapse of sub-prime mortgages, which has taken a toll on investment banks, like Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns, and even the biggest of the commercial banks, like Citibank. 
   At the outset, it seemed that the effects of the recession would be felt mostly by those institutions that were long in sub-prime mortgages. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac deal mainly in prime mortgages, typically with equity of 20 percent, and not sub-prime mortgages, it was felt at first that these institutions, with their government-sponsored status, and their implicit guarantee, would be part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem. It was felt that maybe they could even take up some of the defaulted sub-prime paper. But as foreclosures increased, and housing values decreased, and net interest rate spreads worsened, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to feel the effects, and the financial markets began to question their financial statements, which, I will emphasize, state positive net worth and positive cash flow. 
   Secretary Paulson was able to slow down the steep fall in value by stating explicitly and emphatically what has been implicit since these entities were first created, namely, that the credit of the United States stands behind them. The most important purpose of this bill is for the Congress to affirm in law what the Secretary has declared, or to be more specific, to confer on Treasury the power to extend to these two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, an open-ended line of credit. 
   It's fair to ask why no ceiling on the line of credit. The answer may seem paradoxical, but the Secretary of Treasury has assured us that the larger and less restricted the credit is, the less likely the lines will ever be drawn down. Creditors will not need to worry if they forbear, if they don't cash in, they may not be paid because come hell or high water the Federal Government's credit stands behind these entities. 
   For that pledge also to be taken seriously by the market as credible, it's necessary to increase the debt ceiling of the United States. We did that in the last budget resolution we adopted here in the House. This bill, once again, would confirm and raise the debt ceiling of the United States, giving the Secretary headroom and credibility when he says the standby lines of credit that we're extending will be adequate to accomplish the effect it's intended. 
   This debate is about housing and two entities, GSEs, but it's also about our credit globally. If these two entities were to default and not have the United States government back up its guaranty, the consequences could be truly calamitous. 
   This is also good policy, counter-cyclical policy for the recession itself. It's a good bill, good policy, and I urge everyone to support it. 
   I thank the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2638, as amended, but I wish to draw particular attention to the $5 million of funding provided within this bill for a space-based kinetic interceptor study, that, ostensibly, was included as an earmark requested by Senators ALLARD, INHOFE, KYL, and SESSIONS. Chairman OBEY's explanatory statement of the amendment under consideration expressly states, ``The bill provides $5,000,000 to support the study outlined in section 236 of S. 3001, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.'' 
   Section 236 of the Defense Authorizaton bill no longer refers to a space-based kinetic interceptor study. The provision specific to such a study appeared in a Senate version of the authorizing bill, but it was stricken from the House amended version of the bill that we passed this afternoon for good cause. 
   Mr. Speaker, a study to explore the potential for space-based kinetic interceptors within our ballistic missile defense system is a bad idea. I have many reservations, but chief among them is the message that the purported study would project to the world. It would clearly indicate America's willingness to unilaterally introduce weapons into space. The notion for the proposed study may be couched by its proponents as a low cost method for determining the merits of a purely defensive mechanism, but the dual use technologies associated with kinetic interceptors could be used for a variety of offensive purposes, such as shooting down satellites. Such a step, however small, would surely be perceived as the first step toward an arms race in space, which would only place our vital military and commercial space assets at greater risk. Independent studies in the past concluded that space-based kinetic interceptors would prove impractical and costly. We have no evidence that the proposed study would prove otherwise. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish to underscore that the Congress has not granted any authority to fund a space-based kinetic interceptor study and to reiterate for the record that the specific provision relied upon in this bill for authority and guidance to fund such a study does not exist.
