<DOCNO>Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. (CALLING CARD CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. I certainly want to thank Chairman RUSH and the Democratic staff and the Republican staff for working so diligently to pass not only the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, but also the Travel Promotion Act. I certainly want to congratulate Mr. Engel for bringing this matter before the House. It certainly is an important issue, and we are all delighted that this bill is moving forward. 
   Madam Speaker, I simply wanted to have a colloquy, if I could, with Chairman RUSH about a couple of issues relating to this bill, and simply wanted to confirm with Mr. Rush the intent of certain provisions as they relate to small retailers that are selling these prepaid calling cards. 
   I guess my question, Chairman RUSH, is that if a retailer sells a card but is unaware that the calling card does not make all of the disclosures required by the act, will the retail merchant be subject to monetary penalties under sections 4 or 5 of the bill?

   Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. Thank you very much, Chairman RUSH. 
   To be clear, it is also my understanding that, obviously, to protect consumers, a retailer could be enjoined by the FTC, or State authorities, and required to stop selling fraudulent cards, which they should be required to stop, whether or not they knew the cards were fraudulent. 
   Such retailer would not, however, it's my understanding, and I think you pointed this out, they would not be subject to civil penalties or damages unless they knew the cards were unlawful; is that correct?

<DOCNO>Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. (HONORING THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF THE 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) as well as Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for bringing this resolution to the floor today. 
   As has been said, Fort Campbell, Kentucky is the home of the 101st Airborne Division known as the Screaming Eagles, which is the only air assault division in the world. It has been my distinct privilege and pleasure to represent the First Congressional District of Kentucky, which is the home of this great unit. 
   I would also like to say that, while this resolution focuses explicitly on the 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell is also the home of the 160th Special Aviation Regiment, the Fifth Special Forces Group, the 86th Combat Support Hospital, and we have many young men and women also serving at the Blanchfield Army Hospital as well as the Garrison Command at Fort Campbell. 
   I was delighted that the gentleman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Alabama talked briefly about the history of this great 101st Airborne Division. I might say that, throughout its history, 19 individuals of that unit have received the highest declaration offered by the U.S. Government, which is the Medal of Honor. 
   Since Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom began, thousands of members of the 101st Airborne Division have been deployed no less than three times, performing dangerous counter-insurgency operations and working to secure liberty in nations that once served as safe havens for terrorists. 
   I might also say that we pay special tribute to the nearly 200 members of the 101st Division who have lost their lives fighting the global war on terrorism, and throughout its proud history over 6,000 have lost their lives. 
   Despite the dangers and difficulties faced by these soldiers and their loved ones, I might say that 65 percent reenlist and request to stay with the 101st Airborne Division, which certainly demonstrates the loyalty to the proud history and tradition of this unit. 
   I'd like to thank all of the cosponsors of this resolution. The brave soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division have never hesitated to answer this Nation's call to duty, and it is my great privilege to honor them with this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. (TAKING RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, Chairman Oberstar has been a great leader in the transportation issues of our country, and certainly one of the leaders in rail transportation policy, but I would just like to say on this bill that one of the goals of the rail transportation policy of the United States is to ensure the development of a sound rail system to meet the needs of shippers and the consuming public. 
   I am genuinely concerned that H.R. 6707 may actually have an adverse impact on our rail system, particularly as it relates to rural communities. In rural areas of our country, at one time we had strong railroad service which contributed a great deal to the economic development in rural America. I am very much concerned that this legislation, while it has every good intention of protecting local communities, will actually be a chill to continued rail service in a lot of small communities. 
   The Rail Transportation Safety Board already is required to look, on rail mergers and acquisitions, to look at the public interest standard and must evaluate that. I am just concerned that this additional requirement will really be a chilling effect and will adversely impact rail service in rural America which will have an adverse impact on all of us, particularly at this time when energy prices, being as high as they are, we know that we can transport goods by rail cheaper which makes us more competitive in the global marketplace. For that reason, I would respectfully oppose this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   On December 19 of last year, this body spoke with a resounding voice of approval for our Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act. The measure passed by a unanimous vote of 407-0. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Dingell; Ranking Member Barton; Chairman RUSH; and my predecessor, Mr. Stearns, for the great job that they did in getting this bill through the House. 
   H.R. 4040 is a bipartisan product. We worked for 4 months and in the end came up with a stringent but reasoned approach to strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and to vastly improve the safety of our children's products. The result was a bill that creates the toughest lead standard in the world and imposes mandatory safety standards on products for young children. To ensure such standards are met, we require third-party testing and certification of children's products and we nearly double the Consumer Product Safety Commission budget over 4 years to ensure both the new safety standards and the testing and certification requirements are met. 
   All the new standards and increased enforcement in the world will not help parents unless they also know about dangerous products. We therefore require improved public notice of recalls as well as tracking labels on all children's products so parents can identify recalled toys when they hear about them. We also loosened restrictions to allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to release critical product safety information to the public when people face an imminent health and safety standard. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 4040. I know that this is a work product that will maximize our opportunity to protect children from dangerous toys and products, and I urge and hope that the House managers will stand by the provisions which passed this Chamber unanimously only 5 months ago and insist upon the measures of H.R. 4040, as passed by the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
