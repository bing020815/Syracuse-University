<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5140, the Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act. 
   For the last 7 years, powerful interests--whether its oil and gas companies, PHARMA, or the wealthiest Americans--have had their day in Congress. 
   Today, as the economy is on the brink of recession, we are finally providing relief to those who need it most--working families. 
   These tax rebates will put money back into the pockets of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. I recently asked a young mother in my district how she would spend her rebate check. ``Buy new clothes for my kids,'' she said. 
   While today's package is a good start, checks in the mail are not enough. Just last week, Methode Electronics announced that it would close its Carthage plant--costing my district an additional 850 jobs. This is the latest example of how the Bush economy has failed average Americans and a stark reminder that we need to do more for working families. 
   I am extremely supportive of the Senate proposal to extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and strongly believe we must reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to provide a safety net for workers who lose their jobs due to unfair trade. If we are sincerely dedicated to stimulating the economy, we need to invest in our greatest economic asset--our workers. 
   Today's legislation is just a start, but it shows that this Democratic Congress is committed to putting working families first--in good times and in bad. 
   I strongly urge the President to accept these common-sense measures expected in the Senate's proposal as we move forward on the stimulus package.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this vital and important legislation. 
   For 13 years, I cut suits at Seaford Clothing Company in Rock Island. I would not be here today as a Member of the United States Congress if it weren't for my union. My membership in my local union, Local 617, gave me access to higher wages, good benefits and invaluable workplace safety protections. My union helped me send my kids to college, it helped me buy a house and to begin to build a secure retirement. But, sadly, more and more Americans are seeing these opportunities slip away.     
   Worker productivity is up, but wages are declining. Corporate CEOs are enjoying record profits, yet average workers are struggling to pay their home heating bills, affordable health care, and save for college for their kids. 
   Current law allows employers to refuse recognition of a union when the majority of employees sign cards saying they want a union. In addition, there are weak penalties for employers who intimidate, coerce or fire workers who try to organize a union or secure a first contract. 
   The bipartisan Employee Free Choice Act levels the playing field between employer and employee relations by requiring employers to recognize a union formed by a majority sign-up, stiffening the penalties for employers who violate the law, and providing an arbitrator if labor and management cannot agree on a contract. 
   In closing, let me just say that I chose to join a union. I was able to make it from the cutting room floor of the Seaford Clothing factory to the floor of this Chamber. 
   I urge Members to give every American that same opportunity by voting ``yes'' on the Employee Free Choice Act.

   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Chairman, there has been a lot of talk here about the last election. And my friends on the other side of the aisle were talking about the secret ballot. The reason that they lost the election wasn't because they had the secret ballot. They lost the election because they lost sight of what they were here to do, stand up for ordinary people, fight for them. 
   It took the Democrats a little less than 2 weeks to raise the minimum wage. My friends on the other side of the aisle had this Chamber for 12 years and couldn't get it done. 
   We are standing here today, and I mentioned earlier that I organized a plan. I have been there and I have done that. I worked on the J.P. Stevens boycott, where the foreman would literally follow the employee to the restroom to make sure she or he was not taking an unauthorized break. Someone would show up at the hospital, if they were injured, at the emergency room to tell the employee, if you don't show up for work tomorrow, you are fired. 
   My friends, we have heard a lot of talk today, but actions speak much  louder than words. For 12 years, my friends on this side of the aisle have had a chance to improve workplace safety and they haven't done it, a chance to strengthen workers' rights. And you would swear today that they are the champion of ordinary people giving them the breaks. Well, for 12 years we have watched. Today, we act. 
   I will put my card in. I will vote ``yes'' for all of the people who want a fair shake, an opportunity to join a trade union, to have health insurance and better benefits. 
   It didn't take us 12 years, my friends, to understand. And trust me when I tell you, we will pass this legislation. And as the end of the movie ``The Inheritance,'' the movie that formed my stance on unions, an older man looks into the camera, and he says, you think this is the end? My friends, this is only the beginning.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (U.S. TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Thank you very much. And I thank my friend from Maine for his leadership. And as you know, you're my subcommittee chairman on Veterans Health. And you lead and you do a wonderful job on that committee. And I'm just honored to be able to serve with you. 
   I want to thank you, and I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman S&#193;NCHEZ from California, for her great leadership on this whole issue of trade and protecting American workers and standing up for ordinary people. 
   I don't have a prepared speech tonight, Madam Speaker. I came here tonight just to kind of have a dialogue for a few minutes and talk about some of these trade deals from the perspective of what I'm hearing back in my district from ordinary people who get up every day, worried whether or not they're going to keep their job. 
   I think we take a look at Korea. Here we have a trade deal that they are asking us to take a look at and 
   support. 700,000 vehicles entered this country from Korea, yet our automobile manufacturers were allowed, allowed to ship 2,500 cars to Korea. Now, someone tell me if that's remotely close to being a fair trade deal. 
   I don't have a problem in the world with saying to the Korean government, look, I'm not asking for 700 to 700,000. But when we are only allowed to bring in 2,500 vehicles, compared to importing 700,000, that trade deal is dead on arrival as far as I'm concerned. 
   Plus, if you look what they're doing to our beef production and in terms of importing beef from this country, that issue is basically dead. Oh, they say they'll talk to us about it. But talk is cheap. And the reality of it is we have yet seen this government be able to move on a trade deal that makes any sense. 
   You look at Colombia. I was at a trade press conference the other day on Colombia. As you know, as my friend from Maine knows, Madam Speaker, I'm a union member, president, former president of my clothing and textile worker local. 
   If I had been as vocal for my union in the 13 years that I served in that capacity in Colombia, I probably would have been shot. We've had thousands of people who have been murdered, imprisoned, tortured. This is a government that we're supposed to do business with. We're supposed to trade. 
   Here we are, the United States, greatest democracy on this planet, and they want us to fashion some type of a trade deal with a country that has paramilitary people go out and assassinate trade unionists and their families. We can do a lot better than that. 
   I notice the President of Colombia was here just last week, and I echo my colleague, Representative Schakowsky's remarks, Madam Speaker, when she said to President Uribe in her remarks saying, come back in a year. Come back in a year and prove to this Congress and prove to the American people that you're serious about these violations; that you're going to prosecute more than 39 people, which is all that's been prosecuted under this government. 
   My colleague from Maine mentions the loss of textile jobs and paper jobs  and steel jobs. I talked to one of my friends, Representative Butterfield, and he had, at one time, in one county, in one county in his Congressional district, he had 10,000 textile workers in one county. I said, how many do you have today? And he said, I have zero. They're all gone. 
   We can do a lot better than this. My basic question to those people who want these trade deals is just simply this. I understand the environmental and the labor standards, and I think those are good frameworks. What I want to know is, in every trade deal, what is the ramifications for our manufacturing base, for our workers and for our farmers? 
   I think it's a fair question to be able to ask anybody. When I do, I'm told by some folks, well, we're going to redo the trade readjustment for those folks who lose their jobs. 
   That's little comfort to somebody like Dave Bevard from Galesburg, Illinois. 32 years at Maytag. His wife has cancer. Health care runs out. 
   And one person suggested that I go back and talk to Dave Bevard and explain to him, if you can believe this, Madam Speaker, I'm supposed to explain to Dave Bevard that there's currency manipulation in China that's causing some of these problems. 
   And I remember saying to that Member, well, when I do, when I go to Galesburg and say that to Dave Bevard, I'd better be putting a catcher's mask on because I think I'm going to get poked. We can't talk to our workers like that, justify this. Currency manipulation. 
   I'll tell you why Dave Bevard lost his job; I'll tell you why Maytag went to Sonora, Mexico, because this Congress, under NAFTA, that passed NAFTA, helped those jobs to go to Sonora, Mexico, Madam Speaker. They outsourced those jobs, and this from a company that took $9 million in Illinois taxpayers' money; and the workers gave, not one, but two wage concessions. 
   And guess what? The people in Sonora, Mexico can't afford those refrigerators that they're making. In fact, they're coming across the border illegally because they're not making enough money at that factory. 
   So to my friends at Maytag I would say, thank you for nothing. 
   Look, I'm a card-carrying capitalist. I've said this many times, Madam Speaker. I want to see businesses make money. But I also want to see a system of fairness in this whole trade thing. 
   I think it's the minimum we can do is to expect this Congress, that when we negotiate a trade deal, and when we're looking at a trade deal, is to stand up for those very people whose jobs are on the line. 
   These are veterans who fought and defended this country. These are people who want to put their kids through school. They want to see their kids get married and be able to afford a home. They want to spend some time and be able to retire with some dignity. 
   Instead, we outsource their jobs. We give them a Trade Readjustment Act that isn't really worth the paper it's written on in the final analysis. It doesn't nearly make it up. 
   Now I want to say one thing about that before I just conclude here. Some of the workers at Maytag were told, well, we know you're losing your jobs to Mexico, but here's what you should do. Go into a thing like health care. Growing field. My colleague from Maine and I probably ought to take a look at that maybe some day. 
   But they were told, you need to get into a growing field like health care. So 300 workers, displaced workers at Maytag did just that. That was the good news. They went to school for a year. The bad news was, there was only room for 30 of those workers, 30 of those workers to continue in practicums so that they could practice medicine. 
   So what was the response to those 270 people who were left out? 
   Have you thought of going into cosmetology? 
   Well, that's a wonderful thing. That's a great way to treat workers. 
   No, they don't think about cosmetology. What they think about is what should have been and what could have been. What should have been was this Congress, this House, should have said no to NAFTA. 
   And when it did say yes, and I wish I was here, I could have voted against it, should have had a moral obligation to say to those workers, we're going to do everything we can to help you hold on. But it didn't. 
   And I am saddened that some Members in my own caucus think that every trade deal that comes down is something that we ought to take a look at. 
   Let me suggest this, and I will close by saying this. I ran on this issue for the United States Congress. I talked about it every candidate forum I had. I had four opponents in the primary, and I ran on this issue of trade.     
   I said I will support trade as long as it does not outsource our manufacturing base and that American agriculture has a seat at the table. I won that primary, and I went on to the general election, and I ran against someone who supported NAFTA, who supported GAT, CAFTA, supported all these Bush trade deals, and I walked out of that election with 57 percent of the vote. Part of that, I believe, is because the people of the 17th District of Illinois know what it is like. I had six clothing and textile plants in my district. I have three with one ready to go, soon to close. 
   I say, as long as I am in this Chamber, and I don't know how long that will be, I am not going to vote for a trade deal that will outsource one American job, that will take one farmer for granted, that will tell people you really don't matter because you have to look at the whole picture. So I say this to Dave Bevard and to those people who may be watching tonight, from this freshman's perspective, and I can't thank Congressman Michaud enough for his leadership on this. I met him when I was running for Congress, and I remember one phone call I made to him when I was a candidate, and one of the first questions he asked was, ``Where are you on trade?'' And I told him and he said, ``What can I do to help?'' And he has been a wonderful leader on this issue. 
   And this battle will go on. This hour will end, but the battle will go on. And I am not giving up, and the people that believe that our manufacturing base can be saved, we are not giving up. I am going to support the Patriot Corporation, which helps keep American jobs here and stops giving tax credits to companies that outsource overseas. I want fair trade. I will vote for any trade deal that comes down as long as it meets the criteria that it stands up for ordinary Americans. 
   With that, I am just honored that I was allowed to participate this evening. Thank you, Congressman Michaud.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, the point is, if we're going to trust this administration to enforce labor standards and environmental standards, this is the same administration who hasn't even administered our own National OSHA program and has had one OSHA standard that they had to enforce, and that was because this administration was sued to get it. 
   I would hope my colleagues wouldn't just listen to us this evening. I would hope they would listen to the American people. Poll after poll say, if the American people are asked across the country, north to south, east to west, they are asked about these trade deals, the American people want to see that American workers have a right to be competitive. 
   I wrote down a list of some things: Steel, televisions, camcorders, clothing. The list goes on. It isn't that we don't have the workforce that can manufacture and make these things. They were quality products for years and years and years. Unfortunately, we have had a Government that felt that it was okay to take those jobs and to move them out. 
   I would also remind some of our colleagues that not every person that gets out of school wants to sit behind a computer terminal. There is great strength in working as a welder. It is a great task to be a fitter. It is a great task to be able to do something with your hands. God didn't create all of us to sit behind a terminal. I am convinced of that, because I am computer illiterate. I am living proof. I cut lining for men's suits for 13 years, and I know this: I know that we manufactured a marvelous product. I know my cutting room was outsourced because you can't compete against 17 cents an hour. 
   The unionized clothing worker back then was making a whopping $6.07 per hour when I worked in this factory. So this nonsense about American workers pricing themselves out of jobs because of collective bargaining agreements, that dog, as they say, just isn't going to hunt. 
   I would ask this body, this House, to pay attention to what the American people said last November. They sent us here to do something positive for them. I haven't met a worker yet who said, could you do me a favor, PHIL? I hope you do the best you can when you get out there to make sure I can get some TRA funding and lose my job. People want us to stand up for them, and that is what we are here tonight for. 
   I want to commend the Congresswoman from Ohio, BETTY SUTTON. She has been a tremendous force in this issue of bringing it forward, staying with it and not being afraid to take some lumps, because sometimes we can do that in this business. 
   But let me tell you, this issue that we are talking about this evening is one of the most important issues this country faces. We are going to be at a crossroads with these trade agreements. We can either decide to stand up and be counted, or we can stand aside and watch these jobs go and bemoan the fact that they are gone down the road and try to solve this by throwing some money at a TRA program that not only needs to be reworked, it needs to be reworked because it isn't working, and it hasn't been working for a long time for American workers who have been displaced. 
   I just want to close by saying this tonight: I am for trade. I have said it before. I am for any type of a fair trade agreement that works. But I will not vote for a single piece of legislation that comes to this floor that will outsource one more job, not just from the 17th District of Illinois, the 13th District of Ohio, a district in Maine. 
   But from Maine to California, we have a responsibility. I am here because of the working men and women of my district. I am going to do the very best I can. And I will tell all of them that are watching, I would encourage them to talk to their Representative and to try to tell them just how important this issue is and what is at stake. 
   Let me again thank my colleague from Maine for his leadership on this issue. He is probably one of the most forceful voices we have in this Chamber to stand up for American working men and women. I am honored to be here tonight, and I'm honored to serve with you, and I thank the gentleman for giving me this time.

   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor two great community leaders from Decatur, Illinois. 
   Horace ``Buck'' Livingston is a local civil rights activist who sought higher-paying jobs and better education for African Americans. For over 40 years, he has published the African American Voice, the only African American newspaper within 150 miles of Decatur, Illinois. His tireless efforts continue to strengthen our community and give all of us hope for a better future. 
   William ``Skip'' Dempsey, my brother in the labor movement, sadly passed away on April 13. After teaching at Purdue University, Skip served for over 12 years as training coordinator for Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 65. He continued his leadership as a business agent, advancing education, economic growth, and the building trades in the Decatur area. Skip's valuable service will be sorely missed. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the extraordinary and unselfish contributions of Buck Livingstong and Skip Dempsey.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague and friend, Congresswoman DeGette, for introducing the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and for her leadership on this important issue. 
   As many of you know, I came to this Congress with a bittersweet victory. And although I'm deeply honored to be a new Member of this House and represent the 17th Congressional District of Illinois, part of me is sad that my friend and my mentor, Congressman Lane Evans, is not here in my place. Lane served as a distinguished Member of this body for over 24 years until Parkinson's forced him to retire at the end of the 109th Congress, cutting his exceptional service short. Lane is just one of millions of Americans struggling with chronic illnesses that are curable with the advancement of stem cell research. 
   Spencer House, the son of my very good friend, Doug House, suffers from juvenile diabetes and must take four insulin shots each and every day. But Doug is encouraged with the hope that embryonic stem cell research will some day offer his son a more normal life. And he's not alone. Poll after poll shows that a majority of Americans support ethical embryonic stem cell research as a way to prevent others from having to live with illnesses like Parkinson's disease, cancer, Alzheimer's and spinal cord injuries. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we decide whether to give the American people hope or to continue to prolong the suffering of those who struggle with curable chronic diseases. It's time to put the people above politics by providing millions of Americans with the hope of a better day, and we will do that this day by passing this important legislation.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In its history, the Medal of Honor has been awarded only 3,463 times. 3,458 of those were awarded for separate acts of heroism. I'm here today to tell you about one such act and the extraordinary individual who performed it. I am truly in awe of his courage and selflessness. 
   His name was Charles George. He was a Private First Class in the United States Army. PFC George distinguished himself by going above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy on the night of November 30, 1952. 
   He was a member of a raiding party committed to engage the enemy and capture a prisoner for interrogation. Subject to intense mortar and machine gun fire, and suffering several casualties throughout the advance, he fought  valiantly, and upon reaching the crest of the hill, leaped into the trenches and engaged with the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. 
   When friendly troops were ordered to move back upon completion of the assignment, he and two comrades remained to cover the withdrawal. While in the process of leaving the trenches, a hostile soldier hurled a grenade into their midst.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on December 9, 1861, Iowa Senator James W. Grimes introduced S. 82 in the United States Senate, a bill designed to ``promote the efficiency of the Navy'' by authorizing the production and distribution of ``medals of honor''. On December 21 the bill was passed, authorizing 200 such medals be produced ``which shall be bestowed upon such petty officers, seamen, landsmen and Marines as shall distinguish themselves by their gallantly in action and other seamanlike qualities during the present war.'' President Lincoln signed the bill, and the Medal of Honor was born. 
   The first Medal of Honor was the Navy Medal of Honor. Raymond Murphy was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps when he risked his life and went above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander in action against the enemy. 
   Although painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon, Second Lieutenant Murphy refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through hostile mortar and small-arms fire, while shouting words of encouragement to his men. 
   Under the increasing intense enemy fire, he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken Marines to safety. When reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements, Second Lieutenant Murphy employed part of his unit as support and, during the ensuing battle, personally killed two of the enemy with his pistol. 
   With all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill, and although suffering intense pain from a previous wound, seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared in the trenches. 
   After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing Marines, locating and carrying the bodies of a machine gun crew back down the hill. 
   Wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small-arms, artillery and mortar fire, he once again refused medical attention until assured that every one of his men, including all the casualites, had preceded him to the main lines. 
   Second Lieutenant Murphy's actions epitomize the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, ``always faithful,'' and demonstrate his loyalty and commitment to marine comrades-in-arms. 
   After the war, Mr. Murphy continued his service to his veteran comrades in New Mexico, serving as Director of Veteran Services at the VA center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   Renaming the VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico is a fitting tribute to a tireless advocate of veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Medal of Honor recipients have performed selfless acts of courage. When reading their citations, we are deeply humbled by the courage and selflessness of their actions to save their comrades and to defend this great country. 
   H.R. 2602 would name the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility in Iron Mountain, Michigan, as the Oscar G. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility. 
   The following is from the citation for Sergeant Johnson, who at the time of his action was a private first class in the United States Army. It was September, 1944, and the Allied Forces were attempting to break the German defense line in Italy known as the ``Gothic Line'': 
   He practically single handedly protected the left flank of his company's position in the offensive to break the German Gothic Line. Company B was the extreme left assault unit of the corps. The advance was stopped by heavy fire from Monticelli Ridge, and the company took fire behind an embankment. 
   Sergeant Johnson, a mortar gunner, having expended his ammunition, assumed the duties of a rifleman. As leader of a squad of seven men, he was ordered to establish a combat post 50 yards to the left of the company to cover its exposed flank. 
   Repeated enemy counterattacks, supported by artillery, mortar, and machine gun fire from the high ground to his front, had by the afternoon of 16 September killed or wounded all of his men. Collecting weapons and ammunition from his fallen comrades, in the face of hostile fire, he held his exposed position and inflicted heavy casualties upon the enemy, who several times came close enough to throw hand grenades at him. 
   On the night of September 16, the enemy launched its heaviest attack on Company B, putting its greatest pressure against the lone defender of the left flank. In spite of mortar fire which crashed about him and machine gun bullets which whipped the chest of his shallow trench, Sergeant Johnson stood erect and repulsed the attack with grenades and small arms fire. 
   He remained awake and alert throughout the night, frustrating all attempts at infiltration. On 17 September, 25 German soldiers surrendered to him. Two men, sent to reinforce him that afternoon, were caught in a devastating mortar and artillery barrage. 
   With no thought for his own safety, Sergeant Johnson rushed to the shell hole where they lay half buried and seriously wounded, covered their position by his fire, and assisted a medical corpsman in rendering aid. That night he secured their removal to the rear and remained on watch until his company was relieved. 
   Five companies of the German paratroop regiment had been repeatedly committed to the attack on Company B without success. Twenty dead Germans were found in front of his position. By his heroic stand and utter disregard for personal safety, Sergeant Johnson was in large measure responsible for defeating the enemy's attempts to turn the exposed left flank. What an incredible hero, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Johnson is no longer with us, but we can keep alive his memory by naming the facility in his honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States. 
   It is an honor and a privilege for me to stand here before you today to talk about one such individual. His name was Ernest Childers. 
   Ernest Childers was the first Native American to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic action in 1943 at the battle of Oliveto, Italy, when he charged German machine gun nests against machine gun fire. 
   Although suffering a broken foot in the assault, Childers ordered covering fire, advanced up a hill, single-handedly killing two snipers, silencing two machine gun nests, and capturing an enemy mortar observer. 
   His courageous action helped American troops win the battle and save the lives of countless American soldiers. Childers was also awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his actions. 
   H.R. 366 would name the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma as the ``Ernest Childers Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.'' 
   Until his death on March 17, 2005, Childers was Oklahoma's last Congressional Medal of Honor recipient still living in the State. It is only fitting that we remember such a courageous soldier by naming a veterans outpatient clinic in his honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this critical piece of legislation.  
   Mining remains one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, and our laws have not kept up with the changes in the industry. As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I participated in several hearings on this issue. At one in particular, I was touched by the little boy whose father had just been killed in the Crandall Canyon tragedy. It is for him and the countless other children who will grow up without a mom or a dad that I believe, as Members of Congress, we have the responsibility to do all we can to ensure that our miners are safe and come home to their families safely every night. 
   The recent tragedies at Sago, Darby and Crandall Canyon mines have made it apparent that the MINER Act of 2006 has fallen short in some areas. The legislation we are considering today addresses these areas. I am particularly pleased that the bill grants MSHA the authority to shut down mines that have neglected to pay fines for safety violations. Additionally, the retreat mining and whistleblower protections are much-needed improvements in the bill. 
   While the MINER Act of 2006 was a very good first step towards improving mine safety, it is clear that more work must be done. I believe today's bill will take us that one step further in making mining a little safer. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity, working women stand to lose $250,000 over the course of their careers because of unequal pay practices. While women's wages and educational achievements have been rising, there's still a sizeable gender wage gap. This is a national disgrace. 
   Unfortunately, last week's Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear, does little to achieve fairness for American workers. In a narrow 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court threw out the case, not just because she wasn't being discriminated against but because she filed her claim too late. 
   This interpretation, which has been rejected by eight Federal appeals courts and the EEOC, fails to realize that employees are discriminated against every time they receive a discriminatory paycheck. 
   Congress needs to step in and stand up for ordinary people without delay. We should move quickly to pass Congresswoman DeLauro's Paycheck Protection Act that would provide remedies to women facing pay discrimination. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to live in an America where my daughter earns less than my son for doing the same job.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (NATIONAL STEM SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today as a cosponsor and a very strong supporter of H.R. 1051, the National STEM Scholarship Database Act. I want to commend my friend, Congressman Rush Holt, with whom I serve on the Education and Labor Committee, for introducing this vital piece of legislation. 
   America's global competitiveness will increasingly depend on our ability to attract more of our best and brightest students into technological careers. 
   Sadly, the U.S. is growing reliant on foreign talents to fulfill its science and engineering workforce needs. According to the National Science Foundation, 25 percent of all college-educated professionals in science and engineering occupations in the United States are foreign born. 
   The National STEM Scholarship Database addresses this problem by directing the Secretary of Education to establish a database on the Department's Web site with information on financial assistance for postsecondary and graduate programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This important database will help capable students who are interested in STEM careers find scholarships to support their studies. 
   We all know the cost of higher education is very expensive. In fact, two-thirds of undergraduate students are on some form of financial aid. Therefore, identifying funding opportunities is critical to the recruitment of aspiring STEM students. 
   H.R. 1051 is endorsed by all sectors of the technological workforce, and I urge my colleagues to help the U.S. stay globally competitive by voting for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 334, honoring the goals and ideals of National Community College Month. I am proud to have the opportunity today to acknowledge all the community colleges in my district, and I want to thank them for the invaluable contributions that they make to education, to the communities that I serve, to our State and to our Nation in general. 
   Community colleges offer affordable opportunities for students of all ages to receive a higher education, retraining for new jobs and other university preparation courses. In my district alone, our community colleges work directly with workforce development one-stop centers, providing critical computer literacy courses, technical training and basic education that are needed for newly emerging jobs. In particular, Richland Community College in Macon County in my district is in the process of pioneering a course to prepare workers for the biofuels sector that is quickly becoming a major industry in my home State of Illinois.     
   As factories and other companies leave to go overseas, or as new industries emerge, creating new jobs that require unique skills, community colleges become increasingly important to educate, train and equip the new workforce that will fill these jobs. Additionally, they cannot allow students who cannot afford to go to a 4-year university, but who have the ambition and talent to succeed at one, the opportunity to complete the first 2 years of courses at affordable prices, and then allow those students to transfer to larger schools. 
   For these reasons and many more, I am happy to stand today to honor Community College Month. As a member of the Community College Caucus, I am working hard with my other colleagues to make sure community colleges have the resources and funding they need to continue to offer the services that are so critical to all of our communities across our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating Community College Month by passing H. Res. 334.

   I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the family of Joshua, both for their tireless efforts to pass this legislation and for their son's brave service to our Nation. 
   Too many soldiers are returning from the battlefield with hidden injuries. According to the Department of Defense, 60,000 troops have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. Sadly, only a small number of our veterans receive or seek the help that they need. 
   H.R. 327 strengthens cooperation between the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, it creates a comprehensive program to screen veterans for mental health and suicide risk factors, and increases training for suicide prevention. 
   This bill is the first step in ensuring that we treat the psychological wounds of our troops by improving mental health coordination and our outreach to veterans. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 327.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. 
   When I met with local economic development administration officials in Moline, Illinois, over the February recess, reauthorizing and ensuring adequate funding for the State revolving loan fund was stated as the number one need that these administrators had in assisting the rural communities in my district. We all know that the ability to process and treat wastewater, as  well as provide clean water to a community, is the biggest challenge to economic development. In an area hard hit by offshoring and outsourcing of jobs, this assistance is critical to the 17th Congressional District of Illinois. 
   The Clean Water Revolving Fund is a top priority of the Democrats, and it authorizes $14 billion for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities and other water pollution abatement projects. 
   In addition, this bill renews the requirement that contractors and subcontractors on wastewater treatment projects constructed with assistance from the State revolving funds be paid at least the prevailing local wage rate, as determined under the Davis-Bacon Act. By guaranteeing payment of the prevailing local wage rate, Davis-Bacon provides a better standard of living. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Water Quality Financing Act to address your constituents' clean water needs and to uphold these important labor standards.

Already less than 100 hours into this new Democratic Congress, we have passed legislation to clean up House ethics rules, implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, raised the minimum wage, end Federal subsidies to Big Oil, and lower the price of prescription drugs and a college education.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, if I had been born in Colombia, I would probably be dead. As a former president of my labor union, my fight for higher wages, better working conditions, and secure pension could have cost me my life. 
   Thirty-nine trade unionists were murdered in Colombia in 2007, and they are being killed at a rate of over one per week this year. Even more alarming is only around 3 percent of cases result in convictions, illustrating the culture of violence that has existed in Colombia for decades. Inexplicably, President Bush wants to reward Colombia with a free trade agreement. Not on my watch. 
   The right to organize and bargain collectively is essential to human freedom and the passage of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would greatly diminish our Nation's reputation as a leader in the fight to end human rights abuses worldwide. We should not even consider this agreement until Colombia puts a stop to the violence against union organizers.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California. I rise today in strong support of this resolution. 
   Recently at a town hall meeting that I had, a man approached me, pulled out a picture of his son, said that he had just died in Iraq 6 months ago. His wife won't come out of the home. He said, ``I want you to promise me that when you go to Washington, you will do everything you can to make sure that this never happens to another family.''  
   Three days later, I called the family of Senior Airman Daniel Miller of Galesburg, Illinois, who lost their son to a roadside bomb explosion outside of Baghdad 2 weeks prior to when he was supposed to be coming home. I hope and pray I don't ever have to make another phone call to another grieving family. That is why I come to the floor this evening in strong opposition to the President's decision to deploy 21,500 additional troops in Iraq, and I strongly support this resolution. 
   The current situation in Iraq is grave, and it is rapidly deteriorating. The sectarian conflict is the principal challenge to stability in Iraq, and caught in the middle of this civil war are approximately 140,000 of our bravest troops. Over 3,000 troops have already lost their lives, while over 22,000 have been wounded. 
   Our current strategy has not made significant impact on reducing the violence. In fact, December 2006 was the third deadliest month since the war began. The cost of this war, both in the number of lives lost and the amount of dollars spent, has had a profound effect on Illinois and my congressional district. Out of the 3,128 deaths, 95 have been from Illinois, and eight soldiers from the 17th District. 
   But not only will an increase in troop levels not solve the fundamental cause of violence, it places us at a great disadvantage here at home. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the troop surge could require as many as 48,000 troops and as much as $27 billion, which is five times the amount of the President's request of $5.6 billion. Also the U.S. military will be forced to deploy many combat units for their second, third, and even fourth deployments in Iraq, and extend the redeployment of others. 
   Currently as we sit in debate on this resolution, 16,000 single mothers are serving in Iraq. This troop surge would only extend the time their children are left at home alone, with their mother or their father. 
   Since the military is already short thousands of vehicles, armor kits and other protective equipment, a troop surge threatens the readiness of our forces. In fact, if you saw the paper recently, a soldier was quoted saying he had to go to the junkyards to dig up pieces of rusted scrap missile and ballistic glass so they could armor the vehicles and make them combat ready. 
   While only a first step, this resolution is a good start. It does not give up on our troops or declare defeat in Iraq, but offers a new forward direction towards a nonpartisan goal of bringing our troops home safely, quickly, and securing stability in the region. 
   Already, this Democratic-led Congress has had 52 oversight hearings on various issues related to this war, and many of my colleagues have introduced several bipartisan measures that promote political and diplomatic engagements. 
   A person this evening said, Where do we go from here? I would strongly suggest that this administration try something it hasn't tried yet: diplomacy. It can work. You just have to have the courage to try. 
   In the coming weeks, I am hopeful that Congress will consider a comprehensive measure such as H.R. 787, the Iraq War De-escalation Act, of which I am a cosponsor. In addition to requiring the responsible redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq and allowing basic force protection, it launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative. I am thoroughly convinced that the only way we will attain peace in this region, in Iraq, is through diplomatic initiatives. 
   This legislation also makes the Iraqi Government responsible for their own destiny by establishing benchmarks concerning Iraqi military readiness to police their own country without United States assistance. 
   Finally, as a veteran myself, I also hope as we move forward we will adequately prepare for the return of thousands of new veterans. Our number one priority should be to fully fund the cost of veterans health care and PTSD benefits. 
   This administration's budget calls for cutting prosthetics by $2 million and severely cuts funds to the VA at a time when it is proposing an increase in troop levels. Without full funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, our veterans are left without the services they were promised when they pledged to defend this Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this resolution as the first of many steps towards bringing our troops home and securing our success in Iraq. As I told the gentleman at my town meeting, I promised him I would do everything I could so this would never happen again. That journey begins this evening

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act, introduced by my good friend and freshman colleague, Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland. 
   Mr. Chairman, global warming is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing our Nation today. But, as the impact of global warming becomes more and more visible, our children are increasingly disconnected from nature and the world around them.  
   Kids today spend less time playing outdoors than any previous generation. The Kaiser Family Foundation found kids ages 8 to 18 spend an average of 6 1/2 hours a day glued to the TV, playing video games, surfing the Internet, and talking on cell phones, leading to what has been called a ``nature deficit disorder''. 
   The No Child Left Inside Act addresses critical environmental challenges by strengthening and expanding environmental education in the classroom. This bipartisan bill provides schools with more resources and teacher training for environmental education. 
   Using environmental education in the classroom, we can transform playgrounds and parks into learning laboratories and recapture the interest and enthusiasm of students in the world around them. 
   Not only has environmental education raised test scores in math and reading, but it has also inspired school age children to become future stewards of the Earth. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3036 is an important step toward combating childhood obesity, promoting an environmentally-conscious society and improving the health of our planet. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the No Child Left Inside Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, last week British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that he plans to withdraw 1,600 British troops this summer. The administration's response, this is good news, because it shows that some good things are happening in Iraq. Nice spin. But one has to wonder why our closest ally in this war is pulling out troops at the very same time this administration wants to send 21,500 additional U.S. soldiers into Iraq. 
   The British say they are withdrawing their troops because the Shiite-dominated southern region is relatively calm. That is, indeed, good news. But if the British really believed, as this President does, that expanding number of troops in Baghdad would lead to the same results there, wouldn't they choose to move these troops into Baghdad rather than pull them out completely? 
   No matter how the Bush administration tries to spin it, the British withdrawal is not good news for the administration's troop escalation plan. Why should we be sending thousands more of our troops to Iraq when Britain and other coalition members are pulling out? It is time the administration stops spinning and instead answers these questions.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think tonight on three occasions or maybe four, we have heard, we need to put a face on trade. I encourage all the Members, here is the face. It is the face of a refrigerator in Galesburg, Illinois, manufactured by 1,600 machinists, signed on the last day before their jobs were exported to Sonora, Mexico, thanks to a trade agreement that didn't work. 
   This, my colleagues, is the face of people. This trade deal, while I commend the framework of it, puts the sheriff, as we have been hearing, the President of the United States, in charge of it. I sit on the Education and Labor Committee of the House. We have had three mine disasters. The President won't do a single thing to protect our miners. He won't sign the Employee Free Choice Act to give people a right to collective bargain for it. He will not stand up for America's workers. He has had to be sued by our own government for one OSHA standard. 
   Tonight we stand here ready to give this President oversight on this trade deal. I have been told, well, we'll just subpoena him. We're trying that. We're trying that with the legal counsel for this President and Josh Bolten. We'll see how far that gets us. 
   I take offense, to be honest with you, when people say you won't vote for any trade deal if you can't vote for this one. Let me say I'll vote for every trade deal, as long as it's fair, as long as it works for American workers, as well as the people that we seek to trade with. 
   How much longer are we going to continue to do this? Fifty-four percent of Republicans polled don't support this agreement. Almost 70 percent of Democrats don't support it, and 60 percent of Americans don't. 
   I ran on this issue. I am the product of a person whose dad lost their home, not because he did anything wrong, but because he lost his job. He made me promise two things, take care of your sisters and your mother, this is shortly before he died, and do not, whatever you do, PHIL, for a living, do not allow this to happen to another family. 
   I may only be in this Chamber for one term. I don't know. I ran on this issue. I stand on this issue. I'm proud of my voting record with this Democratic Caucus. I take a back seat to no one in party loyalty. But my first loyalty comes to the people who signed this refrigerator. I have no loyalty to the President of the United States when he has no loyalty to the people whose jobs he outsourced. 
   I tried to get an amendment before the Rules Committee that would say if you can get a free trade agreement, fine, but let's get the safety net for workers, one this Chamber passed that Mr. Rangel worked so hard on, whom I give him a ton of credit for. 
   Let me tell you what happens. The next day he says he's going to veto it. He won't insure 10 million children, he won't sign a safety net for workers, and we are going to pass tomorrow a trade agreement and expect this President to enforce it. Let me ask you all tonight not to be looking at us as though we are naysayers. We're not. 
   I would love to put my card in tomorrow and hit the green button, but I will not, because if I do, I will not come to back to this Chamber. I don't deserve to come back to this Chamber. 
   I ran to support these people. I have heard the term ``protectionism'' used this evening. If all of us, Democrats, Republicans, left, center and right are not going to stand up for the very people who sent us here, who are we going to stand up for? What are we as Members of Congress? 
   I ask you, tomorrow is a very big day. I guess I'm voting ``no.'' I don't guess, and I told two people today, I do so proudly. I wish I didn't have to. But I will remember Dave Bedard, who has been unemployed now after two wage concessions, no health care, a wife who has cancer. 
   One Member who is supporting this deal told me that I should go back to Dave Bedard. And when I said, what should I say to him, that Member said, You should talk about currency manipulation with him. 
   I should need a football helmet. He's going to punch me in the nose if I try. 
   Vote ``no'' on this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Peru Free Trade Agreement and the implementing legislation before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, my fight against the Peru FTA is a personal one. Districts like mine represent the very worst of unfair trade--jobs lost, economies devastated, and lives shattered. In 2004, the Galesburg Maytag Refrigeration plant relocated to Sonora, Mexico, leaving behind 1,600 unemployed workers--all innocent victims of bad trade policies. 
   On their last day, all the workers who were laid off signed the final refrigerator to roll off the assembly line. The inscription on the fridge reads, ``The last top mount refrigerator produced in Galesburg, Illinois with pride by the members of IAM Local 2063, September 14, 2004.'' Although devastated, the pride and spirit of these workers remained strong--a testament to the incredible workers we have in this country. 
   This year marks the 5th anniversary of Maytag's announcement that it would be closing its Galesburg plant. Five years later, the city of Galesburg is still recovering from the loss of Maytag and many of the workers are still unemployed. 
   Unfortunately, the economic nightmare Galesburg has endured is not unique. NAFTA outsourced a total of 1 million U.S. jobs nationwide with casualties in every state. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfair trade is not just a Midwest issue, it is a national crisis. 
   Weary of more bad trade deals, last November voters swept fair trade Democrats into office--sending a clear mandate for a new direction on trade. 
   And yet here we are. Voting on another one-sided, so called ``free trade'' agreement crafted by the Bush administration under fast track authority. 
   President Bush's use of fast track has been nothing but a blatant abuse of power. It has allowed him to force through 4 trade deals built on the flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model, one of them being the Peru FTA we are currently debating. 
   And we all remember what was left behind from NAFTA: the decimation of the U.S. manufacturing industry and the loss of high paying jobs. One must look no further than Galesburg to see what the future holds for American jobs if the Peru FTA is passed. 
   We can also expect the Peru FTA to benefit big business, similar to NAFTA. If this agreement is passed, one thing is certain, the rich will continue to get richer at the expense of the average, hard-working American. 
   Some who support the agreement will say that the Peru FTA is not NAFTA. They will say that the inclusion of labor and environmental standards set it apart from all former trade deals. Not so fast. 
   With President Bush's poor track record of enforcing labor rights, it remains to be seen  whether these improvements will have any affect at all. In fact, the President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said that he is ``encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions in the [Peru agreement] cannot be read to require compliance with ILO Conventions.'' We should be more than skeptical. 
   Moreover, just today the Peruvian government declared a strike by national miners illegal. So much for real reform. 
   In short, without the threat of enforcement, our trading partners, including Peru, have no incentive to uphold international labor standards. 
   Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the proposed Peru FTA would replicate--and in some instances expand on--many of the most devastating provisions of the flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model. 
   Despite ``fixes,'' the Peru FTA is nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
   The choice is crystal clear. 
   Today, Congress can choose to roll the dice when it comes to the loss of American jobs or we can choose to demand an agreement that bans off shoring. 
   Today, we can choose to entrust President Bush with enforcing labor and environmental standards as we did with the Jordan FTA or we can choose to accept that these standards will likely be ignored in Peru, just as they are in Jordan. 
   Today, we can choose to give big business another win or we can choose to stand with American middle class families. 
   Today, Congress can choose to expand the failed NAFTA-CAFTA model to Peru or we can choose to pursue a new trade policy. 
   I for one cannot go back to my district and explain that I voted for another bad trade deal that in all likelihood will result in more job loss. 
   I cannot in good conscience face the 1600 Maytag workers who lost their job and tell them that I voted to continue the hemorrhaging. 
   I came to Congress because I believe in fair trade that creates jobs and raises the standard of living for middle class families. I believe in keeping America competitive. But in my opinion, the Peru FTA does not pass the test. 
   For the sake of all workers, I will be voting NO on the Peru FTA. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   It is time that our trade policy starts serving the interests of America's working families.

   Northern Illinois University is less than 100 miles northeast of my congressional district, so news of the shooting hit close to home for me. At a time like this we find ourselves asking ``why?'' and jumping to conclusions about campus security and gun control. However, we seldom talk about the stigma of mental health in our Nation. I find it appropriate that on the same day we are considering this resolution, we are also debating the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, legislation that will make it easier for people to seek and receive mental health treatment. 
   I believe we need to do more on mental health care in this country in addition to other measures to make our schools, our children and our young adults safe. 
   Again, my condolences go out to all those affected by the horrific shooting at Northern Illinois University--may you find comfort in those still with you and my you come together as a community once again and move forward to better times.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (AIR FORCE TANKER DECISION -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Air Force tanker decision and its impact on our economy and jobs, especially during these hard economic times. 
   Recently, an independent report predicted that 14,000 jobs would be lost if the multibillion dollar Air Force tanker contract was awarded to a foreign company. And the report states, ``These figures understate the potential losses to U.S. employment.'' 
   Madam Speaker, it's outrageous that the Air Force officials did not take into consideration the economic impact of this decision. By outsourcing the production of the tanker, we are denying hardworking Americans good, high-paying jobs, and turning a blind eye to our deteriorating economic situation. 
   Madam Speaker, this tanker deal further jeopardizes the economic security of our Nation. At a time when America is facing a record-high level of unemployment recession, creating jobs in Europe is not in the best interests of the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress must address the broader economic concerns raised by the tanker decision. We owe it to the American people to take advantage of the opportunity to create jobs right here in the United States and resuscitate our failing economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (ESTABLISHING POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House today is considering H.R. 2790, a bill I authored to elevate the current position of Physician Assistant Advisor to a full-time Director of Physician Assistant Services in the VA Central Office. 
   I would like to thank my good friend Representative JERRY MORAN for leading the effort with me, as well as Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their cosponsorship of this legislation. I'd also like to acknowledge all of my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee who joined as cosponsors and the American Academy of Physician Assistants for their tireless work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are currently 1,600 physician assistants serving the Veterans' Health Administration, including many veterans, National Guard, and Reservists. PAs are a critical component of the health care delivery system and are responsible for roughly one-quarter of all primary care patients seen in the VHA. 
   The change from the current role of PA Advisor, who works part time and is based in the field, to a full-time Director is necessary in order to ensure that PAs are being appropriately and effectively utilized throughout the VHA. Right now the PA Advisor is being left out of strategic planning discussions and long-term staffing narratives, leaving PAs with no voice and no advocate. Additionally, there is a severe disparity throughout the VA facilities in how PAs are being used, what medical services they can perform, and even whether facilities can hire physician assistants. Most importantly, the unnecessary restrictions and widespread confusion are causing the VA to miss a clear opportunity to improve the quality of health care for our veterans. 
   One of the biggest challenges facing current and future PAs in the VA system is their exclusion from any recruitment and retention efforts or benefits. The VA designates certain positions, such as physicians and nurses, as critical occupations, which are given priority in loan repayment and scholarship programs. Since PAs are not designated as a critical occupation, they are excluded from these moneys, despite the fact that the VA has determined that physician assistants and nurse practitioners are functionally interchangeable and equal in the work that they perform. The underutilization, the lack of recruitment and retention efforts, and pay disparity are all leading PAs to not consider the VHA as a viable employment option. 
   Physician assistants are very important for veterans living in rural areas, like a large portion of my congressional district. Veterans that live in underserved areas made the same sacrifices as their urban and suburban counterparts. With a disproportionate number of these brave men and women being cared for by PAs, it is critical that we establish a system that will best serve their needs so as not to compromise care to our veterans. Considering the fact that nearly 40 percent of all VA PAs are projected to retire in the next 5 years, the VA is in danger of losing its physician assistants workforce unless some attention is paid to this critical group. 
   This bill will allow the Director of Physician Assistant Services to become an integral component within the VA system to proactively solve the many issues facing PAs and give PAs a fair and long overdue voice. 
   Mr. Speaker, this commonsense legislation promotes quality medical care for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2642, the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. 
   I am honored to stand here today as a freshman member of this Democratic Congress as we approve ``the largest'' funding increase in the 77-year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   It is my hope that providing $6.7 billion above last year's funding will only be the beginning of our commitment to the promises made to our service men and women. 
   All of us were outraged by the reports of what happened at Walter Reed. Part of the problem is for years the VA has been shortchanged on funding, due to understating its budgeting needs instead of proactively planning for the needs of our veterans. 
   This underfunding has resulted in budget shortfalls, understaffing of vets centers, a huge claims backlog, and inexcusable delays at VA facilities. 
   This bill represents a change in priorities. 
   It funds an additional 1,100 claims' processors to address the 600,000 backlog. 
   It provides $4.4 billion above 2007 levels for the Veterans Health Administration. This will help the VA treat the more than 5.8 million patients they expect in 2008. 
   Additionally, the bill increases funding for the VA's repair and maintenance accounts to prevent a VA medical facility from falling into unacceptable levels of disrepair. 
   I commend my colleagues on the VA Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing to the floor a bill that exceeds the recommendations of the veterans' service organizations of the Independent Budget. 
   We've seen a change in priorities and I am going to continue to support this momentum until all veterans who want access to healthcare in the VA system, have it. I urge all my colleagues to pass this bill that funds critical benefits for our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2199, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act. As a Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I had the privilege of working on this bipartisan bill, which I believe provides critical resources to our heroes with combat-related brain injuries. I commend Representative Altmire who initiated this effort and I thank VA Subcommittee Chairman Michaud, and VA Chairman Filner for quickly bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common wound suffered by troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan; unfortunately it is often undetected until it is too late. The bill before us today ensures we preemptively screen all veterans for brain injury and that we have the facilities and research necessary to provide the best care possible. 
   Additionally, this bill addresses the needs of the 44 percent of service members who live in rural areas, like those in my district, by establishing an Advisory Committee on Rural Veterans. It also creates a pilot program for mobile counseling and mental health services. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud we took up this bill in the Veterans' Affairs Committee because it is a strong investment in timely healthcare for our returning troops. I urge my colleagues to support our military heroes by voting for the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm a new Member of this institution. I sat here last night, along with a lot of Members of this body; and on my way, walking to my apartment, I was walking with another freshman Member, and we were talking about what did we just do. 
   It was what we didn't do. We listened to procedure after procedure, stall after stall, finger-pointing after finger-pointing; and here we were talking about, I thought, an appropriation for something that is incredibly important to this entire Nation. Our national security is at stake. 
   I'm going to say something also as a new Member. I will comment on the bill in a moment. 
   I want to commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Quite frankly, he has a much longer fuse than I have. So much finger-pointing going on. I know how much work that he and Representative Price and other people have put into these bills. 
   I'm not an appropriator. I'm a clothing worker, but I'm a freshman Member of this body, and I know finger-pointing when I see it. I know coming to the floor and getting your picture on TV and making sure the cameras hear every word that you say, but I also know the difference between right and wrong. And I will tell you this, Mr. Chairman, last night this was absolutely one of the worst dog-and-pony shows I've seen, and hopefully we will never have to revisit this again. 
   To the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, let me say, I understand how much work went into this, and to the appropriators, how many hearings went on. I heard about the 3 1/2 -month delay that we were blamed about, but the very same chairman of the Appropriations Committee was verbally blasted in this Chamber because he had the unmitigated gall to try to put things in that would give hurricane relief to people affected on the gulf coast, give an opportunity for people to be able to have better lives, a farm disaster, wildfires that we don't have any money for to put out. 
   How quick we can be to criticize. It's easy, very easy to do. 
   I'm here tonight to say to this chairman of the committee and to the appropriators, I thank you for the hard work that you have done. We'll get these passed. We have agreed to a rule that opened this Chamber up to allow people to be able to do it, to be able to offer amendments and to come to the floor. I didn't think we offered it so that we could just have a 2 o'clock in the morning marathon, but I was elected to do the work of the people of the 17th Congressional District. 
   This bill fulfills the commitment to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. How many years have we been waiting for that, Mr. Chairman? 
   It provides significant increased support to our first responders, to Customs and border agents and the Transportation and Security Administration. It appropriates $44 million above 2007 to infrastructure protection so communities can identify and assess critical security vulnerabilities. It funds disaster relief to the tune of $1.7 billion so our State and local governments can respond to declared disasters or emergencies. 
   My congressional district runs almost from the Wisconsin border to St. Louis. I've seen what floods can do to my district. I see what it could do to our farmers and how it can displace people. This bill provides $230 million to modernize and digitize over 100,000 flood maps used to determine rates for the National Flood Insurance program. 
   And the bill assures the consistent application of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage standards to construction projects funded with Federal grants. By guaranteeing payments of the prevailing local wage rate, this legislation facilitates a better standard of living and economic security for workers, particularly in rural communities and small towns in my district. 
   I want to close, Mr. Chairman, by again thanking the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I thank my friend Congressman Price for the hard work that he's put in. As I said, these bills will pass, and we will let the people of our district and the people of this Nation be the ones to decide which one of us, which Member of this body, really came here to do the work of the people. I did and so did many, many of my colleagues in this Chamber. But I will tell you what I won't do: I will not go back to my congressional district and apologize for putting in for projects. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hare) has expired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3920. 
   In 2004, Maytag Refrigeration Products in Galesburg, Illinois, closed its  doors and bolted for Sonora, Mexico, displacing 1,600 workers, all innocent victims of a bad trade policy. I asked my good friend Dave Bevard, a former Maytag employee, to testify before the House Education and Labor Committee about his participation in the TAA program. Dave's testimony revealed a program that was difficult to navigate and plugged with funding shortfalls. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today addresses these funding problems and gives trade-impacted workers the resources and tools necessary to successfully compete in the global economy. It provides workers with sufficient notice of mass layoffs, improves the processes by which workers obtain training, and strengthens access to affordable health care. 
   I'm pleased to see the inclusion of two of my provisions in the bill: one that would require the Department of Labor to inform workers about the availability of counseling and early access to training services, and another to help displaced workers get additional financing aid for training. I'd like to thank Ways and Means Chairman Rangel and Congressman Levin, and my chairman, Mr. Miller, for their leadership on this issue and for the help their staff provided to include these provisions that will greatly assist dislocated workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the current TAA program has not kept pace with globalization, and the bill before us aims to bring the TAA program into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this critical legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and commend Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Frank, and all Members and staff of the House leadership and Financial Services Committee who worked tirelessly, spending untold hours negotiating this bill with their Senate counterparts, the President, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve. 
   Madam Speaker, we as a nation find ourselves in an alarming financial crisis. But this crisis is bigger than a few failing banks or a stock market in disarray. It's more about family budgets than corporate balance sheets. Americans are losing their homes. Many are concerned about the future of their retirement savings. Some fear they won't have enough money to send their kids to college. The unwise and purely ideological decision to deregulate Wall Street has threatened our very way of life. It is with the best interests of working families in mind that I rise today to support this comprehensive rescue package. It is not a decision I made lightly. 
   Madam Speaker, the original plan which President Bush proposed to Congress was completely unacceptable. It was nothing more than a $700 billion handout to Wall Street. It gave unregulated authority to one person--the Secretary of the Treasury--to spend 700 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars without any accountability. The President's plan did virtually nothing to prevent more Americans from losing their homes, and provided no return to the taxpayers responsible for funding it. Finally, the Bush Plan did nothing to limit executive compensation--known as golden parachutes--for top executives who made the disastrous decisions that helped lead to this crisis. At a time when we need to more closely regulate Wall Street, the President's package actually rewarded it. 
   Under the leadership of Chairman Frank, a new bill was crafted to authorize, with strict independent oversight, limited funding to the Treasury to transparently buy the debts of troubled firms. This is not a gift. It is not a blank check. It is a loan. Any financial recovery that results from our action must be shared with the taxpayers. We are loaning these banks money so they can resume lending to ordinary people--families who need help with their homes, cars and college tuition; farmers to continue to buy equipment, seed and fertilizer; and small town banks to deduct losses from investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   This bill also gives the government a financial stake in some of these firms, which means not only will taxpayers get their money back, but they will also have the opportunity to turn a profit. Additionally, this bill limits pay for the executives of the firms to which the Treasury loans. Unlike the Bush proposal, it does not reward corporate greed. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is certainly not perfect. While it does give the government some ability to protect homeowners facing foreclosure, I feel much more work needs to be done. My family lost its home growing up. It broke our hearts. Congress must continue its efforts to address the housing crisis, a large contributor to our current economic woes. 
   In the final review of this bill, I believe the good outweighs the bad. It is a necessary step to protect Main Street from Wall Street. I urge all my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the pending Colombian free trade agreement. Since 1991, over 2,000 labor organizers have been murdered in Colombia. Many of these cases are never investigated, and the perpetrators go unpunished, ready to strike again. 
   For 13 years I served as the union leader for UNITE HERE Local 617. If I had born in Colombia, there is a strong possibility that I would not be here today fighting for working class people. My effort for higher wages, better working conditions, and a secure pension could have cost me my life. 
   Many will argue that the labor rights ``fixes'' in the May 10 agreement between the USTR and congressional leadership will be enough to prevent the deaths of union workers, but no worker protection provision comes close to addressing the brutal violations of workers' rights that we see in Colombia. 
   Mr. Speaker, in good conscience, I cannot support a free trade agreement that rewards Colombia with prized access to American markets as its workers live in constant fear.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2637, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. 
   This bipartisan legislation is designed to address the most serious child labor violations, deter repeat occurrences, and strengthen the enforcement of laws to protect our Nation's most vulnerable workers. 
   This bill would increase the maximum penalty for child labor violations that lead to the death or serious injury of a minor from the current cap of $11,000 to $50,000 per violation. The bill would also permit the penalty to be doubled to $100,000 if it is determined that the violation was repeated or willful. 
   Additionally, the legislation amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to reflect the increases in penalties for child labor violations and for minimum wage and overtime violations. 
   The current language in the FLSA provides limits of $10,000 for child labor violations, $1,000 for minimum wage and overtime violations. These penalties were increased to $11,000 and $1,100, respectively, by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. The legislation before us today would simply conform the language of the FLSA to reflect these changes. 
   The increase in maximum penalties for violation of child labor laws is an important first step in our efforts to protect the health and safety of the estimated 3.2 million workers under the age of 18. The National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health Administration estimates that every year 230,000 youth under the age of 18 sustain workplace injuries, and between 60 and 70 die from occupational accidents.     
   This translates into a youth worker injury every 2 days and a fatality every 5 days. 
   Current penalties do not communicate an adequate level of governmental concern for the health and safety of the working young and do not provide sufficient motivation for employers to ensure a safe and legal workplace for youth. 
   Given the pervasiveness of youth employment and injuries and the fact that the current maximum penalties are too low to demand compliance with child labor laws, this legislation represents an important improvement in our laws that will help provide a safer occupational environment for young workers 
   Mr. Speaker, the Child Protection Act of 2007 was proposed by the administration and is supported by Education and Labor Committee Chairman Miller and Ranking Republican MCKEON, as well as Chairwoman Woolsey and Ranking Republican JOE  WILSON of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. This bill represents an important first step in improving working conditions for our Nation's youth, and I urge all Members to support the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the immeasurable contributions of fathers in the lives of children, especially as we prepare to celebrate Father's Day this Sunday, June 17. While the amount of time a father spends with his child can be quantified, the total contribution to his child's healthy development cannot. Children with involved fathers tend to do better in school, have fewer behavioral problems and demonstrate greater self-control. 
   Supportive fathers also promote the positive physical, social, emotional, and mental development of their children. Responsible fatherhood can increase the chances children will grow up with two caring parents. Additionally, it can lead to reduction in child poverty and strengthen families as well as communities. 
   So as we come upon Father's Day, we would like to recognize and thank the fathers throughout this country who play an active role in the lives of their children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass House Resolution 474, recognizing the contributions of fathers in the healthy development of children, supporting responsible fatherhood and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children.

   On March 24, 2007, Barton College won the NCAA Division II Elite Eight Tournament by defeating the defending champions, Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota. College basketball fans, student athletes, and the general public were treated to an exciting national championship game with one of the greatest rallies in Elite Eight Tournament history. 
   Barton College had an extraordinary year. The team won all nine of its overtime games, an NCAA Division II record. The team also had a season record of 31-5 and won their last 21 games, which is a school record. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to Head Coach Ron Lievense, Athletic Director Gary Hall, Barton College President Dr. Norval Kneten, and Barton's student athletes for winning the national championship. 
   I also want to extend my congratulations to Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota, on an excellent season. Winona State finished their season with only one loss, which happened to be the national championship game.

   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and commend my Chairman, Mr. MILLER for his efforts to bring this legislation forward. The Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter versus Goodyear was a setback for fundamental equal rights. As a Member of the Education and Labor Committee I am pleased that the House is standing up today for America's workers by essentially invalidating this misguided ruling. 
   Mrs. Ledbetter's pay discrimination case was dismissed--not because she was not being discriminated against--but because the Supreme Court believed she filed her claim too late. 
   Under this decision, employees in Ledbetter's position are forced to live with discriminatory paychecks for the rest of their careers. Moreover, the Court's decision ignores the realities of the workplace--where employees generally do not know enough about what their co-workers earn or how decisions regarding pay are' made to file a complaint precisely when discrimination first occurs. 
   The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would clarify that every paycheck resulting from a discriminatory pay decision constitutes a violation of the Civil Rights Act. 
   When the Supreme Court sanctions discrimination through technicalities or misinterpretation, it is the job of Congress to clarify the intent of the law. We start this process today by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2831.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman from Maine, and I also want to just commend you for your leadership on this whole issue of trade. 
   When I first came to this body, I campaigned on the sole issue of trade; and they said there are a couple of people you need to look up right away. I needed to look up Representative MARCY KAPTUR and MIKE MICHAUD for standing up for ordinary people. 
   With all due respect to the President, I don't consider this fast track legislation; it is wrong track legislation. I am a card-carrying capitalist, and I have said this many, many times. But I came out of an industry, the clothing and textile industry. But, for the life of me, I don't understand, this President just doesn't seem to get it. We keep losing good-paying jobs overseas, and for the life of me we are one of the few countries I know that actually subsidize our manufacturers for going overseas, if you look at the east coast and look what happened in your area from Maine all the way down and you look what happened in the Midwest with Maytag. 
   Today I sat and I listened to a person from my district, Dave Bevard, who worked at the Maytag plant. He had 32 years in and his wife had 30, 62 years between the both of them. Here, these workers gave up two wage concessions, if you can believe that, to keep this plant open, $24 million from our State of Illinois in tax breaks to this company; and at the end of the day they ended up moving to Sonora, Mexico. The CEO of the company said, ``I don't care about the workers and the community. I am here to make a dollar for my shareholders.'' It didn't matter about the health care and the pensions. 
   And Dave brought up today, you know, we have trade readjustment funds and things of that nature, but, as the gentleman knows, by the time you get them you have to decide between your unemployment compensation and whether you are going to be retrained. Then they tell you, well, you should go into a field that is growing, maybe like health care. So he said, of the 2,500 people that lost their jobs at that plant, 400 people tried the medical care, thinking they were going to get into medical care. Well, that worked great for the schooling, but when it came to practical exercise to go in and be able to learn the trade and be able to do it, they only had room for 30 people. So, 370 people are left out in the cold. 
   Another woman wanted to go through and wanted to get into daycare and needed a 1-year program at the community college. They only had a 2-year program; and they said, well, maybe she should just try being a cosmetologist instead. 
   When you take a look at the way we do this and the way we treat our workers, I said today this is a moral issue that I think we in this Congress have. 
   I support trade. I will always support trade. I know our country needs it. But I ask, at what price? And I want to know why is it that this President feels he doesn't have to basically come to Congress for anything, as you know, but particularly when it comes to the trade issue. He can outsource it, he can fast track, and he can do whatever he wants to do, and there is no congressional accountability, no oversight. We are left with a package we can't even vote up or down half the time because he has the secret back-door deals. 
   I, for one, as a freshman am tired. I am tired of going back to my district and seeing people like Dave Bevard and his wife who, by the way, has cancer. He is going to lose his health care. 
   And I ask a question very simply of this administration and for those on the other side of the aisle and maybe some within my own party who think that this is the way to go. I want you to come to Gifford, and I want you to see what is left of that Maytag plant, and I want you to see the people whose lives have been affected by this and the lack of health care. 
   Their prescription programs that they had, now they have lost their prescription drug program that they had, it equals for some of them their prescriptions per month, the pension that they receive. Now, they don't even get a pension, they have no health care, and somebody is going to try to convince me that this trade deal is going to work and that this was in the best interest of our manufacturing base? 
   Now I can't in good conscience do that. I think we had some interesting hearings today, but, ultimately, we have to be able to stand up. 
   And I agree with the gentleman from Maine. We had a directive I think this past election. I campaigned on this issue, as you know; and I campaigned very strongly about it. I said, look, I support trade, I support fair trade. So I am a fair trader, and I think that is what we should all be. And I think we have an obligation, as I said before, to ask this administration but also ask of ourselves: Are we here to represent the Dave Bevards of this country? Or are we here to represent the CEO that took the jobs to Sonora, Mexico? 
   And they are going to keep doing it. Every single day we read of another small factory going. My clothing factory that I worked in was shut down, and now I hear that the remaining 350 people that were working there are hanging by a thread. Translation: In about a year, that plant is going to go simply because nobody wants to have  the initiative and the courage to stand up for an industry that has been hit, or dumping its steel. It goes on and on. 
   I don't want to use up the whole hour, but if the gentleman would just let me conclude by saying this. I would like to ask some of our folks on the other side that call me a protectionist, and I looked in the dictionary, and I think that means you are trying to protect something, and I am, and I know we are. We are trying to protect a basic fundamental right for people to have a decent-paying job. 
   You know, these aren't CEOs. These are ordinary people who want to put their kids through school, have health care. They want to be able to work, and work very hard, and be able to retire and not have to worry about it. 
   I am not going to stop on this issue, and I again applaud the gentleman from Maine for courage that he has. And I will promise you this, that I have said many times: I don't know how long I am going to be in this body, but as long as I am I am going to continue to come to this floor, I am going to continue to talk about those lost jobs and say we have to start thinking differently than we have before. 
   We have an obligation, and our obligation is to stand up for ordinary people. That is what I have always been about. And I think the basic job of a Member of Congress, when you really get down to it, after all is said and done, is all of us are here to do the best we can to help ordinary people out, to make their lives better, not complicated. 
   So to my friends on the other side that might think I am off base, I am not going to support fast track. I will vote against it. I am not going to have any part of outsourcing one more job from my district or from this country. I am going to stand up for workers, whether they are from Illinois or Maine or Ohio or Florida or wherever they are from, because we have a responsibility to do it. It is the right thing to do. 
   And, again, I just can't thank you enough, Congressman, for taking the lead on this. You and Representative Kaptur have been great inspirations to me as a freshman here and campaigned on this issue of trade. 
   And, by the way, I would just say to people listening, it is okay to run on things you believe in and lead with your heart and on the right issues, and every now and then the good guys do come out on top. So I thank the gentleman for allowing me to participate this evening and look forward to any questions or discussion you might have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, one of the things that I think we need to do here is we have to start bringing some commonsense back to all of this. I think sometimes we think in too broad of thoughts. For example, some of the questions I would ask is, why can we not make a television in this country anymore, why can we not make stereos, and why can we not have textile mills in this country? We have quality workers. They were trained. They knew what they were doing. 
   My colleague, Representative Kaptur, and I have been talking about getting a group of Members of Congress to go around to areas that have been hit and to interview those workers who have lost their jobs and to put it on tape and to show that to people. I would appreciate the gentlewoman might want to comment about that. 
   But what we are talking about here, Madam Speaker, is letting ordinary people tell us what has happened to them. These are people who are our veterans. They fought in the wars. They have come back, and they are working in the factory. They lose everything they have ever had, and some of them with very little or no notice at all, and yet we are so quick to want to find work outside of this country when we have people going to bed in this country hungry. Those jobs in Ohio and in Maine and in Illinois, they are gone. 
   I think we have to start doing something proactive. We have to stop this hemorrhaging of jobs, and we have to start thinking about how we are going to keep the jobs that we have here and expanding them. 
   The late Senator Humphrey said that the American worker was the most productive worker in the world, and that has never changed. So I appreciate the gentleman for giving me a little bit of time. I thank you for allowing me to speak this evening, but perhaps the gentlewoman from Ohio might want to comment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay honor to my hometown, the city of Galesburg, IL, for publicly speaking out against hate crimes. Galesburg has a rich tradition of promoting equality for all of its citizens. It was a stop on the Underground Railroad and home to the first anti-slavery society in the State of Illinois. 
   Mayor Gary Smith recently declared October Not in Our Town Month, an effort to combat violent, bias-motivated crimes designed to cause fear and intimidation among an entire group of people. 
   The Not in Our Town Month proclamation states, ``Hate groups shall not divide communities.'' It also urges the residents of Galesburg to ``join together to eliminate racism and violence and to declare that respect,  equality and freedom for all people be our goal.'' 
   Crimes based on prejudice are a poor reflection on our communities, and I congratulate Galesburg for refusing to stand by in silence.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (LANE EVANS POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for bringing this measure to the floor; and I thank the gentleman from the great State of Illinois and coauthor of H.R. 521, my friend, Mr. RAY LAHOOD, for his leadership and the Illinois delegation for their support. 
   Thanks also to the distinguished chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Waxman; and Mr. DANNY DAVIS, chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia; and to the leadership for their consideration of this tribute to a great Congressman, Lane Evans. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I rise today in support of H.R. 521, a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no one more deserving of this recognition than Congressman Lane Evans. On January 17, Mr. LaHood and I introduced this bill, and within days we received overwhelming support in favor of this legislation. To date, 82 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have signed on as cosponsors of H.R. 521. Not only have Members of Congress expressed support for the bill, but it has also been well-received by staff members; one staff member saying ``Anything for Lane'' and another stating, ``He's a great man who I have tremendous respect and admiration for.'' 
   We all know what kind of man Lane is, but for those who have yet to make his acquaintance, I am honored to have the opportunity to share with you the story of a very rare politician. 
   I met Lane on the campaign trail back in 1976. We were two young dreamers with the mutual goal of making a difference in this world. Soon after the election, we became a team. I traveled with Lane from one end of the district to another as he provided his legal services to working families, children and the poor. I can recall many times when Lane offered his services free of charge to elderly men and women in need of a will. It was not too long before the people of the 17th District of Illinois rewarded Lane for his sacrifices, his commitment to hard work and hardworking families. 
   In 1982, Lane ran for the congressional seat of the 17th District of Illinois. At the time, the manufacturing industry of western Illinois was suffering from an economic recession which left many looking for a new direction in representation. Lane's populist message, coupled with his plain-spoken personal integrity resonated with the people, and at only 31 years of age, this young legal services attorney was able to win the majority of the votes, which had been reserved for a Republican candidate for more than a century. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane has succeeded in politics by following the Marine motto, Semper Fi, always faithful to his principles, to his constituents and to himself. For 12 elections the people of the 17th District sent Lane back to Washington with confidence that he would represent their interests. 
   The secret to Lane's success was the value he placed in their trust. He never took the people who elected him for granted, and it showed. To anyone that walked through his door, Lane and his staff were always ready, willing and able to go the extra mile in assisting them. 
   Although Lane was a man who delivered on his promises to bring jobs, he also had three outpatient clinics built, and what mattered most to the people was the manner in which he represented them. What always struck me most about Lane was the humility he showed. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak this morning on behalf of the wonderful Congressman, and I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 521.  
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia, Ms. HOLMES NORTON for bringing this measure to the floor of the House. I thank the gentleman from the great State of Illinois and co-author of H.R. 521, Mr. LAHOOD, for his leadership and the Illinois Delegation for their support. Thanks to the distinguished Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. WAXMAN and Mr. DANNY DAVIS, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia. And to the Leadership for their consideration of this tribute to Congressman Lane Evans. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I rise today in support of H.R. 521, a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building''.

   Following the election, Lane asked me to represent him as his District Director. I was flattered that Lane thought so highly of me and entrusted me with the care of his constituency. I accepted because Lane promised me that I would never have to lie, and I can proudly say that in 24 years he kept his promise. It was not too difficult because even those who disagreed with Lane respected him and his commitment to serving on behalf of the middle class family. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane has succeeded in politics by following the Marine motto, ``Semper Fi''. Throughout his career, he has been ``always faithful'' to his principles, to his constituents and to himself. For 12 elections the people of the 17th sent Lane back to Washington with confidence that he would represent their interests. The secret to Lane's success was the value he placed in their trust. He never took the people who elected him for granted, and it showed. He prided himself on maintaining a first-rate constituent service program. To anyone that walked through his door, Lane and his staff were always ready, willing, and able to go the extra mile in assisting them. 
   Although Lane was a man who delivered on his promises to bring jobs to the Rock Island Arsenal and build veteran outpatient clinics, what mattered most to the people was the manner in which he represented them. What has always struck me most about Lane was the humility he showed towards everyone he knew. To everyone he was just Lane. He was more than a Congressman to the people of the 17th district, he was a friend. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane's sincere rapport with people was not limited to the 17th district. As a Vietnam era veteran of the Marine Corps himself, Lane had the remarkable ability to relate to our service men and women. His career in Congress is marked with legislative victories on behalf of the Nation's 24 million veterans. 
   Always a man of great conviction, Lane challenged those who ignored the harmful effects of Agent Orange exposure. Eventually, Lane was successful in his effort to pass legislation awarding compensation to vets exposed to Agent Orange. In the 108th Congress, he built on that legislative milestone by winning passage of a law that delivers health and compensation benefits to children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange who were born with spina bifida, representing the first time children of veterans will receive government benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane's crusade for veterans did not stop there. He was one of the first Congressional voices to speak out about problems experienced by Persian Gulf veterans, what is now known as the Gulf War syndrome. He also pushed Congress to increase funding for veterans programs, which were so important to him because they delivered needed government services to working class families. 
   At the end of the 109th Congress, Lane retired after serving 24 years as a distinguished Member of Congress. It was a sad day for veterans and the people of the 17th district of Illinois when Lane announced he would not run for reelection, but no one was more disappointed than Lane. In spite of all his legislative accomplishments, Lane still felt there was so much more that he could have done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that my first legislative action will be to honor my good friend and mentor, Congressman Lane Evans. My only hope is that when I leave this body I can do half the things that Lane has done for the 17th district, the State of Illinois, and the Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 521. 
   Lane, thank you for your support throughout the years. It means more to me than you will ever know.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, my constituents are frustrated and angry by rising energy costs and the impact on their businesses, their grocery bills, and their everyday lives. Today, we respond to that frustration and anger by considering the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. I rise in strong support of this legislation that increases our domestic energy supply, invests in alternative fuels, and ends taxpayer subsidies for big oil companies. 
   This important legislation includes several provisions to move us towards a 21st century energy policy. My friends on the other side of the aisle have called for increased drilling to capture more of our domestic resources. The bill does just that. 
   Advocates for the environment have called on oil and gas companies to produce oil on Federal land to which they already hold leases or give up those leases. This bill requires them to do just that. 
   After learning last week of the corrupt relationship between Big Oil and the Bush administration's Minerals Management Service, this bill strengthens oversight of the Interior Department. 
   Most importantly, this bill launches a clean renewable energy future that creates new American jobs, specifically in my home State of Illinois. 
   If this comprehensive bill isn't an all-of-the-above response to energy prices, then, quite frankly, I don't know what is. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of every energy vote I have taken in the 110th Congress, from addressing oil speculation abuses, cracking down on price gouging by Big Oil, improving public transportation options, releasing millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to increasing fuel economy standards in our vehicles and providing relief for consumers at the pump. 
   The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act pulls many of these measures together, moving us closer to ending this energy crisis and establishing real energy independence. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this incredibly wonderful piece of legislation.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. I commend my friend, Congressman KILDEE for bringing this legislation forward and I am honored to be a cosponsor. 
   As a former labor organizer, I know first-hand the importance of collective bargaining. I would not be here today as a Member of Congress if it were not for my union. Yet, 21 States do not fully protect the collective bargaining rights of public safety employees. 
   Firefighters, police officers and emergency medical personnel play a critical role in our Nation's homeland security. They are the first to respond to terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other mass casualty events. These workers deserve the same right to discuss workplace issues with their employer that the Federal Government already grants to most employees. Additionally, rank-and-file input improves communication and cooperation between employees and management for more efficient and coordinated operations that are necessary in our post 9/11 world. 
   This bill would establish minimum standards that States must meet regarding the process of collective bargaining with public safety employees. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is vitally important to our national security, public safety, and the rights of our first responders to pass H.R. 980. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment deals with critical access hospitals and their ability to provide crucial surgical services to rural communities. 
   Recently, three of these hospitals in my district have fallen prey to a narrow interpretation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that now prevents them from providing basic surgical services. 
   The CAH program was created as a Federal reimbursement system for small rural hospitals. Providing cost-based reimbursement through Medicare allows CAHs to be a vital part of the safety net for my small communities in my district. This reimbursement allows these rural hospitals to provide both emergency and primary care services for the elderly and disadvantaged. In particular, CAH reimbursements for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists enable tens of thousands of citizens in medically underserved areas to access surgical services every year. 
   Until December 31, 2006, the CAHs were being reimbursed for CRNA services. Now, in 2007, a new interpretation of the law excludes CAHs whose counties have gone through a reclassification process due to a new census process known as ``Lugar counties.'' 
   No new law has said that these CAHs should no longer be reimbursed for CRNA services, however. Now CAHs are being denied their CRNA pass-through payments. Most hospitals affected expect to average losses between $45,000 and $100,000; a drop in the bucket in overall health care dollars. But to these hospitals, this effectively terminates their ability to provide emergency surgical services. My amendment would fix the law to ensure that if a hospital is designated as a critical access hospital, then it is reimbursed for CRNA services. 
   Congress intended for CAHs to assist rural communities with limited access to health care services. I am committed to rectifying this unfair and harmful application of the law. 
   I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey.

   Mr. HARE. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   For 13 years, I cut men's suits at Seaford Clothing Factory in Rock Island, Illinois. I wouldn't be here as a Member of Congress if it were not for my union. My membership in UNITE HERE Local 617 afforded me access to higher wages, good benefits, and invaluable workplace safety protections. 
   Under the Souder amendment, the NLRB could not enforce either party's obligation to bargain in good faith following a voluntary recognition. This would undermine the rights of potentially millions of workers who have already organized under voluntary recognition agreements and already engaged in collective bargaining relationships. 
   Majority Sign-Up has been available under the National Labor Relations Act since 1935. It's proven to reduce strife in the workplace, resulting in better labor-management relations. Majority sign-ups also reduce coercion and pressure, compared to NLRB elections, which is why I'm a strong proponent of the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   As my colleague mentioned, the Souder amendment would force all workers into the broken, unfair, undemocratic election system and strip away the freedom of contract. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to vote against the Souder amendment which would take a huge step backwards for the rights of American workers, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening in strong opposition to the pending Peru Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA promised Americans 200,000 new NAFTA jobs, higher wages and an increasing U.S. trade surplus with Mexico, just to name a few. Now, nearly 15 years later, the evidence shows that NAFTA has failed to make good on its promises. 
   In fact, in many areas in which benefits were promised, conditions are worse than before NAFTA went into effect. For example, in direct contradiction to the promises of NAFTA, nearly 1 million jobs were destroyed directly by the NAFTA free trade deal. 
   My district, in particular, has suffered the loss of 1,600 jobs; and NAFTA forced Maytag to leave Galesburg, Illinois, for Sonora, Mexico. And just last week, it was announced that Carrhart Manufacturing, a clothing company, will cease production and move to Mexico at the end of December. 
   Every aspect of the city of Galesburg is hurting. The economy, the schools, the small businesses that feed into these plants, and the citizens have lost their spirit. Now Galesburg is trying to rebuild its identity, but I fear that the Peru FTA promises more of the same. 
   The proposed Peru FTA would replicate, and in some instances expand, on many of the most devastating provisions of the flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model. First, the Peru FTA preserves many of the CAFTA terms providing extreme foreign investor rights. The provisions in the Peru FTA allow foreign investors to skirt U.S. courts and laws and give foreign investors the authority to sue the United States Government in foreign tribunals for violating their FTA-granted rights. 
   Second, the Peru Free Trade Agreement includes the NAFTA-CAFTA procurement chapters on Buy America and anti-offshoring policies. The FTA requires foreign firms be treated the same as American firms seeking government contracts, challenging our right to invest tax dollars into American jobs and businesses. 
   Several groups have publicly opposed the Peru FTA for those very reasons, including the two largest trade unions in Peru. 
   The September 17 Change to Win Coalition letter states: ``Chapters of the Bush-negotiated FTA that literally replicate job-killing aspects of the core NAFTA-CAFTA model have not been addressed. Not one word was changed from the Bush-negotiated text.'' 
   In addition, the Interfaith Working Group on Trade and Investment released a statement saying: ``Based on our experience with NAFTA and CAFTA, the U.S.-Peru FTA will cause lost livelihoods in rural communities, reduce access to life-saving medication and perpetuate the global `race to the bottom' for workers and environmental protection.'' 
   But to make matters worse, no one seems to have faith in this President to  enforce the labor standards negotiated in the May 10 agreement. This administration cannot and will not enforce American worker safety right here in the United States. 
   In a statement released on May 11, AFL-CIO President, John Sweeney, reminded us of the Bush administration's past failures by saying: ``The Bush violations against nations like Jordan and China remind us there is no guarantee the executive branch will enforce any new rights workers may gain through these negotiations.'' 
   The machinists labor union echoed Mr. Sweeney's statement in a letter to Congress dated August 2. It states: ``We are well aware of this administration's dismal record when it comes to workers' rights. For example, it has refused to issue a trade complaint against China for workers' rights violations described fully in AFL-CIO submissions. Given its past record, we fear that this administration will simply ignore even the most egregious labor violations.'' 
   Recently, I received a letter from two Peruvian labor federations concerned about the labor provisions in the pending FTA. 
   Madam Speaker, our trade policies must start to serve the interests of America's working families and workers around the globe. We can do better. We need to overhaul our trade readjustment program. We need to calculate the loss of American jobs when this bill goes into effect, and we need to remember that our majority is here because working men and women demanded that we look out for them and their families. 
   Let's slow down, vote ``no'' on this trade deal, and stand up to those people who stood up for us. That, Madam Speaker, is the very least that we can do. I urge my colleagues to please vote ``no'' on the Peru agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (HONORING DENNIS KING ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Chief of Staff, Dennis King, who is retiring from the House of Representatives after 33 years of distinguished public service. 
   Dennis, a native of Miami, Florida, first came to Congress as a Special Assistant to the late Representative Dante Fascell. He then served as Chief of Staff for my friend and predecessor, Representative Lane Evans. 
   When I asked Dennis to continue in the same role on my staff, he enthusiastically accepted, saying he felt like he had ``unfinished business to take care of.'' Dennis' decision to extend his service shows his dedication, not only to the people of the 17th District of Illinois, but to working families and to veterans everywhere. 
   Dennis and I have been very close friends for over 25 years. We share the same values. Some might wonder how Dennis, a Duke University graduate with a Georgetown law degree, could form such a close bond with me, a factory worker from West Central Illinois. It's simple. Dennis cares about the people of the 17th District as much as I do. 
   When Congressman Evans hired me to be his District Director and Dennis was my supervisor, he had faith in me from day 1, serving as a mentor and pulling me from the edge of the cliff during the times I lost my way. I will always be grateful for the chance Dennis gave me. 
   And Dennis is also a congenial and friendly person. Current and former staff say they will miss sitting in his office talking about everything from politics to family to sports. No matter what time of day or how busy Dennis was, he always put down whatever he was doing the minute someone walked into his office. The care and attention he gave to every single person is one of the major reasons he's so beloved. 
   Another trait I admire in Dennis is his brilliant political mind. I asked him to be my Chief of Staff because, as a new Member of Congress, I knew I needed someone who understood Capitol Hill inside and out, and whom I could trust to keep me on the right path. Dennis has amazed me with his intuitions, decision-making and loyalty, always choosing the right course for the people of my district and this Nation. 
   It cannot go without saying that when one thinks of Dennis King, one thinks of Lane Evans and vice versa. The two men were like brothers, a friendship that started when they attended law school at Georgetown University. And together they made history fighting for veterans and working families across our Nation. 
   Dennis often mentions how much he learned from Lane, but the truth is that Dennis taught Lane so much as well. He was an integral part of all the great things Lane was able to accomplish. 
   I want to also acknowledge Dennis' family, his wife, Nancy, and his two sons, Steven and Jeffrey. As most of you know, the job of Chief of Staff can take a toll on one's family. The time commitment is great and the stress can be overwhelming. Nancy has demonstrated remarkable patience over the years and remains an incredible source of support for Dennis. Next year Dennis and Nancy will celebrate their silver wedding anniversary, a true testament to their love and respect for each other. I wish them both the best in whatever life brings them. 
   And Dennis, although I say this with a heavy heart, congratulations on your retirement. Thank you for your service, your laughs, your hard work. Your efforts and advice have allowed us to accomplish many great things in my first term and have ultimately made me a much better Member of this body. Your spirit, humor, intelligence and the ease by which you led the Hare team will be missed. 
   Best of luck, and please keep in touch. 
   God bless.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. By passing this bill today, we make the largest single investment in higher education since the 1944 GI bill. 
   College costs have grown nearly 40 percent in just the last 5 years, and too many students have found themselves drowning in debt or, worse, unable to afford an education at all. I believe education is an investment, not an expenditure. This bill will increase our Nation's competitiveness and allow Americans from all economic backgrounds to achieve the dream of a college career. 
   This act would make need-based student loans more easily accessible and provide for additional mandatory funding for the Pell Grant scholarship, benefiting nearly 230,000 students in my home State of Illinois. 
   The bill also cuts the interest rate on subsidized student loans in half over the next 5 years and includes tuition assistance for students who teach in the Nation's public schools and loan forgiveness for college graduates who go into public service professions. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 2669.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, the Fair Minimum Wage Act is an important step toward strengthening America's middle class by providing hardworking Americans with the wages they have earned. I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   As the son of a union machinist and a former employee of a clothing factory, I understand the struggles many Americans face in trying to meet basic needs at minimum wages. Increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour provides a necessary raise to 13 million of America's lowest paid workers. 
   For too long we have ignored the plight of American working families. Providing a more reasonable wage is not only a commonsense issue but a moral one as well, and I am proud that one of my first few votes in the Congress of the United States will be to extend economic fairness and justice to deserving workers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, today's college students are graduating with increasing levels of student loan debt. In Illinois, the average Stafford loan debt for students who graduate from a 4-year university is over $14,000. Unfortunately, the cost of college tuition is skyrocketing, forcing more and more students to rely on loans than ever before. Because I believe higher education should provide economic opportunities for our students and not bankrupt them, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. 
   This legislation will cut interest rates on subsidized loans in half, saving the average student thousands of dollars over the life of his or her loan. Additionally, by making student loans more affordable, H.R. 5 allows many qualified students from middle- and lower-income families to go to college who would not have been able to go to college before. 
   On behalf of the many students in my district, such as those at Western Illinois University with whom I will be discussing this issue this weekend, I will vote for H.R. 5 and will work on the Education and Workforce Committee to find better opportunities for students and their hardworking families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4156. 
   For the last 4 years, President Bush has demanded more and more money from this Congress for the war in Iraq, draining funding from domestic priorities in the process. And this year's just no different. 
   True to form, in October the President casually requested an additional $200 billion to continue his failed policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, every time I travel back to my district, constituents plead with me to stand up to this President and end the war. Fortunately for them, the days of the rubber-stamp Congress are over. This bill before us holds the President accountable. 
   The bill provides only $50 billion of the President's $200 billion request, which serves to meet the immediate needs of our troops currently deployed, while the balance is dependent upon progress in Iraq. 
   The funding is also conditioned on the redeployment of troops from Iraq to begin within 30 days of enactment, with a target for completion by December of 2008. 
   Passage of this bill is the first step towards forcing a change of course in Iraq, shifting the mission from the combat forces to a comprehensive strategy. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4156.

Our appropriation priorities will better protect the Nation against terrorism by including 3,500 more firefighting grants and better protect our neighborhoods against violent crime by investing in 12,000 new police officers. 
   We also invest in community health centers so that they can provide essential health care services to more than 1 million additional Americans. We beefed up cancer and other lifesaving medical research so that we can continue to look for cures for these devastating diseases. 
   And we make the largest investment in veterans health care funding in the history of the Veterans Administration, ensuring that our veterans get the health care they are entitled to. 
   Mr. Speaker, we once again invest in priorities that were neglected by the old Republican Congress, and we do it in a fiscally responsible way following pay-as-you-go policies that will lead us to no new deficit spending.

<TEXT>
    Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act. As a Member of the Education and Labor Committee I had the privilege of participating in a hearing at which Eric Peoples, a former microwave popcorn worker, testified. Mr. Peoples had contracted a respiratory disease from exposure to the butter flavoring chemical, diacetyl, during his work at the factory. I was appalled to find out that despite the mountain of evidence showing the links between diacetyl and respiratory damage comparable to inhaling acid, the workers were told this product was safe. Now, Mr. Peoples struggles with only 24 percent lung capacity and is waiting for a lung transplant. 
   OSHA is failing to protect workers from chemical hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, occupational diseases caused by exposure to chemical hazards are responsible for an estimated 50,000 deaths each year. 
   This bill does the job OSHA has failed to do. H.R. 2693 would require OSHA to issue an interim final standard to minimize worker exposure to diacetyl at popcorn manufacturing and packaging plants. OSHA would then be required to issue a final standard within 2 years that would apply to all locations where workers are exposed to diacetyl. 
   It is necessary for Congress to take this step to protect our workers. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in passing the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, the American people have paid a tremendous price for our 5-year occupation of Iraq. Over 3,100 U.S. lives have been lost and more than 23,000 wounded, and nearly half a trillion taxpayer dollars have been spent. In my own congressional district, nine servicemembers have given their lives to the conflict in Iraq. 
   I am committed to bringing our troops home safely and as soon as possible. The legislation before us today holds the Iraqi government accountable by imposing strict benchmarks for success. If the President cannot show that the Iraqis have met these standards by July 1, 2007, a troop withdrawal will begin immediately and must be completed within 180 days. 
   These measures not only provide the support our troops need and deserve, but they also force this President to think twice before asking our brave military men and women to serve a third or fourth tour in Iraq, and requires and provides the resources our troops need when they come home.  
   But this bill also honors our veterans by investing billions of additional dollars for their health care. And, for the first time since this war began, Congress is not giving the President a blank check. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe we can bring a reasonable, timely end to the war in Iraq, and if this bill does that, we will also protect our troops.

   Mr. Speaker, last Thursday was a bittersweet day for me. I had the incredible honor of being sworn in as a new Member of the United States Congress in front of my family, friends and constituents. Yet part of me was sad that my friend and mentor, Congressman Lane Evans, wasn't in my place. 
   Lane served as a distinguished Member of this body for 24 years until Parkinson's disease forced him to retire at the end of the 109th Congress. Lane's battle with Parkinson's is a testament to his incredible spirit that never caused him to ask, Why me, although retiring meant he had to leave Congress when there was still so much he wanted to do, helping veterans, working families and his constituents. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane is just one of millions of Americans struggling with chronic illnesses that are curable with the advancement of stem cell research. 
   Spencer House is the son of my very good friend Doug. He suffers from diabetes and must take four insulin shots each and every day. But Doug is encouraged by the hope that lies in embryonic stem cell research to offer his son a more normal life. And he is not alone. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans support ethical embryonic stem cell research as a way towards preventing others from having to live with illnesses like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and spinal cord injuries. 
   I am an original cosponsor of this commonsense legislation because the science of stem cell research is clear: Embryonic stem cell research has the potential to treat and cure some of our most debilitating injuries and diseases. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we decide whether to give the American people hope or continue to prolong the suffering of those who struggle with curable chronic diseases. I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 3.

As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I had the privilege of working on this bipartisan bill, which I believe will help more children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed. Not only does this bill improve teacher quality, expand access and strengthen school readiness, it also addresses the unique challenges faced by rural Head Start programs. 
   Much of my district is rural. Therefore, I worked with several of my colleagues to ensure Head Start providers receive the support and flexibility required to serve America's rural communities. Specifically, we provided the assistance needed to improve transportation services in rural areas, the recruitment and retention of qualified instructors for rural programs and outreach to rural families. Later today, I will offer an amendment with my colleagues, Congressmen SPACE, WELCH and ALTMIRE that will further expand this assistance to rural Head Start. 
   Head Start is the country's premier early education childhood development and education program, serving more than 900,000 of our Nation's most needy families annually. Children who attend Head Start make gains in vocabulary, early writing and social behavior and enter school better prepared than lower income children who do not attend Head Start. 
   It is critical that all eligible families know about Head Start and that Congress allocates the necessary resources Head Start providers need in order to continue and expand these successful programs.

   Mr. Chairman, I am honored to join Congressmen Space, Welch and Altmire in introducing this amendment to improve Head Start programs for rural communities. 
   Much of my congressional district is rural. Therefore, I am very sensitive to the unique challenges that Head Start centers and rural families face in providing or accessing Head Start programs. Some of these challenges include instructor shortages, access to Head Start programs and outreach to eligible families. 
   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I had the privilege of addressing these concerns during the markup of this bill. The amendment we present today expands those efforts by directing the Education Secretary to provide the technical assistance and training to remove barriers to professional development, parental involvement, home visits and health screening in rural areas. 
   It is my hope that with this commitment from the Secretary and with the addition of services geared towards the needs of rural families, more eligible children will enroll in and experience the benefits of the Head Start program. Rural communities consist of the low-income populations that Head Start was created to serve. Therefore, it is critical that we address the challenges these communities face in administering Head Start to ensure that those families have the access to the opportunities they need and they so much deserve. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for helping me on this issue, and I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' to improve the rural Head Start program by passing the Space-Hare-Welch-Altmire amendment.

   The resolution that we are debating this week is a straightforward two-page bill. First, it highlights our continued support for our troops in Iraq. And second, it voices opposition to the President's troop increase plan. 
   The American people don't want Congress to continue to shirk from its responsibility to oversee the Bush administration's implementation of this war. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened in the Senate, where a bipartisan resolution opposing the President's troop escalation plan is being kept hostage from the Senate floor by Republicans who seem content to allow the President to conduct this war any way he sees fit.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, this week we finally got an objective analysis of the situation in Iraq. We shouldn't be surprised that it differs significantly from the status report from the White House last month, which painted a much rosier political and security scenario in Iraq. Nor should we be surprised if its conclusions are different from a final report that is scheduled to come from the President this week. 
   The GAO findings are not a surprise. When President Bush began this troop escalation plan, he promised this Congress that the Iraqis must meet these benchmarks, and, if they did not, they would lose the support of the American people. 
   Many of us who opposed the troop escalation plan were skeptical the Iraqis would be able to meet these benchmarks and that 30,000 more troops would bring about any real improvements in securing Iraq. The GAO report shows that our concerns were justified. 
   With the failure of the Iraqi Government to meet 15 of the 18 benchmarks, it is clear that a change of course is needed. I would hope that my Republican colleagues would stop blindly following President Bush and conclude, much as this Nation has, that it is time to begin bringing our troops home.

The President said he wasn't aware of these problems until the Washington Post investigation, but several GAO reports have been released outlining some of these problems. Was the administration ignoring these reports or just ignoring the problem?

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush used his veto pen to strike down a bill that would provide health coverage to 10 million children. In explaining his veto, the President used rhetoric that has no basis in reality. The President claims that the focus of the SCHIP should be on poor children rather than to expand the program. But the fact is this bill does not expand the program, it simply allows for the coverage of more kids who are already eligible. As Republican Senator Hatch pointed out, for those who argue that it's out of control, 92 percent of all the kids who will be covered by this bill will be families under 200 percent of the poverty level. 
   The President also falsely says that the bill would cover kids in families earning $83,000 per year, but no State covers kids at that level now, and the bill actually reduces Federal support for coverage of children at higher income levels. The President's claims are simply wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, the question now for House Republicans is, are they going to stand behind the President's false claims about the children's health bill, or will they join us in overriding the President's veto?

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
   Every April I participate in ``Equal Pay Day'' with my friend, Representative Rosa DeLauro, and other colleagues. This is the time of year when wages paid to American women ``catch up'' to the wages paid to men from the previous year. In other words, because the average woman earns less, she must work longer for the same amount of pay. The legislation before us today addresses this unacceptable reality. 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. This wage disparity will end up costing women anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million over a lifetime in lost wages. Making matters worse, the wage gap grows wider as women age and move through their careers, creating serious economic security concerns. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will strengthen pay equity laws by closing the loopholes that have allowed employers to avoid responsibility for discriminatory pay, and help build economic and retirement security for women. 
   It is in the best interest of all Americans to ensure that every worker is treated fairly and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I commend Ms. DeLauro for introducing the legislation and for her leadership on this issue over the past decade.

Unlike past Republican budgets, our budget returns to surplus in 2012. 
   The new budget makes investments in energy, education, and infrastructure, while also providing tax relief to middle class families. The agreement does not include any new tax increases. In fact, it does support significant tax relief for middle class families, including extension of marriage penalty tax relief, the child tax credit, and the continuation of the 10 percent tax bracket. It also includes an additional year of the alternative minimum tax relief. 
   The budget also ensures that veterans get the quality health care they need and protects our homeland. It also rejects cuts proposed by the President to important first responder programs like the COPS program.

   Today, as we continue to rebuild, we stand united in our resolve to protect this Nation from further threats. This new Democratic majority implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, a critical step towards ensuring the security and safety of the American people. May all of us pause in our own way to remember the sacrifices of so many of our fellow Americans, and may God always hold each and every one of them in arms of love.

   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend Eva Geiringer Schloss for her efforts to educate our Nation about the evils of racism and hate. 
   Eva was born in Austria in 1929. When the Nazis invaded, she and her family went into hiding in Amsterdam until they were arrested on Eva's 15th birthday. 
   Eva was sent to Auschwitz, where she endured the daily degradation of the concentration camp that robbed so many of their lives. Eva's father and brother were killed in the Holocaust. She and her mother were liberated by the Russian army. 
   Eva Geiringer Schloss has traveled throughout the United States educating thousands of people about the dangers of unchecked prejudice and hate. A play based on Eva's life entitled ``And Then They Came for Me'' has been presented all over the country and will be performed in my district to mark the Holocaust Remembrance. 
   It is my honor to recognize Eva, a courageous woman who endured unimaginable brutality and has dedicated her life to fighting injustice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, this Saturday is Workers Memorial Day, when we mourn the loss of workers who have been killed on the job or from work-related diseases. Additionally, this year marks the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Although there has been progress, thanks to the tireless advocacy of organized labor, many workers are still at risk. Last year, in Illinois alone, 194 occupational fatalities were recorded. Unfortunately, OSHA, under the Bush administration, has issued only one major standard in its 6-year tenure, and has either withdrawn or delayed dozens of worker protection measures. 
   Congress must ensure the first step of workplace safety by requiring that OSHA issue timely standards and ensure the enforcement of those standards in all areas of the workforce. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight, and I encourage all Members of Congress to honor our Nation's workers this Saturday.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (GAO'S GOOD DECISION FOR WARFIGHTERS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a victory for the American people. On Wednesday, the Government Accountability Office ruled that the Air Force broke its own contracting rules when it awarded a multi-billion dollar tanker contract to the Northrop Grumman Airbus team and recommended that the Air Force reopen the competitive bidding process. The GAO said the Air Force made ``a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman.'' 
   Let me just touch on some of the main points of the GAO ruling. 
   The Air Force did not assess the relative merits of the tanker proposals in accordance with the criteria that the Air Force established. The Air Force awarded Northrop's bigger tanker extra credit even though no consideration was supposed to have been given for exceeding key performance objectives. The record did not indicate, as the Air Force claimed, that the Northrop tanker could refuel all current Air Force fixed-wing aircraft. 
   The Air Force conducted ``misleading and unequal decisions'' with Boeing by informing Boeing that it fully satisfied a key performance objective but later determined that Boeing had only partially met this objective. 
   The Air Force unreasonably favored Northrop after the company refused to agree to help set up maintenance depots within two years of the first airplane delivery, and the Air Force miscalculated the life-cycle costs of Boeing's tanker and incorrectly concluded that the Northrop tanker would have lowered costs. 
   The Air Force improperly increased Boeing's estimated nonrecurring engineering costs in accounting for program risk. 
   The GAO found seven major flaws in this election process, Mr. Speaker. Not one or two, but seven. 
   Mr. Speaker, most were doubtful that the decision would be overturned. Experts said it was highly unlikely that the GAO would uphold Boeing's protest because the GAO rarely sides with the protesting company. But fortunately for the American people, the GAO saw what Boeing had been saying all along: the competition was unfair and fundamentally flawed. 
   The GAO ruling leaves the Air Force with only one option: recompete the bid. Now, the Air Force has the opportunity to conduct a fair and open competition. And I strongly encourage them to consider an American company. Our economic and national security depends on it. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the GAO ruling in favor of Boeing is welcome, the GAO ruling does not address the broader economic and national security concerns raised by the tanker decision. The first, jobs, jobs, jobs. 
   Over the last 5 months, a record number of jobs had been lost, most of them from the manufacturing sector. In May, the unemployment rate made a 22-year high jump, reaching its highest level in more than 3 1/2 years. But Air Force officials stated that employment effects were not considered in awarding the contract. And as a result, tens of thousands of good, high-paying jobs will be created in Europe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. I'm happy to. 
   And let me say, Mr. Speaker, I refer my colleagues to an article titled ``Bailing Out On America'' out of the EPI Briefing Paper. It is a job analysis report on the tanker decision from the nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, The Economic Institute. 
   The report titled ``Bailing Out On America. Air Force tanker decision will ground at least 14,000 U.S. jobs,'' found that Boeing recreated at least twice as many U.S. jobs as the Northrop Grumman European Airbus team. According to the EPI report, Airbus Northrop exaggerates its own job claims. Equally important, the report states that U.S. job losses are likely to grow in the future if the contract is awarded to EADS because it will give the company sizable cost advantages and will lug up the future competitions to supply tankers to the Air Force. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when America is facing a recession, creating jobs in Europe is not in the best interest of the American people. We owe it to the American people to take advantage of the opportunity to create jobs right here in the United States and resuscitate our failing economy. 
   Several other issues remain outstanding not addressed in the GAO which includes a pending case before the World Trade Organization against EAD, the parent of Airbus, for accepting illegal subsidies, a violation of international trade laws. This and other issues must be addressed before the tanker program can move forward. 
   And let me just, if I could, my friend, just conclude by saying a couple of things. 
   We're fighting two wars here. We just got through passing billions of dollars to fund them. Not too long ago, the guidance system for bombs, I don't exactly know the exact part that was manufactured in India, was shipped off to be manufactured in China. That work is gone. National defense is a risk, in my opinion, and those jobs aren't coming back; and now we have a company who wants to build tankers outside of this Nation not knowing if tomorrow this company or this country that we seek to have this plane made by is going to remain friends with the United States. 
   I was on a talk show program and was amazed at the number of calls that I got from people saying, What are they thinking out there? How could they outsource national defense items to be manufactured by somebody other than the United States when we're at war? I have an arsenal in my district that made the Up-Armored Humvee doors that saved hundreds of lives, and I have to tell you, it makes no sense. 
   All we asked for was a fair shake for Boeing. The GAO report, I think, will give Boeing the opportunity to compete on what is fair. I commend the GAO for doing this, but let me be clear. We have an obligation to protect this country when we're at war, and the products that we produce to protect our men and women and to fight and sustain this war, whenever possible, ought to be made in this country and ought to be made by American workers. 
   And I thank my friends for inviting me this evening.

   Mr. HARE. Will the gentleman yield? You know, you just mentioned $13 billion. We've tried now on two occasions to insure 10 million children for $6 billion. So if you take a look at the cost overrun just on the hangers and you look at the amount of money that we're spending--I think what's really important to also note here is the GAO rarely does this. Normally, the expectation would be that they were going to go with what they had. And when you read this report, and as my friend from Oregon said--and I hope that every Member of this Chamber will read it because I think it's critical if you're going to make an informed decision on this--if you read this, you will see that, indeed, Boeing didn't have a chance to compete fairly, you had tremendous cost overruns into the billions of dollars, you have thousands of American jobs. But again, I go back to my friend and say, this is a Nation at war fighting two wars, and we cannot allow the outsourcing. 
   My friend from Kansas mentions with great pride that she has bases, and these soldiers need and expect the best equipment, and Boeing can give that to them. But most importantly in this whole process is the whole question of fairness. We said this before. When I met with the Boeing people, they said, look, we don't want favoritism here, we just want some fairness brought into this process so we can compete. You can't complete when you change rules in the middle of the game. I liken this, and I was telling one of the Boeing people, it's like tying somebody's hands behind their back, putting a blindfold on, and fighting for the Heavyweight Championship of the world, you're at a slight disadvantage. And that's what happened in this report. 
   So I'm pleased. And I really appreciate my friend from the State of Washington for inviting me to be here tonight to talk about this because this is critical, this is critical for our national defense, it's critical for our jobs. And as you said, when you think of the billions of dollars that we're going to be wasting on this project that we could save, that we could be spending on other things, it really just makes a whole lot of sense. So again, I yield back and thank you very much.

   Mr. HARE. Well, I think the gentlelady from Kansas brings up a great point. Here's a company that's been manufacturing this for 50 years. So they're not the new kid on the block, they've been there and they've done that. And every time they've produced it, they've produced it with quality. And you don't have the WTO looking at them and all kinds of different things. 
   The bottom line here is this is a great product. And giving the opportunity for this company to be able to compete on a level playing field, that's all they were asking for, and now they're going to get the opportunity to do so. And I think at the end of the day, when that happens, I think the taxpayers will benefit, I think the American people will benefit, I think our troops will benefit. And, you know, as my friend said, when you start talking, as the late Senator Dirksen said, a billion here and a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about a lot of money. 
   So again, I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I yield back.

And you look at this, and here is a company--and I don't mean to be picking on them this evening, but facts really are facts, so let's see if we can get this straight. Here's a company who is in violation of trade laws, who was about to receive a $40 billion contract that would have cost us thousands of jobs to build a tanker that can't land at some airports.

   Mr. HARE. Half the airports, and cannot fuel the necessary planes that we might have when we go to war. Now I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer here, and I know this has been a long day, but again, I think clearly we had a company, as my friend from Kansas says, a company that's been doing this 50, 60 years, a stellar reputation, they could have produced a smaller craft that could land where it's supposed to land, fuel what it's supposed to fuel, and not reward this corporation for violating Federal trade laws.     
   So to me, this is really a no-brainer. And I think that every Member of the House, not only should they read the report, which I think is important, but I think they should listen to what my friend said just a few minutes ago, about do we really want to get down the slope of rewarding a company with a $40 billion or $4 million or whatever the contract is when they are in violation of Federal trade laws? I don't believe that is what the people sent us here to do. We're supposed to protect this country. 
   This is a great day. Yesterday was a great day for the GAO report. But we have to be vigilant here. We have to keep pushing on this. And I have to tell you, as long as we're here, I think we have an obligation to hold the Air Force's feet to the fire on this. People make mistakes. But let's don't make it again, and let's don't make it again, and let's don't make it to the tune of a $40 billion contract to a company that can't produce what we really need.

So as you said, and I commend my friend, Mr. Inslee, when he said, if we have to, and this continues, there is an appropriations process. Hopefully we don't have to go down that road. But I have to tell you. I think we have a responsibility for companies that violate international trade laws. I don't think you reward them. I certainly don't think you reward them with a $30 billion contract, as I said, to build a plane too big to land and not adequate to fuel the aircraft that we need. 
   So once again, let me just thank you, Congressman Inslee, for your hard work and your leadership on this. To my friend from Kansas, we will do everything we can. And you have been wonderful.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, no one can deny that the situation on the ground in Iraq is grave and rapidly deteriorating and therefore deserves the immediate and undivided attention of this Congress. 
   Last week, the National Intelligence Estimate released a pessimistic outlook on the future of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The NIE offers no hope that under the likeliest of scenarios the level of violence in Iraq will be significantly reduced between the next 12 to 18 months. 
   Additionally, the Iraq Study Group has identified the increase of sectarian violence in Iraq as a principal challenge to stability in the Middle East. In light of the current situation, a military approach is no longer a viable solution to stabilizing Iraq. Our success in Iraq is dependent upon a forward change in direction, which involves input of Iraq's neighbors and the entire international community. 
   Through political and diplomatic engagement we have a serious chance of reducing sectarian tensions, bringing our troops home, and ultimately declaring victory in Iraq. I urge my colleagues in both Houses to put aside partisan differences and honestly debate our strategy in Iraq.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, April 28 marks the 20th annual Workers Memorial Day. I rise with other members of the Labor and Working Family Caucus to acknowledge the millions of workers who have been killed or injured on the job. 
   Since 1970, OSHA has been a driving force in improving workplace safety across the country. However, the Bush administration has sought to downsize the agency. A weakened OSHA has real life-or-death consequences for workers, such as Cintas employee Eleazar Torres-Gomez who died last year when he was dragged into an industrial dryer. 
   Mr. Torres-Gomez's fate is, unfortunately, too common. Sixteen workers die every day in our country from work-related injuries. 
   Last year, along with Representative Lynn Woolsey, I introduced the Protecting America's Workers Act, which amends OSHA to cover more workers, and strengthens protections and accountability. During Workers Memorial Week, the best way to honor our workers is to quickly send this bill to the President's desk.

Drivers are paying a heavy price for the Bush administration's failure to enact a comprehensive energy strategy. And just last week, the President attempted to show that he's taking action by announcing an Executive Order that doesn't call for any action until a few weeks before he leaves office. This is simply too little, too late. Where has he been for the last 6 years when prices were hitting record numbers each Memorial Day? 
   The Democratic Congress refuses to ignore this problem. We passed legislation that will roll back $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies for Big Oil, and instead we would reinvest here at home in clean alternative fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   In the coming weeks we will bring legislation to the House floor that will crack down on price gouging by the big oil companies so we can provide immediate relief to consumers. Unlike the Bush administration, the Democratic Congress is not simply going to ignore this problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, part of our job in Congress is to ensure that every American has the right to a higher education. Unfortunately, a provision in the Higher Education Act makes it difficult for people of low incomes who attend schools with low tuitions to receive the assistance they need. 
   I rise in strong support of the Pell Grant Equity Act, which provides low-income students  the opportunity to go to college by eliminating the ``tuition sensitivity provision.'' This provision prohibits maximum Pell grant awards to students attending low-tuition institutions of higher education even if their income is low enough to otherwise qualify for the maximum award. 
   As implemented by the U.S. Department of Education, ``tuition sensitivity'' is intended to reduce the Pell grant for low-income students who attend very low tuition schools as a cost-saving measure. Unfortunately, the students most negatively impacted by this policy are the poorest students who still cannot afford the lower tuition. 
   As I have been saying throughout my district this past week, education is an investment not an expenditure. We must invest in our students now or be forced to pay more later. We can start this investment by passing the Pell Grant Equity Act, allowing approximately 96,000 of our poorest students to receive the financial assistance they need in the upcoming academic year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the Education and Labor Committee, I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act--the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI bill. 
   Working families in Illinois and around the Nation continue to struggle with the rising costs of college. This historic investment in higher education will begin to put a college degree back in reach for millions of average Americans, and do so at no new cost to U.S. taxpayers. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act would make need-based student loans more easily accessible and provide for additional mandatory funding for the Pell grant scholarship by at least $1,090 over the next 5 years,  benefiting nearly 230,000 students in Illinois, including over 22,000 newly eligible beneficiaries. Illinois students and their families will receive more than $1.2 billion over 5 years in the form of student loans and Pell grants as a result of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill includes a provision to cut the interest rate on subsidized student loans in half over the next 5 years--from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, benefiting 128,765 student borrowers in Illinois. Once fully phased in, it would save the average 4-year college student, who begins school in 2011, $4,510 over the life of his or her loan. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act pays for itself by reducing excessive Federal subsidies paid to lenders in the college loan industry by $20 billion. In the current budget-tight environment, the Federal Government should not be over-funding lenders while families struggle to send their kids to college. 
   Making college more affordable and accessible for working families is good for our economy, national security, and competitiveness in the world. I was proud to play a role in crafting this landmark legislation from the very beginning and I am honored to vote for its passage today. I urge my colleagues to join me in making college more affordable for our students and urge the President to sign this bill into law.

   Denying troops the rest they need is another irresponsible move in a long line of policies that show a complete disregard for the well-being of our troops, such as being sent to war without adequate armor, being forced to complete multiple deployments, and when wounded, being subjected to a bureaucratic mess such as Walter Reed.

   Mr. HARE. I thank the chairman for his kind words. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1527, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act, and I want to commend my friend, Representative JERRY MORAN, for his outstanding leadership on this issue. 
   I represent a district in Illinois that is very rural. I hear often not only from the veterans but also from the critical access hospitals in my district about the frustrations that they feel from the inability to access or provide the care that our veterans so desperately need. We often see our disabled and elderly veterans driving hundreds of miles to the nearest VA facilities in Freeport, Illinois, or Bettendorf, Iowa, some of them having to wait 6 hours just to be seen. 
   To highlight this point, I recently received a phone call from Illinois State Senator Deanna Demuzio of Carlinville, Illinois, in the southern part of my district. She expressed a tremendous amount of frustration and concern at the fact that one of her constituents, a World War II veteran, was told by the VA that he had to drive 200 miles to get a simple chest x-ray. Like Senator Demuzio, I feel that it just doesn't make sense for anyone to drive 200 miles for an x-ray, one they can get locally. 
   I have been working with the VA, Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, and the appropriators, to authorize the community-based outpatient clinic in Whiteside County in my district to address the hardships that veterans face from the distances they have to travel to access health care. Until that happens, I believe this bill will provide the data we need to best serve our rural veterans while also paying attention to the quality of care our veterans receive, and the VA patient enrollment numbers. 
   Specifically, H.R. 1527 requires the Secretary to conduct a pilot program in four Veteran Integrated Service Networks that would allow the ``highly rural'' veteran to elect to receive covered health services through a non-VA health care provider. Many of the veterans of my district fit under the ``highly rural'' definition, and I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Again, I want to thank Senator Demuzio for her help and support, and to my friend Congressman JERRY MORAN for introducing this incredibly wonderful piece of legislation. I believe this information we gather from the pilot program will go a long way in helping our veterans access health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Amid constant threat from surrounding countries and terrorist groups, it is critical that the United States stand in solidarity with Israel as she fights to protect her people.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. Many students and families in my congressional district fear that in our struggling economy they will not be able to access the financial assistance they need to go to school. While we have not yet seen this, we know that there exists the potential for a real crisis. 
   I have often said in this House how frustrated I am that we wait for an emergency to occur before reacting, rather than working to prevent it in the first place. I am proud that today this body is proactively putting measures in place to ensure our students and lenders that they have the assistance that they need. 
   This legislation reduces borrowers' reliance on costlier private college  loans; encourages responsible borrowing; gives parent borrowers more time to pay off their Federal PLUS loans; it guarantees eligibility for PLUS loans for struggling homeowners who otherwise have good credit; and it provides the Secretary of Education additional tools to safeguard access to student loans. 
   All these provisions are good steps forward and will keep our student loan industry strong, which is why I am an original cosponsor of the bill and was proud to support it when our committee marked it up just last week. However, more needs to be done. I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue to address our Nation's economic troubles. 
   I commend Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon and their staffs for putting together this legislation so that our students and lenders have a safety net during the time of economic insecurity. I urge all my colleagues to support the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to another great American hero. On July 15, 2006, Specialist Nathan Gurley of Fayetteville, North Carolina, though wounded, fiercely pulled Specialist Josh Eckley of Little York, Illinois and another crew member from a military vehicle that had been hit by an IED while on combat logistics control in Al Anbar Province in Iraq. For his heroism, Specialist Gurley was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor and the Purple Heart. 
   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of the 17th District of Illinois, I thank Specialist Gurley for saving the life of one of our beloved sons. Specialist Gurley and Specialist Eckley represent the best the United States military has to offer in Iraq. These two brave soldiers risked their lives to fight an unrelenting insurgency in one of our country's most dangerous areas. For their service, the American people will be forever indebted. 
   Madam Speaker, brave men such as Specialist Gurley and Specialist Eckley are hard to come by, so for their sake and for all those continuing to fight, it is my sincere hope that at the conclusion of this war their sacrifice will not be in vain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Chairman, on behalf of Illinois agriculture, I rise in strong support of the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act. 
   This bill maintains a viable safety net for our farmers. Since my congressional district receives the second most crop payments of all the freshmen in Congress, a strong subsidy program is critical for farmers in the 17th Illinois Congressional District. 
   Additionally, the bill encourages biofuel research and production, which are vitally important to my congressional district and the energy security of our Nation. 
   The 2007 Farm bill also supports rural America through programs that provide healthcare, emergency communications, and broadband telecommunications services to rural areas. 
   Before the bill passed out of committee, I joined with many of my colleagues to ensure it funded nutrition programs so that Americans continue to have access to a high quality and inexpensive food supply. 
   In response, the bill increases the minimum benefit for the Food Stamp Program for the first time in more than 30 years. 
   For the safety and security of our food and the future of U.S. agriculture, I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 2419.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Tennessee women's basketball team for their victory in the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I women's basketball championship. 
   On April 8, women's basketball fans were treated to an exceptional game as the University of Tennessee Volunteers defeated the Stanford University Cardinal and clinched their eighth national title. The resounding 64-48 defeat marks back-to-back national titles for the Lady Vols. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to Head Coach Pat Summitt, Associate Head Coach Holly Warlick, and Assistant Coaches Dean Lockwood and Daedra Charles-Furlow. With 983 wins, Coach Summitt is the winningest NCAA basketball coach in both the men's and women's leagues. 
   At the onset of the season, Summitt also received the prestigious John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching lifetime achievement award. As the first female to receive this award, Summitt was recognized for her talents and hard work with her players both on and off the court. Thanks to the dedication of the entire coaching staff, the Lady Vols have an impressive track record of winning games and also boast an impressive 100 percent graduation rate for student athletes who completed their eligibility at the University. 
   Congratulations are also in order for forward Candace Parker, who was named the most outstanding player of the Final Four for the second year in a row. Parker, a junior from Naperville, Illinois, also broke the University of Tennessee's record for free throws made and attempted, and moved into third place at the University for single season scoring. In her tenure at the University of Tennessee, Parker has scored in double figures 105 times, and the championship game was the 44th game in a row that she completed this fete. Parker was also named the 2008 Naismith Women's College Player of the Year, and was selected by the Los Angeles Sparks as the first pick in the WNBA draft. 
   We must also congratulate Shannon Bobbit and Nicky Anosike who, along with Parker, rounded out the All-Final Four team. Bobbit, a senior from Manhattan, New York, moved into third place in the University of Tennessee's record books when she scored three three-pointers in the final game, for a total of 77 three-pointers in a single season. Anosike, a senior from Staten Island, New York, ranks fourth in steals in NCAA history, with 44 in her career, and tied for second in a championship game with six against the Cardinal. 
   The extraordinary achievement of this year is attributed to the skill and dedication of the many players, coaches, students, alumni, family, and fans that have helped make the University of Tennessee a basketball powerhouse. Winning the national championship, finishing the season with a 36-2 overall record, and winning the Southeastern Conference tournament title has once again brought national acclaim to the University of Tennessee. I know that fans of the University will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to the 2009 season. 
   Madam Speaker, once again, I congratulate the University of Tennessee women's basketball team for their success. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (VETERANS DISABILITY BENEFITS CLAIMS MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5892, the Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act of 2008, and I commend Chairman Hall for his tireless work on this issue. 
   The disability backlog of more than 800,000 claims in the VA is a moral black eye for our country. We made a promise to those who served in uniform, and we have failed to keep that promise. The legislation before us today takes a critical step in restoring that promise. This bill is a comprehensive approach to fixing the flaws that exist in claims decisions and in the structure at the Veterans Benefits Administration, the VBA. 
   The largest factors contributing to the claims backlogs are the broken culture and processes at the VA. There is a lack of accountability on raters, poor quality assurance measures, a broken work credit system, virtually no training for the VBA personnel, and an outdated information technology system. 
   H.R. 5892 squarely addresses these problems by creating a more accountable and accurate system that rewards raters for the quality of their work, and it holds them accountable for their mistakes, ensuring that claims are processed correctly the very first time. 
   I want to thank Chairman Hall for working with me to include specific language on mental health in the study of the readjustment schedule. Of those veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who have accessed VA care, 40 percent have sought mental health care. It is critical that any study on the rating schedule takes a good look at mental health conditions to ensure that those veterans receive fair compensation. 
   I am disappointed that we had to remove the original section 101 language from H.R. 5892, which provided a service connection presumption for post-traumatic stress disorder by clearly defining who was considered a ``combat veteran.'' The provision decreased the burden of proof for combat veterans, increasing their access to disability benefits. 
   I appreciate Mr. Hall's efforts to address this issue in separate legislation, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that it becomes law. 
   H.R. 5892 is a strong piece of legislation that will improve the way veterans' claims are processed. Again, I view this as a work in progress, and I look forward to continuing efforts until the backlog goes from 800,000 to zero.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CAMPUS SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1288, which recognizes September as the National Campus Safety Awareness Month. I urge colleges and universities from across the country to do what they can to prevent violence, crime and abuse on their campuses.     
   The campus safety movement started in the late 1980s, soon after the tragic death of a student at Lehigh University. On April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery, a freshman at Lehigh, was beaten, raped and murdered in her dormitory room. The offender was another Lehigh student who tried to rob Jeanne as she slept in the room. The two did not know each other. 
   Clery's case brought college campus safety to the forefront when it exposed flaws in the reporting of crime information related to violence on the campus. At that time, violent and nonviolent incidents were reported to campus authorities, but administrators did not have to disclose the information. 
   In the aftermath of Ms. Clery's murder, her parents, Connie and Howard Clery, founded Security on Campus, Inc. to end violence on all college campuses. It is a unique, nonprofit grass roots organization dedicated to safe campuses for college and university students. 
   Security on Campus, Inc. partners with a number of colleges to offer educational programs on sexual assault, alcohol and drugs. Programs like Security on Campus, Inc. have done a lot to educate students about campus safety. They have partnered with over 150 colleges and universities from 42 States across this Nation. 
   More than 37 homicides and 8,112 forcible sex offenses were reported on college and university campuses from the year 2004 through 2006. Many of the violence and rape cases take place within the first few weeks of school. 
   As we commemorate National Campus Safety Awareness Month in September, let us focus our efforts on educating our students about campus safety. Students need to be reminded every year about practical precautions to increase their safety. Anyone can become a victim of a campus crime, and it is imperative that students are taught how to avoid dangerous situations. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for National Campus Safety Awareness Month, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1332, which recognizes the importance of connecting foster youth to employment opportunities. The foster care system currently serves 500,000 youth. Out of those 500,000 foster youth, 25 percent of them become homeless within 18 months after aging out of the system. Many of these young people find themselves on the street with few resources. Not only are they without housing and a family support system, but they also lack work experience that can help them reverse their downward slide. 
   The resolution before us today points out the importance of connecting youth to the workforce through internship programs and, in particular, how foster kids can benefit from these opportunities. 
   Orphan Foundation of America's Intern American program offers foster youth top-tier internships, housing and professional development seminars here in our Nation's Capital. Some of these great internships coordinated by OFA's Intern American program are with Members of Congress, Fortune 500  companies and major not-for-profit organizations. These work experiences allow foster children to develop talents and increase their skill sets. 
   Young people who have early work experiences are better prepared to succeed in the workforce. Unfortunately, many foster youth are unaware of the opportunities to gain this experience. House Resolution 1332 encourages employers from all sectors to increase employment opportunities for young people who were in the foster care system. 
   Madam Speaker, once again I express my support for this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate University of Florida quarterback Timothy ``Tim'' Tebow for winning the greatest recognition in college football, the Heisman Trophy, and to honor both his athletic and academic achievements. 
   Tim Tebow received the Heisman Trophy on December 8, 2007 and became the first sophomore to ever win the Heisman. 
   This award recognizes Tim Tebow's college football accomplishments and record-breaking season as he became the first player in college football history to run for at least 20 touchdowns and pass for at least 20 touchdowns in the same season. Tim set a new Southeastern Conference record with 51 total touchdowns in a single season. Rushing for 22 of those touchdowns, he set an all-time new national collegiate record for quarterbacks as well. 
   Although his rushing abilities inspired spectators and left his opponents confounded, his strong arm also contributed to a stellar athletic performance. Tim completed more than 68 percent of his passing attempts for a total of 3,132 yards during the 2007 season. He led the University of the Florida to a 9-3 record and helped the Gators lead the conference in scoring and total yardage. 
   Beyond the field, Tim Tebow has proven himself an astute student in the classroom. He has maintained a 3.77 grade point average while he has been at the University of Florida, and is only the fourth sophomore from the University of Florida to become a member of the Academic All-American First Team. 
   Tebow has exhibited exemplary character by carrying a torch of leadership off the football field to help those less fortunate. Tim has transcended simply being a football inspiration to his teammates and fans. He is also a philanthropic inspiration, regularly visiting orphanages and hospitals in the Philippines and the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the University of the Florida quarterback, Tim Tebow, for an outstanding two years of athletic and academic performance. I urge all my colleagues to pass this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleagues and I on both sides of the aisle were able to work together to craft this important piece of legislation. I would like to thank the Subcommittee on Health Chairman, Mike Michaud of Maine, and Ranking Member Jeff Miller for the bipartisan leadership they demonstrated in working on this important bill. 
   Over 30,000 servicemembers have been wounded in Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Many of these servicemembers suffer from multiple serious injuries that will require long-term care, spanning beyond their discharge and into the care they receive from the VA. 
   In 2007, reports from the Independent Review Group, the President's Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes, and the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, all highlighted the need to improve case management for servicemembers and veterans in the military health system and in the VA. In response, the VA instituted a number of initiatives to support veterans and their families. These measures include appointing patient advocates in every medical center for OEF and OIF coordinators and transition patient advocates for those seriously injured in combat. 
   The Joint Federal Recovery Coordinator Program was also established to serve as a single point of contact for seriously wounded and ill servicemembers, veterans and their families. However, the scope of the FRCP is very  limited. As of June 1, 2008, there were only eight recovery coordinators working with 80 patients. Less seriously wounded veterans do not have access to the FRCP. Instead, they must attempt to navigate the complex system using medical centers, patient advocates, benefit counselors, OEF and OIF coordinators, transition patient advocates and vet center counselors. 
   H.R. 2192, as amended, would create the Office of the Ombudsman within the VA to oversee patient advocacy work and coordinate assistance for our Nation's veterans. The office would be tasked with identifying trends across the system in patient issues and complaints that would allow improvements to VA policies, practices and procedures. The office would also serve as the arbiter of last resort for complaints and issues that cannot be resolved at local or regional levels. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 2912.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (UNITED STATES OLYMPIC COMMITTEE PARALYMPIC PROGRAM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must honor the sacrifice of our servicemembers by providing them with the resources needed to heal from the wounds of war and to help them live an active life after their service to our country. 
   While the VA has taken an active role in initiating programs for our most severely injured veterans, I strongly believe that Congress should provide the VA with the needed resources to help meet this growing demand for rehabilitative services. For this reason, H.R. 4255, the United States Paralympic Programs Act of 2008, is introduced, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   This bill would establish the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events; it would authorize the VA to provide grants to the United States Olympic Committee to implement the Paralympic Program; and, authorize a financial assistance program for veterans who participate in events leading to elite competition. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been a decade since Congress last revisited this program that provides opportunities for participation in paralympic supports. Our Nation's current commitment in fighting the global war on terror has brought to light the need to reevaluate existing programs to see if they meet the needs of a new generation of disabled veterans and servicemembers. 
   As the number of disabled servicemembers has substantially increased over the years, it has become necessary to expand available rehabilitative services to ensure that these men and women are afforded the best possible care after their service to our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the efforts of the VA for entering into a memorandum of agreement with the United States Olympic Committee to help take care of seriously injured veterans and allowing them to be part of the Paralympic Program. This program helps them to accept new physical limitations and to explore those limits. I, like some of my colleagues in the House, have had the pleasure of meeting some of these servicemembers and veterans who have benefited from programs such as the one being proposed today. 
   Earlier this year, the chairman had the pleasure of meeting Jose Ramos, a veteran of the Navy originally from El Paso, Texas. Jose testified before the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity about benefits that adaptive sports programs provide in teaching veterans that they can continue to live productive lives despite their injuries. 
   I would like to thank the ranking member of the committee, Representative Steve Buyer, for the bipartisan effort he demonstrated in working on this important piece of legislation. By working together, we were able to incorporate language from his bill and craft H.R. 4255. I ask all my colleagues to join me in showing their strong support for H.R. 4255 as amended, the United States Paralympic Program Act of 2008.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for those kind words. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6445, to prohibit the collection of certain copayments from veterans who are catastrophically disabled. I want to commend Representative Don Cazayoux of Louisiana for introducing this measure. This bill also includes legislation that I authored, H.R. 6439, the Mental Health for Heroes' Families Act. 
   Current law allows the VA to provide support services to immediate family members of veterans being treated for service-connected conditions. However, with respect to other veterans, the VA may only provide the services when they are initiated during a period of hospitalization, greatly limiting veterans and their families' access to care. 
   While not changing the rule that such services must be deemed necessary for the veteran's treatment, my bill simply repeals the precondition that a veteran must be hospitalized before initiating family services. 
   The VA has begun to transform the delivery of mental health care from an inpatient-based model to an outpatient model, which has improved efficiency and increased veterans' access to care. However, as a result, some families have become ineligible for support services simply because their loved one's care was provided on an outpatient basis. As long as family support services are necessary in connection with the veteran's treatment, it should be irrelevant whether the disability under treatment is service-connected or provided in a hospital. 
   This bill would make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of men and women, and I am pleased it is being considered as part of H.R. 6445. I urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. Cazayoux's legislation to ensure that our veterans and their families receive the care and support they need. 
   Once again, I want to thank the chairman of our committee, Chairman Filner, and Ranking Member Buyer.

   In my district, I hear from doctors, patients and hospitals about the strains that cuts to Medicare and Medicaid have placed on our health care system. This bill takes a first step towards rebuilding our social safety net by preventing pay cuts to physicians, ensuring that doctors continue to accept Medicare patients, and seniors are able to see the doctors of their choice.

   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   This bill authorizes important long-overdue flood control, dam safety and environmental restoration projects. In my district, the Great Flood of 1993 took the lives of 47 people and resulted in over $15 billion in catastrophic damages throughout much of the Mississippi River basin. I support this bill for the safety of my constituents. 
   Additionally, over 50 percent of our locks and dams have aged beyond their life cycle, and they are crumbling. WRDA authorizes repair of these structures and includes critical provisions to modernize seven new locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. These improvement will expand navigation capacity, reduce shipping delays, and accommodate larger barge tows, which is critical for the $12 billion worth of products that the river transports ever year, as well as the agriculture, commercial and labor interests of my State of Illinois. 
   This bill includes a much-needed program to restore the upper Mississippi River ecosystem and authorizes completion of the Emiquon Wildlife Preserve in my district. This preserve is one of the largest flood plain restoration projects in the country outside the Florida Everglades, and I am proud to have sponsored its inclusion in this bill today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Water Resources Development Act. By improving our water resources infrastructure, we will make our river communities safer and strengthen our Nation's economy and environmental welfare.

   Before I introduce our next speaker, I want to say one thing our colleague talked about regarding the President being able to enforce labor standards. If you look just in this country, you don't have to go to Peru, you don't have to go to Panama or Korea, in the over 6 years he has been in office, we have only had one major standard by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration by this administration; and they were sued to have to get it.

   I worked in a clothing factory. I cut lining for men's suits. I have three plants left in my district. They are hanging on by a thread. I can't support trade agreements that are going to outsource jobs. I have done town hall meetings since I got elected. I ran on this issue of standing up for ordinary people. 
   I had a plant in my district, Maytag, with 1,600 workers. Two wage concessions those folks gave up. The company was given $9 million in State funds, and they bolted to Senora, Mexico. Thank you very much, Maytag. 
   They left people like David Brevard, whose wife has cancer, with very little, if any, health care left. I cannot go back to my district and say to the Dave Brevards, I hope you understand that we have some things, if we let Bush handle some of, if we let the administration handle some of this, we are going to be just fine. Just hang on a little longer. 
   I can't do that. I have drawn a line in the sand on this issue of trade. It is how I ran, and it is why I am here. I am not going to vote for a fast track bill that is going to take jobs away from this country. I'm not doing it. 
   Some people would say, here is a protectionist. Yes, if the definition means I'm trying to protect American jobs, then I am. I want the record to state that I'm a card-carrying capitalist. I believe in trade. I just want this thing fair. 
   I would ask the people and the Speaker tonight, look at the Korean trade agreement where 700,000 automobiles were shipped in here from Korea, and the United States was allowed to ship 2,500 to Korea. That isn't fair trade. 
   I am not asking them to be equal, I am asking for 
   the playing field to be level. As Congresswoman Sutton said, give us a chance to produce, and we will produce it. But when we don't even have the opportunity to do that, it is never going to work. 
   I think we need to look at other things. I think we need to invest in something like the bill Ms. Schakowsky spoke about earlier and is going to be introducing. It is about getting companies to stay here, and they get tax credits for helping their employees with their health care and  their pensions. Instead, we give tax breaks when they outsource it. I would like to ask both of my colleagues, and maybe I just don't get it. I want you to know that I am not angry that I wasn't invited to the press conference, I am angry because I know what we can do. This is why we have this majority. If we are going to keep this majority, we have to stand up for ordinary people. 
   Before I turn this over, I want to end with a quote here. One of my political heroes is Hubert Humphrey, and he said in one of the last speeches he gave before he died to the Minnesota AFL-CIO, he said, ``I would rather live 10 years like a tiger than 100 years like a chicken.'' These trade agreements are going to put us back more than 100 years. We are never going to be able to recoup these jobs we have lost. That is why I am here. 
   I am not going to go back to my district, and I am not going to be lobbied to change my mind unless I am convinced that these trade agreements are in the best interest of our American workers, and that there are provisions built in to help keep jobs. 
   While I applaud the efforts of the leadership to do some things, I want to make sure that the language is in here. I don't want to go back to Dave Brevard and say, if you can just hang on, we will work on the currency exchange. That is not going to help Mr. Brevard and the people in my district and in the State of Ohio. 
   Let me say to my colleague, it doesn't matter if you are just from Ohio or just from Illinois, we have lost manufacturing jobs all across this country. I have yet to see, yet to see, a fast track deal that has been in the best interests of the working people of this country. So as long as I am a Member, and I know that is going to be at least another 19 months, and hopefully a little longer, I am going to work very hard to make sure that American workers have somebody. 
   And I have wonderful people that I am honored to have here this evening, and I would like to enter into a discussion of how are we going to keep manufacturers here. 
   Does anybody see anything in this bill about how we keep our jobs?

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, let me just say this, too. These are the very people who fought our wars, defended this country. They just want a decent pension. They'd like some health care, put their kids through school, play by the rules, pay their taxes. They're not the fat cats. These are the thin cats we're talking about 
   And for the life of me, I don't understand. As you said, we have both chambers, and I believe it's time that both of these chambers stand up because I'm afraid if we don't, we'll go back and our base, those folks who elected us here, are going to say what were you thinking. 
   I want to just close with this. I know we just have a few minutes remaining here. I want to thank you all for coming this evening, and this is going to be a tough battle. We don't make any bones about it, Mr. Speaker, but look, nothing comes easy for hardworking people, and we're going to work very hard on this. I don't care where you come from, I don't care what State, but I think we have a moral obligation. 
   I want to close. I did a commencement speech last night at a high school, and I ran into the grandfather of one of the kids that graduated. His father used to work with me in my factory that closed down because of trade, and he's out West now. And I got to thinking, what a shame we couldn't have the opportunity to see each other. He comes back periodically. He's a good, decent man. 
   I'll close by saying this. This isn't the end on this trade issue. Mr. Speaker, this is only the beginning. We're going to fight, and we're going to win this battle.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. 
   Our country is mired in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We have been in recession for well over a year. Manufacturing activity and vehicle sales are at a 26-year low. Unemployment is at a staggering 6.7 percent. Over half a million jobs were lost in November alone. Since the Bush Administration took over in January of 2001, unemployment has risen by 71 percent. 
   The domestic automobile industry and its blue collar workforce have been especially hard hit by this current economic crisis. Over the last several weeks, I've heard a lot of blame being passed around for the situation our car companies find themselves in. I agree with those who say the Big Three have been too rigid in their opposition to building more fuel efficient cars. I believe strongly, as many Americans do, that the Bush Administration and Congress have not done enough to create and protect American jobs. But it is not the auto executives or politicians who are suffering. It's the hard working UAW members who spend every day on an assembly line to support their family. They are the victims of corporate greed, bad business models, and government indifference. They are the reason we are here today, months after Congress adjourned for the year. 
   The consequences of a collapse of the domestic auto industry would be catastrophic for working families. Recession would spiral into depression. Millions of jobs would be lost. It is something we must prevent. 
   The bill before us gives $15 billion in conditional loans to the auto industry to help them survive over the next few months. During that time, they will be required to achieve viability, international competitiveness, fuel efficiency,  and reduced emissions. The bill gives the President the authority to appoint a ``car czar'' who will be responsible for ensuring these conditions are met. If the car czar determines that the companies have not made themselves viable by the end of March, they will be required to pay back the government immediately. If the companies utilize this line of credit wisely and restructure into successful, sustainable operations, they will still have to pay the money back with interest, but the government will have the opportunity to turn a profit by gaining equity in these companies. Furthermore, the car czar will have the authority to prevent an automaker from closing the doors of any of its factories or from outsourcing its operations to another country, should the czar determine such an action detrimental to the viability of the company. 
   Like all legislation, this bill is not perfect. But it is necessary. Letting the auto industry collapse would unfairly punish America's workers for sins they did not commit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. 
   As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am deeply concerned about the lack of a seamless transition for our servicemembers into the VA health care system. 
   This bill changes that broken system by creating a pilot program within the Department of Defense requiring a more efficient movement of medical records and a better process for our separated or retiring troops. 
   It also provides soldiers and their families with a toll-free hotline for reporting problems. Complaints called into the hotline must be investigated and a plan to remedy them must be in place within 96 hours. 
   Additionally, the bill requires the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration to work together to improve their disability evaluation systems ending a lot of backlog. 
   Finally, this bill authorizes $50 million for wounded soldiers' support programs, ensuring that these soldiers don't fall through the cracks without any financial support. Our soldiers have fought bravely on the battlefield, and they shouldn't have to fight for the care they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support today of H.R. 3021. 
   School districts around the country are struggling to find the money to pay for the most basic school repairs, let alone funding to upgrade school facilities to meet the needs of 21st century learners. 
   While school construction funding has traditionally been a State and local responsibility, the magnitude of the challenge warrants an increased Federal role, a role that could help schools such as Lewistown High in my district repair a leaky roof and replace World War II-era equipment that students are using for machine shop. 
   Madam Chairman, the bill before us authorizes $6.4 billion to address unmet school construction needs. Additionally, the bill guarantees schools with the greatest need receive a minimum of $5,000 for school construction projects. 
   As a member of the Green Schools Caucus, I'm pleased that this bill encourages schools to make energy-efficient improvements. By dedicating the majority of funds to green projects, H.R. 3021 will save schools an average of $100,000 each year in energy costs alone--enough to hire two additional full-time teachers, purchase 5,000 new textbooks, or buy 500 new computers. 
   The deteriorating physical condition of public schools also presents an opportunity to stimulate our failing economy. A direct Federal investment in school construction will provide an immediate boost to our economy and create an estimated 100,000 jobs in the building trades hit hard in recent months. 
   Madam Chairman, H.R. 3021 comes as a much-needed response to crumbling school infrastructure, skyrocketing energy prices, and our declining economy. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.

   Mr. HARE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, recently I was at a pharmacy in my district. A man in his late seventies went to the counter to pay for his prescription and found that he had hit the donut hole. The prescription was $350. The people that were there with him passed the hat, and we collected $350. It was enough to pay for 5 days of medication for this man. For him and for the countless other seniors in my district, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Act. H.R. 4 would require the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.     
   Estimates indicate that drug prices would go down by 35 percent by the year 2025, and lower prices would prevent millions of seniors from paying out of pocket for their medications. 
   Fighting for affordable health care is the reason that I ran for Congress, and I start that fight today by voting for H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I had the privilege of working on this legislation, which will have a large impact on the students, veterans, and workers in the rural communities of my Congressional district. 
   Today's legislation includes several provisions I authored to increase enrollment of graduates from rural high schools in institutions of higher education, help rural schools recruit qualified teachers and administrators, and develop a strong workforce in rural America. 
   One-third of K-12 schools in the United States are located in rural areas and are responsible for educating almost 10 million children. Unfortunately, these schools struggle to recruit highly qualified teachers, putting our rural students at a disadvantage. 
   Teachers in rural schools often teach several subjects to multiple grade levels and play many different roles in the school, such as counselor, coach, lunchroom attendant, janitor, administrator, and others. Therefore, in order for rural schools to recruit qualified teachers, colleges of education must teach students the skills needed to work in rural America. My provision achieves this goal by providing incentives to colleges of education to add a rural focus to their curriculum, and encourage students to complete their required student teaching hours in rural schools. 
   I am also proud that Title VIII of the bill includes the College and University Rural Education (CURE) Act, which I introduced with my colleagues, Representatives DAVID LOEBSACK and ZACK SPACE. A variety of studies show that fewer high school graduates from rural schools continue on to college than from suburban schools. This unfortunate reality leads to difficulties in training a qualified workforce in rural America. 
   Now, more than ever, our Nation needs a skilled workforce of teachers, health care workers, information technologists, and engineers willing to live and work in rural communities in order to create and support a competitive workforce, and to enhance the quality of life for Americans living in rural areas. 
   The CURE Act responds to this call by establishing three grant programs to increase enrollment of rural high school graduates in institutions of higher education; increase economic development partnerships to create an employment pipeline from higher education institutions to the workforce; and increase the quality of life in rural areas by providing training for professions of need in rural areas. 
   Finally, I am pleased today's bill includes another provision I developed to help the dislocated workers of Galesburg, IL, and other trade impacted communities across the Nation. This provision allows workers to indicate on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) that they have lost their job and would like to use current year income when applying for financial aid. This will ensure that  dislocated workers receive appropriate financial support, directly resulting in greater access to training opportunities for workers who lost their jobs. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act builds upon the work we started in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to make college more affordable and accessible to all Americans. I thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MCKEON for their leadership in moving these bills through our committee and quickly to the floor. I urge all my colleagues to support the Manager's Amendment and underlining bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. 
   On January 10, President Bush announced an increase of more than 20,000 troops in Iraq. Six months later, it is clear that the President's surge strategy has yielded no positive results, and Iraq continues to remain a battleground for sectarian violence and a hotbed for terrorist activity. 
   But in spite of the realities on the ground, the President seems intent on further digging in his heels on a failed policy that has placed targets on the backs of our troops as they attempt to referee a civil war. In the 6 months that I have served in Congress, the 17th Congressional District of Illinois has mourned the lives of six brave soldiers. In the absence of any visible progress, we can no longer stand by as more of our troops come home in body bags. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush started this war without a plan to win the peace. For the sake of our troops, our national security and our credibility around the world, this Congress must do what this President refuses to do in order to return stability to Iraq. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

This legislation strengthens programs like AmeriCorps, Vista, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America so they can continue their invaluable services and expand into underserved communities. 
   The people of my congressional district are no strangers to community service. We have four effective Retired Senior Volunteer Programs, known as RSVPs, located in my district: West Central Illinois RSVP, Adams County RSVP, RSVP of the Quad Cities, and RSVP of Springfield, Illinois. Together, these programs engage 3,464 volunteers in 577,226 hours of services in 13 counties. I had the opportunity to visit several of these last October and was impressed by their organization, their large number of volunteers, and the variety of services that they offer. 
   Illinois RSVP volunteers serve the young and old, the healthy and the infirm. They work in hospitals, nursing homes, libraries, with the Red Cross, police department, and assist with home delivery meal programs. These dedicated volunteers touch the lives of hundreds of people and have a profound impact on the communities in which they serve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for the very kind words. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 995, a bill to extend the authorization for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. I introduced H.R. 995 along with my colleague Congressman Mark Kirk to provide the time necessary to raise the private funds and navigate the approval process in order to bring this memorial to life in Washington, D.C. Without this bill, the charter for the memorial will expire in October of this year. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rahall for quickly moving this legislation through the Resources Committee; and Lois Pope, the Chair of the Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation, who has worked tirelessly to establish this memorial since 1996. I also appreciate the efforts of Congressman Kirk and Congressman Dennis Moore to ensure the memorial is funded and dedicated by 2010, and all the other Members who have made this legislation a priority in the 110th Congress. 
   There are more than 3 million disabled veterans living today and millions of veterans from past and future conflicts who will be honored by this long overdue memorial. 
   It is my hope as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs that this memorial will only be the beginning of our recognition of the incredible sacrifices of our veterans. This memorial cannot repay the sacrifice of our disabled veterans, but it will serve as a reminder of the debt that we owe to each and every one of them. 
   Transcending conflicts, service branches and generations, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial will express America's lasting gratitude to the men and women whose lives were forever changed in service to our country. 
   Due to its proximity to the Capitol, the memorial will remain in the sight of America's lawmakers, serving as a constant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the sacrifices of our disabled veterans. The memorial will be a setting for school groups to learn about disabled veterans, the cost of freedom and the challenges faced by those with disabilities. Most importantly, it will be a place for disabled veterans to come and know they are recognized by a grateful Nation. 
   I am proud to be a freshman legislator in the 110th Congress because we are changing this country's priorities. In our recently passed continuing resolution, we increased veterans health care by over $3.6 billion, and we are taking swift action to hold those who are responsible for the inexcusable conditions at Walter Reed accountable. 
   Congress has a responsibility to plan for the long-term well-being and health of our troops, and I am committed to taking care of our veterans when they are in conflict and when they return home. This bill is a critical first step in honoring the sacrifices our military men and women have made and continue to make for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 995 and join me and the other 28 cosponsors to ensure this memorial is built and dedicated as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Thank you, Mr. Michaud. And I want to thank you for your leadership on this whole issue of trade. I was here last week, as you know, and we were talking about the Employee Free Choice Act. And I spoke then as a former labor organizer about the difficulties working men and women have in being able to join the union. Tonight I am here, and I want to tell a brief story, if I could, about what I think this whole trade situation boils down to. 
   In my district, we have a city called Galesburg, Illinois. It was the home of Maytag, manufacturing washers, driers and refrigerators; 1,600 very talented men and women worked in that factory. On two different occasions, the workers of that plant gave pay concessions back to keep that plant open. The State of Illinois, my home State, gave Maytag $24 million in State taxes for renovations to keep the factory there. The plant, about 8 months later, announced that it was moving to Sonora, Mexico. 
   The CEO said it was because of several things, but the bottom line was they could make more money manufacturing in Sonora, Mexico, for cheap labor. And 1,600 of those people are out of work, and 1,000 more recently followed a few weeks later in Herron, Illinois, from another Maytag facility. And the CEO of that corporation said, ``You just have to understand, Congressman, I am in the business to make money for my shareholders. I don't really care about the people of this city and the educational system and what happens to them, and the small businesses that feed into Maytag. I am here to make money.'' 
   Well, I am here tonight to say a couple of things on this whole issue of trade. First, let me say, I said this on the campaign trail, Congressman. I am a card-carrying capitalist; I believe in trade. We have to have trade. I am not a protectionist, an isolationist. But I do know this. As my colleague, Representative Kagen, said, we have to have some fair trade. 
   Under this NAFTA agreement, it was tough enough to lose those jobs, but we negotiated that; we, meaning our trade folks, negotiated a 5-year head start for those Maytag jobs in Mexico, gave the Mexican government a 5-year head start on refrigerator products. Now, how are you going to compete? 
   I went to an editorial board, and I remember saying to the publisher of the newspaper, if your competitor across the river had a 5-year head start on subscriptions and advertising and being able to get the news out each and every day, and you could not publish for 5 years, do you think you would be at a distinct disadvantage? He said, ``Absolutely.'' 
   So here is what I think we need to do, in plain and simple language from a former clothing worker: I think we have to stop this exportation of manufacturing jobs across this country. And we have to be not just angry about it; we have to say: I am more than angry. I am now going to do something that we haven't done before. I am going to raise my voice and I am going to tell my elected Members of the Congress of the United States that if you vote to send our jobs overseas, we are going to vote to send you back to your district permanently, because in this business, we are supposed to be here to represent people. 
   The job of a Member of the United States Congress, to me, is standing up for ordinary people, and I am tired of seeing our jobs shipped overseas. And, more importantly, the American people hopefully watching and listening tonight are tired of their tax dollars being spent to subsidize those jobs being sent to Sonora, Mexico, where, by the way, the people down there have no trade unions, don't have enough money to even purchase the products that they are making. And I believe that all of us, whether you are a Republican or Democrat or Independent, have seen the hemorrhaging. 
   In textile, in my industry, thousands of jobs are gone, not because people couldn't do it, but because they can't compete against 18 cents an hour. It is impossible. Not simply because these people were getting benefits and other things that they desperately needed so they can do like I did and buy a home and put their kids through school and go to college and do the right thing; these are veterans of our country who have fought and defended it. They come back and had a job that was taken away from them, not because of anything they did wrong. 
   So here is what I propose: How about a little corporate responsibility? But how about, let's tell our trade negotiators that we want trade, but let's make it fair and free? Let us don't negotiate our manufacturing jobs overseas. And, by the way, let me just say, I have a lot of agriculture in my district, and farmers are the last group brought to bear on the trade negotiations. 
   They are never brought to the table. I think we have to have, as Representative Kagen said, an administration and a Congress that says to the trade negotiators, look, we want trade; we want to be able to negotiate a decent standard of trade for our folks. But we will not do it by simply abdicating our manufacturing base, whether it is in steel or textile or automobiles, whatever it is, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in this country, and not every one of them is going to sit behind a computer terminal the rest of their life and work. They want to be welders. They want to produce steel. They want to produce automobiles. They want to cut men's suits like I am wearing tonight that, by the way, was made in Chicago, Illinois, by working men and women. 
   So I would just encourage everybody this evening as we have this debate on trade that, from my perspective, I ran on this issue, and I am going to be a Congressman on this issue. I am not going to vote for a trade deal that is going to send one more job overseas. I am not going to vote for a trade deal that abdicates the responsibility, and to go back to my district and as some people say, well, you know, we are in a global economy. It is high tech. Well, I understand I am in a global economy. I wasn't born yesterday. But I also know, to those men and women from Maytag that don't know what they are going to do for their health care now that it is gone, for health care, their pensions that are on the line that they are losing, those people from KSIH that lost their jobs simply because they happen to be a union plan and maybe made a bit too much money; I say to those folks that, today, this Congress needs to stand up for working men and women. It needs to say we want trade in this country. We will work very hard to make sure that we have the ability to export our products, but at the same time, the one product that we are no longer going to export in this country is the men and women and their futures and their children, because there is no place for that in fair and free trade. 
   With that, I just want to thank the gentleman for allowing me to speak this evening for a few moments on this issue. I believe very deeply in this. The great news about being a freshman is sometimes we don't come with the best prepared speeches. I think we speak a lot from the heart. But I can tell you this much, from a former clothing perspective, in our union, there is a movie called, ``The Inheritance,'' that talks about how the union was formed. And at the very end of it, a little old man looks into the end, and I would say to our friends on the other side of the aisle who don't want to work with us on this straight policy, he says, ``You think this is the end? My friend, this is only the beginning.'' 
   This 1-hour tonight is the beginning of changing trade policy in this country and in this Chamber. And I am honored to be part of it.

   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for the Record to reflect that I was unavoidably detained due to tornado-like conditions in my district in west-central Illinois. 
   If I had been present for rollcall votes, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 512, ``yea'' on rollcall 513, ``yea'' on rollcall 514, ``nay'' on rollcall 515, ``yea'' on rollcall 516, ``yea'' on rollcall 517, ``yea'' on rollcall 518, ``yea'' on rollcall 519, and ``yea'' on rollcall 520, and finally, Mr. Speaker, ``yea'' on rollcall 521.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment, and I commend my friend and colleague, Representative Dave Loebsack, for offering it during today's discussion on the National Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act. 
   Mr. Loebsack's district in Iowa and my district in Illinois both suffered major flooding in May and June with crests on the Mississippi River of over 500-year levels. As you can imagine, this caused great damage not only to our constituents' homes, farms and schools but also to bridges, roads and to other infrastructure in the flood impacted communities. This is the second 500-year flood to hit our region in the past 15 years. 
   Something must be done to improve public safety and to ensure minimal devastation from floods in the future. Mr. Loebsack's amendment would do just that by requiring the Transportation Secretary, in consultation with the States, to study the risks proposed by a 500-year flood to bridges on Federal-aid highways, on other public roads and on Indian reservations. 
   I believe the information we gather from this study will result in significant improvement to bridge safety and will help our river communities better prepare for flood disasters in the future. Examining more factors affecting public safety is the role of government, and it's good for our constituents. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill. Again, I thank my friend Mr. Loebsack for his leadership on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (OPPOSE PERU AND PANAMANIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the pending Peru and Panama free trade agreements. Over 3 million American manufacturing jobs, one out of every six jobs, have been lost during the fast-track era. How many more manufacturing jobs will be lost with the passage of these two trade deals? How many more? 
   My district in particular has suffered the loss of 1,600 jobs when NAFTA forced Maytag to leave Galesburg, Illinois, for Sonora, Mexico. Every aspect of that town was hurt: its spirit, the  economy, the schools, and the small businesses that supplied goods to Maytag. 
   Now Galesburg is trying to rebuild its identity. 
   The November 2006 election showed that most Americans understand our past trade policies, which gave us NAFTA and the WTO, have failed; yet President Bush continues to bring more flawed trade agreements to this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, on May 10, Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee reached a landmark deal with the Bush administration to include labor and environmental protection in free trade agreements. The deal requires our trading partners to adopt, maintain and enforce in their laws and practice the five basic international labor standards: freedom of association, right to collective bargaining, elimination of forced labor, abolition of child labor, and elimination of discrimination. 
   As positive as this deal was, I have absolutely no faith that this President will enforce any labor provisions included in any trade deal. In a statement released on May 11, AFL-CIO president John Sweeney reminded us of the Bush administration's enforcement failure in past agreements by saying, ``The Bush administration's consistent unwillingness to enforce trade violations against nations like Jordan and China reminds us that there is no guarantee that this executive branch will enforce any new rights workers may gain through these negotiations.'' 
   This administration can't even enforce OSHA regulations here at home. How can we expect this President and this administration to enforce laws in these two countries? Recently, I received a letter from two Peruvian labor federations concerned about the labor provisions in the pending FTA between the United States and Peru. In reference to the May 10 announcement, the letter states, ``These changes are important. Nevertheless, in order for there to be real progress that does not only exist on paper, it is necessary that the administrations of President Bush and Garcia adopt significant change that they do not appear willing to do.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, no one seems to have faith in this President or the Peruvian Government to enforce the law. The problem is that those who support the FTA in Peru are the same people that oppose labor reform in Peru. 
   Mr. Speaker, our trade policies must start to serve the interests of American working families and workers around the globe. I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to say ``no'' to President Bush's trade agreement with Peru. We have a moral responsibility to save the manufacturing jobs that this Nation has lost and to try to regain those jobs that we have outsourced.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY PRODUCED OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration is asking this Congress to approve a $700 billion blank check for Wall Street in the hopes that they can begin to fix the economic crisis that this administration helped create. 
   For 8 years now, President Bush, Senator McCain and this Republican Congress implemented the GOP philosophy of economics: First, shower the wealthy with the tax breaks in hopes that it trickles down to the middle- class; and second, eliminate all regulations so there are no longer any referees watching the barons of Wall Street. 
   Both these policies have failed miserably. Tax cuts for the wealthy are not trickling down to the middle class. In fact, over the last 8 years, real wages have fallen by $300 and the Republicans' lack of government regulation allowed Wall Street to game the system. Today, our entire economy is suffering because Washington Republicans refused to institute the proper oversight that is necessary to keep Wall Street in check. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Bush administration wants to bail out Wall Street, it is important that this Congress look out for Main Street and get some assurances that this will never happen again.

<DOCNO>Mr. HARE. (VOTE ``NO'' ON THE U.S.-PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Peru Free Trade Agreement. I just lost the third of four clothing factories in my district on Friday; hardworking men and women thrown out of work not because they couldn't do the job, but because they couldn't compete. 
   We have a responsibility as Members, whether you are Republican or Democrat, from whatever State you come from, to stand up for the American workers. I can't go back to my district and I will not go back to my district and try to explain to my workers who are losing their jobs, if you will just wait until we pass another trade deal that this President is not going to enforce. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to please vote ``no'' on the Peru Free Trade Agreement when it comes up. We can do much better, we owe it to our workers, and we will do much better.
