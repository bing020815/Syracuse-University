<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (MAJORITY MAKERS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I am really honored to join my members of this freshman class. I am so proud to be a Member of the 110th Congress. 
   I just wanted to point out that this week as we contemplate and as we've seen the three reports, the GAO report, the report from General Petraeus, the report from General Jones, we are at a point where we have to make a big decision. The people of America and Iraq want our troops to have a safe but clear end point to this conflict. The surge has not been successful, as we see 11 of 18 legislative security and economic benchmarks set down have not been met. 
   But I just wanted to talk about a very interesting and curious development in this whole conflict, which is that part of the story of the Iraq conflict is the contractors. Blackwater is the most well known of them, but that's not the only one. There's DynCorp, there's Titan, there's Casey, there's many of them. As a matter of fact, what we have seen is a privatization of this conflict. We've seen the privatization of this conflict as literally estimated at upwards of 150,000 contractors have been in Iraq. And the question is, since we've never privatized a war, since we've always kept an essential governmental function, which is defense of the Nation, within the firm hands of the government and we've never really privatized a military conflict before, what does all of this mean? Interestingly and sadly, we've seen this privatization situation devolve into a very dangerous situation which I believe has in many ways compromised national security and has damaged the reputation of the United States and has led, in my view, to a situation where the Iraqi Government, even though it is a government under occupation, under U.S. military occupation, has had to make a statement to throw Blackwater out of its country. 
   Now, think about that. This is a government that is not in full control of its own country but has mustered itself and said, Look, in order to go forward, this institution, Blackwater, must leave our country. I just want to talk about this a little bit because I think that it's an important part of the story and it needs to be told even from the floor of Congress. 
   The recent incident that I'm talking about has caused the Iraqi Government to revoke the license of Blackwater. This is the result of a situation, of a killing of Iraqi citizens that happened on September 11, 2007 and the wounding of 14 others by a Blackwater USA security company. Ostensibly, this private security company guards U.S. Embassy personnel in Iraq. Blackwater USA is based in North Carolina and is one of the largest of at least 28 different private security firms that have received governmental contracts to work in Iraq, paid for by at least $4 billion in taxpayer dollars. 
   This group, funded by American taxpayer dollars through their contract, seems to hold very few American values, it seems to me, except for making money, by some accounts as much as five times the amount that our brave soldiers make. Five times the amount the average soldier is making is what one of these contractors can make, particularly one that was in Blackwater. According to one source, in February 2004, Blackwater started training former Chilean commandos, some of whom were serving during the Pinochet years in Chile, for duty in Iraq. People who know the Pinochet regime know that this regime was known for people disappearing in the country. Torture was routine. Other news reports indicate that four of the guards killed in January while working for a subcontractor had served in South Africa's security forces during the apartheid era, and one of them had applied for amnesty for crimes that he committed while operating under the apartheid regime. Not good news. 
   Press reports further indicate that this latest incident was not isolated, with Iraqi Interior Minister spokesman Abdul-Karim Khalaf calling the episode the ``last and biggest mistake'' committed by Blackwater. 
   Khalaf went on to say, ``Security contracts do not allow them to shoot people randomly. They are here to protect personnel, not to shoot people without reason.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we are not in a position to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people if we have cowboy mercenary vigilantes. Blackwater seems to be accountable neither to the Iraqi Government, and there are serious questions as to whether they're even accountable to the U.S. Government. They are not subject to the Geneva Convention, which our soldiers are. If accounts of this and other incidents prove to be accurate, and of course due process is critically important, then the Iraqi Government's actions to expel Blackwater from Iraq could indicate the first concrete sign that a real government may exist in Baghdad. Who knows. We'll see. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is very critical that we continue to look into this issue of private contractors. It is an important part of the story of Iraq. It is a critical and fundamental part of this dialogue that we're having. We can't privatize our Nation's national defense. When we do, we lose control of these people. 
   Mercenary actions are not deemed sanctioned by U.N. charter. And to hire a private mercenary army is something that we should not be associated with. They call themselves security contractors, and yet they have been involved  in major military actions in Najaf. Everybody remembers the horrific incident that occurred in Fallujah that was succeeded by a major action against that city. At this point I think it's important for us to pay much closer attention to this situation and put some real accountability on this situation. 
   I yield back at this time, but I do ask that we raise these important issues and focus on exactly what this means for our country and our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, last week Democrats and Republicans came together here in Congress to pass a bipartisan bill that will ensure that 10 million low-income children have access to private health care insurance. The bill would invest $35 billion more over the next 5 years in the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's fully paid for, as this Congress has vowed to pay as we go. 
   Despite receiving strong bipartisan support here in Congress, President Bush is threatening to veto this legislation. He says the bill is simply too big. Instead, the President proposes a $5 billion funding increase that the nonpartisan CBO concludes would force 800,000 children to lose their health insurance. 
   Talk about misplaced priorities. President Bush didn't bat an eye when the Pentagon said that it needed as much as $200 billion, with a ``b,'' over the next year to continue the war in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush has no problem sending billions of dollars to  Iraq every day, but doesn't seem inclined to support an investment in children's health care here in the U.S. Talk about misplaced priorities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding time and for this excellent resolution. I'd like to thank all of the authors, including Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and everyone who signed on to the resolution commemorating the month of Ramadan. 
   I am celebrating Ramadan myself personally, and I have been doing so ever since my 19th birthday. I'm 44 now, and I can tell you that it is a time of reflection, a time of renewal, and regeneration. 
   It's true that we fast during the daylight hours during Ramadan, but it also says in the sayings of Prophet Mohammed, that if you do not refrain from ill speech, bad speech, bad words, basically a bad attitude and negative disposition, then God has no use of your refraining from food and drink. And so in this month of Ramadan, it's important to reassess your life, to contemplate your role in society and to benefit your neighbor. 
   I think it's very important when we talk about ``neighbor'' that we reflect upon what that word really means, ``neighbor.'' It was Jesus, who the Muslims call Esau and who they revere very highly, who told the lawyer in the Bible that his neighbor really wasn't even somebody of his own religion or his own tribe but really was that Samaritan from that other group who lended assistance and gave a helping hand when it was needed. And that is the origin of the story of the Good Samaritan. 
   This idea of the neighbor is something that's very important in Islam, especially during Ramadan where Muslims of all faiths, all colors, all backgrounds, reach out to our neighbors, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist of all types. 
   I want to report to you, Mr. Speaker, that over the course of the last several weeks we've had several Iftar celebrations right here in the Capitol and also in the Pentagon and a tremendous demonstration of interfaith cooperation, interfaith working together and mutual respect and recognition. 
   As was said earlier, and I quite agree, every faith tradition relies on fasting as a means for spiritual regeneration. I also want to report to you that on the date of Yom Kippur, which is the Jewish holiday of atonement and the commemoration of the time of the new year, that my mosque in Minneapolis and the synagogue Temple Israel in Minneapolis joined together to break fast together, and we ended up with a good problem, Mr. Speaker, and that is, that there were 150 people who RSVP'ed and said they wanted to come. We ended up with about 160 people coming, and we didn't have enough chairs for everybody, but we had enough food because we shared it, Mr. Speaker, showing again that we're not too far apart. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'd also like to let you know that many of our Christian friends came to celebrate the breaking of the fast with the Muslims and Jews together, and we're really warmed and encouraged by the fact that we can all come together even though we have different faith traditions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, let me again thank the wonderful, excellent commemoration we're having today as a true expression of American values, religious tolerance, inclusion of everyone.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chairman, let me start by thanking Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this critical and much-needed legislation to the floor. I'm proud to have worked with both of them on this important legislation which represents the most comprehensive response yet in the American mortgage crisis. 
   The package of housing measures that we will vote on today and that I proudly support will help thousands of families facing foreclosure keep their homes. This bill will ultimately help other families avoid foreclosures in the future and help recovery of communities harmed by empty homes caught in the foreclosure crisis. 
   This legislation comes before us at an important time in the mortgage foreclosure and housing crisis. The Pew Center has stated that between seven to eight thousand people per day are filing for foreclosure. Hennepin County alone, which is the largest county in the Fifth District of Minnesota that I represent, has experienced a 54 percent increase in foreclosures from the year before. Statewide foreclosures have risen by 39 percent. 
   The legislation we're considering today establishes a $15 billion HUD-administered loan and grant program for the purpose of rehabilitation of vacant, foreclosed homes with the goal of occupying them as soon as possible. 
   Madam Chairman, let me just say this: The fact of the matter is that for the people who paid every single mortgage payment and were never late even one time, they are suffering because of this mortgage crisis because they live on a block with foreclosed homes. 
   This bill saves money. Can you imagine the cost to a city, in terms of fire, police and public works resources, just to be able to deal with a home that's foreclosed on a block? This is saving money. This is actually improving the quality of life for people all over America. And this amount of money that we will spend on this bill will pay thousand-fold in terms of quality of life for people all over this country. 
   And so I'm proud to be able to associate myself with this bill, proud to be able to say that when the people of America face a serious foreclosure crisis that is affecting not just the victims of foreclosure, but others, we responded.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, every day between 7,000 and 8,000 people file for foreclosures on their homes. In the next 2 years, one in 33 homeowners is projected to be in foreclosure as a result of subprime loans.  
   But the housing crisis doesn't only affect families losing their homes. An additional 40 million neighboring homeowners could see their property values drop, with 44 percent of all homeowners likely to feel the ripple effect of foreclosures from subprime loans. 
   And the overall impact does not end in the housing market. The ripple effects are felt throughout the economy with a reduction in economic activity and severe job loss. 
   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot turn our Nation's economy around without properly addressing the housing crisis, and that is exactly what we plan to do this week. Today, House Democrats will bring a package of housing bills to the House floor that will address the current housing crisis, while also seeking to prevent the problem from getting worse. These bills are the appropriate response to a problem that is affecting our families, our communities and our overall economy. I hope it receives the bipartisan support that it deserves, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chairwoman, let me thank the leadership for bringing forth this very important human rights act. Human rights are labor rights; labor rights are human rights. And for the last several years, the only intimidation that has been going on has not been by labor unions but by employers. 
   Ten employees of the Brinks Home Security Minnesota branch met in secret in 2004 to discuss problems with their employer. They feared for their jobs if talk about a union became public. But they decided a life with a living wage, some health care, and a pension plan was worth the risk. They signed authorization cards to have the IBEW represent them. This was in January of 2005. The National Labor Relations Board certified the IBEW as the employees' bargaining agent. That was on March 16, 2005. Contract negotiations began with Brinks in April, and they have dragged on for nearly 2 years now with no contract in sight. 
   This is a company with an average monthly income of $27 million. Why should they work for a company who insists on contracts with their customers but not with their own employees?  
   We need the Employee Free Choice Act to make sure we can get a contract. Thank you, leadership. Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for kicking it to me because, I just want to elaborate on one of those stories you just told. I think it is very important to tell the stories, and for the freshmen who come to this Congress as the difference makers, we have to tell the stories of the people because it is from the stories of the people that we make the difference. 
   We have to remember that the difference that we are sitting here to make is rooted in the real life experiences of the people who sent us here to act, which is why I was so overjoyed to cast that ``yes'' vote. We saw a vote of 241-185. That is not close. We are here to send a message and to make a difference, and the Employee Free Choice Act is just that. 
   But let me share this with you. Ten employees of the Brink's Home Security, Minneapolis branch, met in secret in 2004 to discuss problems with their employer. They feared for their jobs if the talk about the union became public, but they decided that a life with a living wage, some health care and a pension plan was worth the risk. They signed authorization cards to have the IBEW represent them. This was back in January 2005. 
   The National Labor Relations Board certified the IBEW as the employees' bargaining agent, and that was in March 16, 2005. Contract negotiations began with Brink's that April and have dragged on for nearly 2 years now with no contract. This is a company whose average monthly income is $27 million. 
   The employees have a simple question for their employer: Why should they work for a company who insists on contracts with its customers but not with their own employees? That is a question I think needs to be answered, and the answer lies in the Employee Free Choice Act because dragging it on, taking employees down a slow dance, dragging it out, not getting down to a real contract is something  that the Employee Free Choice Act is going to remedy. 
   But I am going to tell you all why it is that some employers resist the union, even after one has been authorized, and I think the answer lies in this simple chart. 
   The Union Advantage, Median Weekly Earnings, what we see is unionized employees make an average of more than $800 a week, and yet nonunion are down here just above $600. That is quite a bit of difference, 200 bucks a week. That is the difference between fixing the window that is broken, fixing the garage door, patching the roof, sending your child to school with good, decent clothing. That is the difference between a nice meal or, you know, spaghetti every single night. It is the difference between a quality of life and not. 
   I just want to tell you all that I am proud to stand here with you. We are the difference makers. Therefore, we should make a difference, and I would like to recognize my good friend from Iowa, Congressman Braley.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Thank you, Congressman Hodes. I am looking forward to correcting some of those myths, too. It is very important, Mr. Speaker, that the public knows the truth from the myths. 
   But before we go back to correcting the Record and making everything clear, I just want to tell another story, if I may, because I think it is important again for us to root our presentation in real-life experience. 
   In 2003, employees of Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis voted 61 percent to unionize. They did so in part because of their disgust with the health center that punished them for taking time off to be with ill family members. Quite ironic for a health center. 
   Anyway, the employees were immediately harassed and intimidated; they had all kinds of problems that they had to deal with because of their effort to unionize. And today, management continues to appeal the 2003 election, despite losing every appeal with the National Labor Relations Board. But their appeals have prevented the will of the workers to have their union recognized. And I think again, it is very important that we focus on what real people are dealing with. 
   Meanwhile, employees acting on behalf of their union have been harassed and disciplined, as I said, even fired for their union activity even though they voted and have gotten the union by a 2-1 margin. And I think it is time for companies like the ones we have talked about to step up to the plate and recognize the union. It is time to have something like the Employee Free Choice Act to make there be a vehicle to have a contract. 
   And I just want to associate myself with the comments of Congressman Yarmuth. It is absolutely right that there are many employers who understand the importance of respecting the right to organize. We don't want to demonize them. What we are looking for is all Americans, workers and employees, to do well. The great Senator Paul Wellstone is known for saying, ``We all do better when we all do better.'' So when the employers do better, workers should also do better, and, all around, Americans should say the common good is a good idea and we should continue to focus on it.

   Mr. ELLISON. Well, Congressman, I want to thank you for that question. It is an excellent question. Labor rights are human rights. 
   I think it is important to know that Martin Luther King, who lost his life in Memphis, Tennessee, April 4, 1968, was actually helping sanitation workers gain their rights in an effort to unionize and have collective bargaining. That union, which was mostly African American membership, received help from their main-stream headquarters union, which was in New York, but got a lot of help that way. 
   It is important to remember that when Martin Luther King lost his life that the union drive and the strike did not end. It continued on, and the strike was successful. It is important to know that the right of human dignity, human rights and labor rights, are inextricably linked together. 
   One of the first things that my father and mother would tell me as a child is that Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, is a place where Walter Reuther of the UAW and Martin Luther King of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference walked down the street arm in arm with Reverend C.L. Franklin demanding labor rights, human rights, civil rights. It is all one thing, and that is what we have all got to be about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Congressman Hodes, I just want to agree with you there. The fact is that this Employee Free Choice Act actually provides more opportunity, more choice, not less. It is critical to understand that. 
   Again, I want to recognize good employers who work cooperatively with their unions, but I also don't want to turn my eyes to the fact that there has been intimidation, but by and large, not on behalf of the union. In fact, I have a whole stack of horror stories that go along with workers trying to organize. 
   But I wanted to just talk a little bit, before we begin to wind up, about how important the Employee Free Choice Act is for working-class and middle-class prosperity. I want to start out my comments just by pointing out that over the last 6 years of this administration we have seen poverty increase by about 1 million people every year. 
   Right now we have got about 39 million Americans who live below what the government calls the poverty line, 39 million. That is a lot of people, and that is unacceptable in America. 
   Now, you might say we are not talking about poor folks, we are talking about workers. Well, let me tell you what a worker is. A worker is a person who works hard every day and makes a decent salary. Let me tell you what a poor person is, a worker who lost their job and hasn't gotten their paychecks for a little while. 
   So the ranks of the poor and the ranks of the working and middle class are tied together. So many people are only a few paychecks away, if not one paycheck away, from disaster. So we cannot ignore the rise in poverty during the Bush administration and say that it is not connected to workers' rights. It is directly connected. 
   We also have to talk about how the ranks of the uninsured have increased every year during the Bush administration. This, again, is tightly tied to the fortunes of the working class people, our folks. We have to be clear that if we have an Employee Free Choice Act in which people can organize and people can form together, build a union, what they can do is they can parlay that organizational power into greater benefits for American people. 
   We can now begin to form the basis of a real universal health care system, a system in which everybody can have health care in our society. We can parlay it into a real credit reform system where people are not subject to the vicissitudes of what some creditor lending institution wants to do with regard to lending practices, payday loans, all these kinds of things that sort of eat away at what working-class people are doing. 
   They can pull up, they can build a little fence around the fortunes of the working class, which I think are so important, and really sort of redirect the focus of our country towards the common good, which is where it should be.     
   So let me just say that the myths are important to address and I am glad we have done that. But I just want to say that this Employee Free Choice Act is giving working people a hedge, a fence, a wall, a protection in order to improve the lives of everyday people. 
   And I just want to turn our attention to this chart I have to my left which shows real median household income. For those of you who don't know the difference between real and unreal, it just means adjusted for inflation. 
   When we take inflation into account, we see that the median household income of Americans has dipped between 2000 and now and has gone down precipitously, dramatically, and we cannot allow it to continue. 
   If you have unionized workers, they don't need us to go pass a minimum wage law. They don't need us to think about some of these basic things. They do it for themselves. They have the power in their own hands when they can organize.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, General David Petraeus acknowledged that we will not see any significant improvements in the situation on the ground in Iraq by September. 
   When President Bush first proposed the troop escalation plan at the beginning of this year, he said we should know if it's actually working by the beginning of the summer. A couple of months later, when the troops were actually on the ground, the President revised that time frame, saying that we should have a good grasp if the plan is working by September. 
   Now we have confirmation from the President's top general on the ground that positive signs in Iraq will continue to be elusive. 
   The question now is, will the administration do as it has in the past and change the deadline? 
   Moving deadlines are simply no longer acceptable. President Bush has been promising for months that we would see significant changes come September, and since that is no longer possible, a significant change in direction is needed in Iraq. 
   It is time for the President and the congressional Republicans to realize that Petraeus is now admitting that no improvements will be seen by September.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, tonight the freshmen, the Democrats of the Freshman Caucus are going to take the rest of this hour to talk about our economy. And it's an excellent way to move forward, Mr. Speaker, because the prior speaker had some interesting things for us to chew on, and we will help the American people to see that under Republican control, the economy has not fared well, that they're not good at running the economy, and the proof is out there for everybody. 
   We'll be able to show how, when Democrats are in charge, that we do have job growth, we do have strong economy, we do have an economy where we are reducing poverty. We have an economy where all Americans are doing better than they were doing before. 
   I think it is obvious to everyone if you reflect only a few years ago in the late 1990s--I think it was a different President in office than the one we have now--that the economy was much better than it is today and that it is these policies that we've seen over the last 8 years where it was a Republican House, a Republican President, that have really led us to the difficult situation that American consumers and workers are seeing today. 
   So we have a different vision. We have a vision that includes everybody. We have a vision that says that workers should have the right to organize. We have a vision that says we should have a fair trade policy. We have a vision that says that we need investment in our public infrastructure. We have a vision that says that we need universal health care coverage for all people. We have a vision for an economy, Mr. Speaker, that says that everybody counts and everybody matters.

I consider you one of the most learned persons on this issue in the Congress, and I just want to know, isn't this proposal of just drilling in the Continental Shelf, drilling in ANWR, isn't this kind of like trying to cure a disease by simply treating the symptoms of the disease? For example, if I were to have cancer, you could try to find a cure for my cancer, or you could simply try to alleviate the symptoms of the suffering that I am enduring but not really get to the root of the matter.

   I think it's important when you mention construction jobs and retrofits and things like that, what you're talking about is the green economy, an economy that can include everybody, people who can do relatively menial jobs and also the innovators. Up and down the educational scale. But it's going to take training, it's going to take opportunity, and it is going to take courage.

   Mr. ELLISON. So what we need is a vision for a green economy for now and in the future where we can increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles, where we can invest in transportation and transit, where we can move people and not just cars, where we can take some of our old windy buildings where right out of the roof the heat's just going out, retrofit them for some green roofs. 
   Are these the kinds of things that you have in mind, Mr. Perlmutter?

   Mr. ELLISON. Well, you know, Mr. Perlmutter, when you talk about these energy issues, it makes me think that this is where the country, I think, really wants to go. I mean, in these last several months we've heard a lot about change. It seems Americans want change. We don't want to be stuck in oil handcuffs. We want to go towards an energy future that includes everybody and that where we need to invest in our innovation, we need to invest in our brain power, you know, where we can have a into new opportunity in our country to make sure that we're not polluting the air, warming up the globe. 
   And again, as our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about, well, why don't we just drill off the Continental Shelf off Florida, they kind of imply it's just a matter of sunbathers not wanting to see an unsightly rig out there. Of course it is ugly to see that. But that does minimize the real concerns we're talking about; isn't that right, Mr. Perlmutter?

   Mr. ELLISON. As we talked about the gas prices and things like this, we'll be talking more about that as we get closer to the end of the hour. But I also want to bring some other things into the conversation which I think are very important. 
   One of those things is that today the House tried to increase the unemployment insurance, and we tried to put it on the suspension calendar and pass it that way. Unfortunately, we did not meet the marker we were looking for. We needed three more votes to get there on suspension calendar, and we are not going to quit. As you know, the Democrats have a lot of fortitude, and we don't quit, and we are persistent and dogged in our efforts to stand up for the American people. 
   But the Senate recently did pass a 13-week extension of the unemployment insurance as part of a supplemental appropriation, and I think that it is really indicative of the situation people are finding themselves in. 
   As we're talking about $4 a gallon gas, we also have to take into consideration, Mr. Speaker, that we've seen 30 years of stagnant wages, except for that period in the late 1990s when we had a Democratic President. We have seen 30 years of stagnant wages except for that 1990s blip, and now that paycheck is being asked to do more, being asked to take on more child care, more health care, more fuel prices, more in terms of food prices. 
   Americans are in a difficult situation, and I dare say that now we have about 8.5 million unemployed people  who need help, and I think that it is a little unfortunate we were not able to pass that mark today with that unemployment insurance, but I'm sure that we're going to keep on trying until we get it. 
   I just wonder how the people in Colorado are faring. Are they unemployed, having a tough time there, and basically, as we see ourselves having creeping expenses for our food, fuel and things like that?

   Mr. ELLISON. Well, you know, all of us are looking for better days. You know, I can tell you that my constituents in Minnesota let me know that we've been hit with the foreclosure crisis as well as stagnant wages, and I'm sad to report to you that the Nation's job market showed clear signs of recessionary conditions, as the jobless rate leapt up a half a percent in May alone from 5 percent to 5.5 percent. That's a lot of people, and that's according to our Bureau of Labor Statistics. And this monthly increase was the largest since the mid-1980s. It's been a while, pushing unemployment to the highest rate since 2004. 
   I don't like to rattle the sabers in terms of the partisan divide, but I'm one, speaking only for myself, who's prepared to say that, you know, the Democrats have a better vision for how to run the economy, vision in terms of the energy future, vision in terms of trying to get some unemployment insurance extended so that people can have a little relief as they try to find that next hard-to-find job. 
   But I think it's important that we see this thing in a broader context.

   Mr. ELLISON. We need a safety net. We need to have a caring Nation, and Americans are a caring people and a compassionate people, but we also are a working people and we want to work, and we also need a vision for our future because if you're unemployed right now, this might not be a bad time to think about getting some extra education, as long as you can get some unemployment insurance, and if you get that education, maybe you want to think about a green job for a green energy future. 
   You know, I want to add, too, while we're on the subject of jobs, the payroll contracted for the fifth month in a row, down 49,000 with most of the net job losses occurring in the construction industry, factories, offices, and retailers. Since the total payroll peaked last December, they've been down by around 324,000 jobs since the government sector tends to be less cyclically affected by downturns. 
   And looking at just the private sector, job loss can provide a more accurate gauge of the lagging economy's impact on job growth. Private sector employment has fallen over the past 6 months by over 400,000 jobs. I'm not happy to report that to you, Mr. Speaker, but it is the situation that people are facing, and I think it's important that this Congress be willing to respond to the needs of the people, which is why we needed three more votes in order to get that extension of the unemployment insurance passed as we tried to do today. 
   I think we're going to hit that mark. We're certainly not going to quit. I certainly believe that there are a lot of people out there who really want this policy. They certainly can get on the phone, get on the e-mail, and let folks who represent them know how they feel. But this unemployment extension is a big deal, but I think it's important as we push to extend unemployment insurance benefits that we tell folks that while they know they're dealing with putting the food on the table tomorrow and paying the rent tomorrow and paying the mortgage tomorrow, we want them to look to a better future, and that involves the green job economy that you've so amply described. 
   I also want to just say, too, as we talk about the economy and the job situation that, you know, we've got to have a real clear understanding about those indicators that tell us which direction the economy is going in. And I'm looking for a time when we can actually set policies in place that really will give Americans the kind of vision that they need, as we talked about just a little while ago.

   Mr. ELLISON. Well, you know, Mr. Speaker, these are important facts you bring up. I kind of think of that period  after World War II, up until about 1973, as the almost, almost golden age of America. I say ``almost'' because it was marked by Jim Crow and other things like that, very important, serious issues. And we've come a long way. Our country's come a long way. 
   But you cannot ignore the fact that after World War II, you had the GI Bill. You had FHA. We had already established Social Security to make sure that no seniors had to live out their retirement in an undignified way. And we also had tax rates for the very wealthy that were much, much higher than they are now, and we also had a higher rate of unionization. 
   I know some folks don't understand how important that is, but the fact is, in 1957, 33 percent of all workers were in a union. Another 33 percent were paid like they were, and folks were living relatively well. We all look back at those old TV shows and kind of chuckle now at how corny they were, but they actually were doing pretty well economically in the 1950s. 
   And the fact is that some of these kind of policies are things we need today, but we have the advantage today to have greater equality which is so great, you know. It's a great honor of America that we have overcome some of those things of the past, those lack of equality issues. But as we've gotten greater social equality, we've lost in the area of income and economic equality, and we've got to revitalize our economy to make sure that everybody can share in it. And I think that green jobs are the way, but a compassionate response to people who are unemployed now is also part of the picture as well. 
   And you mentioned your dad. My dad was born in 1928, went to World War II, to the Pacific at a very young age, about 17 years old, but he did go. He was a military person and served in the Pacific, was in Hawaii and was a beneficiary of the GI Bill and was able to go to college, Wayne State University in Detroit, on that program. And it made him into a man who could put five boys through college, me and my brothers, and you know, it's an amazing thing. 
   You know, I am proud of my brothers. They're all doing well. They're all doing great. And the fact is, none of us would be doing this well if our dad had not been the beneficiary of an enlightened, compassionate, common-sense program like the GI Bill, and I'm glad that we're able to pass it through this House. And I pray that the President sees the light and passes and signs that bill.

   Mr. ELLISON. There has been actual progress on the ground in Colorado. I'm happy to report that in Minneapolis we have a wonderful VA hospital there, and we've seen things getting better all the time. But I want to let the veterans know that, as we talk tonight about the economy, we've talked about gas prices, we've talked about unemployment insurance, looking out for our veterans, making sure our veterans have economic opportunity, educational opportunity, health care opportunity is part of the whole dialogue. This is a working class prosperity issue, veterans' benefits. GI Bill benefits is a factor when it comes to trying to make sure that the American middle class, American working class has a real chance at doing well in this economy. So I want to thank you for bringing that out. 
   And I just want to say, you know, that it's important to understand veterans as an important component in our economy because when you just separate the soldier from the economy, you forget that the soldier is coming back. And they should have a good way to go when they get back. 
   You know, I also just wanted to mention, as we start walking into our final 15 minutes tonight, that we just had a Memorial Day. And on that day, I am proud to tell you that a number of our veterans are well aware of some of these programs; a number of them are well aware of the work that Congress is trying to do, not always with a cooperative White House, but on some things we have found cooperation, and we're thankful for that. 
   And I just want to mention to you as well that it's really tough on our veterans to have to deal with foreclosure. I've had a few vets in my district, while they were away, they had only their spouse to try to keep up the mortgage, and they've fallen behind. And I bring that up only because I think that it's important, as we talk about this, that we do mention that a part of what this Democratic Congress and the ``difference makers,'' this freshman class, has been a part of is trying to close the gap when it comes to the foreclosure crisis. 
   You know, I don't have to tell you, Mr. Perlmutter, that we're dealing with about 2,800 foreclosures a day. We're dealing with about 20,000 a week. We're dealing with a very serious problem. And I just want to point out that this foreclosure crisis is something that there have been bills introduced that try to forestall foreclosure for a veteran, for a soldier who's overseas, but it's something that really is affecting our entire economy. 
   We've passed bills through the House recently that will allow FHA to be put in a position to buy some of these mortgages and restructure them going forward. I think it's important that we point this out because the Congress has been responsive. You and I are both on the Financial Services Committee, and so we both know that we've been working on this housing issue quite a bit. And also, last December, I believe, we also passed a bill through Congress, an anti-predatory lending bill that I think should pay some good dividends if we could get that enacted into law. 
   But this foreclosure crisis is hitting our veterans and it's hitting all of our people. And maybe you would like to comment on that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Well, you know, I'm glad you mentioned that it's not just the individual who is getting their  mortgage restructured with the FHA assistance who will benefit, actually, it's the neighborhood. Foreclosures really don't hit individuals alone, they hit neighborhoods. Because if you end up with a foreclosed home and an abandoned house, it's an attractive nuisance for people in the neighborhood who have bad intent. We know the price of copper. These houses are being stripped of their copper wiring. And oftentimes the copper strippers are not very careful about how they get it out. They've been known to nick and cut and damage gas lines and cause fires and explosions, not to mention other damage. 
   And so when you have a concentration of foreclosed and abandoned buildings in a neighborhood, it really does put downward pressure on the homes of everybody in the neighborhood, even the people who have been fortunate enough to pay every single mortgage payment on time every time. And so it really is something to help everybody, not just the individuals who are being directly assisted. 
   And of course, as you also know, when a house is abandoned, the city cannot receive property taxes on that house anymore. And so really what it's doing is coming up with a practical solution which will allow the bank to keep getting some of that money back, maybe not the originally intended amount, but a portion; of course half a loaf is better than none often. And so it's a practical solution to a serious problem. And it's just one more example of how Democrats and how freshman 
   Democrats like you and I are part of solutions to try to improve our Nation. 
   And we're trying to bring benefits not only to our citizens, but also, as you mentioned before, our veterans, trying to make sure that our vets and all kinds of people who are going through this foreclosure crisis are able to keep their homes, neighborhoods are able to be stable, cities are able to receive property tax, city police departments aren't having to run out to properties and spend resources kicking people out of abandoned houses, or fire departments putting out fires. It really is a responsible way to sort of operate and try to improve the situation here. 
   Well, Mr. Perlmutter, it looks like we've got about 5 minutes left. Any parting shots?

   Mr. ELLISON. Well, Mr. Perlmutter, I want to be a witness to what you just said. You have made a great difference. You, together with our freshman class--which I'm also a member of--have been here trying to improve the lives of Americans. And what we've been offering, yes, vision on energy policy, yes, vision on dealing with unemployment insurance and the jobs and the economy, yes, vision on veterans. But what we're really offering is a bigger vision of America, not just a litany of bills, but a bigger vision of our country, a bigger vision, an America that is fairer, that's more prosperous, that's more innovative, that takes care of its own. This is the America that we all know we can have because people like your dad and mine fought for an American that could be that way. And we believe that it is our generation's responsibility to make a better America for our children and our parents and everyone. 
   So it's been great hanging out with you, Mr. Perlmutter. Have a great night.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (HISTORIC JUMP IN JOB LOSSES DEMANDS IMMEDIATE ACTION -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks to help workers out as they continue to look for a job. 
   Mr. Speaker, the grim numbers of five consecutive months of job losses is yet another sign that President Bush's economic policies have utterly failed the American people. The unemployment rate has surged from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May, representing the biggest one month jump in more than 2 decades, and climbing to the highest level in nearly 4 years. 
   These statistics are not just numbers to more than 1.5 million Americans who have seen their unemployment benefits expire simply because there are not enough jobs to go around. So today the House will vote to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks to help these workers. Democrats have been pushing to extend unemployment benefits since the beginning of the year, but have faced stiff opposition from the President and congressional Republicans. 
   Mr. Speaker, with job losses so far this year totaling 324,000, American families can wait no longer. Thanks to this Democratic Congress, today we are going to get some relief.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Well, Doctor, let me just add my voice and say I love to be on the House floor with my colleagues. You guys are servants of the people of the United States, whether we're from the upper Midwest or Iowa, Kentucky, or all the way out in Colorado, it's a joy to be in the company of people who care about the American working class and are willing to get out there strong to speak up for what working class people need. 
   You know, this stimulus package is to signal change in a broader sense to make our economy fair and more productive. It's signaling change. One hundred billion dollars is a whole lot of money, but when you think about this trillion-plus-dollar economy we live in, it's not a whole lot by comparison. But it's not designed to solve every problem, it's supposed to spark economic change, signal an overall change in the way our economy is structured so that we can have working class people prosper and grow. 
   My colleague from Colorado pointed out that it's not a matter of trickle down, it's bubble up. You put the money in the hands of middle-class people, they go out and buy washing machines, they go out and buy food, they go out and buy groceries, they put  their kids in school, and the next thing you know more deals are being done and you see an overall increase in the economy, a rising tide lifting all boats. You take care of the middle class and the rest will take care of itself. 
   If you give tax cuts to the wealthiest of the wealthy, the very definition of being rich is that you don't need the money. So, what do you do? You don't spend the money. You merge. You go buy some company overseas and then they take advantage of comparative wage differentials and the next thing you know we're exporting jobs. The fact is is that an economic stimulus targeted to people who really will spend that money and really do need that money and can spend that discretionary income will spark our economy. But it will only be a signal of an overall shift of economic fairness that has to do with our innovation agenda, that has to do with increasing the minimum wage, that has to do with decreasing the cost of college loans, an overall economic package that is big and that is structural that has to do with making changes to predatory lending laws, that has to do with our housing markets, an overall package that will take a little more time to implement, but an economic stimulus package that will happen soon and will spark economic growth directly affecting the unemployment numbers that jumped in December, and as Mr. Perlmutter correctly points out, directly affecting the increase in the Consumer Price Index as well. 
   Now, you know, the underlying source of this economy's weakness is the collapse in the housing market. In 1995, what happened to the housing market? Bam, straight to the moon. People thought it would never end. As a matter of fact, people bought houses, some of them subprime. Some of them found themselves thinking, well, if I buy this house right now, get into this subprime mortgage, the increasing housing values gives me wealth; I can refinance when this house is even worth more. But, you know, everything that goes up must come down. And as a matter of fact, when we saw people refinance these homes, they consumed that increased wealth in their house. That helped drive the consumer sector, but eventually these things come down and we are hitting the wall. 
   People are not making it, folks. We have a negative savings rate in America. Negative savings rate. That means if you get paid on Friday, you're out of money Wednesday night. That means you're hanging on and you're hoping that you can stretch that penny out to get to the end of the week. That means that instead of steak you're eating hamburger and instead of salmon you're eating tuna fish. And it's not funny. It's serious business. People are really, really struggling. 
   And so the fact is, folks, that we have a negative savings rate and that is why people are turning to the credit cards. That's why, when they get a big purchase, they've got to refinance their homes, although that's tough to do today, and that's why they go to title loans, payday loans and pawnshops. This is what is driving that move. We are drying up the consumer sector. 
   And I just want to say that we have seen record foreclosures in America, record foreclosures. We haven't seen this many foreclosures since the Great Depression.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. I want to respond directly to your point, Congressman, because I think this is one of the things that in a very palpable feeling way really struck home to me, and that was when I was campaigning back in 2006. I met a gentleman who kind of came to the front door when I knocked on his door. And he came in a very gingerly way; it was clear that he had suffered some kind of injury and wasn't feeling very good. And he said to me, you know, Keith, about a year ago I was up on my roof because me and my partner make a little more than minimum wage, not that much more than minimum wage, but we were able to get into the house because we got into the subprime mortgage. We got some credit cards that they sent to us that we didn't ask for. But because I didn't have a whole lot of money, I climbed up on that roof to fix it because it was leaking. I didn't want to see more damage happen to the house, we had to patch it. And I, as you might guess, fell off that roof. The guy fell off the roof and sustained some serious injuries. The injuries were too bad, his partner was going to try to put him in the car but he couldn't move him because he was hurting, and it was dangerous, and so he called the EMS truck, Emergency Medical Services. They came to get him. That was about 1,800 bucks right there. He didn't have health care insurance. He put the medical bills on the credit card as long as he could, couldn't pay that; as a matter of fact, paid one credit card, but on the other one he was late. Guess what happened to the interest rate on the credit card that he was on time for? It went up. That's called universal default. So, now he's paying 32 percent interest. He's getting further and further behind. He's not working. His partner is struggling to keep the mortgage paid. They see a reset in the mortgage. Now they are totally up. They are just really in bad shape now, and they are facing foreclosure. 
   When the man told me this story, he was dry in the eye but I was misty. I couldn't believe, I said, you know, not in America. People who work hard, 40 hours a week every week, cannot be in this situation. It's wrong. And I felt it was my responsibility to do something about it.     
   So when I stand on the floor to talk about working class prosperity with you here tonight, six Members of Congress, and when I heard our Speaker talk about this stimulus package, I was reminded of what happened when the great President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died. Back in those days, Representative Yarmuth, they used to have the coffin of the President loaded up on the trains. You know what I am talking about, Representative Walz? And that train was carrying that casket across the country. And there was a man who appeared at one of those train stops where that casket was being carried across the country, and there was a journalist there too, and the man was crying about the President. He was in tears over President Roosevelt. And as you know, he was the President during the Great Depression. 
   And the journalist walked up to the man and said to the man, ``Sir, I see that you're crying and very emotional over what happened to the President. Did you know President Roosevelt?'' 
   And the man gathered himself, cleared his threat, and he said, ``No, I didn't know President Roosevelt. But he knew me.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Congresswoman Sutton, it is a great honor to be here with you tonight together with our other colleagues in the freshman class who will be speaking in just a moment because I think it is important that the American people know that the freshman members of the Democratic Caucus came to this Congress, not to occupy space, not to warm a seat, but to create positive change for the American people, to project a vision, a vision of inclusion, of a generosity of fairness, a vision that says that this economy should be one where everybody can be successful. 
   This government should be one where everyone has access, not just lobbyists  and the privileged few, a system of government that people can feel proud of and not have to be worried that privileged individuals might be lining their pockets at the expense of the American people. 
   We came here on November 7. We were elected here by the American people because the American people, the finest people, have the right to feel good about their government, not cynical, not despondent, not despairing, but good and positive, who would say, Do you know what? I trust my government. I feel that my government is doing the right thing. We can do no less than to take up that charge. 
   We have to say the American people have a right to feel that their government is operating for the public good and in their best interests. And to that end, I am proud to be associated with this Democratic majority that from the very beginning began to signal change with the 100 hours program. The 100 hours program is not all that we are going to do, but, Mr. Speaker, we had to tell the American people that we are about business from the very beginning. We had to signal change from the very beginning. 
   We had to let them know that we care about the affordability of a college education by cutting student loan interest rates; we care about our seniors by making sure that we get a prescription drug benefit that actually helps our seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate. 
   We did a 100 hours program that said, we are going to raise the minimum wage; we are going to stop the oil and gas subsidies and put the money into renewable energy. We had to signal change. 
   That is not all we are going to do. We are just getting started. But we had to do something soon, something quick, something early, in the very beginning, so that the American people will know that we are putting money on the table. This is an earnest commitment to the American people to do real government, real change that they can feel good about. 
   So what I want to talk about very briefly tonight is how important it is and how happy I am that the Democratic Congress has taken steps regarding this scandal about the U.S. attorneys. The United States attorneys are members of our government under the executive branch whose job it is to do good, to promote justice. They are ministers of justice. They are not just lawyers who are entitled to advocate for their clients. Their job is higher. Their job is to do the right thing. Neither fear nor favor should influence them. Neither concern about their job nor worry about who is not going to like it should influence their behavior. They should enforce the law and protect the American people. 
   So when it came to light that U.S. attorneys that had had good recommendations, eight of them, were summarily fired with no explanation, and then when the explanations did come, their reputations were besmirched--they said that they were not good workers, that they were not good employees of the State, not carrying out an excellent mission for the people of the districts that they were charged to represent--I think people started getting a little nervous. Wait a minute. Why besmirch these people? Why put them down? What have they done that was wrong? 
   And what we began to find as the common thread between these U.S. attorneys is that these individuals, though Republican appointees, took their charge to promote respect for law and took their charge to protect the American people seriously. And some of them prosecuted corruption cases, and that brought them into disfavor with the administration.     
   As the facts just keep on leaking out, they don't look good. They don't look good. It appears, it appears that political decisions were brought to bear in this scandal with regard to the U.S. Attorneys. In fact, one of the U.S. Attorneys was one of the people who prosecuted Mr. Duke Cunningham, and somehow ended up getting fired. My goodness. Don't we want to get rid of corruption in government? Don't we want a clean government? Why would you bring the hammer on somebody who did that, unless you didn't necessarily want the even hand of the law to be applied, you wanted it to be tilted one way or another. Justice must be blind, Mr. Speaker. 
   Then what else did we see? One of the calls that was made from as high as the White House was that these folks are not going after immigration cases or going after voter fraud cases enough. Wait a minute. Doesn't the prosecutor make decisions? Isn't prosecutorial discretion a hallmark of our legal system? Wait a minute. These people are charged with protecting us from drug dealers, killers, bank robbers and people who commit acts of terrorism. 
   These people are charged with protecting us from defrauders, stealers, thieves, embezzlers, and yet somebody on a political basis is trying to force them to focus in one area or another? They have finite resources to prosecute the cases and protect the people. They have to make a determination as to what is most important to protect our seniors from identity thieves, to protect our neighborhoods from drug dealers and meth makers. And yet they were put under scrutiny and fired, it appears, and the evidence is still coming in, because they wouldn't play ball with people in the administration. 
   This is scary business. This is not a good thing. And it goes to the very heart of restoring accountability to Washington. It goes to the very soul of whether we have a fair justice system and whether justice is blind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about that, and I want to urge the American people to continue to insist that all the facts come out. We have to know. Justice must be served, and it must be served with these U.S. Attorneys, because if the people whose job it is, the ministers of justice, cannot be comfortable in doing their work, then what can the rest of us who need their services expect? 
   Let me just make one point, and this has to do with the questions around the prosecution of Mr. Scooter Libby. He was found guilty of four out of five counts just last week, and we hear there are linkages to the Vice President. We hear many people are calling him a ``fall guy,'' signaling there may be more people involved. 
   I think that it is very important that if we are going to insist upon accountability in Washington, that there be no pardons. I am very concerned that there could be a pardon in this situation that would render him not willing to tell all that he knows. 
   We need to know how bad this thing is. In the U.S. Attorney issue we found out it was Harriet Miers, the very person the President wanted to be on the United States Supreme Court, who said fire them all. 
   It is very important we get to the bottom of this, because, as I started with, the American people have every right to know what their government is doing and to trust in and feel good about their government. It is not a question of public relations, it is a matter of substance. 
   So I will yield back to my colleague, Congresswoman Betty Sutton, who has been leading us in so many excellent ways, who has been doing such a fine job, and with whom I am so honored to be associated in this Congress. We have other excellent Members joining us tonight and they are going to tell the story. I just want to say I am proud to be associated with these majority makers, these difference makers, these people who believe that the American people have a right to believe in their government, and the only way to do it is to restore accountability to Washington.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, today we insist, we ask, the President to fund the troops by not vetoing this bill. We ask the President to sign the bill. 
   What has been described as pork is not pork. What it is, is money for traumatic brain injury. What it is, is money for veterans who are suffering, who have serious problems and serious needs for funding. 
   The President has received more money than he even asked for for these troops, and we insist and ask him to sign the bill so that the troops can get the money that they need. It is going to be on his desk. The funds that the President needs will be on his desk. And if the President vetoes the bill, it will be the President who denies the troops the funds that they need. The President must accept responsibility for denying the troops the help that they need, veterans the help that they need.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the National Intelligence Estimate makes it clear that the United States confronts grave challenges to our national security. Al Qaeda grows stronger with each passing day and remains intent on inflicting harm on the American people and others around the world. 
   The NIE confirms what many of us in this Chamber already know: the war in Iraq has stretched resources thin and continues to distract from the global war on terror. It is nearly 5 years since President Bush proclaimed ``mission accomplished.'' In that time, over 3,600 Americans have lost their lives and 26,000 more have been wounded. Despite the courageous efforts of our men and women in uniform, Iraq today is a distraction from our mission to destroy the al Qaeda network. How many more lives must be lost until the President and our colleagues realize that we must change course? 
   Mr. Speaker, around the world right now, our brave troops are fighting to protect this country and win this war. If we are going to prosecute the war to the best of our ability, it is time to face facts and reevaluate our strategy and begin a gradual redeployment of our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to lend my voice with all of the people who voted for a change for America, but especially to lend my voice with my fellow new Congressmen, the freshmen. I rise because I believe that we were sent here to pursue an agenda for America, to set our country on a new course, a new course which put the public good at the center of our efforts, a new course which said that politics must be in service to the average citizen. 
   This past November, the winds of change took on a gale force in American politics. American people took back their government. They sent a loud and clear message that the government was here for them, by them and of them. No more, no big contracts. No more legislation written behind closed doors by and for the special interests, no more whittling away the constitutional rights that we were fighting, and no more bridges built to nowhere. No more rubber-stamp administration. 
   We are going to have an active and engaged Congress that really believes in the principle of oversight, and no more escalating an oil war that we believe is sacrificing innocent young Americans for no legitimate purpose. The American people voted in record numbers and demanded that their voices be heard. They wanted their government to respond to their needs, and their needs are not the needs of the big oil companies, the big pharmaceutical companies or the Halliburtons of this world. 
   American people want a new politics of inclusion, of generosity. The American people want a new politics which says everybody counts and everybody matters. The Democrats heard them. 
   In record time, 100 hours, we made history by passing a people's agenda. Yes, within 100 hours, minimum-wage workers were able to say that they were getting a raise; within 100 hours, lifesaving research, so that people could have a real chance at a cure for their loved ones and themselves. Within 100 hours, real implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and within the 100 hours we made a real statement about education being affordable for all Americans. 
   I am proud to be a Member of this new class of freshmen, proud to be a Member of these folks who came here to make a change to put the public interest first. The public interest is a very good idea, and I am very proud to say that I have been a part of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (RECOUNTING REASONS FOR VOTING IN FAVOR OF 2002 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentlewoman from California. And I was told early on, Madam Speaker, that the gentlewoman from California wanted to feature Congress people who had voted for the war in Iraq and then had subsequently changed their minds. I was persistent in trying to be a part of tonight's special order, and I thank the gentlewoman from California for allowing me to, because I just wanted to point out that back in 2003 I had no idea that I would ever be standing in the halls of Congress, but I did know in 2003, in March, that this war was wrong and we needed to stand absolutely against it. 
   But I respect those Members of Congress who came forward tonight and pointed out that this war is wrong, was wrong, and we have to get out of Iraq now.  
   Today--after 6 long years of subsidies to big oil companies with outrageous profit margins--we made a bold change for America. 
   Today we gave America an energy policy that will move the Nation towards a day in which no young American will ever again have to fight another oil war for any President--especially this one. 
   The President finally admitted last Wednesday night what most Americans have known for a long time. 
   His Iraq policy is a failure. 
   I rise today to strongly oppose this President's solution to that failure--a surge of American troops. 
   Surge in Bushspeak is plain and simple--an expansion of the same disastrous policy in Iraq. 
   The vast majority of our country's top military and foreign policy experts disagree with the viability of the President's approach. 
   This list includes the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, current military commanders in the region--General Abizaid and Casey, the Baker-Hamilton commission and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
   Republican Senator CHUCK HAGEL told it like it is last week: ``I think this speech given last night by this President represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.'' As a Vietnam Veteran he should know. 
   Our military leaders state we must view Iraq policy as a three-legged stool. 
   Each leg of the stool represents a key strategy to support reconstruction of Iraq--one leg represents our military strategy, one economic and one political. 
   All 3 legs have to be present, and strong, to ensure Iraqi success. If one strategy is over-emphasized--and others don't even exist--the stool and our strategy falls apart. 
   The President's plan is--at best--a one-legged stool--our military involvement. A one-legged stool cannot stand. 
   Nor should it--when it is built on the lives of 22,000 young Americans. 
   I am not a military expert, but experts of counterinsurgencies look at Iraq and recommend a military force of a quarter million, to a half million troops for any hope of success. 
   [Let me be clear I am not for any increase in our troop levels in Iraq] 
   But, 22,000 troops don't even come close to making this critical military benchmark. 
   Ted Carpenter of the Cato Institute stated last week: 
   . . . A lesser deployment would have no realistic chance to get the job done. A limited surge of additional troops is the latest illusory panacea offered by the people who brought us the Iraq quagmire in the first place. It is an idea that should be rejected. 
   This is a reckless and irresponsible proposal. To allow the President to place these selfless young Americans in a virtual shooting gallery is wrong. 
   Since last night, 3,012 of America's most promising young men and women have lost their lives in Iraq--and over 22,000 more have been grievously wounded. 
   We have squandered more than $350 billion of our Treasury in Iraq with no end in sight. 
   Three hundred fifty billion dollars would fund 48 million kids a year of Head Start; it could provide 17 million students 4 year scholarships at public universities; we could build 3 million additional housing units; or we could hire 6 million more public school teachers for one year. 
   Instead, we've dug 3,012 graves and mortgaged our children's future. Enough is enough. 
   Monday, we celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King's life and work. In one of Dr. King's last speeches in which he criticized our Vietnam policy, Dr. King stated that: ``a time comes when silence is betrayal.'' 
   That time has come--and our continued silence will be our Nation's betrayal. The immediate withdrawal of our troops is the only new way out of Iraq: 
   Lt. Gen. William Odom, of the Hudson Institute said, (and I quote): ``The wisdom and moral courage to change the course for strategic purposes is what we need today, not mindless rhetoric `about staying the course.' `Cutting and running' from Iraq is neither cowardly nor imprudent. It is the only way to recover from what is turning out to be the greatest strategic mistake in American history.'' 
   I concur wholeheartedly. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from California for her courage and persistence in the pursuit of peace; the pursuit of a saner and safer world for our children, and all the children of the world.

   Last year on August 1, this day, we as a Nation were united in our grief for the victims. Today, the new I-35W bridge stands almost complete over the Mississippi River. I have had a chance to tour it, and it is a good-looking bridge. But we can never forget about the victims and the lessons that we have learned from the collapse. 
   We will be having a memorial today in Minneapolis for the victims, and we will be celebrating the fact that we have come back and been a resilient community after this collapse. 
   But I believe the tragic bridge collapse serves as a national call to action for our political leaders to focus on improving our domestic infrastructure. The time is now, Madam Speaker.

   The most important thing I want to share with people tonight is that, when I just started here and I started getting on my feet and figuring out where the bathrooms were and how to get around the House a little bit, JULIA CARSON took a moment, JULIA CARSON had time, JULIA CARSON and I sat in the chairs of this gallery and talked. And she told me about the struggles that she had to overcome. And she also told me, when I had my first bill, ``if you don't put me on that bill right now, boy, I don't know what I'm going to do.'' And I had to laugh, because the spirit that she had was remarkable, given some of the health problems she was facing. 
   The health problems she was facing may have been a burden, but they were not too great for her to show kindness to a new freshman here in Congress. And so I will always remember JULIA CARSON, very fond memories of her, and I will always be inspired by the great example that she gave us.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, middle-income Americans are paying a high price for the Bush economic policies that have taken us deep into debt and to economic recession. While the prices of groceries, gas, education, and health care have all gone up, the purchasing power of a middle-income salary has actually fallen over the last 7 years. 
   Unfortunately, Republicans and President Bush continue to defend the status quo, refusing to support our efforts to help middle class families feeling the economic squeeze. House Democrats are working on new solutions to deal with this immediate economic crisis, and for long-term economic recovery. We have taken action to extend unemployment benefits, insurance benefits, and also so that workers can continue to receive important financial assistance while they look for jobs in these trying economic times. We have also passed legislation to address the Nation's housing crisis so that millions of Americans will not be forced into foreclosure this coming year. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats also support a second economic recovery plan, and we hope we can gather Republican support for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I am for fair trade, not simply free trade. And I would associate myself with comments already made today, ``free trade for free people.'' Yet already reported recently, miners in Peru are facing having their strike declared illegal and shut down. That doesn't sound very free to me. 
   This Peru FTA, I will acknowledge I am happy to see the positive developments in the labor and environmental standards. For me, however, they don't go quite far enough. I believe that the Congress has a constitutional role and responsibility to be able to amend these trade agreements no matter whom they are with or how large or small they may be.     
   Trade negotiations have successfully passed before without fast track authority or closed rule type of treatment, and I think that should be the case today. 
   The Peru agreement, as currently structured, to me is symptomatic of the larger problem: allowing an unelected trade representative, and not the duly elected representative of the American people, to decide what is best in our trade policy. 
   The current agreement does not provide for enforceable environmental protections, especially with regard to the lumber industry in sensitive areas of Peru's environment. The agreement, as currently written, would help force the privatization of Peru's Social Security system. The agreement would devastate Peru's already faltering rural agricultural economy. 
   Congress forced the trade representative to include minimal standards, in my opinion, and these things have been called a breakthrough. I think there should be credit where credit is due, and they have been an improvement. But at the end of the day, if we are to rely on the trade representative and the Bush administration to enforce the trade agreement, I don't think that's an enforceable agreement. 
   I tried to offer an amendment which would allow for a private right of action to allow American citizens to enforce the provisions of the trade agreement to be carried out and enforce those labor and environmental provisions to be fully fulfilled. But, however, due to the nature of this debate, no such amendment was allowed, and I think that's to the detriment of us all. 
   I believe that we must work to return to a time when Congress and the elected representatives of the people were allowed to amend our trade agreements. Organized, negotiated and fair trade amongst nations is one of the most important issues facing our Nation, indeed, our world. Its great importance demands that it be given the attention that such an issue deserves.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R. 6867, the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008. 
   This bill provides for an additional 7 weeks of extended Unemployment Benefits for workers who have exhausted their regular UI benefits. 
   Earlier this year, we enacted a bipartisan compromise to provide extended unemployment benefits. But those benefits will start to run out in October unless Congress acts. 
   With today's news of another 159,000 American jobs lost in September--the worst job loss in 5 years--this action is critical to providing relief as well as strengthening the American economy and creating jobs. 
   Madam Speaker, the research is clear, extending UI benefits is one of the most cost-effective and fast-acting ways to stimulate the economy because the money is spent quickly. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, every $1 spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand. 
   Madam Speaker, Minnesota's unemployment rate hit 6.2 percent this past August, we are waiting for the September State numbers now. This is highest state unemployment rate in 22 years. 
   This legislation could not be more timely; the House has just passed legislation to save Main Street by helping out Wall Street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor for me to speak in support of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. I want to thank both Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad for their dedication to ending the insurance discrimination and ensuring that all Americans have access to mental health and addiction services. 
   As a Minnesotan, I'm struck by the emotion of this day because the late Paul Wellstone's tireless efforts to ensure mental health parity might finally be realized. Paul Wellstone knew it was wrong for health insurers to place discriminatory restrictions on treatments, and I am honored to be part of this effort to finally guarantee that millions of Americans who need mental health and addiction services can obtain the services they deserve. 
   The urgent need for the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act is surely best expressed by those who have seen a loved one in need denied coverage. I think immediately of Kitty Westin, a Minnesotan whose daughter Anna suffered from anorexia, a deadly disease that affects approximately 8 million Americans and ultimately claimed Anna's life. During her daughter's battle with anorexia, Kitty took Anna to the hospital. Anna was refused care by the insurance company because it did not consider access to mental health treatment important enough to cover. 
   Kitty knows this is completely unacceptable and has been fighting selflessly to make sure that no other family experiences the same frustration and pain. I commend her for carrying on Anna's legacy so impressively through her advocacy efforts and community work. For Kitty and all of those who have encountered insurance discrimination, I carry Paul Wellstone's message that access to mental health and addiction services is imperative and must take place now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, today I voted in favor of House Resolution 951 to condemn rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and the death and fear those attacks have caused. These rocket attacks must be condemned, and they must be stopped. I've been to Sderot, and I have seen how these rocket attacks cause fear and suffering among the people there, where it is extremely difficult to carry on anything approaching a normal life. The residents of Sderot and now Ashkelon face a daily barrage of rockets, and that is intolerable. Terrorists are bombing citizens, not soldiers. There is nothing in Islam to justify hurting innocent civilians. Bombers cannot use religion to justify what they're doing, and I condemn it. 
   But this resolution is not enough. If we want to be morally consistent, we must condemn rocket attacks on Israel and also condemn the humanitarian crisis in Gaza too. The 1.4 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip exist in a state of dreadful isolation, quite literally cut off from the world. Basic supplies and necessities are at a minimum. Ninety percent of the industry has closed down. Unemployment is rampant, and poverty and disease are endemic. Only a few weeks ago, the people of Gaza broke through walls to buy groceries in Egypt. I regret the resolution we voted on today did not devote adequate attention, in my view, to the plight of the people of Gaza. 
   To suggest that this is the Gazans' just desserts for voting the wrong way in the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006 does nothing to improve the quality or alleviate the human suffering on either side of the border. We in Congress need to show compassion for the people of Gaza, Sderot, and Ashkelon and the tremendous human suffering they are undergoing. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says he does not want the humanitarian crisis in Gaza to continue, and the Bush administration should do all it can to help him meet that commitment. 
   This resolution criticizes one of the leading advocates for stability and peace in the region: Egypt. The Egyptian Government has made it clear that it is doing all it can to close off smuggling. What's needed is a greater degree of cooperation with Egypt. This resolution does nothing to advance that cooperation. We need to engage Egypt, not pass resolutions that publicly offend or diminish our relations with them. Absent strong evidence that Egypt is complicit in allowing weapons smuggling to occur, I am not in favor of Egypt bashing. 
   I understand Egypt is doing what it can to control the border despite restrictions on its security forces imposed by Egypt's peace treaty with Israel. If Egypt had direct contact or diplomatic channels with all parties involved in the conflict, the United  States should prevail upon Egypt to help effect a prisoner exchange, stop the rocket attacks on Israeli citizens, and improve the humanitarian conditions for citizens of Gaza. 
   It's a fortunate coincidence that the Secretary of State is in the region right now, and I am supportive of her taking an active role in resolving this conflict. Beyond resolutions and expressions of sympathy, we need real actions from the Bush administration to solidify and advance the commitments of leaders in the Middle East to a lasting peace through the two-state solution envisioned well before Annapolis. I ask my colleagues here in the House to join me in urging the Secretary of State to highlight the humanitarian needs of ordinary citizens of Gaza alongside the fear and death among ordinary Israelis as she seeks to mediate the situation so tragic for all involved. 
   Finally, as a Member of Congress, I am concerned about the resolution's references to Iran. Now, I agree that Iran is playing a negative role in the region, but we have seen what the Bush administration has done with past congressional resolutions. I want to repeat that there is nothing in the resolution that should be construed as a justification for military action. I remain opposed to military action against Iran. We need to start a bilateral dialogue. That has been and will continue to be my position. The most effective way to stop Iran's harmful activities is to engage them directly. 
   Mr. Speaker, though I wholeheartedly condemn the rocket attacks on Israel, I urge my colleagues to consider the suffering of all of the people, including the people of Sderot, Ashkelon, and Gaza.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise on the floor today to speak on behalf of H. Res. 606, a resolution that honors the city of Minneapolis and the first responders and citizens of Minnesota for their valiant efforts in responding to the horrific collapse of Interstate 35W Mississippi River bridge. 
   Madam Speaker, while we honor the city of Minneapolis, there are also numerous cities in the area of Minneapolis, such as New Hope, Golden Valley, and many, many others, all that sent their first responders to the aid of the victims. And each and all of these cities deserve honor and respect. Thank you. 
   At 6:05 p.m. on August 1, 2007, Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota collapsed into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people and injuring nearly 100 people. The 13 victims were mothers, fathers, children, workers, good people, each and all. 
   I'm honored today to stand with my colleagues from Minnesota to honor the work of the first responders and the entire community of Minnesota and the Nation for stepping up to the plate to assist our community on August 1 in responding to the horrific bridge collapse. 
   Without any hesitation or any regard or consideration for their own safety, Minnesota first responders, firefighters, police, emergency medical personnel all rushed to the bridge collapse scene, and it is clear that the commitment and heroism in the minutes and hours that followed the tragedy saved countless lives. 
   Additionally, scores of ordinary Minnesotans became good Samaritans. For example, Madam Speaker, Jeremy Hernandez, a 20-year-old employee of a Minneapolis nonprofit organization, was riding on a school bus with over 50 children when the bus dropped towards the Mississippi River gorge as the bridge collapsed. Jeremy immediately took charge and evacuated the bus, ensuring that all staff and children got off the bus safely. This is America and Minnesota at its best when ordinary citizens become extraordinary citizens. 
   But let me conclude, Madam Speaker, by respectfully asking this Congress to regard this tragedy as a national call to action, to focus our public energy on the reconstruction of our public infrastructure. 
   On August 1, we as a Nation were united in grief for the victims, and we were united in the recovery and healing efforts. Now let us all stand united in rebuilding our country's ailing public infrastructure. For if the Nation is a body, our infrastructure is the skeleton that holds it up. 
   I look forward to working with Members of Congress. I thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank you, Mr. Walz, for your excellent energy. I also would be remiss if I did not commend your community, our community, and southern Minnesota for its own tragedy that we suffered collectively. And we stand with the people of southern Minnesota in solidarity and in brother- and sisterhood. Thank you very much.

But we have also done something else which I am proud of, and that is provided oversight. We have subpoenaed people and made them come to these hearings. We have asked people the questions, the tough questions, and made them give forth the right answer. 
   Why, on the Judiciary Committee just this week, we had Mr. Tanner, who is the section chief of the voting section. He offered the opinion that, actually I wish I had it written down, because I don't want to get it wrong, but he offered the opinion that voter ID bills may affect seniors because they live longer, but when it comes to minority seniors they die, so it doesn't really matter for them. Chairman Conyers issued that request for him to come to that committee, and we asked him questions about voting rights. We asked him about how that department was being run. We asked him the tough questions that Americans expect us to ask. 
   But that's not all. Chairman Nadler of the committee has had constitutional hearings, and we have had people come in and talk about important issues, and, of course, Representative Cohen has been there as well, on Guantanamo, on habeas corpus. These are the kinds of things that Americans are concerned about because America will never be a place where we give up on our constitutional protections and our civil liberties. 
   I just want to say that I am so proud to be a Member of this freshman class that is not only passing legislation, not only standing up for its right as a coequal branch of government, but is calling people on the carpet and asking the tough questions as it is our job to do. The American people expect us to say, What's going on? Tell us what's going on. What have you done? Why have you done it? 
   That is our job, and we will continue to do it, because we don't work for anybody but for the American people. Not the judiciary. Not the executive branch. We are enshrined in article I of the Constitution, coequal branch of government, that branch of government in which all vested power to legislate is inside of us. 
   Mr. Klein, I want to thank you for conducting yet another excellent freshman hour.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, a good friend of mine who runs a charter school needed to get a line of credit recently to float her payroll. She couldn't get it. In the past, she had. That puts the teachers, the custodial staff, the people who work in the kitchen, and all of those folks in line for a payless payday, which means that we've got 60 folks who will not be able to make car notes, mortgages or who will not, perhaps, be able to pay credit cards and who knows what. 
   This kind of problem is bleeding throughout the economy. That's why the unemployment rate is 6.2 percent. We can wait to see the pain, and then we will be motivated to act, but do you really want to see 8 percent or 9 percent unemployment?

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (FAILED TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Thank you. I thank you for your leadership on this issue of fair trade. I think that the time is right, the time is now to begin talking about fair trade. I want to commend all of the Members here tonight talking about this critical issue. 
   This election sent a strong message: no staying the course on Bush's failed trade policy. So now what do we hear, that the Bush administration wants to send to Congress NAFTA expansion agreements with Peru and Colombia. Consider the problems that Democrats have endlessly raised in writing, in hearings, on the floor, think about these problems and the administration's trade agreement model, how we have continually demonstrated that the Bush trade model is killing American jobs and is an enemy of the middle class. 
   Then consider what the administration chose to put in the deals anyway. Democrats are for consumers' right to affordable medicine. The 2002 trade negotiation authority instructed the Bush administration not to lard up and pack up these trade deals with new protections for big pharmaceuticals that could cut poor consumers off from access to medications and cause endless deaths in poor countries. But the administration inserted this poison pill into the FTAs. The TRIPS-plus requirement needs to come out. 
   Democrats are against privatization of Social Security. We believe the elderly in whatever nation they are in should have safeguards for their security as they age. Yet the Peru free trade agreement requires Peru to open its social security system for privatization. That has to come out. 
   Democrats believe that foreign businesses operating on U.S. soil shouldn't have greater rights than U.S. businesses. And we believe that our environmental and health safeguards cannot be exposed to attack in international tribunals. But the administration included the extreme foreign investor rights and investor state enforcement of NAFTA's Chapter 11. That needs to come out as well. 
   Democrats believe in the right of Congress and the President to protect this Nation's security. We have made it clear that the trade pacts cannot subject our decisions about who should operate U.S. ports to attacks in international tribunals or demands for compensation. Yet although the Dubai Ports World operates Peru's ports and thus would have the right to such a claim, you included the ``landslide port activities'' in the Peru and Colombian agreements. That has to come out. 
   Democrats believe in reducing poverty in the developing world. We believe in providing farmers in the Andean nations opportunities to earn a living without resorting to illegal drugs that will end up on our streets here in the United States. But despite the warnings from Peruvian and Colombian Governments and the record of NAFTA displacing 1.7 million compesinos, the President has insisted on zeroing out corn, rice and bean tariffs in those things. That has to come out. 
   Democrats believe consumers have a right to safe food. But the administration included provisions allowing food imports that don't meet our standards. That needs to come out. 
   Democrats believe that when governments spend tax dollars, they must do so in the best interest of the taxpayers. But the administration included language in these FTA procurement texts that could expose Davis-Bacon prevailing wage laws, renewable energy standards and more to challenge. That must come out. 
   It would only require striking a sentence here or a word there to remove the FTA terms that directly conflict with these core Democratic Party values and goals. 
   And then there is what is missing, the enforceable labor and environmental standards in the core of the text of the agreement equal to the commercial provisions. 
   Regarding the Colombia FTA, there is no fix to that and there is nothing that can make this agreement acceptable in my view. It is highly offensive that the Bush administration would exploit the enormous discretion fast track provides even to initiate negotiations with a country infamous and, unfortunately, famous for having the highest rate of trade union assassinations. More than 2,000 labor activists have been murdered in Colombia since 1990. Sixty were assassinated in 2006 alone; one per week. The Colombian Army is implicated in many of these murders, but few have been prosecuted. Until the Colombian Government changes its situation, the United States should not offer any enhanced trade relations to Colombia. 
   Mr. Michaud, thank you for your excellent work and leadership. The American people deserve fair trade agreements. The American Congress must take back its constitutional authority to make sure that any agreement that the United States engages in is an agreement that is in the best interest of the American working people.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the House's attention that it was on October 25 a few years ago, not long it seems, only days ago, in 2002 that our State of Minnesota lost Senator Paul Wellstone. 
   Paul Wellstone, Mr. Speaker, was a United States Senator, was a professor of politics, political science, at Carleton College. Paul Wellstone was an organizer of average citizens in Minnesota and helped them to discover their own power and their ability to maneuver the instrumentality of government to work for the benefit of the average citizen. Paul Wellstone was actually the State Chair of the Jackson for President campaign in 1988. 
   Paul Wellstone was truly a friend of all working people everywhere on the globe. And I just wanted to let you know, Mr. Speaker, that as we approach October 25, and I reflect back upon my own personal exposure and friendship with Paul Wellstone, whose picture hangs in my office right now, that I just wanted this day to go by with us in contemplation of what a true servant leader represents. 
   Paul Wellstone was a friend of mine. I'm proud to say that he was a political hero of mine as well. I had the awesome benefit of knowing him, and I'll never forget some of the things he said to me. But, among those things was to make sure that you never ever stop listening to the people. 
   Paul Wellstone was comfortable anywhere he went. He was comfortable in the hair shops, the beauty salons and the laundromats. Paul Wellstone obviously was comfortable in the halls of power in Congress. 
   Paul Wellstone, wherever he went, was a person who understood that he carried a sacred trust, that government service was a trust that the people of the State of Minnesota entrusted in him, that it was not a privilege, but it was an awesome responsibility, and he never forgot it. 
   Paul Wellstone was a leader in many ways and was an example to young people like myself. And as I think what his life means to me, means to the people of Minnesota, I have to consider that it is also that awesome responsibility that he laid out there. A servant leader, Mr. Speaker. Not just somebody who was looking to be served but a person who was looking to serve. 
   Paul Wellstone's favorite color was green, that was the color of his campaign literature, because it symbolized life. And I shamelessly copied it, Mr. Speaker, because I wanted to carry on that spirit of service, of being evergreen, of being ever new, and being committed to the idea that we have to constantly and continuously renew ourselves, our values, our faith, and our consistency when it comes to serving people all over the world. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that whether it was veterans, of whom Paul Wellstone was a tireless advocate, or whether it was students or whether it was the poor in our country, and I will never forget the tour he took around this country to highlight poverty in America, Paul Wellstone could always be found serving people. His loss was a tragic loss. 
   Only the day before we lost him, he was scheduled to come to my office, and we were going to do some campaigning together. It was a long night, Mr. Speaker, when we heard back the reports as the news reports said that a plane has gone down in Ely, Minnesota, and it was thought to be containing Paul Wellstone and his partner, Sheila Wellstone, and their daughter and several other campaigners. We hoped all night that what we thought might have happened didn't happen, but at the end of the evening, we learned that that tragedy, in fact, did occur. Our worst fears were confirmed when we learned that we lost him, but it was a long several hours before we realized that that tragedy had actually occurred, and we had hoped against hope. I will never forget that night. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I wind down my remarks, I just want to say that in many ways I have dedicated my service and take great inspiration from Senator Wellstone. I will never forget him, and I hope that this House and Senate never do, either.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Well, my colleagues, let me thank you again for this excellent dialogue. 
   We have to, as the difference makers in this 110th Congress, tell the people what's going on, what we're here for, and to reclaim the Congress as a co-equal branch of government articulated in article I, a co-equal branch of government that resides and has all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in the Congress of the United States and shall consist of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
   And so as I heard my colleague, Mr. John Hall, articulate his trip to Iraq, I was forced to reflect upon my own. And I didn't go there out of an idle curiosity seeker, a person trying to go on an interesting trip, but as somebody who is going to be called upon to execute a vote, to push a button, red or green or otherwise, as to monies that will be sent forth and as to other business that will be happening in Iraq. That's our job, we claim it, we do not abdicate it, and it would be wrong and a dereliction of our duty to do otherwise. 
   So, let me commend you and everybody who has gone to that place where our constituents, some of them have spent up to 18 months at a time as they face extended deployments. 
   And I also want you to know that I sat down at a table with young people  from my district in Minnesota where we ate lunch. I was struck by the fact that wherever they go, they've got these big old guns that they carry with them, everybody. It's like a wallet, but it probably weighs quite a bit more than that. And that's just the lives that they lead. But they distinguish themselves and make us proud by their courage. And it is political authority, politicians like us that make decisions whether they stay or whether they go. So we had better at least spend a little bit of time there with them, and we had better at least try to get in their shoes and identify with what they're going through just a little bit and feel that 130-degree heat that they're in every single day and feel the dust and sand under their feet and the hum of those helicopters. I'm sure you were humming around in those Black Hawks with the windows out and the machine guns on either side, strapped in in four places and feeling the heat of those propellers as the air hits against your helmet. It's the kind of experience that we go through so that we can have some real sympathy and empathy with the people who we are charged to represent. So, hats off to you, Congressman. I appreciate it. 
   I'm not going to talk long because I love the switching around that we do. But I just want to make one other point as we look at article I and we reclaim and assert our responsibility under the Constitution as Congress. It is also important to understand that we have asserted our authority in the area of promoting working-class prosperity for people. 
   I am so proud that one of the things we did for the first time in 9 years is raised the minimum wage, Mr. Speaker. The hardest working people in America getting paid the least got a raise under this Congress. And I don't want people to make that into any kind of a small matter. Thousands and thousands of Americans benefited by raising the minimum wage for the first time in 9 years. I'm talking about the folks that clean the bedpans, mop the floors, sit in those cold or hot parking booths all across this country and really do the tough, tough work, getting paid not much of nothing. And you know that if you make minimum wage, basically, if your employer can pay you less, they probably would. So what we did is we raised that minimum wage so people can have a little bit better of a life. So now instead of moms having to tell kids, ``Honey, you can't go on that class trip,'' ``Honey, you're going to have to wear those sneakers a few months longer,'' now, instead of dad saying, ``No, son, you can't sign up for baseball,'' or, ``Yes, we're having macaroni and cheese again,'' now they can say, ``No, we're going to do a little better this time. We're going to make your life a little better. We're going to make your quality of life a little better.'' 
   So I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I'm so proud of my colleagues and this whole 110th Congress to be able to do a little bit better for the hardest working Americans in our country.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, when I think about article I, I think this passage in the Federalist Papers where it says that we are to be in intimate sympathy with the people, I got to tell you, that when I sat down along with my colleague Congressman Hodes and Congressman Klein with the Financial Services Committee to listen to people who had faced foreclosure in their homes because of the subprime lending crisis, I thought about article I. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thought about article I because article I is that provision that empowers me as an individual Member of Congress to want to listen to people who are facing foreclosure; listen to the mortgage originators who say, yes, we do need to have some regulation of what we are doing, there are some cowboys out there; to listen to these community bankers; and to listen to people who say, look, I made all my mortgage payments, but there is a foreclosure on the left and a boarded building on the right, and my house where I paid every payment is now suffering loss in the value of it because of this foreclosure crisis. 
   I was in intimate contact with article I as I sat there in earnest and sincere humility listening to people and what they were going through, when I was so proud to sit there on that committee to be able to respond to the people. Because we have to go back there every 2 years. We can't take a vacation from the people in the House. We got to listen every week. Week in, week out, we are in touch with our folks. 
   So Mr. Speaker, Mr. Yarmuth, I just wanted to say that article I, what it means to me is sympathy with the people and action on their behalf.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, there is a real difference between the Democratic and Republican plans when it comes to energy. The comprehensive Democratic plan is an American-owned, 21st-century energy plan, and the Republican plan is not. 
   The Democratic plan lowers prices for consumers and protects taxpayers, expands renewable sources of energy, and increases our security by freeing America from the grip of foreign oil. Perhaps this is the problem with the objection to the Democratic plan: it requires Big Oil to pay what it owes taxpayers. It ends subsidies to Big Oil companies. Maybe some people don't like that. And it creates good-paying jobs here in America. 
   The Republican bill is more of the same old Bush-Cheney, two oilmen in the White House energy policy written by and for the oil companies. It is time to end that policy.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Frank for bringing this bill to the floor today before the body. 
   H.R. 1852 makes significant improvements to the current Federal Housing Administration policy at a time that is crucial to American working families and to our Nation's economy. It comes before us at a time when the unstable housing market has brought disruption to our economy, world financial markets, but, most importantly, in our neighborhoods. By expanding the availability of FHA loans and using the new revenue to create an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, we are helping to make the dream of homeownership not just an illusion but a real possibility. Once again, I want to thank the sponsors of this legislation and urge support of the bill. 
   I would also like to point out that the mortgage foreclosure crisis in America continues to get worse. Mortgage foreclosures are now at a level previously seen only at the height of the Great Depression, and it is only predicted to get worse going into the fall and winter. In August, foreclosures nationwide were up 115 percent from 2006. Hopefully, this important piece of legislation will help make the American Dream of homeownership not just an illusion but a real possibility.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, the Republican Senators have been coming forward saying that the status quo in Iraq cannot continue. They're right. This week they have an opportunity to act on those words. We'll see if they join us in changing the course of the war, or if they find another excuse as to why they must continue to support President Bush's failed policy. I would hope that they would stand by their words. 
   Senator Lugar correctly stated, ``The President and some of his advisers may be tempted to pursue the surge strategy to the end of his administration, but such a course contains extreme risks for United States national security.'' Senator Voinovich correctly stated, ``A policy of responsive military disengagement, with a corresponding increase in nonmilitary support, is the best way to advance our Nation's interests in Iraq and achieve our primary goals.'' Senator Domenici again correctly stated, ``There's nothing to wait for.'' 
   We agree. That's why this House voted last week to bring most of our troops home by next April. The Senate has the chance to take that same action this week. I hope that these Senators will stand by their words and join us in changing the course.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats know that middle class families are struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is simply leaving too many of them behind. That is why we worked in a bipartisan way to pass an economic stimulus plan earlier this year. And starting this week, more than 130 million Americans will receive some much-needed relief in the form of recovery rebate checks. 
   This is a good start, but more needs to be done. Once again, this Democratic-led Congress is reaching out in a bipartisan way to develop consensus for a second round of economic recovery legislation. We believe that a second economic stimulus plan is needed as the bleak news around the economy continues to mount and Americans everywhere are feeling the negative impact of President Bush's economic policies. Unfortunately, the President has said that a second economic stimulus package is not necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President is incorrect. The congressional Democrats hope the President will reconsider so that we can work in a bipartisan fashion to get this economy back on track, create jobs, and speed up assistance to middle class families.

   It has been a long time coming, about 10 years; too long in fact, too long. Fifteen million people will benefit. But the people who get the pay increase, they will not be the only beneficiaries. You and I will be able to claim a generous Nation that believes that all labor is dignified and must be honored with fair and decent pay. 
   Poverty has increased every year over the last 6 years. The ranks of the uninsured have increased every year over the last 6 years; and something else has increased over the last 6 years, executive pay. 
   An average CEO makes more before lunch than the average minimum wage worker makes all year long.  
   Today, the House recognizes that all labor is important; all workers deserve dignity.  
   Today, the House recognizes that 37 million people living in poverty is not acceptable. 
   And this should mark a new beginning.

   Today, middle class workers are struggling to make ends meet on paychecks that are, on average, $300 smaller a year than they were back in 2001 when President Bush took office. Meantime, grocery prices have increased by more than $800, home energy prices are up $300, and health care costs are up more than $2,000. 
   In total, American families are paying $4,000 a year more for these basic necessities than they did during the Clinton administration. No wonder the American people are feeling financially squeezed.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I know that it's protocol and important to thank the Chair of the committee and the ranking member, but today, I have to convey my very sincere and heartfelt thanks to Chairman Berman and to Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Of course, I have to also thank my dear friend Zach Wamp, who came to me many months ago and proposed that we offer this resolution together. 
   I believe this is an historic day, and I am deeply humbled. Other than the day that I had to come here before the House to talk about the collapse of our bridge in Minneapolis, I feel the most sense of emotion and of weight and of gravity today. 
   I also want to point out that this resolution that comes to the floor today takes place during a very special time for people of the Muslim faith, which is the month of Ramadan--a month of reflection, of fasting and, based on this resolution's coming to the floor, of good things as well. 
   The passion that my colleague Mr. Wamp and I share for this resolution may strike some Members as unusual, but it shouldn't. Indeed, as Members of Congress on different sides of the political aisle, Mr. Wamp and I may not always agree on policy, but we are two men who have come together as people of faith to highlight what we both believe are historic interfaith developments within the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths. 
   In late 2007, 138 Muslim scholars from every sect of Islam, representing communities of faith in countries both friendly and hostile to the United States, sent a letter to Christian leaders everywhere, declaring common ground between our faiths and seeking dialogue among leaders of two traditions that represent nearly half the world's population.     
   Responding to that letter, some 300 Christian leaders, including many leaders in the United States, declared in November 2007 their appreciation and support for this historic outreach. In March 2008 the Vatican announced that the Pope had invited these scholars to a first-ever summit, which will meet in Rome in November 2008. 
   I believe the mutual respect by all participants in this effort holds tremendous transformative power, not only for relations between Christians and Muslims, but also for Islam's entire relationship with the West. 
   I believe it is in the best interests of the United States to support and encourage those efforts so that the world knows that our Nation stands with those people who reject extremism and violence and hate and embrace reconciliation. 
   Let me read from the resolution: ``It is the sense of Congress ..... that the United States encourages the many people of faith around the world who reject terrorism, radicalism, and extremism to join these and similar efforts to build a common bond based on peace, reconciliation and a commitment to tolerance ..... Furthermore, the United States appreciates those voices around the world who condemn terrorism, intolerance, genocide and ethnic and religious hatred, and instead commit themselves to global peace anchored in respect and understanding among the adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths,'' Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
   Today, our world knows too many people who are divided, rather than healed, by faith. I speak for myself, but I am sure most Members of the House would agree that our religious faith is a great source of strength and has the transformative effect of bringing people together, not pushing them apart. 
   I believe this resolution will serve to send a strong message to people everywhere that Members of the House stand in solidarity with members of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faith as they confront ancient and modern divisions so that peace may prevail. It is brought up during a particularly special month for me. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this truly bipartisan resolution.

   Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to stand up for working families across America by passing legislation that will ensure the prosperity of the working class. And this legislation, Mr. Speaker, needs to be part of the financial markets' rescue plan. As we move forward to try to help people on Wall Street, we cannot leave alone the people on Main Street. Americans are suffering under tremendous weight of this credit crisis. We have to do something, and this is what we can do about it: giving people relief from these incredible abuses in the credit card industry. 
   The debt crisis inundating so many Americans is in large part due to the result of an industry with few regulations and little oversight. Consumers with credit cards nationwide are facing excessive credit card fees, sky-high interest rates, and unfair incomprehensible agreements that credit card companies can revise at will. 
   In short, American families are suffering while credit card companies are making record profits, Mr. Speaker. In 2007, credit card issuers imposed $18.1 billion--that's billion with a ``B''--in penalty fees on families carrying credit card balances for more than 50 percent since 2003. This accounts for nearly half of the $41 billion industry profits. 
   This year, credit card companies will break all record fees for late fees, over-limit charges, and other penalties pulling in more than $19 billion.     
   H.R. 5244 bans unfair and deceptive practices that have resulted in billions of dollars in fees drained from hardworking families for the credit card industry. 
   Also included in the bill is a ban on universal default. Last May, I introduced legislation to ban this unfair and ethical practice, and I'm pleased to see it included in the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Universal default is the popular term for a practice that allows creditors to increase the rate on your credit card to the default rate, even when you haven't missed a single payment on that card. This means that we're going to look at real reform with this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Maloney, again, for her valiant advocacy, and this does need to be a part of the rescue package.

   Mr. ELLISON. Let me thank the gentlelady from New York, who has done absolutely heroic work on this bill, and let me echo her words: no more abdication from Congress. We are a coequal branch of Congress, and it is time for us to do our job. 
   Americans all over this country want to know what does the Congress care about the debt that they are drowning in because of these credit card practices. If the Fed says they are deceptive practices, who are we to just let them go on and step back and say, well, somebody else will do it. 
   No, it is time for the Congress to do something about it now. To do otherwise is to abdicate our responsibility. Nobody at the Fed holds an election certificate. All of us do. It is time to take this thing by the charge. 
   The fact is, about $8,000 worth of credit card debt is what Americans are holding on average for people who have a revolving balance. That is a burden that people cannot sustain. The fact is, we would not be in this situation if we had the active regulation that Americans expect from their government. 
   We have seen now nearly 30 years of stagnating wages. Americans have had flat wages, on average, if you look at folks who are working hard every day to put food on the table. Because the wages have been flat, we haven't had the savings to buy the things that we need. 
   What has been happening is people have gone to their credit cards, and as we have gone to the credit cards, the credit card companies, some of them, have been using unfair, deceptive practices that have got to be brought to a stop now. If the Fed says they are wrong, they are wrong. 
   We shouldn't have to wait on them to tell us what to do. We should do our job. 
   I just want to thank Chairwoman Maloney and Chairman Frank for bringing this bill to the floor now. I hope this bill can be wrapped into the rescue that is being contemplated for the financial meltdown that is going on now. 
   This is what we should be doing, and it needs to go into effect now. We need to deal with the credit crisis now, and credit cards must be a part of it.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, thank you again for allowing me to address this final point. 
   This issue that I put to our colleague and friend, Mr. Campbell, regarding whether or not deceptive practices, practices that have been deemed to be deceptive by the Fed and that are proscribed in this legislation today, whether these things will result in rate increases or lack of availability. 
   In fact, they will do the opposite, Madam Speaker. They will provide transparency, they'll provide fair rules, and most importantly, they will help to keep good lenders good. 
   If you have a good lender, a good credit card company who is playing fair and acting ethically, and yet their competitors are allowed to engage in universal default and things like this, the net result will be that they will be at a competitive disadvantage when they don't do these unethical practices, things that the Fed has deemed to be unfair. So it's very important that we keep a nice level playing field and maintain the high standards in the industry. 
   This is actually a bill that will help the credit card industry because it will send a signal that the rules are fair, even, and ethics are the priority.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleagues, the gentlemen from Florida and New Hampshire, both for their eloquent remarks. I am looking to my colleague, Congressman Welch and his remarks, but I would like to say that the bedrock idea behind accountability in government is trust in government. If somebody is not accountable, if they are not answerable, if they don't have to tell you whatever you want to know, if they can tell you to take a hike, take a walk and they don't have to listen to you and they are not answerable to you and not accountable to you, as the public, then what you cannot have is trust. 
   Trust goes away when accountability goes away. Trust leaves the room when there is no one to answer the question about what happened. Trust leaves the room when you cannot have a public official look you in the eye and say here is what happened, the good, the bad and the ugly. 
   Accountability is not about perfection because when you have a human endeavor, there is no such thing. But accountability is about being able to say, you know what, those folks up there on Capitol Hill, I believe that they are doing the best they can because when I asked my question, they gave me an answer. When I came forward with my concerns, they gave me a reply. They had the documents. They were able to say, here is what is going on. 
   But when government, Madam Speaker, will not answer, we have problems, we have a lack of trust, and unfortunately sometimes people disengage. But this Congress is here to turn that around. This Congress is here to say, no, there will be accountability. You can trust your government. You can expect that your government is going to be operating on your behalf. 
   Let me turn to an example. One example is that for the last several years  we have had prosecutors, United States Attorneys, trying to do the best they could in many instances at ferreting out corruption in government. We saw prosecutions go on, former Congressman Cunningham and others, and we saw prosecutors who were appointed by a Republican administration to essentially do their job. As you know, Madam Speaker, prosecutors are not like other attorneys. Their job is to seek justice, find the truth. They are ministers of justice, whereas other attorneys, very correctly, have, within the rules, no other obligation than to zealously represent their client. But prosecutors have a higher calling than that, and that is because it is their job to protect the public. 
   But what we found out recently is that eight of them have been fired, and it appears very clearly that the reasons were entirely political. Eight of them have been fired, and the evidence that has been unearthed so far in only 3 months of this ``accountability Congress,'' as the distinguished gentleman from New Hampshire is calling the 
   phrase, in this accountability Congress, the first 3 months we have seen getting to the bottom of this question of justice being undermined. 
   The Democrats have brought back accountability. And what we have seen that is unfolding right now is that the Justice Department has released thousands of pages of e-mails based on the demands of the accountability Congress, and internal documents as well, related to this U.S. Attorney scandal. These documents would not be in the public domain. They wouldn't be in front of the people. They wouldn't be available for questions to get to be asked and answered but for this accountability Congress. 
   I am so proud to be associated with this accountability Congress because what it means is that the U.S. Attorneys, whether they be U.S. Attorneys or food inspectors or people who work at the hospitals taking care of our veterans, they now can know that there is not going to be an intolerable condition that exists for too long before some inquiring person in Congress says, what is going on over there. Thank heavens for it. 
   And I just want to point out, and I will get back to this in a little while, I just want to point out that even Patrick Fitzgerald, who was a prosecutor in a recent case that you may have heard of, the Scooter Libby trial, in which he obtained four convictions out of five counts, he himself was rated as ``not distinguished.'' He was not distinguished in the eyes of the Bush administration officials. And I can see why they would find such a gentleman as ``not distinguished,'' because he did not evidence enough loyalty and obedience to the administration, but he certainly did bring forth some real accountability in government. 
   I am going to yield back now, but I am going to be sticking around because I have more to say about this. I am going to yield back now; but before I do, I just want to say that accountability breeds trust in government and trust in government promotes an active, engaged citizenry which is fundamental to democracy.

   The President has offered to make a deal, and the deal is that the Democrats could interview, not under oath, not on the record, certain White House aides about this scandal regarding the firing of the U.S. attorneys who have been, it appears, perhaps fired for prosecutions they did do and for prosecutions that in their discretion they did not do that could somehow benefit  somebody who was running on the other side. 
   My question is, how does this deal stand in the light of this new spirit of accountability? This deal that would say, yes, White House aides can come in, no going on the record, no under oath, no transcript, behind closed doors, how does that deal stand in the light of this new spirit of accountability?

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, let me say in these final few moments tonight, I want to say there have been over 91 hearings on Iraq alone. But we have also had oversight hearings on Hurricane Katrina. Several of them, in fact. Subcommittee Chair Waters went down to New Orleans to get the real story from people who are living it. 
   On the Committee on Financial Services, we are going to be talking about predatory lending. Today we talked about executive pay and shining some light on that issue. 
   On the Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee Chairman Nadler held a hearing on civil rights enforcement, what is the Attorney General's civil rights division doing in the area of civil rights enforcement. 
   I have participated in hearings on the increase in immigration fees and how those fees are going up in a precipitous manner and questions were asked and officials were made to answer. 
   So as I said before, this is a time of accountability. We are slowly trying to restore the public's faith in government. They have a right to believe that their government is honest, fair dealing, accountable and transparent. I couldn't have been prouder in the committee hearings I personally have been a part of on issues from the National Security Letters and the FBI executive pay, civil rights enforcement, immigration; there has been a whole range. 
   I think the story is not necessarily one thing like the Valerie Plame incident or Walter Reed or the U.S. Attorneys; but there is a prevailing, systematic reexamination of how government does business. I am proud to be associated with it.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, with two former oil executives in the White House, is it any wonder why gas prices are at a record high? President Bush's energy policy, created in secret by Vice President Cheney and by Big Oil, leaves us dangerously dependent on foreign oil, and it hurts our economy and American families. 
   Washington Republicans only offer more drilling, even though 68 million acres of Federal oil reserves are already open and leased for development. New drilling won't lower prices for years to come. In fact, drilling in the pristine Alaskan Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield oil for 10 years, and in 22 years, it would only save consumers about 2 cents a gallon. 
   Mr. Speaker, if congressional Republicans really are interested in helping consumers at the pump today, they will join us this week in passing legislation that forces Big Oil to either drill  where they already have leases or to lose those leases. It's time Big Oil uses it or loses it.

   Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentlewoman from California for allowing me to participate in the Out of Iraq Caucus. I do formally request membership in such caucus at this moment and anxiously await being a full-fledged member of the Out of Iraq Caucus. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise today really in the mindset of this coming weekend, which is Martin Luther King's birthday celebration. Martin Luther King, we all know, was a valiant defender of civil and human rights, also stood up strongly for the poor, but in this day and time must be recognized as one of the clearest voices for peace that this country has ever known. 
   As I stand before you asking this country to join this Out of Iraq Caucus of the Congress, the whole United States should rise up, one and all, and join the caucus. And I just want to mention that it is important now to remember that those voices of peace, of which Martin Luther King was a key voice, need to be listened to, need our attention. 
   Today, it is important to point out, as we walk toward the Martin Luther King holiday, that it was he who spoke up for peace, and he didn't do it in a way that was easy. Martin Luther King was arrested over 30 times as he was talking about peace. In 1967, and it is important to remember this, in 1967 he gave a speech in which he said that silence could continue no more. And then on April 4 of 1967, 1 year before his death, he said that we have got to get out of Vietnam. 
   And he didn't just say that Vietnam was the issue. He said Vietnam was critical, and Vietnam was what he was talking about at that time, but he actually projected a greater vision than  just Vietnam. He talked about a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation. In fact, what he talked about was a generosity of spirit, a politics of spirit in which we all could live in peace with each other. 
   We need to say, no escalation, get out of Iraq now, but America needs to adopt as its guiding principle, America needs to say the thing that guides us the most is peace. It is not living in superiority to the nations of the world, but living in brotherhood and sisterhood with the nations of the world. We need to talk about a peace of generosity, a peace of inclusion, and a peace that will allow us to look our constituents in the face and say we will not send your brothers, your sisters, your children, your parents into a war zone to be one of 20,000 more targets. 
   We are going to stand up with courage, just like Martin Luther King did. We will withstand the criticism of those detractors who just don't get it. We will stand with the people who need peace, which is our constituents, and with the soldiers. Today, my colleagues, we are actually protecting our soldiers, as they protect us, by calling for no escalation. Withdraw from Iraq. Peace now.

   Well, any high school civics student can tell you that there are three. But it seems like our Vice President is confused about the facts. House investigators have revealed that since 2003, the Vice President's office has failed to provide data on its classification activities as required under an executive order claiming that the Vice President's office is not, ``an entity within the executive branch.'' 
   It seems that the Vice President's office believes that his office is its own branch of government above the law.

We stand united in our heartfelt concerns over the news of the collapse of the 35W Bridge spanning the Mississippi River in my hometown of Minneapolis, which occurred early this evening. I spoke with Mayor Rybak regarding this tragic situation, and I pledge to work with him in every possible way to recover from this disaster. 
   As of now, we simply do not know the magnitude of the tragedy. Early reports are that eight cars and one truck are in the river. About 50 school children very narrowly avoided falling into the river. I do not know the depth of the injured. As of now, we know there are three confirmed dead. We pray for the deceased, for those still in peril, and for the families who have not yet heard the news from their loved ones.     
   Our delegation stands united in marshaling the resources for our Minneapolis emergency forces in need of search and rescue efforts. 
   I want to express my profound thanks for the dedicated work of the responders who are on the scene risking their own lives to save others. 
   We are grateful for those who we know have survived this tragedy, including, miraculously, the school bus containing perhaps as many as 50 youngsters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment and outrage at President Bush's veto of the Iraq War supplemental bill. By vetoing this bill, the President has vetoed the will of the American people, and it is the President who is denying funding for our troops. 
   The President has vetoed a responsible funding bill for the troops that would have provided more funding for our troops and military readiness than the President requested. The President rejected a bill that reflects the will of the American people to wind down this war. The American people sent this message very strongly last November. 
   By vetoing this bill, Mr. Speaker, President Bush vetoed: One, fully funding our troops, and providing $4 billion more than the President requested; honoring our veterans by providing $1.8 billion more for veterans health care. Is $900 million for treating traumatic brain injury pork? Is $20 million to repair facilities at Walter Reed pork? 
   By vetoing this bill, the President has vetoed accountability for the Iraqi Government, and he has vetoed his own benchmarks that he laid out January 10 in his speech to the Nation. Let me quote from that speech. 
   ``A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities. So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced. 
   ``To establish its authority, the Iraqi Government plans to take responsibility for security over Iraq's provinces by November. To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues. 
   ``To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections next year and allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political light, the government will reform de-Baathification laws and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's Constitution. America will change our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the supplemental contained these benchmarks directly quoted from the President's speech. So was the President's call for benchmarks a sincere request or what? 
   Providing the President with a clean supplemental bill simply provides him a blank check for the same failed policies in Iraq he has rejected and vetoed, his own benchmarks, as I simply quoted his speech. 
   New evidence keeps emerging that clearly points to a new direction in Iraq. Despite the President's constant claims of ``progress,'' the facts are otherwise. The U.S. death toll in Iraq reached 104 in April, making it the deadliest month of the year and one of the deadliest of the entire war. 
   Republican Senator CHUCK HAGEL recently returned from Iraq and paints a bleak picture. ``This is coming undone quickly, and Prime Minister Maliki's government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through parliament.'' That is a quote from someone who just went there, Senator CHUCK HAGEL. 
   Over the weekend, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction released his quarterly report and paints a dispiriting picture of our $20 billion rebuilding efforts. For example, an audit of the facilities in Iraq discovered serious maintenance and operational problems, with seven out of  eight facilities audited. The report concludes that ``The U.S. project to rebuild Iraq remains far short of its targets, leaving the country plagued by power outages, inadequate oil production, and shortages of clean water and health care.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to hold the Iraqi Government accountable. This bill's timetable and benchmarks finally hold the Iraqis and the President accountable. As Major General Paul Eaton stated, ``This bill gives General Petraeus leverage for moving the Iraqi Government down a more disciplined path laid out by the Iraq Study Group. The real audience for the time-line language is Prime Minister al-Maliki.'' 
   Even Defense Secretary Robert Gates has noted that the timetable is helpful and sends a message that ``The clock is ticking.'' Gates said, ``The strong feelings expressed by Congress about a timetable probably have had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.'' That is Secretary Gates. 
   This bill represents the views of the American people. The latest CBS News/New York Times poll from April 26: 64 percent of Americans favor a timetable that provides a withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Iraqi in 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for accountability. The veto was wrong, and we must stand firm.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (HOUSE BEGINS HOLDING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the days of this House rubber-stamping President Bush's failed war policies have ended. So far this year, House and Senate committees have held over 52 hearings on Iraq. And now this week, over a 4-day period here on the House floor, we will be debating the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq. 
   The bipartisan bill is simple. It states that the House will continue to support our troops, but that we oppose the President's troop increase plan. Some of my Republican colleagues say that if you really support the troops, you must support the President's plan. But this makes no sense. 
   Do my colleagues not realize that our troops in Iraq were polled on the President's plan? Only 41 percent of them supported it. Not even a majority of our troops say that this plan of the President's is a good plan. What about our generals? Both retired and active duty military leaders have said that the President's plan will not reverse the devastating civil war that is now taking place in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that we listen to those military leaders and our troops and voice our opposition to the President's plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the very, very wonderful company of my freshman Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the 110th Congress began, we have, as a class, stepped forward to try to do everything we could to help the American people see a new way forward for America. And this week, we have seen that the distinction and the differences between our view of caring for the health of all Americans and that of the President were brought into very sharp contrast, very sharp contrast in that the President has vetoed SCHIP. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I turn it over to my very able classmates, I just want to point out that we're not rising today to talk about health care and SCHIP to throw partisan darts or anything like that. We recognize and respect and appreciate and even are quite grateful for members of the Republican Caucus in both Houses who have come forward to join and say that the health of our children is very important, in fact, it's sacred, and that all Americans should come together to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization bill, which was vetoed by the President, is supported by 67 Senators, including 18 Republicans. It is supported by 43 Governors, including 16 Republican Governors, and I'm proud to say my own Governor, Tim Pawlenty. Governor Pawlenty knows that he and I have disagreed on things in the past, but we're together on this, that children's health must be cared for by adults. 
   The bill that was vetoed today is supported by more than 270 organizations, literally representing millions of Americans, and has very strong support from the American people at large. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to get us started today. I have much more to say, but I don't want to delay any longer because I know that my very excellent difference-maker classmates have much to say about this issue. So without any further delay, I'd like to offer the microphone to the very able, very excellent, honorable Mr. Sarbanes from Maryland.

The young man who had a tooth abscess and had that go up into  his brain and he died as a result of it stands as an indictment against our whole Nation. That young man deserves to have all of us, every adult in America, stand up and say, change must come, and it must come now. 
   I just would like to read a quote and see if I could get my colleague from Brooklyn's reaction, if I may. 
   Yvette Clarke, you are here with us tonight. You are a stalwart. You are a clarion voice for the public good. I just want to know what you might think about this statement as relates to SCHIP, which is a quote from the late Senator and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, from my home State of Minnesota, in which he said that the moral test of any government is how it treats those in the dawn of life, the children; those in the dusk of life, the elderly; and those in the shadow of life, the disadvantaged. 
   When you think about this veto of SCHIP and you think about the moral test of the Nation, what do you think? What thoughts come to mind?

Very few people are better qualified to talk about health care than he is. He is a physician. I think he was probably practicing right up until the day he got sworn in.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to point out that this is a bipartisan effort. As we come here and ask that this veto be overridden, it is not simply a Democratic initiative. It is also a Republican one. Let me tell you, I was really warmed, my heart was warmed up when I read the words written by Representative Heather Wilson and Representative Ray LaHood, two Republican Members, who sent out a Dear Colleague letter for the support of the SCHIP. They wrote, ``According to Census Bureau data, about 9 million children lack health insurance. This SCHIP agreement would cover 3 to 4 million of them by investing $35 billion in additional funding in  children's health insurance over 5 years.'' 
   Here is what our two Republican colleagues wrote further: ``We urge your support for the SCHIP agreement and believe it is the best vehicle for reauthorizing the program before it expires.'' 
   That is what two Republican colleagues had to say about this bill. Presumably, they will be with us trying to overturn the veto. 
   My point is that as Americans citizens are watching us and watching this whole debate unfold here in the Capitol, they should know that they don't have to take sides based on party.     
   This is something that is simply a moral imperative. It is right, it is cost-effective, and improves our health and well-being. It demonstrates our commitment to our children. It is right for a whole number of reasons, not just one reason. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to say, Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY, who is a Republican Member, spoke very eloquently on this. He says, well, I am not trying to score political points. Again, it is not politics we are talking here. And any of the Democrats that have worked with me I know believe in they want to help kids, low-income kids, and we are going to not only keep the existing kids on the program, we are going to do what the President implied he wanted to do, was to bring more kids on. We are going to cover 4 million more kids as a result of what we are doing. I think it's up to the President, based on his message, to look at what we have done and see if it doesn't fit into that he tried to do, that he can't do that with just $5 million. 
   So, the point being, Senator Grassley, a Republican, is in support of this.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I think that the words of Dr. Kagen are on the mark. Elections certainly do have consequences. Elections absolutely have consequences. I do hope as we deliberate on the next phase of this struggle, because the American people should know that we will not falter, we will not back down, we will stand strong with them, we will stand strong with the children, we will keep the faith, we will be in fidelity with them on this issue of health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, please let everyone know that we have heard our Speaker clearly state that we are not going to back down on this one. This is a gut-check issue, and we will be sticking to it. Not only have both Democrat and Republican legislators been very clear on the importance of this issue, it is bipartisan and it is a moral issue, and our Nation's editorial boards have been clear. 
   It is important to point out that on October 1, The Washington Post editorial stated that President Bush appears determined to veto, and he did now, the $35 billion expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program that the House and Senate approved last week. The administration's proposal to increase spending by less $5 billion would fall $14 billion short of what is needed to maintain the existing coverage in SCHIP alone, never mind adding the millions of eligible but uncovered children the President once said he was determined to sign up. Where is the commitment in that? 
   The Austin American Statesman editorial states on October 1: ``For many kids, the doctor is not in.'' What kind of statement is that, doc? 
   The Atlanta Journal Constitution: ``Kids lose out to politics,'' screams the headline on September 30. 
   The Chicago Tribune editorial: ``A sound children's health bill.'' Stating further, ``We urge the President to sign the measure. If he vetoes it, Congress should override that decision. We share the concern over stealthy leaps toward government-sponsored and universal 
   health care. But this bill doesn't do that. It is a reasonable expansion of a vital program.'' 
   The New York Times editorial: ``Overcoming a veto and helping children.'' 
   The Daily News, New York, editorial. ``Presidential malpractice,'' screams the headline. ``President Bush is threatening a veto of legislation with broad bipartisan support that would extend health coverage to millions of  uninsured children. He is wrong. Dead wrong.'' 
   My colleagues, do the editorial writers have it right or wrong?

   Doctor, you worked in this field. You are a professional. You are in the healing arts. Is SCHIP a program where the government would be telling doctors like yourself how many pills to prescribe? Are they ordering every facet of the patient-doctor relationship? What is the real truth about this?

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity, it is an excellent segue that the doctor made. While the President finds it repugnant to have $35 billion in new moneys over 5 years, which would be what SCHIP calls for, the President in his new Iraq war supplement asks for an additional $45 billion, totaling close to $200 billion for the war in Iraq for the next year. That is $200 billion for the next year. And we can't afford a $7 billion increase for our children to get health care? 
   So please keep in this mind that this compromise to reauthorize SCHIP is something very small in comparison to the values that he seems to hold dear, which is waging war, in a war that we never should have been in, based on a false premise. For that he is willing to give all. But to secure the national health of our children, no money for that.

   In a couple of weeks, we will be right back here in the same Chamber and we are going to see what is what. Who is who and what is what. We are going to be counting. On that day there will be no hiding, and everybody who has an election certificate will be called upon to say where they are really at when it comes to caring for the health of our children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important now to talk about what American citizens might consider doing. Of course people do whatever they want, it's a free country, but people feel strongly about SCHIP, and 70 percent of the people believe it should have been passed. So what they might consider doing.

It wouldn't hurt to talk to our rabbis and our ministers and our imams in our faith communities to talk about this issue, make it sort of an issue that we talk about and make sure that people understand what is going on. 
   It wouldn't hurt to have a coffee klatsch. Invite some people over to talk about it. It wouldn't hurt to talk to the teachers and the principals in the local community about it. That wouldn't hurt a thing. Build awareness. Help get a teacher's perspective on what it is like to teach a child who is coughing and sneezing and wheezing and can't really focus on his or her studies. 
   We can e-mail and write and call in to our elected officials. That is something we certainly should do. It is time for people to come together and demand an override to this awful veto.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday a jury here in Washington convicted Scooter Libby, the Vice President's former chief of staff, of obstruction of justice, giving false statements to the FBI and perjury. Libby's attorneys say they will appeal. Meanwhile, the White House remains silent about whether or not the President will pardon Mr. Libby. 
   From the very beginning, this case has been about more than just Libby's attempts to lie to a Federal prosecutor. As egregious as that is, and Mr. Libby should be punished for it, perhaps even worse are the revelations that came out during this trial of how the Bush administration operated when it came to issues of national security. 
   Testimony from Libby's trial shows the great lengths the Bush administration was willing to go to silence opponents of the war. In the case of Valerie Plame, the administration was more than willing to out an intelligence operative. It did not matter that they may have been jeopardizing her life or the lives of other intelligence agents that she may have been working with. All the administration cared about was silencing a critic of the war. 
   President Bush should realize how serious this case is and should state for the record today that he will not pardon Mr. Libby.

   Mr. ELLISON. Representative Klein, thank you, and your introduction was excellent because it really does set the stage for this new energy future that America is walking into. 
   Today, the House considered H.R. 5351 which would end unnecessary subsidies to big oil companies and invest in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is similar to the House bill passed, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act passed as part of a bipartisan energy package in August 2007. 
   And I just want Americans to know that when you sent this class, this 110th Congress, this freshman class here to Washington, you expected that we would take a step in favor of our energy future. And I want you to know that we are doing that. We are stepping into that energy future, putting innovation, putting incentives into the hands of people who are going to make the difference, and we are putting the best interests of the American people forward. 
   As I think about our energy future, I think about it every time I walk up to the pump, Representative Klein. Every time I go to the pump, I am reminded of why we need a new energy future. I remember back in 2001 when I would be able to put that gas pump in the tank, and I think I was paying somewhere around $1.50 a gallon. Well, that is not so today. You and I both, whether you are in Florida or Minnesota, or whether you are in California or Arizona, you are probably paying somewhere north of $3, somewhere close to $3. And that is double what I remember paying. And that is wrong. 
   And this is especially at a time when we are seeing energy prices go up and food prices go up, because it costs money to get food from one place to another, and we see family budgets being pinched. We are in the middle of this subprime mortgage crisis. And it is time that we get a handle on our energy future, get a handle on not only the issue of global climate change, not only on the issue of pollution, but on the issue of cost to the American consumer that we get our hands on top of this important issue. 
   So as I hand it back to you, Representative Klein, let me just say that the big five oil companies recently reported record profits in 2007. ExxonMobil earned $40.6 billion, the largest corporate profit in American history. These profits, well, I just want to say that the American taxpayer, we are paying a whole lot more, and it might be going pretty good for some folks, but a lot of the rest of us are hurting. 
   So let me toss it back to you, Representative Klein, and thank you for leading the charge today on this new energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Let me just lend my voice and agree with you. I do believe that the oil companies do not need any more help from the American taxpayer. It's time to repeal these tax breaks and credits, and I am glad that we have done so. I just want to say that the 110th Congress, this Congress that you and I came in as freshmen, as majority makers, really has been productive in the area of energy. 
   I am so glad that within the first 100 hours, and I know Congressman Klein, you will remember the first 100 hours, that we passed a bill to repeal tax breaks to the big oil companies and to incentivize production of clean and renewable sources. And then, of course, it was just last year that we passed the bill for CAFE standards. So many Congresses, so many years passed where we had no CAFE standards to speak of, no increases in the CAFE standards. Now we are at 35 miles per gallon. I think we should look at this not as some great victory but as a start down the road of progress. 
   And then again today we passed this I think historic bill and it signals change. It signals change. It signals that the United States Congress is serious about our renewable future. It signals a change that we can have a future where we can have air that we can breathe, where we can be at peace with our environment and not warm up the globe to the degree that no life can live on it, or that the changes in the world temperatures will be so drastically changing that we can't sustain life as it exists now. 
   And I think that we can also live in a future where we can get around and have transportation that is affordable and make some sense and actually is something that we can all live with and all participate in. But I think that these changes that we have seen in the 110th Congress, the 100 hours, CAFE standards and then today, signal that we are going in the right direction. 
   We need the American people to continue to fuel the movement that we are on. And one thing we are doing here tonight is trying to let you know what we have done and then ask for your continued participation. Because the American people are demanding change, and I think that the 110th Congress is giving it to you. 
   Let me just say that those statistics that were just shown about oil profits earned, I just think it is very important to bear in mind that as oil profits have been skyrocketing, the average person that we have seen increases in prices in everything from food to fuel, we have also seen inflationary tendencies, and we have also seen increase in unemployment. We are in a time where clean, renewable energy and a new path towards energy is something that everyone needs, and it is something that I think our entire society, our entire economy, oil companies included, need to take a part in and need to look at the tremendous bounty they have received from being able to be an American corporation and saying that, look, we are going to do something to participate. 
   I would like to see our oil companies take some of their own profits and invest it into renewable energies. I would like to see them take some of the great bounty they have received and make a commitment to the American people to get into a green future. So again, what we see today is signaling change, sending us in the right direction, and I look forward to going much, much further.

   Mr. ELLISON. Let me just say that I agree with you. You have to understand that when you borrow all this money to fund the government, you have to pay that back. And that payback accounts for a part of your budget which squeezes out other things you might really want to do. So pay as you go has a whole lot of merit, and I'm glad we are not adding already to the enormous debt. As you know, when this President came into office, he inherited a fairly significant budget surplus. But that is yesterday. 
   One of the things I want to mention, Congressman Klein, about this important bill, is that provisions are critical to creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying, green collar American jobs. This issue of jobs, green collar jobs, is critical. Green collar jobs are jobs perhaps in the construction industry where people would help retrofit old buildings in order to make them more fuel efficient. For example, green roofs on buildings, more fuel efficiency in buildings, construction jobs, jobs that people can earn a good wage in. 
   I think it is important to understand that part of the new energy future that we are talking about takes into consideration not just the scientists who are going to be working in labs and not just the folks who are going to be working on the policy issues, but actually hardworking Americans who work every single day to put food on the table for their families. The green collar job is something I think we have to pay close attention to. And as you may know, our farm bill actually included a provision about green collar jobs, which is very important. I was happy to be a part of that. 
   The preservation of existing jobs relies on these green collar jobs as well. A recent study showed that allowing the renewable energy incentives to expire would lead to about 116,000 jobs being lost in the wind and solar industries through the end of 2009. 
   Now this is a big deal, because if we incentivize the production of clean, renewable energy, of wind, of solar, of biomass, of cogeneration, of other forms of energy production, it has the effect of spinning off more and more employment. And, of course, as I led in before, the first part of creating a green future for America is in conservation. That which we save, we never have to use energy to fuel. And so in this area of conservation, as I mentioned before, all kinds of jobs in the area of construction, in the area of so many things that would allow people who can make a good honest living and at the same time preserve our energy future and make our economy cleaner and make our economy one in which everybody can even avoid the health risks associated with some of the burning of hydrocarbons. 
   So, again, green collar jobs is a big part of what we did today, a big part of what we have been doing, and I am proud to be associated with that.

   But I just want to say as I hear Mr. Hall make comments about young people who are involved in innovation and creative use of their talents and skills, it reminds me of the fact that this bill that we passed today, plus the bill that we passed in the 100 hours, plus the farm bill and the energy bill we have already passed, is a policy that all Americans can get behind, whether you are a young person in high school trying to figure out how much of the surface of your solar vehicle needs to be paneled so that it can run efficiently, or whether you are a person working in a company or whether you are a person who is just trying to earn enough money for a family, this is a bill that meets the needs of many people, which is why it's good legislation.

I also just want to point out that whether you are a mom and a dad or whether you are Home Depot or even Dow Chemical or the Sierra Club, or the United Steelworkers or the National Farmers Union, this is good legislation. This is legislation America can get behind. 
   I look forward to a more renewable, greener future that we all can participate in, and I just want to say, finally, to our oil companies that have made such monumental profits over the last numbers of years, I do hope that you all look within yourselves and take some of those profits that you have been able to get based on you being an American company and invest in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT--DEMOCRATS DELIVER WITH LEGISLATION THIS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, the appalling conditions at Walter Reed captured the Nation's attention this month and finally spurred this administration to begin taking action. But reports on the poor conditions at Walter Reed date back 2 years ago. The President and the Congressional Republicans did nothing. In fact, Lieutenant General Kiley, former head of Walter Reed, knew for years about the horrible conditions at the facility, but he claimed the problems ``weren't serious and there weren't a lot of them.'' 
   We now know that that was not true, thanks to The Washington Post and hearings held by the Democratic House. Oversight by the former Republican Congress could have stopped these problems long ago. But lack of oversight didn't begin or end with Walter Reed. Republicans also failed to look at the President's policies in Iraq, the administration's actions during Hurricane Katrina, or the firing of numerous U.S. Attorneys for political reasons. 
   Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress has already held 91 oversight hearings on these issues and others, and we will continue to uphold our legislative duty to oversee the actions of the executive branch.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (IRAN -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. I would like to thank you, Congressman WATERS and Congressman LEE. Before I got to Congress I thought both of you just were towering heroes of peace. Now that I have been here and had the chance to get to know both of you, I am certain that I was right from the very first impression I had of you. Thank you for standing up and calling this special order tonight. 
   The point I would like to make is simply this. We see in Iran a country we have not had any open diplomatic relationships with since 1979, except for brief moments around IEDs last summer. The meetings have not been continued, and, in essence, we have had no real diplomatic relationships with Iran in many, many years. 
   Many Americans don't remember the day when we did have relationships with Iran. Yet, despite all these years of having no diplomatic ties to Iran, no open communications, channels of communications, it really has not solved any of the problems. Not talking has not helped. 
   I want to join with Representative Waters and Representative Lee in calling for an open dialogue, unconditional bilateral dialogue. Dialogue is not a gift, dialogue is not a present, dialogue is not a reward. 
   Dialogue is a tool that can help us stabilize the world, bring peace to millions and millions of people all over the world. Dialogues should not be used as some sort of a gift. It doesn't make sense for any nation to say capitulate to our demands, and then we will talk to you. The very purpose of negotiation is to say, let's talk, and the first agenda item could be serious problems we have with one another. 
   But the start is talking, unconditional talking, talking with a clear agenda in mind, talking with no illusions about differences. But talking, nonetheless, is something that I think we need, and we need it now. 
   I want to say that our effort to isolate Iran by not talking to Iran, reminds me of our effort of trying to isolate Cuba by not talking to Cuba. Now everybody in the world does business with Cuba except the United States. American farmers wanting to sell grain, Cubans want to buy stuff from the U.S., people wanting to see family, those things are hampered because we are the only ones in the world maintaining this policy of nondialogue. I fear that we could end up in the same way with Iran. 
   Let me just point out an article in the Times online from March 3, 2008. The headline is, ``Four kisses, then the band played: the day former foes became friends.'' 
   It starts out describing a meeting between Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Nouri al-Maliki. It goes on to talk about how a young girl dressed in a white dress clutched a bouquet of flowers as she waited with a small boy in a smart suit to greet President Ahmadinejad of Iran, who began a historic visit to Iraq. 
   Earlier today, we heard a speaker who I won't name say that, oh, the United States needs to get with China and Russia to isolate Iran. China and Russia, we can't even get Iraq to isolate Iran. 
   We can't even get Iraq, a country we have invaded and essentially have taken over, though it does operate under the guise of sovereignty, we can't even get them to say don't talk to Iran. They have open relationships with Iran and are building them more and stronger every day. It doesn't make any sense. 
   Now, it's not just Iraq that has a welcome mat for Iran. But let me just say that when Americans, Members of Congress go to Iraq, all of us know we go into military aircraft that takes evasive maneuvers into Baghdad, because we are concerned about our safety. 
   This is a fact. So much for isolating Iran from Iraq. Okay, well, then, what about another country, Pakistan. We send a lot of money to Pakistan. Yet Pakistan announced in a March 5, 2008 article, the Times of India, Iran, on Wednesday, said it was ``ready to sign the India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline deal,'' but technical issues between the two are hindering the process. 
   ``We are ready to sign the agreement as soon as possible,'' Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs said. ``Everything is okay from our side. There are some technical issues between India and Pakistan,'' he said. 
   ``The India-Pakistan-Iran pipeline, which is dubbed as the 'Peace Pipeline,' is stuck over issues such as price and transition fees.'' 
   So much for isolating Iran from Pakistan and India. All right, so Iraq, they are talking to them, Iran, Pakistan and India are talking, but, okay, maybe we can still get Russia and China, countries that have militaries, countries that have economies, countries that have been freestanding and independent for many, many, many, many, many years. 
   Okay, what about Afghanistan? Isn't that country essentially a failed state which we invaded and kicked out the Taliban and now are trying to reconstruct today? 
   ``In the electricity substation just outside of Herat, western Afghanistan, there's the loud hum of power--Iranian power,'' that's right. ``More electricity reaches Herat than the city can use, but the industrial park just across the road from the NATO military base is putting it to good use. 
   ``Small plastic bottles of fizzy orange juice shuffle along the conveyor belt to be labeled and packed--the building is noticeably Iranian in design and the markings on the machinery show exactly which country helped these Afghan businessmen. 
   ``The camels grazing outside cautiously cross the fast, straight, asphalt road--one of the best roads in Afghanistan stretching 120km to the border. 
   ``Soon a railway will link Afghanistan to Europe, or so boasts the Iranian government.'' 
   I would just mention, with a quick Google search, Iraq, India, Pakistan and, now, Afghanistan are all coalescing economically with Iran. We are not talking to Iran. We don't talk to Iran. We don't want to try to get into that market of 70 million people. We don't want to try to open up diplomatic ties and work on issues. 
   We are not trying to solve this nuclear conflict with dialogue, discussion and open conversation. We are just trying to isolate them, but nothing suggested we are being successful at doing that. 
   The fact is maybe isolation of Iran is not the right tactic. Maybe the right tactic is to try to talk to them, to try to build a better relationship, to try to have cultural exchange, try to have exchange of views, different though they may be, with an eye toward a more peaceful world, with an eye toward a world in which people can have security and in which an eye toward which the world can rest and feel their children are safe at night.  
   The fact is this saber rattling, I remember that it was about maybe 16 months ago that I sat in my first meeting that I ever had with the President, with, I believe, Representative Lee and Representative Waters. I think it was Representative Lee who said, are you, Mr. President, planning on hitting Iran? He gave us a sure statement that he was not. 
   Yet ever since that time, all we have been hearing, time and time again is that Iran is the problem. 
   I don't know how Iran could be the problem in Iraq without the complicity of the Iraqi government. I mean, I need somebody to correct me on this point because I just don't get it. How can Iran be an issue in Iraq unless Iraq wants them in the country. It just doesn't 
   make any other kind of sense to me, and I need somebody to explain that, because maybe I have just not been in Congress long enough to get it. 
   Let me just say, I want to move aside now, and I want to thank the two Members who have been leading the charge, along with Congresswoman Woolsey, who is recovering from back surgery. I know if she was feeling better she would be right better with you, the triad, the triad for peace. I admire you so much.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I just want to again thank Representatives WATERS and LEE and SHEILA JACKSON LEE. 
   I just want to make a few quick points. We're under no illusions. I think that by this special order, I don't think anyone intends to excuse bellicose, inflammatory remarks that have been made by the President of Iran. There's no excusing that. But you don't deal with bellicose remarks with a war. You deal with bellicose remarks by issuing a statement condemning those statements, but not with a war. And I don't think any bellicose statements or inflammatory remarks by the President of Iran could ever justify an attack which will result in the massive loss of life. 
   I also want to say that a strike against Iran, no one can predict what the consequences of that will be. Will it excite the Shiia community in Pakistan, of which 30 percent of the people are Shiia there? What will it do to Afghanistan? 
   Again, Iran is providing electricity in Afghanistan in an effective way, much, much more than other countries have done. Again, Kabul and Kandajar are not electrified 100 percent of the time. 
   What will happen in Lebanon? Will that inflame another war such as the one in the summer of 2006? That could inflame the region, and no one knows whether bombs will start falling from other parts of the region. 
   This war against Iran, a strike against Iran has no clear outcome. It is a very bad idea. And I think that what we must do is pursue diplomatic negotiations, and remember that negotiation is not a reward, it's not a gift, it's not a present; it's a tool for the security of the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (TRIBUTE TO VERNON BELLECOURT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the life of Vernon Bellecourt of Minnesota, a selfless servant who committed his life not just to fight for American Indians but for the rights of all people. 
   Last night I was at a funeral service for Mr. Bellecourt, and while I regret to report the recent passing of Mr. Bellecourt at age 75, I am grateful for his spirit of equality and inclusiveness which will continue to live on in the Twin Cities of Minnesota and around the world. 
   Mr. Bellecourt, a member of the Ojibwe Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, came to St. Paul from Minnesota's White Earth Indian Reservation. As a skilled communicator and a natural leader, Vernon championed the power of community. He practiced what he preached, solidifying his commitment to community by operating several small businesses. And while Vernon was a businessman, his greatest contribution was as a human rights leader around the world and in Minnesota. 
   Let me read a little bit from the Washington Post obituary that appeared today in the paper: 
   ``Vernon Bellecourt, who fought to restore land and dignity to Native Americans and against the use of Indian nicknames for sports teams as a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM) died October 13 of complications of pneumonia at a Minneapolis hospital. 
   ``Since leaving behind careers as a hair stylist and real estate agent and joining his brother'' Clyde Bellecourt ``at AIM in the 1970s, Mr. Bellecourt had been in the forefront of the movement to ensure that treaty rights of Native American tribes and the U.S. Government would be fulfilled. He was president of the National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the Media and a principal spokesman for AIM. 
   ``He was involved in numerous demonstrations to bring attention to his causes, including the 1972 occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington and the 1992 Super Bowl rally to protest the name of Washington's football team. He also spoke at colleges and universities around the world about more than 400 treaties that the group believed the U.S. was not honoring. 
   ``Clyde Bellecourt, a founding member of AIM, said yesterday that his brother had been in Venezuela about 4 weeks ago'' to talk about ``providing heating assistance to American tribes.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let me wrap up and say that Vernon Bellecourt brought an issue to the attention of the American people that most of us walk past very quickly. Most of us would look at Native American sports team mascots and think no big deal. But just imagine, if you would, Mr. Speaker, teams called the Chicago Negroes or the Washington Caucasians. None of us would appreciate that kind of depiction of our ethnicity, and Mr. Bellecourt didn't appreciate it either. And he helped elevate the self-esteem of young Native Americans and also helped us understand our common humanity as we respect each other due to his inspirational work. 
   I also want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I met Mr. Bellecourt in the early 1980s in Detroit, Michigan, when he was standing up for Native Americans at the Hopi Indian Reservation as they were in a conflict with Peabody Coal Company over land and treaty rights. I got to know him better when I joined him in northern Wisconsin, standing on the docks to stand up for Native American treaty rights. And whether you agree with him or not, Mr. Speaker, he embodied the spirit of an American standing up for what you believe in, speaking out for what is right, speaking up for the people who don't have a voice. 
   Mr. Speaker, Vernon Bellecourt will be sorely missed and will never be forgotten. In my opinion, he is a great man and he has helped us discover ourselves in a deeper and more meaningful way. May God bless Vernon Bellecourt and sympathy for his family.

   Imagine, Mr. Speaker, a young person voting for the first time, freshly 18 years old getting a chance to vote, waiting in line and finding out that there are no more ballots because of one reason or another. Or imagine the person is a senior citizen who has plowed so much into our country, forged a way for us in this society, but yet they stand in line, no backup ballots, they can't vote because the machine broke down. Or what about a veteran, Mr. Speaker, a veteran who has served in Iraq or Afghanistan who stands in line trying to cast a ballot to select a leader of their choice in their community and the machine breaks down, no ballots, and they're not able to cast a vote. 
   This is a very commonsense, reasonable and responsible piece of legislation that goes to the very heart of what we are here to do in this Capitol today as the United States Congress which is to make sure that democracy marches forward. This is prudent. This is wise. This is smart. This is a dollar very, very well spent because it ensures that our country continue to reflect the rich diversity in this body so people can vote and pick their leaders. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to support this excellent legislation. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (REQUIRING A VOTER'S PHOTO ID WILL DENY MANY AMERICAN CITIZENS FROM THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, it was on May 7, the day of the Indiana primary election just last Tuesday, I believe that was May 5, excuse me, May 5, that 12 nuns came to the voting booth to cast a ballot in the election. These nuns, women of the cloth, women who have dedicated their lives to prayer and service, only wanted to vote but were barred from doing so by Indiana's photographic identification law. This law, which is the most stringent in the United States, the most stringent of any State, requires that before you can cast a ballot, you must present a government-issued photographic identification card. This 98-year-old nun, American citizen, devoted to her country and her faith, was denied along with 11 of her colleagues. 
   I'm disappointed to tell you, Madam Speaker, that this problem didn't have to happen. Only a few days before this Indiana photographic ID law was put in place, the United States Supreme Court reviewed this law and found that it was reasonable for Indiana to force citizens to provide such identification. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, you might say, well, isn't this designed to just stop voter fraud? The answer is ``no,'' Madam Speaker. In the United States Supreme Court decision, the Justice that wrote the majority opinion admitted and acknowledged that there was no evidence of voter impersonation. And in fact, Madam Speaker, this bill was a bill to solve a problem that simply did not exist at all. This bill was confronting a mythical voter fraud that worked only to stop 12 nuns and many others from voting. 
   The bill that required the photographic ID clearly would disenfranchise people who were low-income and didn't have a photographic ID. It clearly would, and did, disenfranchise older Americans who may not have an ID or maybe were born at home and can't even find a birth certificate, which is what they would need to get such a photographic ID. It would clearly bar college students, who maybe haven't gotten a driver's license yet, from voting. 
   In effect, this bill prohibited people from voting who need a change in America. It stopped seniors who are against the donut hole of the prescription drug, Prescription Medicare Part D that is hurting our seniors. It's barring their way to the ballot box. It's barring our students' way to the ballot box as they struggle to confront galloping tuition increases and mounting debt. It's barring the rights of our citizens who cry for greater civil and human rights in our country. And it's basically standing in the way of voters who need a fairer, more equal, more just society. 
   The fact is, Madam Speaker, I wish those people who pushed this law forward would have simply admitted that they don't want to debate the ideas, they just want to stop voters from getting to the ballot box. They don't want to debate whether or not it makes sense to help rich people get even richer, to help big corporations get even bigger. They don't want to debate that. They just want to stop the people who would be opposed to their ideas from them ever being able to cast a ballot. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the New York Times which, on May 13, submitted this editorial: The Myth of Voter Fraud. And what this editorial shows is it is not just Indiana but many other States which are requiring this absolutely unneeded, unneeded photographic ID requirement. States like Missouri, Kansas, Florida, South Carolina, and now others are considering these bills. They must and should be stopped. They're not intended to stop fraud. In fact, if there's any fraud going on, Madam Speaker, it is that people in the category that I mentioned, the senior citizens, communities of color, low-income people, students, those people are being defrauded because actively in almost every election, we've seen schemes and devises reminiscent of Jim Crow to bar them from the ballot box. 
   And so, Madam Speaker, I ask you and all of the Members of this House to consider a bill that will preempt the Supreme Court's decision in the decision that upheld the Indiana voter law. It's what we need. It would improve the quality of democracy in our country. 
   And as I close, Madam Speaker, I just want to say our country is a great one not because of bombs and guns and a huge economy, it's a great country because this country has been advancing liberty ever since its inception. 
   In the beginning of this country, Madam Speaker, you and I know that only white men of property were able to vote. Just being a white male would not get you the vote. But then we saw the Jacksonian Revolution, and people without property could vote; and then we saw the Civil War come, and then black men could vote; and then we saw the 19th amendment, and then women could vote. And then we saw the barring of the 24th amendment which said that no more poll taxes could stand in the way of people voting. And then we saw the amendment that allowed people 18 years old to vote. Every generation we've seen increases in the right to vote except for this one. It's a sad day, Madam Speaker. 
   I yield back, and I call on this Congress to keep the doors to the voting booth open for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. First of all, let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for leading this important debate in our country. No doubt, the American Dream has always been homeownership and yet, with exploding ARMs, with prepayment penalty and other such exotic products, that dream of homeownership has become an American nightmare. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'd love to be able to take every Member of this body through a tour of north Minneapolis. There are blocks on my community where every other house is boarded and vacant. The fact is that for the people who have made every single mortgage payment, and never late, they suffer because of this crisis because their home values have been dropping and plummeting. 
   We have seen our cities suffer, we have seen communities become unattractive nuisances, which were once vibrant places where people owned their own homes and did well. It's not because the market worked right; it's because it worked wrong. It's because of defective financial products, defective financial products which are addressed in this bill. 
   It's important to understand that this bill is not designed to harm the subprime market. It's designed to reform and correct it and make it work properly, Mr. Chairman. The fact is that it does not help any homeowner who gets into a 227 with a prepayment penalty, who eventually can't pay the mortgage after it explodes in their face and then lose their home. We are not better off because of something that happens like that. That is what this bill is here to stop. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, let me say that this is an important part of making the American Dream come true for middle-class Americans, making sure that when they buy a home, they can actually keep that home and that it will be a product that can enhance themselves and their families and the communities they come from.

   Does the President realize that on his watch, poverty has increased every single year, and that overall household income has decreased? 
   Does the President realize that at a time when Americans have less money in their wallets, they are trying to squeeze every dollar to pay higher food, gas, education and health care bills? 
   Madam Speaker, how bad does the economy have to get for the average working man and woman before the President realizes that there is a problem? 
   This Democratic Congress is not satisfied with the status quo. Over the last year, we have made progress to ease the economic crunch for middle-class, working-class families. We have passed legislation to make college education more affordable, increased the minimum wage, addressed the subprime mortgage crisis, and cut taxes for middle-class families. 
   We are proud of these accomplishments. We also realize that with most Americans struggling, this economy is just not working.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, today we continue debate on the Democratic budget that boosts economic growth and restores fiscal responsibility. While the Bush administration's budget priorities and policies are responsible for the largest fiscal deterioration in our Nation's history, the 2009 Democratic budget is not only balanced by 2012, but it also invests in our Nation's top priorities. 
   We reject the President's budget proposal because it creates a $396 billion deficit this year, while cutting funding for Medicaid and Medicare, veterans and homeland security. Our budget rejects the President's cuts and instead fully invests in Medicare and Medicaid, so that the most vulnerable amongst us, our children and our seniors, continue to have access to healthcare assistance. 
   We also reject the President's proposal to add more than $18 billion, billion with a B, over the next 5 years in new fees for our veterans and military retirees. 
   We reject the President's attempt to eliminate several State and local law enforcement programs, including the successful COPS, Community Oriented Policing Services program, which has put more police on the street to help reduce crime.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from the great State of Kentucky. He has been helping to lead our majority-maker class in this leg of our two-term service, and has been doing a fine job of it. 
   As I start, I want to invoke the memory of two young men, one Robert Dixon and another one, Quising Lee.     
   These are two young men who are from Minneapolis who were killed in Iraq. There have been 64 Minnesotans killed in Iraq, and Robert Dixon and Quising Lee are two gentlemen who lived in my district. 
   I'll never forget when I went to go see Quising Lee's family after he was killed. He went to North High School. He was 20 years old when he died, and he was killed in a roadside bomb in Iraq. 
   Robert Dixon was killed in a roadside bomb in Iraq as well. I wasn't able to go to see Robert Dixon's funeral. I was here. My wife went for me. Kim, thank you for doing that. And she sat there and listened to stories about Robert Dixon and his life and his service to our country and the things he hoped for and wanted. 
   But I did get a chance to visit the family and go to the funeral of Quising Lee. Quising Lee, 20 years old when he was killed, went to North High School, had his whole life in front of him. Only 20 years old. 
   It's in the memory of those two young men from Minneapolis that I offer remarks tonight, and on behalf of those 64 Minnesotans that have been killed, and on behalf of those 4,500-some individuals, Americans who've been killed in Iraq, and on behalf of those, probably as many as perhaps 600,000, perhaps even 1 million Iraqis who've lost their lives in Iraq. 
   That's the spirit in which I approach tonight, my fellow majority makers, because, as you know, tomorrow is the big day we're going to be voting on Iraq appropriation once again. 
   Just for the facts, I think it's important to point out this will be a three-tier vote. One will be on appropriation for Iraq. I'll be voting ``no.'' The second will be on certain terms and conditions to get out of Iraq. I'll be voting ``yes'' on that. And the third will be appropriations for GI bill and things like that, and I expect to be voting ``yes'' on that. 
   And so I want to just lay this out tonight because I think people that are listening should know that tomorrow is a big deal. Tomorrow is a big day. We're all going to be casting votes, votes, I pray, of conscience, votes that are not based on licking a finger and sticking it in the wind, votes that we earnestly believe in. No matter what you may conclude about how you should vote tomorrow, I pray that you do it based on your conscience, consistent with your conscience. 
   And as we sit here tonight, you know, I reflect on the fact that I've been to Iraq once, been to Afghanistan once, look forward to going back. I think it's the responsibility of every Member of Congress to see the place that we have these soldiers struggling to survive in. I don't think it's right to just send somebody there and then just expect that they're going to be fine. We should at least go there, eat with them, sit with them, listen to them, their hopes, dreams, aspirations, what they hope to do if they make it out of there. 
   I think it's important for us, as Members of Congress, to go to the VA hospitals in our local communities and here in Washington, DC. 
   I think that what we're dealing with is serious issues, life and death. And more importantly, perhaps most importantly for me, we're dealing with issues of how our Nation works in relation with other nations in the world. 
   I believe that the United States should aspire to be a good neighbor in the world. I believe that our country, blessed with tremendous economic power, blessed with tremendous democracy, meaning not just elections, but the power to respect minority rights, the power to respect religious diversity, ethnic diversity. In America, we're not saying that people don't discriminate, but it's illegal if you do it, and good people fought and even died to make it so. 
   So I hope that tonight, as we reflect upon our great Nation, we reflect upon our role in the world, reflect upon not only the hard power but the soft power of America; that we all reflect on the sacrifices that were made to make it that way; and that we say that American history is not written yet, and that greater things are left for us to do. 
   And the greatness of this country is not bound up in guns and bombs, but, my friends, it's bound up in the goodness of the people and our desire to say that we cannot rest on having a democracy at home, but we should model it for the world, but not impose it or inflict it upon the world; and that we are not the world's police officer, but we could be a good example for what people might want to emulate, and that we should use our power to beat swords into plowshares and make war no more. 
   I'll be voting ``no'' on that appropriation tomorrow. And so I just want to turn it back, as we reflect tonight, as I reflect on the lives of Robert Dixon and Quising Lee. I know my friends from Kentucky and Wisconsin have some young people, or not so young people who they're remembering tonight as well. 
   Thank you. I yield back.

   Mr. ELLISON. As we talk about this merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta, I have a number of serious concerns I'd like to point out. One is that Northwest has a pilots' union, has a mechanics' union, has an airline attendants' union. Delta only has an airline pilots' union. And the fact is that Delta is the bigger entity. And so when they merge, what will happen with these organizations that are designed to make sure working people have some rights? I'm very concerned about that. 
   And I think that's one of the reasons why I think--and I hope and pray we can pass the Employee Free Choice Act, which we already passed through this House, but we have not yet been able to make into law. 
   I'm also concerned that Delta and Northwest in the future, if they merge, will never compete based on price or based on product. They will never compete because they will be one entity. They won't make each other better, and they won't make each other more efficient. They're just going to bond together and make some money. And of course, they're quite candid, and they tell you they are going to merge so they can get efficiencies. So what is that? Well, that means somebody is getting fired. That means somebody's got to go. You can't have two Employee Relations offices; you can't have two H.R. offices. Can't have two of everything. Somebody is going to go. And at the end of the day, a lot of folks who are paying property taxes, who are raising families, who are doing well, are going to be out of work and lose their jobs. 
   So I'm very concerned about this. I'm concerned about what consumers are going to pay in terms of ticket prices. I'm concerned about loss of jobs. I'm concerned about the fact that this Justice Department has never seen a merger that it didn't like, and we are seeing an increasing monopolization, oligopolization of our, what should be, competitive markets. 
   And I would love to see some of these free-market advocates get out there and fight for a competitive market. They seem to not be in favor of competitive markets. They seem to be in favor of really big business, not competitive markets, not free enterprise. These are things that are on my mind, and I think Americans want to know what is this Justice Department going to be about. 
   Because as I wrap up and toss it back to you, I would like to ask you gentlemen a question. Did you know that in 1980, the average CEO made about 42 times the average worker; but in 2005, which is the last year I have data, the average CEO made about 411 times the average worker? That is a problem. What do you guys think of that?

   Mr. ELLISON. I think you're right, Mr. Yarmuth, and I appreciate you pointing that point out. 
   The article 1, that's kind of our theme this year, isn't it? Reasserting the power of the legislative branch. 
   I want to pick up on a theme that Dr. Kagen mentioned a moment ago as he was laying out how he was speaking with some workers in northern Wisconsin. 
   I was talking with some workers in Minneapolis recently, and we're kind of like cousins, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Folks had talked about how their pay has been stagnant and they haven't seen much of a pay increase except in the late nineties. But the prices of everything seems to be going up: health care, housing prices, and all of that. And what people did in the early part of this decade is they were able to get money out of their houses, right, which has led us into the foreclosure crisis. 
   But what are people doing now that housing prices are flat? Well, they're turning to credit cards. Charge it. They're putting it on the plastic. And I think this is a big deal because I think we need to know that people are essentially consuming not out of savings, they're consuming out of pay-day loans, credit cards. They used to do it out of the equity of their houses. And this is a serious problem, and people cannot consume out of their savings but have to consume out of debt.  
   And what it has caused us in our economy today, gentlemen, is that we have seen the credit card debt jump from 6.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, a credit card increase of 6.7 percent in the first quarter of this year to a whopping $957.2 billion. This is a very serious issue for our economy. 
   That's why we need a high-wage strategy. We need to put more money in people's pockets by reducing the costs of education, housing, health care, gasoline, and by saying that folks are going to have a fair, decent wage that they're going to be able to earn; and we need a strategy to pull those things together for the American people.

   Mr. ELLISON. You put your finger on a very important issue. You used the word ``philosophy,'' and I think it's a good time to talk about the philosophical framework that I believe is crumbling before our eyes. 
   The idea that the middle class doesn't matter, that the wealthiest among us--and let me just tell you, I'm one who says, thank God that you were able to do really, really well. I'm not against people in the top 1 percent. I mean, I'm like great. But I think people in the top 1 percent say, you know what, I climbed up the ladder and I'm going to leave it there so other people can climb up the ladder, too. 
   But the philosophy that I think we have seen over the last 8 years is the philosophy that says, you know what, we're going to give every opportunity, every incentive to the people at the very tiptop; we're not going to make sure people in the middle are making it. And what eventually happens is that those people there in the middle don't have anymore money to spend. They are now spending out of debt, and then what happens is that they can't even afford the basic necessities of life, which then is going to have an impact on the consumer sector and on corporate America. 
   Seventy percent of the whole GDP is what we spend, consumer spending, but we ain't got no money. And so the point is, we are literally killing the goose that laid the golden egg. We need to say that we need new politics where the market is a part of our life but not a holy, sacred grail. The market helps to propel productivity, but is not all there is. But we have alongside the market, a regulated market, a market that makes sure that competition is  present, a market that says that consumers cannot just get stuck and gouged and pinched and pulled and taken advantage of, and a market that says that we want to have innovation and room for small producers so that there's this competition over goods and services and brand and innovation and, of course, price. 
   We need a new market that has the middle class as the VIP of this economy, not the CEO.

   Mr. ELLISON. That's why I really believe that we need a philosophy and a President who believes in the philosophy of the common good. The common good because, you know, as Representative Yarmuth refers to infrastructure, that's another word for our common wealth. That's our common wealth. That's what we all own together. That's the roads, the bridges, the dikes, the levees, the transit. That's the universities, the public school system. That could be a health care system that we own together, that's ours. And that's all of these things that when we invest in them, they pay dividends back. 
   Like you just said, that military spending is a one-way good. You shoot that bullet, and it's gone. But when you build that road, all of us who use it for even just our businesses, just to truck stuff over it, are using it, that's a return on investment. Those of us who go to school on it, that's a return on investment. Those of us who use it just for recreation, that's a return on our investment. 
   It's our common wealth, and we need to get back to the idea that, you know, America is a country where we have our common good and we share it, and we believe it and we have a common wealth that we share and we keep and we promote. And our market is a part of the common wealth, but it's in service to the people of the country. It's in service to tap into the creativity and the productive power of the people so that they can produce goods and services for the people of this country. 
   Our markets are another, not just to produce goods and services, but to improve our social life because in that way, when I'm allowed to do my thing, right, I can be more happy, more productivity, more creative. And if I had health care and if I had a pension and if I had a school system that my kids could go to, boy, I could sit in that garage and come up with all kind of cool stuff. 
   The fact is we've got to get back to this place where it's about the common good, it's about the common wealth, and not about just me for me and I don't care about anybody else. Greed essentially elevated to a political philosophy, we've got to get away from that. It has not served us well.

It's an honor to be able to stand in front of the American people and to project a progressive vision that includes us all, that allows us to share in a common good and a common wealth together and also allows us to, you know, embrace the fact that we are an economy, that our society embraces the free market as well, that we look at these two things as complementary and not one superior to the other, that we see them as something that enhances our life together.     
   And I just want to say, as you mentioned, Mr. Yarmuth, that I don't think Americans want to be under a corporatocracy. I think we like our national identity. 
   And I'll say that you should know that before the 1870s, the corporate entity was nothing close to what it is today. As a matter of fact, you couldn't even own one unless the charter was issued by the State, the same as it is today. That's the thing; we think of these things as somehow natural or inevitable, but corporations are creatures of the State. Without a State charter, they don't exist. And we should say that corporations should ask, does it work, does it make money, and is it the right thing to do? That is a perfectly legitimate question. And I look forward to the day when that question is asked by all of us. 
   So with that, I again thank you two gentlemen, and also salute the majority makers. And I look forward to a day when we have a cooperative and productive relationship with the executive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the Bush economy has lost nearly 325,000 jobs this year alone. With five straight months of job losses and the unemployment rate experiencing its sharpest spike in 22 years, it is clear that the economic downturn is hurting middle class people everywhere. 
   Last week, the Democratic Congress passed legislation to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks to provide relief to millions of Americans who are finding it increasingly difficult to find a job. 
   Not only will this extension help 1.6 million Americans who have already exhausted their regular benefits, but it will also stimulate the struggling economy. For every $1 spent on unemployment benefits, it generates $1.64 in our economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, after last week's bipartisan vote, President Bush and the majority of the House Republicans should drop their opposition to this common-sense legislation so we can provide some much-needed assistance to those who are hurting under the Bush economy. Workers who are having trouble finding a job are not to be blamed for this struggling economy.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, today is a good day. The Majority Maker Freshmen are here tonight at this late hour to celebrate the increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. The minimum wage, the amount of pay that the lowest paid workers in our country receive, now will be able to claim an increase in pay. 
   Madam Speaker, I am joined today by our colleagues, Mr. Ron Klein of Florida and Mr. Paul Hodes of New Hampshire, to talk about this question of economic justice, this issue of a shared prosperity in our economy and in our country. And I can think of no more important and no better topic to kick off the conversation than a send-up and salute to the hardworking folks of this country who do it on minimum wage every day. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, there is a mom who can say to her son, ``Yes, son, you can go on that field trip because Mom has the money. Here you go.'' There is a dad who can say, ``Honey, yes, you can go in and play softball this summer because we can work it out.'' There is an aunt who can afford to buy her nephew or niece maybe a birthday present which she just couldn't afford before. 
   There is a hardworking mother and father who do not have to rely upon the goodness of charity, which we admire that, but everybody also wants to earn their way, don't they? And they are not going to have to go to those food shelves, although I am glad that those food shelves are there because we need them. But this week they don't have to go because the minimum wage has been increased, and the hardworking people, the people who make this country really go, have gotten the edge up. 
   And so I just want to yield, take it to one of our fellow new members of the Majority Makers, and talk about this idea of a shared prosperity of America, and how the Democratic Congress is going to return our country to a time when everybody can feel that you can really make it, you have a real shot in the American economy not just for the few, but for the many.

But I think it's important for the American people, Madam Speaker, to understand them as a whole. As we increase minimum wage, as we increase funding for health research for education, this is a general approach to help the average, working American, the average working family, do better, be more prosperous, reach their goals, help their children be prosperous and have a secure and good retirement.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Klein, it's an important point you make, and I just want to add to this idea that for so many of the working, the people who are in poverty, we are talking about working poor folks, folks who are really struggling hard every day. And you know, Mr. Klein, housing as you well know is one of the most central things that everyone needs. 
   Poor, inadequate housing leads to a lot of serious problems. I'll list a few of those, but then we'll get to what we did. Children who don't have stable and adequate housing tend to move around a lot. As they move around, they are having their lessons disrupted in their school district every time they move, which means they fall further and further behind, which has an implication for how they're being educated. 
   Health issues, whether it be exposure to lead, mold, all kind of things that are inadequate housing, very serious issue for young people and for families. Poor housing has a significant impact on health. 
   Of course, issues of crime and exposure to violence has a lot to do with where you live and the quality of the housing that you may happen to live in. And so because these problems are so important in order for families to be prosperous, in order for families to grow and do well, this Congress has taken on some important initiatives. One is section 8 vouchers. The President's inadequate budget for section 8 would have been, would have forced between 40 to 80,000 families and individuals to lose their housing vouchers. The bill that we dealt with provides for an increase above the President's budget of $330 million for tenant-based vouchers and nearly $667 million for projected base vouchers in order to renew all current section 8 vouchers so no one that has a tenant-based voucher will lose it. 
   It's important also to talk about how we were making good strides on housing for seniors. We've seen increases. We've seen seniors struggling with housing, and we're making strong commitments, seniors will benefit from the increase in section 8 vouchers as well. 
   And also I just want to say that we're looking at, we had a lot of discussion in the Financial Services Committee about what we're going to do about the foreclosure crisis. As you know, about 20 percent of the mortgages, subprime mortgages are going to result in foreclosure. That's a tremendous amount. And what it means is that people who thought they had the American Dream ended up in the American Nightmare with these foreclosures. And we've been talking in the Financial Services Committee about what we're going to do to stave off these kinds of predatory loans so that people can have a fairer, more realistic loan they can get into, so that when these loans, these 228s, 327s, these kinds of loans that adjust upward in a dramatic way, that people will have better information, that there'll be greater responsibility on the mortgage originators, that there'll be greater standards applied to these originators and that people can be able to keep their homes or will be able to be in a mortgage they can actually afford. 
   So housing is a critical issue. This Congress we're dealing with it, and it's something I'm very proud to be associated with. 
   So we have about five more minutes left, and I think that we've had kind of an abbreviated evening this evening. But we've been talking about issues that are of vital concern to the average American working person. I think it's important for each one of us to take about 1 1/2 minutes to just talk about what we feel we want the American people, Madam Speaker, to go away with as we wrap up this important Special Order by the majority freshman class. 
   Why don't we kick it to you, Mr. Klein. About 1 1/2 minutes. What do folks really need to go to bed with tonight as we think about this powerful middle class that fuels our American economy and life?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chairman, let me start by thanking Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this critical and much-needed legislation to the floor. 
   The HOPE VI program was developed as a result of recommendations by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing, which was charged with proposing a national action plan to eradicate severely distressed public housing. The commission recommended revitalization in three general areas: physical improvements, management improvements, and social and community services to address resident needs. As a result, the HOPE VI program was developed in 1993. 
   Grants are used by public housing authorities to fund capital costs of major rehabilitation, new construction and physical improvements, demolition of severely distressed public housing, acquisition of sites for off-site construction, and community and supportive service programs for residents. Any public housing authority that has severely distressed public housing units in its inventory is eligible to apply. 
   In each of the past 5 years, the Bush administration has proposed elimination of the HOPE VI program, requesting no money for this successful program, threatening to strand tens of thousands of low-income families and children to live in substandard public housing. 
   But the Congress, under both Republican and Democratic majorities, has continued to fund the program. In 2006, $100 million was appropriated, and last month, $100 million was included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. This reauthorization of HOPE VI is long overdue. 
   In the Fifth Congressional District and in the City of Minneapolis alone, my local public housing authority has estimated that they need over $205 million just to maintain 5,883 public housing units at only a fair condition. Again, let me repeat this. My district needs $205 million to keep these public housing units from not falling below basic standards. The backlog of units in desperate need of refurbishment and rehabilitation is a result of 7 long years of neglect of public infrastructure. 
   This is why I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill. By passing H.R. 3524, we move a step closer to recognizing the rights for all citizens.

   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6309, the Lead-Safe Housing Act of 2008. 
   Let me start by thanking Chairman Frank, Subcommittee Chair WATERS, and Housing Subcommittee Ranking Member SHELLEY CAPITO, for all of their work on this legislation to protect low-income children in public housing from lead exposure. I also want to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee and Chairman Dingell for their work on this bill as well. 
   H.R. 6309 requires that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, update its blood lead level intervention regulations to reflect the level used by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The legislation simply requires HUD to update its blood lead regulations from the current 20 micrograms per deciliter to 10 micrograms per deciliter. The Center for Disease Control, the CDC, has that as their recommended threshold. Or if the CDC updates their standard to a lower number, that lower number. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. The CDC, in 1991, 17 years ago, determined that a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter was the threshold for potential damage in children. Lead poisoning causes destructive physical, intellectual and behavior problems, including weight loss, decrease in IQ, hyperactivity, lethargy, and even sometimes, Madam Speaker, death. In fact, a 4-year-old young man swallowed a lead charm and died in my district a couple years ago. 
   Lead poisoning is one of the largest environmental hazards affecting children in America today, and it is also one of the most preventable hazards. Madam Speaker, our most vulnerable children often face a greater risk of being exposed to lead. Children of color, children from low-income families are more likely to reside in older homes, and these homes are much more likely to contain lead paint. 
   Thanks to congressional action in the 1990s, our country has seen significant progress in reduction of children exposed to lead. Between 1991 and 1994, 4.4 percent of children under six, or more than 800,000 children, had unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood of 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher.     
   The CDC now estimates that this number has dropped to 1.6 percent of children or more than 300,000 children. That's progress, but progress is not enough. Though this is progress, 300,000 children are still 300,000 too many; 1 is too many. 
   Madam Speaker, my legislation is just one attempt to tackle the problem. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to some day eradicate this problem of elevated blood lead levels in children. This legislation is supported by numerous organizations from the Children's Defense Fund to the Sierra Club. 
   Madam Speaker, let me just note that challenging and reducing childhood lead exposure will help our society lower the number of children who have reduce IQ because of this exposure, reduced hyperactivity, reduce children experiencing impulse control, and all of these things have implications for our juvenile court system and our adult court system, not to mention shutting off, closing down the tremendous potential that is locked up in every child. 
   Madam Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

This is the greatest deliberative body in the world and in the history of the world. And the evidence of that is that not only, not only does this body thoroughly debate issues, but when tragedy strikes one, people respond in the most humanitarian way. Even though we have strong points of difference of opinion, when tragedy strikes America, we have no Republicans, we have no Democrats. We just have Members of Congress who are responsive to the people of this country. 
   So, Mr. Chair, I want to thank you for your bold, decisive action. I want to thank all the members of the community in Minnesota who have responded, not only the official responders but the good Samaritans as well. And let me urge every Member to support this most important measure that will restore our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (THE PAINFUL COST OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, on Monday, the President submitted his budget for our Nation. In that budget, it would be easy to look at it and say, this is all about numbers, it is just a rational approach, it is just a plan, it is an impersonal thing. But, in fact, Madam Speaker, what a budget is is a moral statement about who matters in our society. 
   What a budget is is a reflection of our own humanity. It talks about who counts, who doesn't, who matters, who doesn't, what are our priorities. In fact, what the budget shows, Madam Speaker, is our values and what we hold dear, and what we believe is really just not that important. 
   Let me say as we approach this budgetary season, this process in Congress, it is very important to remember that this budget will tell much, much more about our society and who we are than we might imagine. In fact, we should use some guiding principles as we approach this budget. And one of them is very simple, and it is a quote that comes from the great late Senator Hubert Humphrey from my State of Minnesota. 
   Senator Humphrey said, ``The moral test of any government is how it treats those in the dawn of life, the children; those in the dusk of life, the elderly; and those in the shadow of life, the disadvantaged.'' 
   This budget is a measure of how we stand, how we fit along these very important metrics that Senator Humphrey laid out for us. And by that test, the proposal that the President set forth fails. It doesn't value the hardworking investment, the hardworking energy, the blood, sweat and tears of Minnesotans or Americans. 
   This budget proposal diminishes the importance of health. It includes $78  billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts and billions in new premiums that threaten to endanger Minnesota's 691,000 Medicare patients' access to care that they need to lead healthy, independent lives. 
   This budget proposal does not value children in the dawn of life. It underfunds by $10 billion the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The administration itself argues that it needs $15 billion just to continue covering those children already enrolled in the program. With only $5 billion proposed to cover its neediest children, we will almost certainly add to, not subtract from, the already 86,000 uninsured children in Minnesota. 
   Minnesota's 407,000 veterans will undoubtedly be hurt by the President's proposed VA funding cuts. Nearly one-half of the military servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan will require health care services for the physical and psychological impairments and traumas of war, yet the President's budget cuts in half the minimum annual increase needed, according to the Veterans Health Administration. 
   The President freezes funds for college work-study funds and zeroes out Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants at a time when tuition and fees at schools like the University of Minnesota have soared nearly 50 percent in just 4 years. 
   It eliminates two of Minnesota's most effective local crime fighting tools, the COPS, Community Oriented Policing Service program, and the Justice Assistance Grants. 
   It reduces Minnesota's Community Block Grant Development program by $17.2 million, which is the cornerstone of Minneapolis and the Fifth Congressional District's affordable housing and revitalization program. 
   And it goes on: public housing cut by $450 million; Section 8 housing vouchers cut by $500 million; Section 11 disabled housing cut by $121 million; elderly housing cut by $160 million; lead paint prevention cut by $38 million; zero funding for Brownfields redevelopment. 
   Madam Speaker, a budget is a moral barometer of a nation. It is a reflection of our values. This budget proposal does not value people, but it does value the privileged, because it proposes to maintain permanent tax breaks for the President's wealthy friends. 
   The President proposes making his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. This includes reducing rates on capital gains and dividends, a phaseout of the temporary repeal of the estate tax, educational tax incentives and child tax credits. The cost to you and me? Well, that is $373.9 billion over 5 years; $1.6 trillion over 10. 
   Remember the cuts the President proposes? Kids, COPS, Justice Assistance Grants, Community Block Grants. The fact is, Madam Speaker, we have to build a new politics of inclusion, a new politics of generosity, a new politics of peace, a new politics that says that our parents and our seniors are precious, our students are precious, our veterans are precious, and we value them. 
   And tax cuts for the most privileged people amongst us, there is just not time for that right now. We have to ask all Americans of all wealth positions to pony up for the good of the whole Nation.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, tonight I would like to welcome you, Mr. Speaker, and the American people to the Accountability Congress. Over the next 1 hour, my freshman colleagues and I will be claiming this hour to talk about the accomplishments of this 110th Congress. 
   We have seen not only an auspicious and bold, brave, new agenda for the first 100 hours, but also the first 100 days. And we are not just going to talk about and celebrate the accomplishments of the last 100 days. We are going to talk about a vision for our country and talk about what will happen in the days to come. 
   It is important, Mr. Speaker, that the American people know that by getting a new majority in the Congress that they have signed up to get a vision that is inclusive, that brings Americans all together, that makes for a safer America, a fairer economy, that makes for an economy where working people, middle-class people can strive and do well in our society. 
   And joining me tonight with the members of the freshman class are a host of tremendously brave and tremendously intelligent, capable leaders who are aiding not only in charting a new course for our country, but who in this very 110th Congress, Mr. Speaker, are fully engaged from the very top. The leadership has engaged our talents, our skills, our ability, and we have been proud to be able to help this 110th Congress be a stronger, better place. 
   And tonight I am going to be anchoring the one hour, but I am not going to hang on to it long. I think the American people want to hear from the brilliance that this 110th Congress class has to offer. So in the very beginning, I am just going to pass it right off to Mr. Hodes, who is the president of our class. 
   I yield to Congressman Hodes.

   It is time to get specific, my friends. Let me just say specifically that in the first 100 hours alone, we made our very first vote the implementation of the independent bipartisan 9/11 Commission's national security recommendations. Second, we voted to increase the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years to give American workers an overdue pay raise. Third, we voted to cut student loan interest rates in half. Fourth, we voted to roll back multibillion dollar taxpayer subsidies for big oil and big coal companies, and we put that money toward renewable energy. 
   Next, we expanded research and help for stem cell research. And then we voted to require Medicare to leverage its substantial bargaining power to buy prescription drugs and pass the savings on to people. And then we put the interests of all Americans ahead of the special interests by passing a tough congressional ethics reform, restoring the pay-as-you-go budgeting and restricting spending on earmarks. Those are the specifics. Now we are going to elaborate. 
   Congressman Hodes, I would just like to ask you a question: What did this Congress do to help students and to stand up for the right to an affordable education so that every American can reach their highest potential?

   One of the things that we are trying to do in this Congress and we are going to do and we are on the track to do is to make middle-class people have a real opportunity for a real future for their children, for their parents, for everyone. There is no doubting that doing things to strengthen the American worker is part of that. 
   One of the things we did was we passed the Employee Free Choice Act, and we have made some firm strides on issues of trade to make sure that we don't export jobs.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, this month marks a special opportunity to pay tribute to the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Americans. In our community, we have a great opportunity to recognize this dynamic force of creativity in our Nation, and I welcome the opportunity to do so and I thank my colleague Mike Honda for hosting this special order tonight. 
   An estimated 180,000 Asian Pacific Islanders representing a diverse community of backgrounds and cultures and experiences make their homes in Minnesota, with an estimated 32,000 in the Fifth Congressional District alone. Minnesota serves as home to one of the Nation's largest Hmong population, estimated at nearly 80,000. In Minnesota, we boast 2 members of our State legislators who have Hmong American heritage, Senator Mee Moua and Representative Cy Thao. The Hmong American story in Minnesota is quintessentially Minnesotan and we are proud of our Hmong community. 
   The Hmong story is quintessentially an immigrant story as well, a story coming from their land to a new one to make success here in America, overcoming the many difficulties, struggling, persevering, while retaining love for their land of origin, finding tremendous love and loyalty in their new home as well. 
   The Asian American and Pacific Islanders make a valuable contribution to every aspect of American life and Minnesota life, from business, education, to arts to military. We will always remember Qixing Lee, a young man who graduated from North High School of Hmong American heritage who lost his life in this conflict in Iraq. Their contributions and unique additions to our life have enhanced the moral fabric and character of our State and our great country. 
   As we celebrate the many contributions of the Asian American-Pacific Islander community, let us not lose sight of the cornerstone of their contributions and to the very foundation of this country, immigration. Immigration has played a vital role in the entire making of America, whether the immigrants are from Europe, Africa, whether they are from Asia, or Latin and Central America. But immigration no doubt has played a vital role in the creation and success of our country, and must be looked at as a vital American strength as we look forward in this 110th Congress. 
   As the Democratic-led House leads the way on immigration reform, I believe that we must look at comprehensive reform, not shock radio sound bites. Reform that fully recognizes the contribution of immigrants have made and continue to make to our Nation is as equally important as security on the border. Fair comprehensive immigration policy must work to protect and unite families. Right now, an estimated 1.5 million Asian and Pacific Islanders face an immigration backlog that has forced many families to live separated from their loved one for years. This is a shame and must end. 
   As we celebrate the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to our Nation, let us use this occasion to take our great country in a new direction and to higher heights, and to meet the challenges facing all Americans, including Asian American and Pacific Islanders. As we have in the first 100 days, let us take further steps to change the way we do business in Washington and defend our country, grow our economy, care for all children and families, protect our planet, and restore accountability. Together, we can make the American dream a reality for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (TRADE AND LABOR -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Hare, thank you for leading us in this very important Special Order tonight. Trade is one of the critical issues facing our Nation. 
   Let me say that on the campaign trail, Mr. Speaker, I found myself talking about jobs, employment, and opportunity to people on a daily basis. Whether I went to the suburban areas or the heart of Minneapolis, I could talk to people about trade. And it wasn't just people who were in labor unions. Also, Mr. Speaker, it was people who had small businesses. 
   One particular business that does a metal plating service was very concerned about trade and expressed to me how vital it was that they be able to continue to compete with other companies around the world that do metal plating but that they were in jeopardy and loss of business all the time due to trade policy. 
   So whether you are a small business person, farmer, worker, no matter who you may happen to be, trade policies are affecting our country, and we need to be very clear about it. 
   As I was on the campaign trail, I ran into people who were recent immigrants who were concerned about immigration policy; and, Mr. Speaker, here is what they told me. They said, look, prior to NAFTA, we were doing okay where we lived, but after NAFTA it got a lot harder to run a farm in certain southern parts of our country, and we just couldn't make a go of it anymore. So some folks started moving north. 
   Now the fact is we have to understand that whether we are talking about small business people, trade unionists, people who have been forced to immigrate, no matter what you are talking about, trade policy is critical. So when I was on the campaign trail, Mr. Speaker, one of the things I made very clear to people is that I was concerned about trade, that I wanted to do something about trade, and we need a model for trade that said that we were not going to export our jobs. We were not going to incentivize sending our jobs away. We were going to care about the human rights of people abroad. We were going to care about our small businesses here, and we were going to have a new trade policy that said that Americans who are trying to live the American Dream and experience prosperity could do it right here and would not be subject to an unfair trade policy of our Nation. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I set about this journey working hard, working with my colleagues in the freshmen class, talking about trade and how we could get a better trade deal, Mr. Speaker. So I am very concerned about these issues. 
   On May 10, 2007, the Bush administration and congressional leadership talked about a new, with bipartisan cooperation, deal on trade; and I am not saying that the deal is bad or good. What I am saying is that we have got to be very clear, very careful about how we proceed forward. 
   I am happy about the announcement of labor standards and environmental standards. Of course, those things are good. But, Mr. Speaker, we can't rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. We need a whole new boat. We need a new model. We need a new way of going forward. 
   The ``deal'' covers changes to certain provisions of the Bush-negotiated free trade agreement with Peru, Panama, but also Colombia and South Korea.  The legal texts of the proposed agreement have not been made public, though summaries have been shared with Members of Congress. 
   We appreciate the chairman's willingness to work with the AFL-CIO on the labor chapter and are pleased to see a commitment to the International Labour Organization's standards on the May 10 agreement. However, we have got to be careful as we go forward, because, ultimately, it is going to be the Bush administration that is responsible for enforcing these labor standards; and we are a little skeptical. Let me be clear.     
   We remain concerned, I remain concerned over the future of ``fast track'' authority, and the proposed Korea and Colombia Free Trade Agreements. Congress needs to reassert its authority over trade policy as we move forward. 
   We are concerned, and speaking for myself, I am concerned, that as we go forward, that we make sure that we have a new model on trade, a new commitment to the working people of America, a new commitment to the human rights and environmental rights around the world. 
   I fear there are remnants of the failed FTA-WTO trade model in the May 10 agreement which will only lead to further hemorrhaging of U.S. jobs and the erosion of American manufacturing and service industries. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, one in every six, have been lost under the FTA-WTO trade model. By the end of 2005, the U.S. had only 14,232,000 manufacturing jobs left, which is nearly down 17 million before NAFTA and the WTO went into effect in the early 1990s. 
   What makes these already horrible statistics worse is the fact that the U.S. job export crisis is expanding from manufacturing to high-tech and service-oriented jobs. Contrary to the belief of Big Business and the multinational corporations, the decline of U.S. manufacturing is not the result of Americans simply choosing different careers; in fact, job loss and wage stagnation are increasingly affecting workers from sectors where the U.S. is understood to have a competitive advantage, such as professional services and high technology. 
   Studies commissioned by the U.S. Government show that as many as 48,000 jobs in U.S. jobs, including many high-tech jobs, were off-shored in the first 3 months of 2004 alone. Economy.com estimates that nearly 1 million U.S. jobs have been lost to off-shoring since 2000, with one in six of those being in IT, financial services and other services. Goldman Sachs estimates that about half a million U.S. service jobs were off-shored between 2002 and 2005. 
   Projections of future job losses are frightening. A University of California-Berkeley study concluded that 14 million jobs with an annual average salary of almost $40,000 are vulnerable to being sent overseas. That is a lot of food, clothing and shelter, Mr. Speaker, and we cannot tolerate the loss of these important jobs. Additionally, we can expect up to 25 percent of additional IT jobs will be relocated by 2010. We can't let it happen. Furthermore, since NAFTA, the U.S. trade deficit has risen from about $100 billion to about $717 billion, or 6 percent of national income. Mr. Speaker, we can't allow that to continue to happen. 
   Remember that real wages for U.S. workers are flat or declining, and jobs now available in the U.S. economy suffer and offer less pay and fewer benefits than jobs that we've lost since 1994. 
   Our Nation is in trouble when it comes to trade policy, and we've got to have a change. And we don't have confidence, or I don't have confidence, in this administration to make sure that any standards are being enforced, and we've got to demand that they are. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, there is a lot to be said about this. I look forward to the continuation of this Special Order because trade policy is important to the American people. It was a common theme on the campaign trail during my election, and from what I've heard from my freshman colleagues, they are very concerned about it, too. Mr. Speaker, we need a new trade policy. 
   I want to yield back at this time, but I want to commend my fellow Members and colleagues, and especially freshman Members, on standing up for American working people, business people, immigrants, and all kinds of people when it comes to trade policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Let me thank my friends from New Hampshire, Kentucky and Florida. 
   My dad likes to say, ``people respect what others inspect. If you don't inspect, you are not going to get any respect.'' So it is important that we have oversight. It is important that we have a regulatory system. 
   The market and the public sector should work in a balanced way, should compliment each other. That has not happened, and, as a result of the lack of regulation, as a result of deregulation, Gramm-Leach-Bliley in 1999, and I would like to talk about that in a moment, we have got ourselves into quite a situation. 
   Let me share with you what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued recently. You probably would not be surprised to know that between 2005 and 2006, the average income of the top 1 percent of households increased by $73,000, after adjusting for inflation, while the average income of the bottom 90 percent, that is us based on our pay here, increased by $20. I am talking about a twenty-spot. You know, bam, that is your pay increase between 2005 and 2006 if you are in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution. 
   Now, you might be thinking, gee, that is not good. But let me just tell you, what this means is that the share of the Nation's income flowing to the top 1 percent has increased sharply, as a matter of fact rising from 15.8 percent in 2002 to 20.3 percent in 2006. That means that people in the top 1 percent of our income distribution make one-fifth of the money. That is not good. 
   Now, you might be thinking, that is kind of bad there. But the fact is that it hasn't been this bad since. 
   Mr. Yarmuth, when was the last time the top 1 percent were making this much of the money in America? It did happen before, Mr. Yarmuth. I want to ask you if you know?

   Mr. ELLISON. The Great Depression. I am telling you, the signs are not good. We need bold, decisive action which puts the public sector and the private sector in a partnership to look out for the American consumer. This is what we have to do. 
   You know, Mr. Yarmuth, let me talk to you a little bit about some things you inspired me to think about. 
   When we had Chairman Frank out to Minnesota, we had a hearing on the foreclosure crisis. One of the pieces of testimony that came out is that a lot of folks actually could not find rent at the amount that they could buy into a subprime mortgage. In other words, they could get into a 228 or a 327, which means you have a low rate for 2 or 3 years and then it jumps way up. The teaser rate was lower than the market rent they could find. Since nobody was checking income, they got into that. Then when the 2 or 3 years expired, they were in a mess. The mortgage jumped up, there was not enough equity in the house even to refinance it, and they were foreclosed upon. 
   Now, that speaks to another thing we have done in this 110th Congress, and that is invested in a National Housing Trust Fund so we could truly invest in affordable housing, which is part of the equation here. 
   In America, we need an overhaul of our economic system. We need real progressivity in our Tax Code. We need  real regulation in the financial housing markets, we need to have a real aggressive attempt to support affordable housing, and we need to make sure that people have livable wages to live on. We need a new vision for an economy which puts economic prosperity at the very center dot of what we do around here. 
   So I yield back at this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (FAST TRACK TRADE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Michaud, Congresswoman Sutton, Congressman Ryan, and also Congresswoman S&#225;nchez, who left us, because you all have been carrying the banner of trade all night, fair trade. 
   And I think that before I jump into my remarks that I pulled together for tonight, I just want to say this: We are talking about trade, Mr. Speaker, within the context of two decades of flat wages for working people. When you look at real wages, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about flat real wages for working people. We are talking about a system of health care where we leave 47 million people out of it and so many other people carrying an increasing burden on their jobs just to be able to afford the health care that their job does provide. It is within this context that I want to talk about trade tonight within flat wages, within increasing health care costs, within the context of increasing and mounting consumer debt. 
   The average American, when you take their mortgage out of the equation, has about $13,000 worth of consumer debt to carry around. And that is talking about your credit cards and everything else. So we have got consumer debt, increasing health care costs, and flat wages. And now we are going to talk about trade, trade that has sapped our jobs. 
   If you look at NAFTA, NAFTA alone I want to talk about tonight. NAFTA was sold as a way to make sure that workers both in Mexico and in America would benefit. But has that really happened? Has that really happened? 
   What has really happened is the opposite. We have seen 3 million jobs lost, 30,000 in Minnesota alone. NAFTA, by permitting its heavily subsidized U.S. corn and other agricultural business products to compete with the small Mexican farmers, has driven the Mexican farmer off the land due to low price imports of U.S. corn and other agricultural products. Some 2 million Mexicans have been forced out of agriculture, and many of those that remain are living in desperate poverty. These people are among those who cross the border to feed their families. 
   NAFTA service sector rules allow big firms like Wal-Mart to enter the Mexican market and begin selling low price goods made by ultra-cheap labor in China to displace locally based shoe, toy, and candy firms. These estimated 28,000 small- and medium-sized Mexican businesses have been eliminated. Wages along the Mexican border have actually been driven down by about 25 percent since NAFTA. The Mexican border has actually been driven down since NAFTA, reported a Carnegie Endowment study. An oversupply of workers, combined with a crushing of union-organized drives as government policy, has resulted in sweatshop pay, running sweatshops along the border, where wages typically run 60 cents to $1 an hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned what is going on with Mexico because I think it is so important from the standpoint of the American worker, the American worker who is trying to put food on the table, hold jobs here in our country, it is critically important. We are talking about, as I said, flat wages, rising health care costs, increasing consumer debt. And it is so important to understand that this immigration debate we are having is heavily informed by what? Trade. Our trade policy is increasing the pain not only on American workers but on workers abroad. As we fight back and forth, to and fro, about what we should we do, more border security, higher walls, fences. We have all these raging debates around here around these issues. What we have literally done through this NAFTA trade policy and other trade policies like it is wiped out an economy in another country and not just pulled people here through higher wages but 
   pushed them here by elimination of their economies in Mexico. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I bring these points to the floor tonight so that we can have more informed debate so that when people say, hey, look, why are these folks making such a big deal about fair trade policy, it is important to know that the middle class is being pinched and squeezed. And so often even here in Congress, we are being told that the problem is some immigrant, when in reality the problem, I believe, is heavily subsidized agri-businesses and our trade policy, which allows us to dump cheap, low-cost corn into countries like Mexico, which wipes out their farm economy and drives workers there over here so that they can make a living. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critically important that we understand these issues and we get these issues on the table as we debate them because it is hypocritical, in my opinion, to talk about spending $700 million, or however much we are going to spend on a fence, and not adjust our trade policies. We can't build a fence high enough if we keep on destroying the farm economy in Mexico and dumping cheap commodity prices there. We have to fix our trade policy. We have to fix a trade policy that benefits American workers and workers around the world too, Mr. Speaker.  
   So I didn't come here to say a whole lot more than that, Mr. Speaker. I want to get this issue of trade policy in the debate as we talk about immigration policy, and I want to talk about trade policy within the context of the squeeze the middle-class people are feeling every day.

Well, if we already start out with what is a trade policy that is lax, a trade policy with a model that is not inclined toward saving American jobs, and then they won't even enforce the rules that they do have, what will happen if we vote for a trade policy for Peru and Panama that supposedly has these provisions in it, but they don't enforce them? 
   The fact is, I would like to ask the gentleman from Maine and the gentlelady from Ohio what they think about a trade model which would give labor organizations, for example, the right to charge an infraction of a labor standard and to bring a country into court for violating a labor standard? What if the sole power for enforcing the labor agreement was not in the hands of a trade representative that was favorably inclined to multinational trade but not so much for American workers, but actually in the hands of a labor organization; how might that play out?

   Mr. ELLISON. Will the gentlelady yield? I agree. American workers are some of the best in the world, innovative, hard-working, no doubt about it, and given a fair chance, can compete with any workers or anyone around the world, but we just need a fair opportunity. So I think we need a new model, a new way of doing business that will protect American workers and also protect American small businesses, and other businesses that actually are in the business of helping America prosper and do well. 
   And before we wrap up, because I think we are probably getting close, I  just want to say briefly that I hope that people who feel so passionately about immigration will incorporate into their arguments the impact of trade policy on immigration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, for over a year now, senior citizens in my State of Minnesota have been subject to a sink hole that the administration calls Medicare part D, the prescription drug program. 
   It was really never meant for our seniors. It was written for and by the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies at the expense of our senior citizens and paid for by the American taxpayer. 
   In 2006, companies like Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novartis made record  profits. Meanwhile, Minnesota seniors are at the mercy of complex and confusing drug company rules, matched by the rising cost of drugs, costs that make gas prices seem stable. 
   Prescription drugs have increased at twice the rate of inflation. Medicare folks pay as much as 10 times more than vets do through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is no way to treat the greatest generation. We can and must do right by them. We must end the drug company charade and enact real prescription drug reform. It is time to let HHS negotiate just like the VA. 
   Today, the House will pass the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. Let us end the scam and give the greatest generation the dignity they so deserve. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.

   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, at a time when more and more Americans are struggling to obtain affordable health care, the President's budget drastically slashes health care for seniors and low-income working Americans. 
   Today, 36 million seniors get health care coverage through Medicare. The President's budget takes a swipe at their pocketbooks by proposing to save nearly $6 billion by increasing the monthly premiums that seniors pay. 
   If the President was concerned about seniors, he would instead go after the vast overpayments made by Medicare to private managed care plans. Instead, he has raised premiums on our seniors and focused his cuts on our Nation's hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other health care providers. The President also cuts Medicaid by $33 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Today, Medicaid serves 55 million low-income and disabled Americans. Such cuts force cash-strapped States to either reduce benefits or cut provider payments. 
   Mr. Speaker, as our economy continues to face uncertain times, this is the worst time for the President to promote drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. 
   Rest assured, the Democrats would not allow these cuts to become law. These provisions are as good as dead as they come to Capitol Hill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ELLISON. (DISCUSSING THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Well, Mr. Speaker, I'm always happy to join my colleagues, the difference-makers, who heard the call of the American people and came to Congress to really make the case for a safer America, a stronger America; an America that is not mired down in the quagmire which is Iraq; an America that says, look, we are ready to defend American interest around the world, but that does not include being mired down in a war we never should have been in in the first place. 
   I'm proud to have voted for this safe redeployment act today, but I just want to point out something that's so very important; and that is, that while dollars and cents clearly are important in this debate, no one can calculate the loss of a loved one. Since this surge began, 600 families have received the most devastating news that any family can ever receive, 600 spouses, 600 sets of parents, 600 sets of children, 600 communities lost a loved one because of this surge that was wrong-headed from the very beginning. 
   We can't calculate the costs of this war in dollars really. It must be calculated in terms of the lives of our fellow Americans that have gone forward in this horrible conflict. We have to calculate this war in terms of the injuries and the casualties that have been faced, in terms of the young people who have lost limbs, who have lost their strong sense of mental health, their ability to discern reality, their ability to have a calm frame of mind because, for so many of these young people, the helicopter sounds don't stop even after they come home. For so many young people, the explosions, a car backing up, any sort of sound sends them back to that war zone they used to be in. And it's a horrible tragedy, it's a human tragedy, and no amount of calculation of dollars and cents will ever truly capture what we have lost as a Nation. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as we stand here, the difference-makers, today we want to state to the American people that we are here to keep the faith with the American people. We will never forget all of our fellow Americans, our brothers and sisters who have gone forward in this conflict, who have lost lives, who have lost limbs, who have lost their health and their families, who have received an injury that is so impossible to ever heal from. But we know the resilience and the strength of the American people, and we know that they expect us to put their best interests first forward always, and that means a safe, responsible redeployment out of this conflict. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, just as I say that the losses in this war cannot simply be calculated in dollars and cents but in terms of real human lives, it is also true that they be calculated in dollars and cents as well. 
   And before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out this very important graph that I have right to my right, and this shows very clearly the costs of this war. It wasn't the $8 billion that we thought it was. 
   Now, we know it's 10 billion per month, but just look here. Per year we're talking about a number with so many zeros behind it I think that my young children will be very hard pressed to be able to pronounce this number. This is a huge number. What is this, this number is about 120 T, trillion? Billion. I think I need an arithmetic lesson, and I'm a fellow that's had a little bit of schooling. 
   But as I look at this big number, it will be a challenge for any fifth grader, Mr. Speaker. It's a whopper of a number and it can't even begin to calculate the true losses of our country in this war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the Member from Maine for his excellent leadership, looking out for the hard-working people of this whole United States. 
   It is true, I am honored to come from the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota, but as I stand before you tonight, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to associate myself with the Member from Maine, with the Member from Ohio and Pennsylvania, because working people all over America need a fair trade and balanced trade situation. We can no longer abide doing trade deals which essentially support environmental policies that degrade other nations, that degrade workers in other nations, and that degrade human rights in other nations, and then thereby give other nations a competitive advantage over us because of the exploitation and ignoring important environmental regulations. And it is all very important because we need leadership tonight, Mr. Speaker, leadership which is willing to stand up and be counted for the American people, leadership which will not go with the wind but will actually change the wind. That is the leadership we need at this time. 
   Let me say that we need a trade policy that does three things, basically: respects workers' rights and their dignity; protects our fragile environment; and upholds basic human rights. Today's trade policies in America do only a few of those things but very little of what we need. 
   What we see is a continual erosion at the very heart of America: the middle class. It started first with the elimination of our manufacturing jobs. And I now represent Minnesota, the Fifth District of Minnesota, but I started life out in Detroit, where I saw plants closing on a daily, weekly basis, and I saw jobs outsourced on a weekly basis. But now what we see is a situation in Minnesota where that has taken hold and we see jobs leaving left, right and center, and it has got to stop. 
   The global economy has evolved to a large extent and is reminiscent today of the Robber Baron era, where huge transnational companies scour the planet for the cheapest, most exploitable labor and the most lax environmental standards. We have the opportunity to change that in Congress, and we must change it. 
   But what kind of global economy do we want? The answer to that question must be determined and will be determined to a large extent by the rules incorporated in free trade agreements that define so much of the global economy. By what we decide in this Chamber, we will determine the shape of the global economy. 
   If we want sweatshops in the global economy and the continued erosion of our middle class, we could continue negotiating and passing trade deals with no protection for workers or the environment. Trade deals that threaten the prevailing wage laws. Trade deals that could force us to privatize public services. 
   But if we truly believe in a global economy that lifts the living standards at home and around the globe, one that seriously values the environment on which all life depends, then what we must do is we must do better. If we want a better global economy that lifts standards everywhere, we need to change our approach to trade agreements as we enter into this fast-track arena coming up. 
   First, we need to put an end to the fast-track trade negotiating procedure which previous Congresses have ceded to the Executive branch. The Founding Fathers wisely delegated that role exclusively to the branch of government closest to the people: the Congress. And we have the perfect opportunity to take back our constitutional responsibility by allowing fast-track promotion authority to expire in June. We can and will put forward a different, more humane method of negotiating international trade agreements, but it is time for fast track to die a rightful death. 
   Secondly, we must stop passing more trade deals designed to spread the sweatshop model of the global economy. It has become clear that NAFTA, after 13 years of real-life experience, has not worked. It has cost us a million manufacturing jobs, left Mexican workers without rights and still working for wages far below the Mexican poverty level. It has displaced more than 1.5 million Mexican farm families, leaving many with no alternative but to migrate north for a better life. 
   The same applies to CAFTA and the pending Peru and Colombia ``free'' trade agreements. Colombia is distinguished by being a country where trade unionists are assassinated more than in any other nation in the world. 
   Instead, we can construct a new global economy built on generosity and inclusivity; one that raises living standards and supports the vast and growing global middle class. But we can only do it by casting off the failed policies of recent decades and by building the middle class. 
   The choice is ours. The choice is clear. It is time to reclaim Congress's free trade authority and our country's, and the world's future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, make no mistake about it, the change that took place in this body over the course of November 7 is directly related to this war in Iraq. And the presence of a number of people who are here now is directly related to the will of the American people to end this war, which never should have been started. 
   The fact is, the strategy to escalate the troops is not new, it has been tried at least four other times. It won't work this time, it didn't work those times. The thing to do now is to engage diplomatically and politically. That is what this situation calls for and that is the only thing that will bring success in this conflict at this time. 
   Support the troops? Of course. Of course, support the troops. Always we support the troops. But there comes a time when you cannot get the success that you seek at the barrel of a gun, you have to talk it out, you have to engage diplomatically, you have to engage politically. There is no substitute for that. 
   Support the troops, but bring them home. Support the troops, redeploy them, and allow the Iraqi people to seize and protect their country at this time. 
   I carry a message here today on behalf of people like Phil Steger and the Friends For a Nonviolent World, on behalf of Chapter 27 of Veterans For Peace, on behalf of every patriot who stands for peace, in the frigid cold, every Wednesday night on Lake Street Bridge in Minneapolis. 
   On behalf of the 3,100 Americans killed, including Minnesotans, I carry that message. On behalf of 24,000 scarred and wounded young Americans, including 372 Minnesotans, I carry the message. On behalf of the families and the loved ones of the damaged and deceased, I carry the message that the American soldier has done what has been asked, and it is time for politicians to step forward and do their job, which is to seek a political and diplomatic solution to this conflict, something that this latest escalation cannot do. 
   On behalf of the $8 billion we send to Iraq each month, hard-working American tax dollars that could be used to enrich the lives of the 86,000 uninsured children of Minnesota, or for nearly the 700,000 Minnesota Medicare patients, I carry the message that we need peace. We need to pursue it vigorously, unwaveringly, and urgently. 
   On behalf of the Americans who purposefully misled repeatedly, including the administration as related to these weapons of mass destruction where none existed, on behalf of the people who claim falsely of the collusion between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein where none existed, on behalf of the people who said that regime change would be welcomed with flowers instead of IEDs, I say stop the deception, start telling the truth. 
   On behalf of the people who say that the Iraqi oil revenues would pay for this war instead of draining the American Treasury of over $400 billion, I say stop the deception, start telling the truth. 
   On behalf of those Americans who told us, repeatedly, facts which got us into this war in the first place, and which they are trying to sustain us in this war now, I say stop the deception. Stop the killing. Stop the carnage. Support our troops, do not support this escalation. Send a clear signal to the President that this is the wrong way to go. 
   For 6 years now, while the deception has deepened, we were told to shut up, bite your tongues, you are not as patriotic as me, you don't love America as much as I do. None of that is true. We have to stop this polarizing language and really focus on the best way out of this. 
   Even people who support the escalation can't claim that we are going to be in Iraq forever. What is your plan for eventually getting out of this thing? We say let's start the withdrawal now, let's start the diplomatic solution now, let's start the political solution now. 
   I want to say, on behalf of those who really thirst for peace, who believe that peace really is the answer, that we need to look at the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., when he spoke out against the Vietnam War. He said, ``There comes a time when silence is betrayal.'' And so it is. 
   And so, in keeping in line with the legacy of Dr. King, I want to talk about peace today. To those people who believe in the principles of peace and that peaceful dissent that guided Dr. King, those people should know that for you to raise your voice on behalf of peace is a patriotic act, it is a good thing.     
   To those people who say they believe in peace and believe peace is the right way to go, let me wrap up my remarks by just reminding you that Marine General Peter Pace, somebody who knows a little bit about warfare, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, just last week said, There is no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in Washington strengthens our democracy, period. He added, Potential enemies of the United States, they may take comfort in rancor, but they do not know anything about how democracy works. The fact is that peace is patriotic. Dissenting from an ill-fated policy of the President is the right thing to do. Indeed, it is our obligation. 
   So please continue to stand up for peace and never forget that peace is the answer, and peace is going to prevail.

   Mr. ELLISON. A tragedy is indeed a terrible thing to waste. Whenever a tragedy befalls us, it does not do proper justice and honor to the victims of that tragedy to not learn from it and to do better into the future.  
   As the world knows, the tragic collapse of the Interstate 35 bridge occurred in the Fifth Congressional District, my home district, less than a year ago on August 1, 2007. During the evening rush hour, the Interstate 35 bridge collapsed, 13 Minnesotans lost their lives and over 100 individuals were injured. 
   It has been widely reported that the 35W bridge was ``structurally deficient.'' Even more disturbing is that according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one of every eight bridges across the Nation is structurally deficient. 
   In my home State of Minnesota, about 10 percent of our 13,000 bridges are rated structurally deficient, so the problem of structurally deficient bridges and deficient bridges is a real issue to me and my constituents. It could and should be yours as well. 
   Investing in our infrastructure and fixing our Nation's bridges demands our attention today so that our communities across the Nation can be spared the trauma that my district and my State had to bear last August. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3999. This legislation strengthens the inspection requirements and standards on our Nation's bridges. It requires that all Americans involved in bridge inspections receive appropriate training.

However, I must rise in support of the amendment that has been brought by Mr. Boustany because I believe that the impact of this piece in the bill would signal to the region a very hostile and unhealthy message. 
   The message that we should be sending to allies in the region is that we want to work constructively and productively to seal that border. I would point out that sealing borders is no easy enterprise. But I also believe that with a greater amount of help and with proper resources that the border could well be sealed between Gaza and Egypt. 
   This conditionalizing sends a signal that Egypt, that it is criticism of Egypt, that Egypt is somehow not putting forth the proper effort. Given that Egypt is such a long-standing and important ally, I think this is not the right message to send.
