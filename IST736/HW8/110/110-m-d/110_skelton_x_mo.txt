<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (OUR ROLE AS THE WORLD'S INDISPENSABLE NATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to continue my series of discussions about the future of American grand strategy. Last week I suggested that we strive to remain and even bolster our role as the world's indispensable nation, and that should guide our thinking as we consider the imperatives that define our national interest. 
   Indispensable nation is a term with significant potential for misunderstanding, particularly in this time when our global credibility has ebbed. We must be careful how we explain our intent. Most importantly, we must ensure that our actions meet our words. 
   Just as a person cannot demand respect, only earn it, so it is for nations too. So we should define indispensable to mean that we inspire by our standards, not coerce, with our demands. We should strive to be indispensable, not because our wrath is feared, but because our strength is valued. 
   The point is, it's a fine one but essential nonetheless that our role as the world's indispensable nation cannot come by internal proclamation, but rather by external validation. 
   The engines of our claim to leadership in the future are the engines that made this country great in the first place, our robust economy that provides opportunity while connecting us with the rest of the world in productive partnerships and in our unceasing pursuit of what is right, fair and just, even when we fall short of those ideals. To the extent we veered off course in those areas, whether because of crippling energy dependence, unprecedented levels  of foreign debt, our departure from sound constitutional practices, or even when and how we marshal our forces for war, we must refocus internally to address those challenges and master them once again. 
   If we redouble our efforts, we can recapture the international prestige that more than anything else translates our unmatched power into the ability to alter the course of world events. As part of this course correction, we must recall the essential truths about war and international relations that were stated so well by Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. I mentioned several of these to our current president in 2002, but we lost sight of these truths in Iraq. 
   As we do that, there is no reason why we cannot gain the confidence to understand that the term ``challenge,'' even in the international context, need not always have an adversarial meaning. In our daily life we are challenged by those around us, and we come out the better for it. 
   We are challenged by our professors to be better students. We are challenged by our coaches to be better athletes. We are challenged by our clergy to be better people. We are challenged by our spouses to be better partners. 
   All of these relationships help refine us, and, in so doing, enrich our lives so that all benefit. We might regard many of our international challenges in much the same way. In the free marketplace of ideas, are those ideas that the United States exemplifies clearly superior? Do we remain the guarantor of liberty and the natural ally against tyranny? Do we provide the best economic and social opportunities for all people with whom we interact? 
   We need not see that as solely an external challenge. It's also a challenge within ourselves, and we should not miss the opportunity to refine the good things about America so that we remain the obvious, the indispensable choice for a continued global leadership role.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (ANNOUNCING THE PASSING OF MARGARET TRUMAN DANIEL -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I announce to the House that Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of our 33rd President, Harry S. Truman, passed away today. 
   As the daughter of a Jackson County judge, a United States Senator from Missouri, a Vice President and President, Margaret Truman grew up in politics. She was a good friend, and I know others in this House who knew her considered her a friend as well. 
   Margaret was an accomplished woman in her own right, but she also revered her father's memory. In this very Chamber in 1984 a Joint Session of Congress was convened to honor the 100th anniversary of President Truman's birth. As chairman of that event, I worked with Margaret closely and was grateful for her participation as a speaker. 
   I also had the honor of being with Margaret on the first day that the Truman Home in Independence, Missouri, was opened to the public as a museum in the National Park Service system. I will never forget watching her sign the guest book in her own home that day. 
   Margaret Truman Daniel was a great American and, as an independent-minded woman, was truly her father's daughter. 
   I know my colleagues join me in expressing this body's deepest condolences to the family of Margaret Truman Daniel, including her three surviving sons, Clifton, Harrison, and Thomas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3087, a bill to require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the status of planning for the redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq. 
   This bill is the rarest of creatures, a bipartisan compromise on one of the most significant issues facing our country today, the war in Iraq. This bill was marked up in the Armed Services Committee with the support of our ranking member, DUNCAN HUNTER of California. The committee took the excellent work of Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE and Representative JOHN TANNER and built on it. 
   The committee adopted a comprehensive amendment developed by Mr. Abercrombie and Representative MIKE TURNER, two of our leaders on our committee on the advancement of national defense. The bill, as amended, passed our committee 55-2. 
   I am proud of the work of our committee. I am glad it has been brought to the floor. The bill seeks to accomplish two primary goals. First, it affirms the critical need for comprehensive, well-thought-out planning for a redeployment of troops from Iraq, the kind of planning that, frankly, was not done for the post-war period in Iraq, the so-called phase 4 of the war before we invaded. 
   This will help Congress fulfill its duties to ensure that such a mistake is not repeated. 
   Second, it requires that the planning the Pentagon is doing for deployment from Iraq be shared with Congress, as it should. It lays out a clear statement on the need for appropriate, detailed contingency planning for our redeployment of troops from that country, including consideration of force protection for our military and civilian personnel, and the need to continue to protect our vital national security interests. 
   It requires by statute that the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provide us with a report and briefing on redeployment planning from Iraq within 60 days of enactment, and that updated reports and briefings from senior Department of Defense officials continue to be provided on a quarterly basis thereafter. It will allow the Armed Services Committee to perform the oversight function, which is central to our purpose. 
   Time is not on our side. In my view, it's time to begin responsible redeployment of forces and a change of mission in Iraq. Members are on different places on Iraq, but we can agree that we must be engaged in serious planning for the redeployment of American forces. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Some will knock, Mr. Speaker, the importance of this legislation. It is a bill to require the Secretary of Defense to submit to us here in Congress reports on the status of planning for the redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq. Further, it requires the Secretary to meet with Congress to brief us on the matters contained in those reports. 
   Under the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, we are charged here in Congress with raising and maintaining the military. It's important for us to be able to look  around the corner to unseen challenges that are out there. The last 30 years we've had 12 military engagements, most of which were a surprise to us. So consequently, it's important for us in Congress to understand the progress and the status of planning for the redeployment of our Armed Forces from Iraq, because there may be those contingencies out there. We hope it doesn't come to pass, but if the future is anything like the past, our forces will be necessary. 
   So let us understand what this bill does. I think it's a step in the right direction. I am absolutely pleased with the bipartisanship we have had, both in the Armed Services Committee and here on the floor. And special thanks to my friend, my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Turner) for his work and his amendment on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, the people of rural Missouri and those who live throughout the United States are eager for Congress to enact energy policies that help alleviate record high oil prices, reduce America's dependency on foreign oil, promote homegrown energy sources, and preserve the environment for future generations. The comprehensive energy bill we are considering today, the Energy Independence and Security Act, would address the peoples' concerns in these areas. After careful consideration, I have concluded the measure is good for rural Missouri and for the security of our Nation. I will lend my support to it. 
   Our Nation cannot afford to ignore the impact high energy prices are having on individuals, on families, and on the economy at large. Oil and fuel prices have been at record levels for weeks. Rural Missouri families and farmers, who rely heavily on transportation to go about their daily lives, are particularly hard hit by high fuel costs. They have been allocating larger portions of their income to fill their gas tanks and to heat their homes. Meanwhile, America's top five oil companies have been collecting record profits and refusing to invest those profits in new oil refining capabilities. 
   Enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act would be welcome news to Missouri motorists. For the first time since 1975, this legislation would raise fuel efficiency standards for the cars and trucks sold in our country. Further, it would ensure that automakers continue producing trucks driven by many rural Americans by adjusting the fuel efficiency requirements for these particular vehicles. 
   Improved fuel efficiency is long overdue. Over time, this added efficiency would reduce by half the amount of oil America imports from foreign sources, reduce hazardous vehicle emissions, preserve our environment, and eventually yield fewer trips to the gas station for hard working Americans. I am pleased that the automobile industry and conservationists support this fuel efficiency standard. 
   Important to Missouri farmers is the robust renewable fuels standard included in the Energy Independence and Security Act. In the Show-Me State and throughout America's heartland, ethanol and biodiesel production facilities dot the countryside. They have fostered economic development in areas of the country that have struggled to produce jobs. Many of these facilities are owned by farmers who have committed their financial resources and ingenuity toward advancing America's energy 
   independence, improving farm incomes, and boosting the economic well-being of small towns. 
   The 2005 Energy Bill included a strong renewable fuels standard for ethanol made from corn. Since passage of that legislation, ethanol production has dramatically increased, corn yields have set records, and ethanol's farmer-investors have reaped economic gains. Because of the overwhelming success of ethanol and the demand for corn, the price per bushel of corn has risen. Combined with widespread drought that has impacted much of the Midwest and Great Plains States over the past several years, killing or damaging grazing pastureland, high corn prices have raised concerns about ethanol with some livestock producers. 
   This year's energy bill would build upon the successful renewable fuels standard established in 2005 by allowing for a strong corn ethanol mandate, while also phasing in ethanol made from sources other than corn to help assuage the concerns of some U.S. livestock producers. The bill also would create a minimum use requirement for biodiesel made from soybeans and other sources. 
   While I will support the Energy Independence and Security Act, the bill is not perfect. I am concerned that investor-owned utility firms in Missouri and elsewhere may not be able to sufficiently produce electricity from renewable sources within the time mandated by the legislation. I am hopeful that the Energy and Commerce Committee will sit down with investor-owned utility firms to iron out any glitches that may arise in this particular area. 
   Taken as a whole, the Energy Independence and Security Act would be good for rural Missouri and for our country. I will vote for it and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, a bill which we will today consider for the third time on the House floor and which has been revised to address the objections expressed by the President. I strongly believe, Madam Speaker, that this bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation passed by this Congress and I must say one of the very best, if not the best, defense authorization bills that I can recall during my time in Congress. And I am so extremely proud, Madam Speaker, of all the members of the Armed Services Committee as well as all those who have worked hard in and out of our committee to make it happen.     
   A special thanks to our wonderful staff, our crack staff, for the hard work that they have done to get us where we are today, with a bill that will be signed by the President, and the recipients of the benefits of this bill will be those young men and young women in uniform. 
   Last night, we disposed of the President's veto of an earlier version of this bill. That veto was a surprise, frankly, to all of us. Today, we move on. We send a final version to the President that his aides have indicated he will sign. The changes to the conference report, which we passed in the House by a vote of 370-49, and passed the Senate by 90-3, are minimal. Only one section, section 1083, dealing with claims against countries that are or have been state sponsors of terrorism, caused a problem for the administration that led to this veto. 
   This bill before us includes a compromise on that provision we worked out on a bipartisan basis with the body on the other side of the Capitol, as well as with the White House, and it allows the President to waive the application of the section under consideration to the government of Iraq, while also expressing the sense of the Congress that the President should negotiate with the government of Iraq to satisfy the legitimate claims that American citizens have against that country and its former leader, Saddam Hussein. 
   The only other changes made to the bill were those required to make retroactive the pay increases and many benefit improvements provided for the military servicemembers as well as their families. Those provisions will be made effective under this bill as of January 1 of this year, as would have been the case had the President signed the original bill that was before you. 
   This is a good bill. I think it's the best defense bill in decades that this Congress has put forward. It's good for our troops, good for their families, it will help improve the readiness of our Armed Forces, and it will bring significant oversight to the Department of Defense in much needed areas where oversight was so needed in the past. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, if I may, let me add to the comments today the importance of this legislation. Under our Constitution, it is up to the Congress of the United States to raise and maintain the military and provide the rules and regulations therefore. We do that by means of a defense authorization bill that comes from the Armed Services Committee. 
   We worked long and hard, and we were able to pass such a bill from our committee back in May and the Senate passed one back in September. And we, of course, had conference with the Senate, and we were finally able to reach an agreement on a conference report that is a piece of legislation that embodies both the House and the Senate provisions. 
   The people at the White House had the opportunity to look at it and give comments on various sections of the proposed legislation, which they did. We looked at them and worked with them and passed a good piece of legislation. Like I said before, 370 Members of this House and 90 Members of the other body voted for it. However, the President chose to veto over this provision--that to me was a surprise--that it rose to the level of a veto. Nevertheless, it is what happened, and that is why we are here. 
   There seems to be a rather interesting intellectual discussion as to the type of veto. If I remember correctly, the veto message that was read to us yesterday here in this Chamber, the President's remarks made reference to the fact that it was a pocket veto for the reason that we were not in session and also that it was a regular veto. To me it sounded as if there were two vetoes wrapped up in one message. 
   Nevertheless, regarding the issue as to whether it was a pocket veto or not, the 1974 case Kennedy v. Sampson, which was a D.C. Circuit Court case, said that the ability to receive a veto message, which we had, under our adjournment resolution, Madam Speaker, we had language that allowed the Clerk of the House to receive any messages which, of course, on December 28 was the veto message from the President. The Speaker designated the Clerk to receive it. As we saw, it was a regular veto as opposed to a pocket veto. I hope that puts that issue to rest for the days ahead. 
   Let me briefly also mention, Madam Speaker, that besides the pay raise and the family benefits and the fact that we prevent the increase in fees for pharmaceuticals and TRICARE for the troops and their families, we provide for taking care of the problems that were raised in the Walter Reed situation a good number of months ago where our injured and wounded soldiers were not receiving the best care. We knew that and discussed it. As a matter of fact, on this floor, in the Wounded Warriors Act, we included that in toto in this legislation; also, outstanding sections on contract reform regarding the possibility of fraud, the reform of acquisition, we touched on many areas such as that. 
   I was so pleased with the outcome of this, including, of course, most importantly readiness, which we need to keep up, allowing additional troops for the Army and the Marine Corps. 
   I have been on the Armed Services Committee most of my career in Congress, and I just can't think of any more comprehensive and far-reaching authorization bill that we have ever had. I have to really give credit to our committee for the hard work they did. I just can't say enough about our crack staff on the committee. They are just first rate, and we appreciate them, rely on their hard work so very, very much, and I want to again pay tribute to them. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my time. If my friend has some further comments to make, we would appreciate them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak on this very important subject. 
   Mr. Chairman, for too long, Afghanistan has been the forgotten war. Opportunities there have been lost, and progress has been limited. Recently, there has been movement in a more positive direction. 
   Secretary Gates has been focusing more on Afghanistan and NATO-led and U.S. forces achieved some notable successes against the ongoing Taliban insurgency this spring. This, of course, is encouraging. I commend Secretary Gates for his efforts, and, of course, I commend our troops for their tremendous contributions. 
   However, over the same time, violence is on the rise in Afghanistan. Roadside bombs, suicide attacks are increasing, and the number of civilian casualties is, of course, troubling. Opium production is at high levels. The authority of the central government remains, of course, limited. Corruption and poverty still plague the country. These are significant challenges that will not be overcome either easily or quickly. 
   Lasting security in Afghanistan depends on long-term comprehensive efforts that, of course, are well coordinated. It is critical that our NATO partners who are there play a central role in this effort in terms of both troop contributions, as well as aid. 
   Earlier this year, I traveled to Afghanistan with a delegation led by Speaker Pelosi. I came away from that trip convinced that the effort in Afghanistan is winnable, and I am still optimistic. 
   But together with NATO, we must ensure that the Taliban and al Qaeda are destroyed and destroyed for good. Afghanistan will never again become a terrorist harbor as it once was. 
   The House Armed Services Committee, which I am pleased to chair, is committed to doing whatever it can to achieve this goal. Our committee has held comprehensive hearings on Afghanistan this year. 
   Just recently, in the defense bill that we passed, we had provisions regarding Afghanistan. This bill not only provides funds for Afghan national security forces, but it includes a range of provisions that will promote long-term security, as well as robust oversight of American activities in that country. 
   I am pleased to see that the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act builds upon our committee's efforts. This legislation includes many important bipartisan provisions that will further advance long-term security in Afghanistan. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this. We must build on recent gains in that country and seize the moment to establish real security there. 
   I do support this legislation.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, first let me compliment my friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), the chairman of the Appropriations Committee; and the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), for the excellent work that they have done. And we thank our minority for working with us on this bill. 
   The purpose of the Members of Congress front and center is to provide for the common defense of our country. I must tell you how concerned and worried I am about the readiness and state of readiness of the United States Army based upon testimony and briefings that we have had within the Armed Services Committee. 
   Readiness is based upon equipment and based upon people able to do their job as defenders in uniform. This is a serious situation in which we find ourselves. This bill is a major step toward helping our readiness. 
   It is our job not just to appropriate money for today's concerns, whether it be in the Middle East or elsewhere. It is our job to make sure that those in uniform can protect the interests of America in the days and years ahead. 
   In the last 30 years, we have had 12 military conflicts in which our military associates have been involved. What does the future hold? We don't know. But as sure as God made little green apples, there will be threats that we need to deter or challenges that we need to fight in the days and years ahead. We must have a ready force in all services and my deep concern for the United States Army causes that to come into question in our capability. 
   In this we provide money for the real war in Afghanistan, the Strategic Reserve Fund, which supports training, not just operations but repair of equipment, purchase of equipment, and expenses to improve the readiness of the nondeployed military forces. 
   I am deeply concerned about the readiness of our forces in the days and years ahead. This bill will help immeasurably in that first step toward restoring readiness for our United States Army. And this is no small thing. A vote against this is a vote against those uncertainties of the future as well as where we are today involved in conflict. 
   Military health care is very important, and we look at that in this bill solidly. Veterans' health care, military housing allowances. We do so many good things in this bill for our military. 
   Let us not let the readiness of our United States Army suffer as a result of not passing this all-important legislation.

   Bill Hungate was elected to Congress in 1964 and served until my class of 1976 arrived. Undoubtedly one of the most popular Members of this body, warm, jovial, a musician, he always had a good word and a cheery smile. He will be remembered for his work in Congress, but I think remembered most as a warm and decent human being. 
   After leaving Congress he became a Federal judge, and did quite well in that position. Whatever he did, he did well, as well as make friends and did an awful lot for our wonderful State of Missouri.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend originally from Missouri for yielding this time. 
   Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. After a ceremony there, I went into the library, and in the glassed-off section for old and rare books I found a book printed in 1926 about the 1915 British misadventure at Gallipoli, entitled ``The Perils of Amateur Strategy.'' I have often thought regarding the situation in Iraq that we face today that this administration is not giving food for thought to some author to write a book entitled ``The Perils of Amateur Strategy II.'' 
   The issue before us this evening is what would we have done, had we known what we know today. Had that been the case, we probably would never have had a resolution before us, much less voted in favor of it. 
   We have a wonderful military, the finest we have ever had and the finest in modern history. The young men and young women are dedicated, they are professional and they are volunteers, whether they be active duty, whether they be National Guard or Reserve. Gosh, I am proud of them. I have been with them aboard ship; I have been with them in their training. I have been with them in Iraq and Afghanistan and had the privilege of spending Christmas Day with them in Baghdad. But I wonder where all of this ends. 
   They moved the goalposts on us. The first goal was to make sure that weapons of mass destruction were not there, then to establish a democracy, and now to bring stability to Iraq. And those goalposts keep moving. 
   I am truly concerned about where we have been and much more concerned about where we go in Iraq. Whatever happens there, and I feel that there is no positive outcome for this, the star of this show will be the young men and young women who wear the uniform of the United States. History will treat them well and our gratitude should go toward them. 
   There are some mistakes that are made that are irretrievable. There have been such mistakes that we have made in Iraq. The first, of course, was going in with the intelligence that at least was available, not having a plan in use, despite the fact that there was a plan available. Lieutenant General Jay Gardner asked for the people to help draw it up and was finally given one person from the State Department. But the plan was not allowed to be used. 
   Looting was allowed, and then we dismissed those who belonged to the Baathist Party, who made the trains run and the local government run. Some thousands of school teachers were put out of jobs. Then the army was dismissed, rather than giving them a paycheck and a shovel and the opportunity to help bring security and stability to that torn country.  
   The military ammunition, weapons and caches, were not guarded. In September of 2003, JOHN SPRATT, ROBIN HAYES and I were told by David Kay that there were 50-some-odd caches that went unguarded, and the truth in fact is there were many, many more. That is where the insurgents got their weapons and ammunition to use against our young people. 
   We fought the insurgents, the Baathists, criminals, foreigners and al Qaeda helping the insurgency, and then more recently the sectarian violence that overlays all of the insurgency that is going on; and we are there trying to bring stability to that torn land.     
   I am hoping for a positive outcome. It is dark and misty as to where we are going today. I am hoping lightning will strike for the benefit of our young people who are there. 
   It is having serious implications in our readiness which we will explore and talk about and hope to rectify to some extent in the Armed Services Committee. 
   All of these areas, I think, are irretrievable, and I am hopeful that in the days ahead there will be some light at the end of the tunnel in this very sad misadventure in Iraq.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me take this moment to recognize my former colleague, fellow Missourian, and good friend Bill Clay. Today, I join with my colleagues in support of H.R. 5395, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 11001 Dunklin Drive in St. Louis, Missouri, as the ``William `Bill' Clay Post Office 
   Bill was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the very town in which he carried out his storied political career. In 1959, he was elected as a member of the St. Louis Board of Alderman, where he served until 1964, Between 1964 and 1967, Bill worked as a real estate broker and later as a labor coordinator. He also worked for the union of St. Louis city employees and then with a Steamfitters Union. 
   In 1968, Mr. Clay was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and he proudly served the residents of Missouri's First Congressional District for 32 years. Throughout his years in office, Bill became known as a champion of social justice and a true pioneer for civil rights. He was a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and Chairman of the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service. He was always a truly delightful colleague and I am proud to have served with him as a fellow Missouri Congressman. I must also say, Mr. Speaker, that I am also so very honored to serve with Bill's son, LACY, who was elected to represent the First District upon Bill's retirement. 
   Naming a St. Louis post office after Bill Clay is an outstanding way to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant and a true pioneer in American politics. I urge the House to honor Bill for his years of public service and his commitment to his community by supporting H.R. 5395.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me share my support for legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 561 Kingsland Avenue in University City, MO, as the ``Harriett F. Woods Post Office Building.'' Harriet Woods will long be remembered as a pioneer in American politics. 
   Born in Cleveland, OH, Harriet Woods received a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy from the University of Michigan. She married Jim Woods on January 2, 1953. Before beginning her career in politics, Woods worked as a journalist and television producer. 
   Woods' political career began in 1962, when she became a member of the University City Council. In 1976, she was elected to the Missouri State Senate and was re-elected in 1980. Dedicated to women's participation in government, Woods was the first woman to win statewide office in Missouri when she was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1984. While she was not successful in the two Senate races in which she was a candidate, her actions and leadership inspired hundreds of women nationwide to participate in politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I speak today with a heavy heart. I am deeply saddened as I take the floor this afternoon; saddened because we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict in Iraq, a conflict that is involved with insurgents that we failed to acknowledge or recognize, a conflict that is overlaid by sectarian violence between the Shiite Muslims on the one hand and Sunni Muslims on the other. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a great American tragedy. The mission of this Congress is to urge the change of course. 
   We are here today because of a series of irretrievable strategic mistakes. Let's understand the goal of this resolution: number one, to fully extend our support to those in the uniform of the United States. I have been on the Armed Services Committee now throughout the years, and more recently as its chairman, and I cannot tell you how proud I am of those who are in uniform, whether they be deployed in the Middle East or somewhere else in the globe or here in our country. We must let them know, and this resolution does let them know, that we fully support them, as well as their wonderful families. 
   The second part of this resolution deals with the Presidential decision to increase our troops by 21,500. However, it is not clear what support troops are needed. The Pentagon says 2,500 support troops. The Congressional Budget Office says 13,000 minimum. But whatever it is, we find ourselves not seeing a change in strategy, as was promised by the administration and the White House, but just another tactic that had been used before, an increase in troops. No more, no less. We are here to say that is not a good idea. 
   The series of irretrievable mistakes is a serious list: the skewed intelligence we received from the Defense Department Office of Special Plans; the postwar phase of conflict that did not have sufficient planning; not enough troops, as pointed out by General Eric Shinseki, the former Army Chief of Staff; allowing the uncontrolled looting and the breakdown of law early on after the occupation began; the dismissal of the Iraqi Army, rather than giving them a paycheck and a shovel or having them do security work that is important to the stability of that country; the deBathification, that put so many thousands of Iraqis out of business, out of work, including thousands of school teachers. The administration has consistently refused to adjust its overall strategy. 
   I take no pleasure in this, but it is a moment of ``I told you so.'' On September 4, 2002, and again on March 18, 2003, I sent letters to the White House  predicting some of the deadly outcomes we are experiencing today, and I warned against a jagged ending to the conflict. While there is a peacefully elected Iraqi Government, it is a government so divided along sectarian lines it has not been able to accomplish even the most basic steps needed for national reconciliation. And now we have the President's plan for a troop increase, which is a tactic that we do not approve. 
   The President's plan will embroil our troops even more deeply into the sectarian conflict. Put together hastily, it is insufficient as a requirement for success. Forty percent of all of the Army equipment of our country is either in Afghanistan or Iraq. The readiness of our troops is in peril. We are stretching the Army and the Marine Corps to the breaking point. That is where we are, and basically it is because of the conflict in Iraq. 
   Today is an opportunity for us to express our support for the troops and to say it is not a good idea to increase the troop level in Iraq because it has been tried unsuccessfully before.

   The great Chinese strategist and thinker once wrote that war should not be begun unless the end is in sight. Sadly, that admonition of Sun Tzu was not adhered to in this war in Iraq. 
   Let me bring us back to what we are all about today. We have been hearing discussions ranging from both ends of the football field. This is a very simple, straightforward resolution. 
   The first part of it is: We fully support the American troops. And I am going to say, Madam Speaker, we are so proud of them. They are volunteers, they are professionals, they understand the word duty. 
   And, secondly: We do not agree with the troop increase of 21,500, for the simple reason it has not worked in the past, for the simple reason it is going to cause somewhere between 2,500 and 13,000 support troops to support that effort. And, consequently, it is not a well-thought-out tactic. And despite the fact that some wish to call it a strategy, it is a tactic, and there is a large difference between the two. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the Budget Committee, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).

   Madam Speaker, I am very troubled about the course that lies ahead. That is what we are about this evening. We have seen an irretrievable strategic mistake made in Iraq that put us where we are. And consequently it brings us to this point where we express our concern and disagreement with the increase in troops in this crucial time in Iraq and allows us the opportunity to say thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADVANCE U.S. INTERESTS -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a fundamental problem affecting the national security of the United States which has not received the notice and consideration it deserves. 
   The United States suffers from the complete absence of a comprehensive strategy for advancing U.S. interests. This strategic void detracts from almost every policy effort advanced by the United States Government. As a result, major policies are inconsistent and contradictory in different areas of the world and across different policy realms. We find ourselves unable to agree upon and set national priorities for addressing the major challenges of our time. We suffer from a splintering of national power and an inability to coherently address threats and reassure and cooperate with allies. 
   What do I mean by a comprehensive national strategy? The word ``strategy'' has military roots, coming from the Greek word for ``generalship,'' but the concept of a strategy extends well beyond just the military context. In the context of this speech, and others that I intend to deliver on this topic, it means a commonly agreed-upon description of critical U.S. interests and how to advance them using all elements of national power: economic, diplomatic, and military. 
   The next President will have a unique opportunity to develop a successful strategy for the Nation. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower took office, he commissioned the Solarium Project to review strategies for dealing with the Soviet Union. After a competitive process in which three teams of advisers promoted the merits of three strategies, President Eisenhower decided to continue the policy of containment developed by President Truman, and did so with a largely unified administration. 
   Over the course of our history, the U.S. has had numerous successful strategies. During the Cold War, both major political parties supported a strategy of containment for confronting the Soviet Union. During World War II, the United States had a widely-supported strategy of focusing first on the war in Europe and deferring some effort from the war in the Pacific until the Nazi threat was contained. At other times in our Nation's history, we have pursued less successful strategies, such as a strategy of isolationism during the period between World Wars I and II. 
   The next President would be well advised to engage in and personally lead a Solarium-type approach to determining a strategy for today's rapidly changing world. To ensure that a new strategy for America can truly develop support across the political spectrum, Congress should be involved in the process, and to ensure that a new strategy is one that the American people can support, the general outline of the debate should be shared with and involve the American people. 
   This speech is the first in a series. In the future I will discuss the objectives and challenges that a new U.S. strategy will need to contend with; some of the means by which the U.S. will likely need to pursue its objectives and their ramifications for the national security apparatus of the United States Government; and some of the options that a Solarium-type review of a strategy by the next President would need to consider. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in urging the next President to address this problem and join with me in a conversation, both in Congress and with the American people, about what today's strategy should be.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I think this is a very important piece of legislation. 
   Let me take this opportunity to compliment my friend from Hawaii for introducing it and for bringing it to the floor. Mr. Abercrombie is indeed to be commended for this work. 
   What this does is merely closes some loopholes that are presently in the United States law. Defrauding the Federal taxpayer should be a felony, and it is subject to considerable years in prison and a fine up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime. 
   When we're in a war situation, you want people to work hard. We expect a great deal from those in uniform. And we expect those who are supplying and building and reconstructing in the war-torn area to also play by the rules as we demand of those young men and young women in our United States military. 
   So this bill does the right thing. It goes after the war profiteering, that is the overcharging in order to defraud or profit excessively from the war. And this bill also confers jurisdiction within the Federal courts to hear and try such cases. It's the right thing. It's the right action for us to take in this Congress. 
   I, again, compliment the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), and I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for giving me the opportunity to express my condolences to the Jo Ann Davis family, her husband and two sons. 
   It's always difficult to say good-bye to a friend. And Jo Ann Davis was my friend. She was my colleague. We served together on the Armed Services Committee since she came to Congress. She represented the First District of Virginia, which had and has a strong military tradition. She was preceded in this Congress by my friend through the years Herb Bateman. 
   She was a strong advocate for the men and women in uniform, and she will be sorely missed in supporting them as the days lie ahead. Shipbuilding was the centerpiece of her work because of the district she represented, and she understood and advocated the importance of shipbuilding for the United States Navy. She was a member, actually a subcommittee ranking member, on the Readiness Subcommittee.     
   And it is interesting that we should, this evening, point out that she fought a disease with grace and dignity, and that this is the Breast Cancer Awareness month, that I think we should make note of. 
   She fought a tremendous fight. She came back when she could, and our heart was with her. She fought the good fight. But in looking back at my friend, Jo Ann Davis, I remember her most for her sense of humor, how we would joke with one another and how absolutely pleasant she was. Those are attributes that people remember just as much as they remember the good work that she did as a Member of this body. So I thank the gentleman from Virginia for allowing me to say a word or two about my friend, Jo Ann Davis.

   But one of the most memorable aspects of this was the commissioning of 10 of the junior college graduates to receive their second lieutenancy in the United States Army Reserve. After two more years of college, they will be able to go into the active duty of our country or be full-time active members of the National Guard or Reserve. 
   What I speak about today very briefly is, of the 10, half of those newly commissioned second lieutenants at Wentworth Military Academy were from American Samoa, outstanding students, good soldiers, fine young Americans. I think that it should be brought to this body's attention that they are doing their best and their part in the national security of our Nation, and I must say I'm very proud of them.

   Mr. SKELTON. I certainly thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration for a remarkable Missourian that I support this concurrent resolution. This measure was introduced by Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, which honors the life of my late friend, Margaret Truman Daniel. 
   Margaret was a loving daughter, wife, mother, an accomplished vocalist, journalist and author. She was filled with the unique Truman spirit, and personified the plainspoken, no-nonsense nature of so many Show-Me-State residents. The qualities that defined Margaret as a person were instilled by her parents, President Harry S Truman and his wife, Bess. Throughout her life, Harry and Bess provided a steady hand and unfailing support and  love which allowed Margaret to flourish 
   But Missouri itself played a meaningful role in Margaret's life. She was always a proud Missourian. On one occasion, she returned to Independence and spoke about Missouri's influence on her. She stated, ``Even till today, I feel it in my bones. Although I have now spent much more of my life in Washington and New York than in Missouri, it is Missouri that has molded my character, my conduct, my sentiments, and yes, my prejudices; Missouri and its people, its customs, its attitudes, and its habits. These are ingrained in me.'' She added, speaking of her many Missourian artifacts and pictures in her home, ``So you see that on every hand I'm reminded of my Missouri, Jackson County, Independence heritage. I couldn't forget it even if I wanted to.'' 
   Through the years, I had the great pleasure of working with Margaret on several occasions that honored her father's life. Her efforts gave added meaning to President Truman's legacy. Margaret was gracious, intelligent, wise, witty, and spirited. Truly her father's daughter. I was pleased that our paths crossed, as they did, during her lifetime. 
   She will long be remembered as an inspiration to those who knew her and to all Missourians. I was honored to call Margaret Truman Daniel my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman. 
   I thank Majority Leader Hoyer and Minority Leader BOEHNER for crafting this elegant, bipartisan resolution today, solemnly marking the tremendous tragedy of 9/11 and honoring the thousands of Americans who have worked since to recover and stop a similar event from happening again. 
   And although the aftermath of the9/11 attacks will resonate for generations, the terrorists' cold-blooded violence will never break the American spirit, alter our values, or shake our resolve. 
   The job of protecting the American people is a perpetual responsibility. We are blessed with dedicated men and women in uniform and civilian roles who serve our Nation with honor here at home as well as abroad. 
   As we remember the fallen today, all of us must renew our commitment to do all that is necessary to protect our families, our communities, and our Nation. 
   I cannot say enough in recognition of the incredible sacrifices being made by military families around the world. Time and again, we grow concerned that the burden for them will be too great, and yet they've continued to amaze us with their dedication to country and devotion to service, not to mention their unsurpassed skill. 
   I still worry that we have asked too much of these few Americans and too little of the rest of us. But I cannot be prouder of those in uniform and their families. 
   Seven years ago, al Qaeda terrorists intent on destroying symbols of American power ruthlessly killed thousands of innocent people. The genesis of the9/11 attacks emerged from al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan. I remain deeply concerned that the United States has not given the war in Afghanistan the priority it deserves. That concern was only reinforced yesterday by the testimony of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the House Armed Services Committee. Admiral Mullen testified that the United States is not yet winning in Afghanistan. This is unacceptable, particularly when military and intelligence officials predict that this volatile region is the most likely source of a future attack against our country. 
   On this day of memory for loss and sacrifice, my resolve to do my part in performing Congress' unique and necessary role in preventing a recurrence of such attack only grows stronger.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, article 1, section 8, of the Constitution grants Congress the responsibility of raising and maintaining the military of our country. Our Founding Fathers were wise to put this power in the hands of Congress, the branch of our national government most closely connected to the American people. As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, I take seriously Congress' role with respect to national security policy. In a series of recent committee hearings designed to study the need for a new comprehensive strategy for advancing American interests, it was evident that America must use all elements of national power--military, diplomatic, and economic--to remain the indispensable nation, acting as a consistent and ever-present global force. 
   If our economy were to falter, it would undercut America's global military and diplomatic strength. And it would be far more difficult for Congress, working with the President, to properly address our international challenges. It is through the lens of national security that I have examined the economic rescue bill before the Congress today. 
   The economic crisis is real. Cash flow in the market has slowed, and some of America's top financial firms have failed. If action is not taken immediately, experts warn that the average American, including those in rural Missouri, will find it difficult or impossible to obtain credit for a mortgage, a car loan, a farm loan, a college loan or a small business loan, bringing economic activity to a standstill. 
   At the request of the President of the United States, Congress has worked over the last week to build consensus around a bipartisan plan to stabilize the financial markets. Luckily, the bill being considered today bears little resemblance to the $700 billion blank check that the President initially requested back on September 20. That approach was totally unacceptable. So Congress improved it in a way that better protects the American taxpayers. 
   Like many of the Fourth District residents from whom I have heard in the last week, I am angry that we find ourselves considering an economic rescue bill. But as I have studied the specifics of the crisis, I am convinced the consequences of inaction would be dire for America's economic and national security and for our country's overall standing in the world community. 
   While I support this particular bill, I urge Congress to continue studying the economic turmoil we are facing and to consider additional legislative solutions to it. We must get to the bottom of what caused this crisis so that it does not happen again. 
   Madam Speaker, I intend to vote in favor of this bill.

   Here are some pertinent facts: 
   Native of Blue Springs, Missouri; 
   While attending Blue Springs High School performed in The Music Man, West Side Story, and Singin' in the Rain; 
   Cook formed the band, Axium, his junior year of high school, for which he was the lead singer and guitarist. In 2004, Axium, was chosen the best band in Kansas City and was  recognized nationally as one of the top 15 independent bands; 
   He was a 2006 graduate of the University of Central Missouri with a degree in graphic design; 
   Upon completion of college, he released his first solo independent album, Analog Heart, which was chosen the fourth-best CD released in 2006; 
   It is worth noting that David Cook did not originally plan to audition for American Idol; he traveled to Omaha, Nebraska to support his younger brother Andrew; 
   Cook was often seen playing his electric guitar while performing on American Idol; 
   He received 56 percent of the vote; 97 million votes were cast.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, I reserve the right to object, and I will not object. 
   Madam Chairman, I think we should point out the fact that the base bill to which you just referred voids an executive order where the President said that any language in a project, in a program, report language, could not be put into force and effect and that it had to be in bill language. It sounds good, but in truth, in fact, what happens if that is the case, whatever is in bill language on a program or project, whatever the case may be, may not be reprogrammed. You're stuck with it. 
   For instance, I signed, together with my friend Duncan Hunter, a reprogramming on Future Combat Systems within the last 3 or 4 weeks for well over $100 million, and it should have been. We did the right thing. And if the executive order were in full force and effect and if that had been in report language, it would all have been for naught and Mr. Hunter and I could not have agreed to that very, very important reprogramming which should have been done. 
   So you're throwing the cat out with the kittle. 
   Madam Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of objection. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona?

   Mr. SKELTON. I think back lo those many years ago to a time when I was prosecuting attorney of Lafayette County and had the opportunity to witness our sheriff, deputy sheriff or Missouri Highway Patrol interrogating people who were suspects of various  different offenses, and I shudder to think what if we had contracted that out to someone who had not been fully trained on the one hand and who did not understand the law or the rules and regulations under which interrogations must be conducted. 
   Fast forward to today and the interrogation of detainees. I think a governmental function that is as important as interrogating detainees should be a function of the government.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Let's really look at what we are talking about. It is important to note that the amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to classify videotapes. Under the existing rules--by the way, there are three theater internment facilities in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Under those rules, one can only be held 14 days. But any interrogation between the time of capture and the time a person is entered in the theater internment facility does not have to be videotaped. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for debate has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. SKELTON. Let me say at the outset that it's important that this school continue to succeed. It does yeoman's work, not just in educating, but in building fences between our country and those in Latin America. The military culture reigns, as it should, and friendships are formed through the years. 
   And I think that transparency as to who goes, who graduates, and the fact that names and pictures are put in the advertising brochures lets everyone know that this is not such a secret thing. 
   Openness is important. The Defense Department, up until 2005, released the names of instructors to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. I think, in order for this school to be fully transparent and successful, it should allow the names to be made public.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, I was sorely distressed when I learned of the fact that there were a good number of former military officers that were given special access, many of whom had conflicts of interest in various defense businesses, and they were considered military television analysts. 
   You see, people in the military are trusted by Americans. People who are retired military are trusted by Americans. And what's interesting is that this special group had special access to information in the Pentagon and obviously used that in their analysis when talking of the Middle East on television. And what's really interesting is the fact that their special access was canceled.

   Mr. SKELTON. Gathering information, Madam Chairman, on Iraq's nuclear program is an important priority for our Congress. The November, 2007, National Intelligence Estimate provided the needed reappraisal of Iran's nuclear intentions and capabilities. This amendment is sure that that assessment process continues. 
   Given the differing conclusions between the then-NIE and its predecessor and their analysis of the status of Iran's nuclear program, it's appropriate that we continue to receive reports. This amendment details specific information necessary for congressional oversight, which we have been stressing in our committee all year long. This amendment replaces and improves on the text of our committee, which was of course approved on a bipartisan basis in our committee markup last week. This amendment appropriately identifies the Director of National Intelligence as the official to provide that assessment. 
   I think it's an excellent amendment. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for clarifying the text and replacing it with this amendment.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, it's very difficult for me to understand or believe that a motion on the bill named in honor of our good friend and colleague, Duncan Hunter, is being sent back with the word ``promptly'' when everyone knows that under rule XXI, clause 2 of our House rules, a motion to recommit using the word ``promptly'' with instructions sends the bill back to committee and kills it. 
   Mr. Boehner just spoke a moment ago about this being the last time this bill would be considered. I trust he would vote against this motion to recommit. Because if this motion prevails, along with it goes a pay raise, health benefits, so many good things for those wonderful troops that we support. 
   The committee would be forced to take it up, and it would come back and then be subject to a point of order because it violates the PAYGO rules. I'm surprised and shocked and saddened at this because, Mr. Speaker, there has  never been, in the history of this body, a motion to recommit using the word ``promptly,'' which would have the effect of killing the bill. 
   I recognize my friend from Texas.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that deals with a very difficult situation that has arisen in recent years: the cooperation, or I should say, the lack of cooperation between various departments of our government that relate to national security. This in particular, however, deals with just the Defense Department and the State Department. We had a historic hearing in our committee touching on this subject with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State testifying side by side. 
   This amendment provides both the Congress and the executive branch with specific recommendations by a specified panel to key issues based on practical experience. It will also serve as a useful tool to guide future congressional efforts in this area and demonstrate congressional commitment to long-term solutions and cooperation. 
   I wish to compliment my friend and colleague from California for his assistance on this as well, Mr. Berman, and I might say this also is a bipartisan amendment. Several people, the gentleman on the Armed Services Committee on the other side of the aisle, are strongly in favor of it, as well as on the Democratic side. 
   I also wish to thank, besides Mr. Berman, Nita Lowey for her cosponsorship of this particular amendment.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, let me take this opportunity to say a special thanks to those who worked so hard and so long on this issue. Number one is recognizing the problem, number two is doing something about it. 
   Now, it really crosses more than two departmental lines or two committee lines, the Defense and the Foreign Affairs. This is a major step in the right direction, and Congress is doing something about it. 
   Let me say special thanks, first, to our ranking member, Mr. Hunter, to Dr. SNYDER, Mrs. DAVIS of California, Mr. Thornberry of Texas, Mr. Murtha, of course cosponsor Mr. Berman, cosponsor Mrs. LOWEY, Mr. Cooper, who chaired the panel on Roles and Missions, Mr. Schiff, Mr. Langevin and Mr. GEOFF DAVIS.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. 
   Back in law school when you had a question, the instructor would say, ``Read it. What does it say?'' And this amendment says that $163 million is attained from a military personnel account and from the health care account for our troops. That's what it says. 
   Let's be clear. The personnel account deals with pay and benefits and the health care for our military community. Cutting that is not acceptable. 
   Let me explain. The subcommittee system in the Armed Services Committee does a good job. This particular program, the Future Combat System, was scrubbed. As a matter of fact, some items in it were plussed up by several millions of dollars. Nothing well beyond 2015 was touched. It has come in at an estimate of nearly actually twice what the original estimate was. 
   I just think it's wrong to take this money or attempt to take this money from these accounts which take care of our troops. We are doing our best to increase the readiness of our troops, and readiness also touches families, families' attitude whether someone will re-enlist and keep the skills in uniform or whether they will go home and not remain part of our military. 
   Consequently, I think this is just a wrong amendment and I do oppose it.

   In doing so, I want to reflect on the work that the subcommittees do in the Armed Services Committee. The gentlelady from California (Mrs. Tauscher) chairs the subcommittee that deals with this subject matter that Mr. Franks seeks to amend. Hearings, witnesses, briefings discussions, markups, all of that goes into the work product that this gentlelady's subcommittee did. And for us to second-guess on anything of this magnitude or on any subject that has been studied as thoroughly as this one has, and I compliment all the members of that subcommittee on the work that they did. 
   I think it would be improper to do so, and I do oppose this amendment.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also wish to compliment him on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, there was a lot of hard work that went into this, and what it would do is add the Clean Contracting Act of 2008 to national security and defense. It compiles provisions that have already passed the House or would extend acquisition reforms passed for the Department of Defense in prior authorization bills in identical form. It also adds a couple of new measures. 
   This Waxman amendment complements last year's bill in which we extended several of the reforms beyond the Department of Defense, and it also included several bills that have already passed, such as the Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act offered by Representative Maloney, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act offered by Mr. Welch, and the Government Contractor Accountability Act offered by Mr. Chris Murphy. 
   There's a lot of hard work that goes into this. And we are always going to have difficulties in the acquisition process and the contracting process. But this is a major step in that direction, and I favor it.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, this is really a reflection of constitutionality. This refers to any agreement that requires the United States to take action on behalf of an ally in the face of an attack. This is one that is an agreement that is a security agreement, and it requires either a treaty ratified by the United States Senate or a provision passed by the entire Congress of the United States. 
   It's unclear, for instance, that if the Iraqis could repel any external invasion or address a serious internal threat without America that the United States could avoid being involved against its will in such a situation. Quite honestly, it is a requirement that the Constitution be followed. A security agreement, by the way, is different from a Status of Forces Agreement. I favor the amendment.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, this is first-year law school discussion. If you read the amendment offered by the gentlelady, it makes reference to 1212(a)(1)(a)(4). It applies only to this. I read that section: ``Any security agreement, arrangement, or assurance that obligates the United States to respond to internal or external threats against Iraq.'' That doesn't say a thing, not a blooming thing about Status of Forces Agreement. So that is what we are talking about. That is why a treaty is required or a consent of Congress.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I go back to the basics, and that is, read the amendment before you. This amendment asks that the Secretaries jointly establish and operate a temporary program to offer employment as translators, interpreters, et cetera. This is not a mandate in the words at all that are before us. Under this amendment, these Iraqis must have assisted our country in Iraq for at least a year and be here in the United States legally. 
   As a practical matter, these are the Iraqis who have been brought to our country under the legislation offered by my good friend Duncan Hunter that was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2 years ago, which is good language. We are also not talking about a large number of people. We are talking about 760 people who have been brought to the United States. 
   I think we can do something for them. I think a careful reading of the amendment will solve a lot of discussion today. Mr. Israel is right.

But it is important for us to turn the reins, give the baton over to the Iraqi forces, to the Iraqi Government. We cannot hold their hand there forever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and a very valuable senior member of our committee, the Armed Services Committee. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2082. This bill makes us safer from terrorists and other adversaries in a number of ways: the bill makes critical investments in human intelligence, counter-terrorism operations, counter-proliferation, counter-intelligence, analysis and language skills. 
   In addition, Chairman Reyes' conference report includes a provision which requires that all interrogations conducted by intelligence agents and contractors comply with the Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Our military already has raised its standards. 
   Since September 2006, all interrogations which are conducted by the men and women in uniform are conducted by non-military personnel on a detainee who is otherwise in custody of the U.S. military and must provide and must abide by the Army Field Manual. The manual specifically prohibits eight interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. Waterboarding is the technique which originated during the Spanish Inquisition and makes the person who is being interrogated feel as though he is drowning. 
   One of the wisest of our Founding Fathers, Ben Franklin, once told us: ``Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' But that's where we find ourselves on this issue. 
   All of the very senior civilians in the administration continue to waffle on whether waterboarding continues and constitutes torture or cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment. Our military has stood up against this widely condemned practice. Our military understands the impact of the Golden Rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
   Our military also appreciates that approved interrogation techniques that are not cruel and inhumane or degrading have provided valuable intelligence which has helped captured terrorist kingpins and foiled terrorist attacks against our country as well as our allies. The sooner that we reclaim our moral authority in the world by clearly articulating which techniques we find to be abhorrent, regardless of the nationality of the interrogator, the sooner we can better protect our homeland and our folks in uniform who are in harm's way. 
   I strongly encourage all of my colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle to strengthen our national security by supporting this very fine bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, farmers in Missouri and throughout the Midwest depend upon our rivers for the transportation of agricultural goods and other products important to their businesses. Rivers afford producers greater market access, so it is essential that our river transportation system runs smoothly and efficiently. 
   Earlier this year, the House and Senate approved the Water Resources Development Act, a bipartisan bill to authorize funding for America's navigation, flood control, and environmental restoration projects. Important for Missouri's agricultural community, this long-overdue measure would modernize outdated locks and dams along the Mississippi River in order to facilitate the movement of commodities to the domestic and global marketplace. 
   On Friday, the President vetoed the Water Resources Development Act. I was extremely disappointed that the President chose to veto this bill, which is an investment in rural Missouri and in the sound water infrastructure of our entire country. 
   On behalf of the Show-Me State farmers I am privileged to represent, I am pleased to cast my vote in support of overriding the President's veto. I am hopeful it will garner the necessary two-thirds vote and that the Other Body will act swiftly so that Congress will enact; the water infrastructure bill despite the President's objections to it.

   Mr. SKELTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3159, introduced by my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, Ellen Tauscher, the gentlelady from California, as well as other Members of the House. 
   Our troops and their families are stressed and they are under pressure. Yesterday, the USA Today newspaper had an article entitled, ``Stress of War Hits Army Kids Hard.'' The article, sadly, was about the increasing number of child abuse and neglect cases among deployed Army families. The article quotes Amy Lambert, an Army wife living at Fort Stewart, Georgia. She states, ``I firmly believe that more time at home between deployments would be the most beneficial solution.'' I think that quote sums up the reason we're here and why this bill is before the House. 
   Our troops and their families are tired. They are being stressed by the continued and extended deployments. It's time that Congress takes a stand on behalf of our families and states in a clear, unequivocal voice that it is time that servicemembers have a minimum dwell time between deployments. 
   This bill would require that active component units and members be provided at least the same time at home as they are deployed. It would also require that Reserve and National Guardsmen who are called to deploy are given at least three times at home as they are deployed. 
   This proposed minimum period of deployment is less than the Department's own goal, which provides that active duty servicemembers should be deployed for 1 year, with 2 years back in home station, and Reservists and Guardsmen should have 5 years between deployments. 
   The Army recently implemented a policy that requires active duty units to deploy for 15 months and only spend 12 months back at their home station. This is a troubling sign, Mr. Speaker, since the time back at home station is used to reset, retrain and re-equip forces. 
   Servicemembers and their families are entitled to a predictable and stable time between deployments. Congress needs to step up on behalf of the troops, as well as their families, and say enough is enough. 
   We need to hold the Department accountable to their own policies and protect the readiness of our forces. That's no small thing. We have a moral responsibility to our troops to ensure  that their quality of life is reflective of the sacrifices that we ask them to make. 
   We need to ensure that our active forces have at least the same amount of time deployed that they have back home with their families, and that our citizen-soldiers have at least three times the amount home as that time deployed. 
   This bill is also about our national security and its readiness, and it's about strategic risk. This bill will help to ensure that our military can deal not only with Iraq, where they have been serving remarkably under extraordinarily difficult conditions for 4 years, but wherever the next conflict occurs, our force must have adequate time to train if it is to be prepared. 
   And in this exceptional all-volunteer force, we must keep our retention levels up if we are to insure that our military will be able to succeed both now and in the next fight, which, of course, is very unpredictable. 
   H.R. 3159 is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to stand with us in support of our troops and in support of our families. 
   Before I reserve the balance of my time, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Tauscher) control the time on my behalf.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to recommit offered by my friend, my colleague from California who has served with me through the years on the Armed Services Committee. 
   The ground forces of the United States in particular are being stretched and strained as never before. For instance, during the Second World War, those that were involved with active combat after 3 or 4 months at the most would be taken off line for rest and recoupment. The young men and young women today that are in Iraq are on point in combat and now are extended up to 15 months. I think this bill helps alleviate that point and helps keep the readiness at a higher level. 
   The stretching and straining of the ground forces, in particular the Army, will have a breaking point. We already know about the equipment shortage of nondeployed units. Why stretch these young people? Why not bring them home? This is a reasonable proposal, reasonable, and should be enacted into law. And, as the gentlelady from California points out, should there be any problem with any unit, there are waivers provided for in this legislation. 
   This is simple and straightforward. It is about protecting our military readiness, it is protecting the health of the troops and, by the way, helping those families recoup with their loved ones as they come back home with predictability, knowing when they will be home and knowing when they will be due to be deployed once again. 
   So I find myself having to vote against this motion to recommit for all those reasons: the families, the troops, and the need for predictability; and I compliment the gentlelady on this proposal to bring about predictability for our troops.

   History has well documented that President Truman was a man of great principle and courage. He was by all accounts a man that did not shrink from responsibility even when the decisions were very difficult. The employment of atomic weapons at the end of World War II, the Berlin airlift at the beginning of the cold war, and the Korean war are but few examples of his leadership during crisis. 
   However, I believe it is his decision to declare that each person in the military is deserving of equal treatment and opportunity, regardless of race, color, religion, and national origin that most reflects his personal commitment to his core beliefs. 
   His July 26, 1948 Executive order was no weak-kneed statement designed to fit the political expediency of the era. Executive Order 9981 was a bold statement that reflected his heartfelt commitment to the civil rights of all Americans and the American style of freedom that became a beacon of hope for so many people throughout the world during World War II. This powerful statement of equality in treatment and opportunity reflects the highest standards of democracy and lived up to the American spirit that we all cherish. 
   President Truman saw much in the professional and heroic performance of African Americans during World War II that demanded he issue his Executive order. The exploits of African Americans that carried out the Red Ball Express, flew with the 99th fighter squadron, and served as Tuskegee Airmen are legendary. There were also stories of the many individual heroes during World War II like the seven African Americans who were finally awarded the Medal of Honor for their long-overlooked World War II heroism in 1997. Like all the other wars that preceded World War II, African Americans had played an important role during war and Harry Truman was determined to set the record straight. 
   The 60th anniversary of President Truman's Executive order to begin the integration of the Armed Forces is a pivotal event in United States history that is deserving of a ceremony in the rotunda of the Capitol. I thank Chairman Brady and the staff of the House Administration Committee for helping to move this resolution so expeditiously and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 377.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, over the past months, economic conditions in our country have soured. Particularly troublesome to our Nation's economic engine are skyrocketing home foreclosures and loan delinquency rates, which have risen over 85 percent in the past year. 
   Foreclosures and delinquencies are harmful to borrowers and lenders, but they also stifle economic growth, shake consumer confidence, and lower home values for those who live near foreclosed properties. 
   While borrowers in our country must certainly bear a great deal of responsibility when it comes to financial planning, the government can and must carefully examine the impact of soaring mortgage foreclosures on the whole U.S. economy and also thoroughly review regulatory oversight with respect to the mortgage business. 
   I have been pleased that the House has been active in addressing the mortgage crisis, voting last year to strengthen consumer protections against risky loans and to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae, among other things. Under the leadership of Financial Services Committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK, the House is again poised to pass critical, market-driven housing legislation designed to reduce foreclosures, to help families avoid foreclosure in the future, and to alleviate the negative impacts of foreclosures on property values and the national economy. 
   I am pleased to support this legislation, which would create a new voluntary program within FHA that would offer lenders an alternative to foreclosure. This approach, which is driven by the lenders' desire to save costs associated with foreclosing on property, forces the lender, the borrower, and the government to all make sacrifices to ensure families have the ability to stay in their homes. While some have criticized this initiative as a government bailout of those who have made poor financial choices, in my view, it represents an innovative, market-driven way to shore up the housing market and the overall economy. 
   The measure would also create a $7,500 tax incentive for first time home buyers and other important tax incentives while simultaneously modernizing the FHA, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae and increasing the loan limit for FHA and Veterans' Administration loans. 
   I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly on this well written bill and that it will be signed into law by the President.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding and giving me this opportunity. 
   It goes without saying that the United States Postal Service has an historic reputation for excellence and unyielding dedication to the people of our Nation. ``Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these carriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds'' are the words engraved on the outside of the James A. Farley Post Office Building in New York City. Every day, thousands of postal employees proudly wear the uniform of the United States Postal Service with the understanding of the enormity of this commitment. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, I stand before the House in support of H.R. 4166, a bill I introduced to pay tribute to the life of one of those public servants, Mr. Steven W. Allee of Stoutland, Missouri, and a rural mail carrier for the citizens of Lebanon, Missouri. 
   Since 1989, Mr. Steve Allee held a full-time position as a rural carrier at the Lebanon, Missouri, Post Office. He was a dedicated employee, a loving family man to his wife Debbie, his children and his grandchildren, a member of the Buffalo Prairie Baptist Church, and a friend to many. 
   Tragically, Madam Speaker, on August 20, 2007, Mr. Allee was killed in the line of duty when his vehicle was swept away by floodwaters in rural Lebanon. This flash flood was unprecedented in its magnitude. As Mr. Allee completed his route, he approached a country bridge under which a typically dry creekbed usually lies. However, on this day, the rapidly falling rainwater had overtaken the bridge. When Mr. Allee attempted to cross, his vehicle was swept away. 
   Today, I urge the House of Representatives to honor this man for his public service and his commitment to his community. Let us pay our respects to his personal and postal family by designating the facility, the United States Postal Service located at 701 East Copeland Drive in Lebanon, Missouri, as the Steve W. Allee Carrier Annex.

   Mr. SKELTON. I am somewhat disturbed, Mr. Speaker, procedurally on something this important not being shown to anyone on this side until moments ago and it takes a speed reader to go over the amendment and digest it. 
   We are going to accept this amendment. In truth, in fact, the committee, the Armed Services Committee, fully funded, and I will say it again, fully funded the administration's request for Israeli missile defenses. The committee strongly supports efforts to work with Israel on missile defense. This has been true for years. The bill fully funds the President's request of $73.5 million for the Arrow missile defense system. It fully funds the President's request of $7 million for the joint U.S.-Israeli ``David's Sling'' short-range ballistic missile.     
   The committee also supports Israel's effort to obtain information on the THAAD system, which is being held up by the Pentagon. 
   It's interesting to point out that Representative Terry Everett and I wrote a letter on March 12 of this year to the Secretary of Defense asking that he work to release the THAAD information to Israel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank my friend from Wisconsin. 
   Mr. Speaker, it really depends on where you put the spotlight. The spotlight has, unfortunately, been on some goals or a goal to redeploy troops, when truth in fact the spotlight of this legislation should have been and should be on the readiness of the troops of the United States. I am truly concerned about the readiness, let me tell you. 
   In the last 30 years, there have been 12 military contingencies in which the United States military has been involved. If this means anything in the future, sure as God made little green apples, we are going to have conflicts or concern, we hope none, but in the future. 
   Readiness is a major part of it. The testimony is that a large, large percentage of our equipment, Active Duty, National Guard and Reserve for the Army, is in the Middle East. It's not here; it's not available for training. What is over there, of course, because of the sand, the conditions and the usage, is getting worn. 
   I truly worry about the training and the equipment for our Army and for our Marines in particular, because we don't know what the future holds. That is where the spotlight ought to be on this legislation, the positive aspects of it in preparing the readiness for tomorrow as well as for the readiness of today for the groups that are going over time after time, whether it be for 12 or for 15 months. 
   My hats off to those young people in uniform. It's our job to maintain them and take care of them. This bill would have done that.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of the 109th Congress, Republicans adjourned for the year without completing work on 9 of the 11 budget bills that fund the operations of the federal government. Completion of the federal government's annual budget is one of Congress' most critical tasks, but even though several months have gone by since the beginning of the fiscal year, only 2 of the 11 bills for fiscal year 2007--Defense and Homeland Security Appropriations--have been signed into law. 
   This failure to complete Congress' most basic task--to pay the country's bills--has left newly elected leaders of the House and the Senate with no choice but to make tough choices with regard to the fiscal year 2007 budget. 
   Since October 2006, the federal government has been operating on the basis of a temporary measure known as a continuing resolution. This resolution is set to expire on February 15, 2007, and unless Congress approves funding for federal programs covering Agriculture; Commerce, Justice, and Science; Energy and Water; Foreign Operations; Interior and the Environment; Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education; Legislative Branch; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; and Transportation, Treasury, and Housing, federal government operations in these areas will cease. 
   Over the past weeks, House leaders have been writing legislation that would ensure the federal government remains operational through fiscal year 2007. Today, the House is considering H.J. Res. 20, a joint resolution that will keep the federal government open and require most federal programs to operate under tight budget constraints. While modest increases were allotted to some of America's high priority items, such as veterans' and military health care, law enforcement, and education, the bill cuts over 60 federal programs and rescinds unobligated balances on many other programs to pay for them. Further, the bill explicitly eliminates special funding provisions, commonly referred to as ``earmarks.'' 
   H.J. Res. 20 is not a perfect bill, and I am concerned about how it might impact some federal programs that are important to Missouri residents. Despite my concerns, I have concluded that it is in our nation's best interest to quickly approve this appropriations package and focus our attention toward the President's fiscal year 2008 budget and the President's anticipated supplemental appropriations request for military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I commend Congressman OBEY for drafting such complex legislation that makes the best of a bad situation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (U.S. MILITARY READINESS HANGS BY A THREAD -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, in matters of national security, experienced leaders never forget that the unexpected is always just around the corner and that danger is never far away. The Roman orator Cicero immortalized these ideas in his story about the Sword of Damocles. 
   Damocles, a citizen of the ancient Greek city of Syracuse, wanted to be king for a day. The king agreed to this request, and Damocles feasted and reveled with wine and fine meals. Only after his merrymaking did Damocles discover that a razor-sharp sword, suspended by a single thread, hung over his head all day. Damocles was immediately cured of his desire to rule. 
   When I consider the challenges confronting the U.S. national security today, I see not one but two swords of Damocles dangling above us. The first danger concerns the strain current operations place on U.S. military readiness, and the second concerns the deterioration of security and stability in Afghanistan. 
   Military readiness ratings measure how prepared U.S. forces are to perform their assigned combat missions. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, more than 6 years of war have resulted in serious readiness shortfalls, with our Army and Marine Corps ground forces experiencing the most acute problems. In spite of efforts to fill the gaps in equipment, training and personnel, readiness deficiencies serious enough to cause alarm last year have only continued to expand. 
   Today, two-thirds of the Army's combat brigades in the United States are not ready for duty. Units in the U.S. are suffering from shortages of personnel, and units are preparing for deployment without having all of their assigned personnel or equipment during training. To fill shortfalls in Army personnel, the Navy and Air Force are supplying over 20,000 troops to conduct ground force tasks such as convoy security and logistics support. 
   While U.S. military forces are getting by, painfully, and performing today's missions despite readiness shortfalls, we are simply not prepared for the emergence of a new conflict. Experience tells me that we cannot assume another crisis won't come our way. In my 31 years in Congress, the U.S. has been involved in 12 significant military conflicts, none of which were predicted beforehand. Because we can't know with complete certainty what dangers lurk around the corner or when they might strike, we need the insurance policy military readiness provides for America's security. 
   Our current readiness situation demands a massive investment in time, effort and money to restore our full capability. Of course, devoting the resources required to solve our readiness problems will force us to make painful tradeoffs with some elements of modernization, which is tomorrow's readiness. But with current readiness levels, this is a predicament our Nation cannot avoid. It is simply a cost we must bear. 
   The second danger I worry about is the deterioration of security and stability in Afghanistan. For too long, the war in Iraq has overshadowed the real war against terrorism in Afghanistan. While the military effort there is actually a qualified success, the political effort at this point is not, and the benefits of economic progress are far too uneven. Too many Afghan citizens do not yet see tangible improvements in their daily lives. The effort in Afghanistan is not really reconstruction, but the creation of a stable, secure, and unified nation which has never existed. 
   The recent decision to send an additional 3,200 marines to Afghanistan is a necessary and positive step in the right direction, but that alone will not be sufficient. This undertaking is gargantuan and requires a far more significant effort than the United States or our allies have been willing to commit. History will judge us very harshly if our focus and effort in Afghanistan is insufficient to the task. A failure of the mission there would not only damage our security, it would also seriously damage NATO. 
   So how do we deal with these twin challenges? To start, we must focus our Nation's strategic priorities to find the right balance between the near-term needs and the long-term health of our military. We must address the imbalance in our deployment and use of troops overseas, because our readiness problems cannot be resolved as long as we continue to deploy in excess of 100,000 troops in Iraq. A responsible redeployment of a large percentage of that force is a strategic necessity. 
   In addition, we must do first things first by focusing on Afghanistan, just as in World War II we focused more of our resources on Germany and the war in Europe until that war was won. Finally, we must substantially increase the use of our soft power, our diplomatic, economic development, and strategic communications efforts in Afghanistan and around the world.  
   We can and should receive much more help from our allies. Together, the U.S. and the international community must make the war in Afghanistan a top priority and provide the leadership, strategy, and resources necessary to ensure that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are destroyed for good and that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe harbor for terrorists. 
   To his great credit, Secretary of Defense Gates has been arguing for several of these solutions. The truth is, though, that the U.S. has as much or more to lose in Afghanistan as any other nation, and the same would be true of whatever new conflicts emerge. Until our country is prepared to lead and act decisively, these problems will fester, and the threads holding up those twin swords will stretch ever thinner.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As my friend, Mr. Hunter, the gentleman from California knows, both the House version of the Defense Authorization Act and the Senate version authorized supplemental funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I say ``authorized.'' 
   The Armed Services Committee has collectively supported authorizing this funding to ensure the continued relevance of the committee and to make sure that the specific purposes for which the President has requested funds are actually related to the wars. 
   In both the House and Senate versions of the bill, we have authorized this funding in a way that provides maximum flexibility for the leadership as well as for the appropriators. While we authorize funding, as my friend from California knows, nothing can happen without further action on an appropriations bill, and it is those appropriations bills that have served as the vehicles for the Iraq debate. 
   The House recently passed a bridge supplemental fund that would change our policy in Iraq. We may very well have similar debates in the future, and I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be forthcoming with their suggestions on how to address the strategic risk we incur by pursuing the President's failed policy. In the Defense Authorization Act, our committee, I expect, will act in conference to ensure that those debates can occur and that the House can work its will on future appropriations bills to restrain the President's Iraq war policy. 
   We all acknowledge that our troops have done a great job in Iraq. We owe them our thanks, our gratitude and our congratulations for their work as well as for their sacrifices. Their sweat and their blood have helped to reduce the level of violence in Iraq from the horrific levels of late 2006 and early 2007. 
   The original purpose of this surge was to reduce violence to provide the Iraqis with a chance for political reconciliation. Violence is down. It is time for the Iraqis to step up and take the hard steps toward reconciliation that will finish the job our wonderful troops have started. Yet they have refused to do this. 
   In response to this refusal, the House recently voted to begin to redeploy most of our troops out of Iraq and to change the nature of our involvement there. This policy is supported by a large majority of the American people who do not believe that we should continue to police a civil war when the Iraqis themselves refuse to take the hard steps to bring it to an end. 
   Well, we are not having the Iraq debate on the defense authorization bill. The supplemental authorization is intended to set the stage for that debate. That is an appropriations bill as all of us know. That is why the House and the Senate versions of the Defense Authorization Act, which is before us, included a supplemental authorization and why I suspect that the conference will do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The motion to instruct by my friend Mr. Hunter from California is in two parts. Both of these sections make reference to issues that are spelled out in both the House and Senate versions and consequently should be acceptable. I would hope that the conferees would be in line with accepting both of those issues. 
   I would like to take just a moment, Madam Speaker, however, to say a word about those wonderful troops who we, through this authorization, support. They are the best in the world. They and their families have been tasked to do monumental work in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and to say we are proud of them is an understatement. General Petraeus is the right man for the job in his great efforts in Iraq. 
   That is why in this bill we authorize a 3 1/2 percent pay raise for our troops; that is why we made significant changes to address the problems unearthed by the Walter Reed situation regarding our wounded warriors; that is why we put $1 billion in strategic readiness funds to deal with the critical readiness shortfall. And this is a major challenge for us. The reforms for Iraq and Afghanistan contracting are spelled out in this bill. There is additional money for the MRAP vehicles; there is $980 million for our National Guard equipment; prohibition on TRICARE fee increases; taking steps to minimize the inequities for survivors and to step forward on the survivor benefit plan offset. 
   So all of these are major issues within the realm of the two bills, and hopefully the conferees would be able to make significant progress on each of those. 
   I am proud of the work we have done. I am proud of the Armed Services Committee. I think it is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. Special thanks to the gentleman from California who has worked with us these many years to the end of positive help for the American in uniform. 
   So with that, I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act. This bill amends title 10 and 41, United States Code, and establishes other new statutory requirements to improve the quality of government contracts, increase government contract oversight, and promote integrity in contracting. 
   The House Armed Services Committee approved this legislation on a bipartisan vote of 53-0. Our committee has worked for decades to improve the contracting process within the Department of Defense. 
   Over this time, the committee has passed numerous bills, including both major additions to contract law and focused revisions. We utilized the experience gained in these legislative efforts to formulate our recommendations in this bill. I am confident that this is a good product that will improve contracting and save the taxpayer money. 
   Right now, American military forces are deployed throughout the world in support of the war on terrorism as well as other military operations, including Iraq. These contingency operations have generated a number of very large contracts, the Department of Defense has expended billions of dollars on support and reconstruction contracts that have been awarded, administered and overseen in the most challenging of conditions. 
   H.R. 1362 would help address these challenges by empowering the heads of the military departments and the defense agencies to ensure the proper use of a variety of contract types, both competitive and noncompetitive, and by empowering Congress to oversee such contracts. It also ensures continued faith in the integrity of the procurement system. 
   I thank my friend and colleague, Chairman Waxman, for introducing this legislation and bringing it to the floor today. And I especially want to thank my friend and partner on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Hunter, who is the ranking member and the former chairman, for working so closely with us on this legislation. I thank him for that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I first wish to thank the gentleman from California and all the members of the Armed Services Committee that worked on this legislation that recommended its passage by a 53-0 vote, and I was very pleased and proud of that. Of course, it was changed to about 1 percent as opposed to 99 percent that we approved in our committee. 
   The change merely clarifies the application of post-employment restrictions to senior level officials who are involved with procurement. It is a minor change. The language was shared with the minority well before the bill went to the Rules Committee for its rule on bringing it to the floor today. So I think that the change made post-Rules Committee effectually was minimal, or as they say in the law, de minimus; and I am sorry that there is a question that has arisen to that effect. 
   This bill does not affect the rapid acquisition authority that the Armed Services Committee did approve. It allows, as the gentleman from California mentioned, 1 year for emergency contracts, and it can go longer if the agency head so determines that it is needed. 
   I wish that this bill, as it is before us, could receive a unanimous vote on the floor because of what it does. It is clear. It helps the procurement process. It brings it home to every American that we are on top of the matter and that oversight is happening, and it is a clarification of a law that is actually overdue and well deserved. 
   I applaud all those who worked on it. I am going to thank the gentleman from California for his work on the Committee on Armed Services and all of those, Democrats, Republicans, who did approve it and thank the chairman, Mr. Waxman, for his hard efforts in bringing this to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. 
   Of course, I rise in support of the rule for this conference report, the National Defense Authorization Act. I will speak more at length on this issue later today after we have the privilege of passing the rule on this floor. But, I must say, Madam Speaker, that in my years of being here in the Congress, this is the most comprehensive, well thought-out and studied authorization bill that we have had. It's excellent for the troops, it's excellent for the families, and their health care. It makes great strides in the area of readiness. 
   I just feel like bragging on all the members of the House Armed Services Committee on both sides of the aisle. Of course, it couldn't be done without the crackerjack staff that we have, and we are just absolutely blessed with the dedicated staff that we have, Erin Conaton, who's the staff director. We owe all of the members of the staff our great appreciation. 
   This has been months of hard work. We have a proud tradition in the Armed Services Committee as being bipartisan. It helps with the problems of readiness, including equipment, training and people. It gives an across-the-board 3.5 percent pay raise, protects them from escalating fees for health care. It includes over 100 measures, large and small, for quality of life. We combined the best elements of the Wounded Warrior Act that was passed here in the House by 426-0, as well as a companion bill that passed the Senate. 
   We have many parts of this bill that are new, which will help us in the area of national security all the more. I  will, at length, discuss them when we take the bill up at a later moment today.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule on the conference report for H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. I will speak at more length about this bill later today. 
   This legislation represents the outcome of months of hard work by the House Armed Services Committee and our colleagues in the other body. It is a good bill and it is a bipartisan bill in the proud tradition of the Armed Services Committee. It is good for our troops and their families. It will help improve the readiness of our Armed Forces, who face dire problems with all elements of readiness including equipment, training, and people. And it will bring significant new oversight to the Department of Defense in areas where oversight is sorely needed. 
   Let me just mention a few high points. 
   H.R. 1585 includes a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for the troops, protects them from escalating fees for health care, and includes well over 100 other measures, both large and small, to improve their quality of life. Just as important, it upholds the debt of honor the nation owes to its injured and fallen veterans, by combining the best elements of the Wounded Warrior Act which passed the House 426-0, and a companion bill which passed the Senate. 
   To address the readiness crisis, it establishes a new, high level board of military officers, the Defense Materiel Readiness Board, to grapple with the growing, dramatic shortfalls confronting the Armed Forces. The committee also made a special effort to authorize the most money possible for readiness accounts. 
   Critically, this bill will bring much needed oversight to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It follows up on the bipartisan investigation of Iraqi Security Forces by the committee's reinstated Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee by increasing reporting relating to Iraqi Security Forces and requiring real accountability for weapons transferred to that nation. And it institutes, for the first time, regular progress reports to Congress on the war in Afghanistan, where our critical national interests remain deeply challenged by those who attacked us on September 11. The bill also creates a new Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. 
   Finally, this bill takes significant strides to ensure that the Department of Defense is able to posture itself to address new threats. The bill includes $17.6 billion for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles to protect our troops in Iraq and in future conflicts. It increases funding for shipbuilding by almost a billion dollars. The bill also adds 8 C-17s to help meet the demands for global power projection in today's world. 
   In closing, I ask my colleagues to support this rule and to support the conference report when we consider it later today.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I'm so extremely proud of the members of the Armed Services Committee, of all of those who worked hard in and out of the Armed Services Committee to make this happen. And a special thanks to the fantastic staff that we have supporting us, Erin Conaton, Bob Simmons, who is the leader of those on the other side of the aisle regarding the staff, and everyone just pitched in so very, very well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. As a matter of fact, I think it's the best bill in decades that this Congress has put forward. It's good for our troops, good for our families, it will help improve readiness of our Armed Forces, and it will bring new significant oversight to the Department of Defense in areas where oversight was sorely needed in the past. 
   Let me begin by saying that the Armed Services Committee has remained committed to a tradition of bipartisanship, and we appreciate that, and we have all throughout the year. 
   Special thanks to our ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and today to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) who's been such a great help through the years. 
   When the 110th Congress began, we laid out, from the Armed Services Committee, six strategic priorities, and we have met them in this legislation. The bill before us is the culmination of our efforts. It addresses strategic priorities in important ways. It includes a 3.5 percent across-the-board  pay raise, it protects the troops and their families from escalating health care fees, and includes well over 100 other measures, both large and small, regarding quality of life. It is especially important because it adopts the elements of the Wounded Warrior Act which passed this House earlier in the year 426-0. And I think that that, in and of itself, is a major victory for those in uniform. 
   It addresses readiness. It establishes a new, high level board of military officers, the Defense Materiel Readiness Board, to grapple with the growing shortfalls confronting the Armed Forces. The bill allocates $1 billion to a Strategic Readiness Fund. 
   The bill will bring much needed oversight to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It does so by instituting new reporting requirements developed on a bipartisan basis. 
   The bill builds on the successful passage of H.R. 1, which fully implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. H.R. 1585 authorizes the funding required to carry forward that act by continuing, and this is important, and expanding the Department of Defense's cooperative threat reduction program and the Department of Energy's nuclear nonproliferation programs. Mr. Speaker, these programs address perhaps the single largest threat to the American homeland, the threat of nuclear terrorism and other weapons of mass destruction, and we address that very carefully in this bill. 
   We also include $17.6 billion for the mine resistant ambush vehicle, which is known as MRAP, to protect our troops in Iraq and in future conflicts. It does a great deal in the area of funding for our various ships, including production of two Virginia-class submarines per year by 2010, and adds eight C-17s to meet the needs of the demands of global power projection. 
   One of the most important elements of this bill, in addition to the money and the hardware, is a requirement that the Department of Defense perform a quadrennial review of its roles and missions. The first time this was addressed, and the last time it was addressed thoroughly, was back in 1948 at the behest of President Harry Truman and his then Secretary of Defense, James Forestal. The review we require in this bill causes a full examination as to whether the Department of Defense is truly developing the core competencies and capabilities to perform the missions assigned to it and whether those capabilities are being developed in the most joint and efficient way by the military services. Much has changed since 1948. Technology has changed and has blossomed and mushroomed, and that's why it's important that we update, by way of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, the Key West agreement that was met back in that year of 1948. 
   I am very, very pleased with this bill, Mr. Speaker. I think that history will say that this one was a comprehensive, if not the most comprehensive, Defense authorization bill that our Congress has passed in decades. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record, regarding the Key West agreement of 1948, a statement by Sam Rushie, who is the supervisory archivist of the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.  
   On December 19, 1945--3 months after the end of the Second World War--President Truman recommended to Congress that the War and Navy Departments be unified in a new Department of National Defense. In his statement to Congress, Truman declared, ``One of the lessons which have most clearly come from the costly and dangerous experience of this war is that there must be unified direction of land, sea and air forces at home as well as in all other parts of the world where our Armed Forces are serving. ``We did not have that kind of direction when we were attacked four years ago--and we certainly paid a high price for not having it.'' 
   On May 13, 1946, Truman met with Secretary of War Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and he urged that the Army and the Navy reach a compromise on the problem of unification. 
   The President's proposals were finally enacted on July 26, 1947, as the National Security Act, the main feature of which was the establishment of a unified Department of Defense. That same day, the President issued Executive Order 9877, an attempt to define the functions of the Army, the Navy, and the newly created Air Force within the unified National Military Establishment. However, bickering between the services continued, especially over issues that the Executive Order had failed to address specifically. Many of these issues concerned the functions of the Navy. The Army regarded the Navy's Marine Corps as a rival for control of combat operations on land; similarly, the Air Force viewed Naval Aviation as an infringement on its jurisdiction over air operations. 
   In an effort to resolve these conflicts, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal summoned the Joint Chiefs of Staff to a meeting at Key West, Florida in March 1948. Following suggestions made by Forrestal, the Joint Chiefs drafted a directive entitled ``Functions of the Armed Forces and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,'' popularly known as the ``Key West Agreement.'' Forrestal submitted this proposal to the President in late March. On April 21, 1948, the President issued Executive Order 9950, revoking his earlier executive order. This cleared the way for the Secretary of Defense to issue the new directive that same day. 
   With modifications, the Key West Agreement continues to govern responsibilities within the armed forces to this day. In contrast to the broad language of the earlier executive order, Forrestal's directive specified the primary and secondary responsibilities of each branch of the service. In a tenuous compromise, it was agreed that the Navy would not establish a strategic air component, but would be permitted to have aircraft carriers and use its aircraft against inland targets. (This was interpreted by the Navy as an endorsement of the projected new supercarrier, the USS United States.) The Air Force would retain primary responsibility for strategic air operations and air defense. At the same time, it was agreed that the Marine Corps would be preserved, but would be limited in size to four divisions, and would cooperate with the Army in planning amphibious operations.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The question is, where are we today? We are looking at this conflict today and the consequences that it has upon tomorrow and tomorrow's military readiness. 
   I spoke about the lack of readiness last summer. Others did as well. We had a hearing on it a good number of months ago, our committee responded, and we thank the gentleman from California for helping in that massive effort to re-equip our Army as was necessary, and hopefully we will be able to do more in the future. 
   But where are we today? Yesterday regarding the issue of readiness of our Army, the Army Chief of Staff, General Schoomaker, said that the increase of 17,500 Army combat troops in Iraq represents only the tip of the iceberg and will potentially require thousands of additional support troops and trainers as well as equipment, further eroding the Army's readiness to respond to other world contingencies. 
   In the last 30 years, there have been 12 military engagements, some large, some small, that our country has engaged in. The Pentagon says they would only need some 2,500 support troops for the 20,000-plus combat troops. The Congressional Budget Office says there is going to be a necessary 13,000 in additional support troops. But the issue of readiness is real, it is there today because of additional combat troops, and that is what we are debating today. That is exactly the issue today. The readiness of tomorrow is contingent upon what happens today. 
   I yield, Mr. Speaker, 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak).

   All one has to do is to go to Walter Reed and the Bethesda hospitals, go to visitation or a funeral, and those are the ones, and the saying good-bye to the National Guard and Reserve units, the active duty units, the farewells and the welcome homes, those and their families are those that are involved. 
   And I am afraid the gentleman is correct, that they are the only ones that are actually involved with this war.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to share this body and this floor with the remarkable gentleman from Texas. I applaud him for his patriotism, his courage, and commitment to America. 
   Madam Speaker, we have had a long debate on this resolution. I have listened to critics, and I find it quite interesting that the criticism is focused almost exclusively on what this resolution doesn't say, rather than what it does. 
   Let me review, if I may. The resolution says two simple things: We support the troops completely, wholeheartedly, now and in the future; and we disapprove of the White House's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional combat troops to Iraq. 
   That is what we are voting on today, and nothing said on this floor or in this Chamber will change the fact that that is what is before us. 
   I oppose the President's plan because it will embroil our troops even more deeply in a sectarian conflict. Some call this conflict a civil war, some call this more complicated than a civil war, and, either way, it is a conflict we cannot resolve and which ultimately cannot be resolved militarily. 
   The President's plan to deploy more troops is simply not the answer. It cannot fix the three irretrievable mistakes made in 2003 when the administration insisted on de-Baathification, dissolving the Iraqi army, and shutting down the state-run industries, throwing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis out of work and creating untold numbers of insurgents. 
   The President's plan hastily put together is insufficient in a number of ways: 
   It is insufficient in the requirements for progress it places on the Iraqi political system, the true center of gravity in this whole conflict. 
   It is insufficient in the support it provides to our combat forces both in terms of equipment as well as support forces. 
   And it is insufficient in the amount of training time it allows for deploying units. 
   As a result, under the President's plan, U.S. military forces will be less ready to go into during and after this troop increase; and, sadly, they could be stretched to the point of breaking. To the point of breaking. 
   Now, finally, I oppose the White House's plan because it will heighten the already unacceptable level of strategic risk currently facing our Nation,  strategic risk that exists because our military is overcommited in Iraq and is ill-equipped and ill-positioned to respond to emerging crises elsewhere in the world. And this worries me, it worries me deeply. 
   I have been privileged to serve here in Congress slightly over 30 years, and over that time 12 significant military contingencies have occurred in which our military have been involved. Each of them occurred in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time. It will happen again. Right now, we are not prepared as we should be for an unforeseen military threat. That worries me. 
   Unfortunately, it is the magnificent, wonderful, courageous men and women of our military who will pay the price for that failure. 
   Madam Speaker, we must send the White House a message that cannot be ignored; and that is why we are here today. I urge that we pass the Skelton-Lantos-Jones resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker, I am blessed to be a Member of the House of Representatives. 
   Under the Constitution of our country, this is a co-equal branch of government. We are charged here in Congress to raise and maintain the military of the United States. The President is charged with being the Commander in Chief. Our job is clear. We must prepare and maintain our military to the highest standard possible. 
   1950, the North Koreans invaded South Korea. We had a small force there. General MacArthur, supreme commander in that part of the world, sent a unit that was untrained, underequipped and undersized, called Task Force Smith to stem the tide of the North Korean armies. They fought valiantly and found themselves in the southeast corner of South Korea in what is now known as the Pusan perimeter, and they were in serious trouble. General MacArthur's brilliant Inchon landing on the western coast of Korea changed the nature of the Korean War at that moment. 
   But the lesson of all of this is the lack of readiness of the United States  Army as it was in 1950. Our job is to see that that does not ever happen again. 
   This rule, this bill, this resolution is the right one for our time. It will help the readiness of the United States military, in particular our Army. I am very concerned about the stretching and the straining of the Army in Iraq, so much so we just have to fund them, and this is a major step in that direction. 
   Now, some object for some Iraqi language, which frankly leaves a lot to the discretion of the White House. But what we are overlooking is the fact that this bill, this resolution does lead to supporting the troops and keeping the readiness at a higher level. A large percentage of the equipment of the active duty of the National Guard and of the Reserve is not here in America, is overseas in Iraq or Afghanistan. Readiness capability of the future is what this is all about.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today the House begins consideration of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This bill is a collective effort in the bipartisan tradition of the House Armed Services Committee, which approved the bill in markup last week by a vote of 58-0. 
   I want to thank our committee members, particularly our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, for their outstanding work. And special thanks go to the ranking member, Duncan Hunter, and I appreciate his working so hard in a very bipartisan manner to make this bill come to the floor. He's been a partner in this, and I appreciate it. I am proud that we're always able to work together in our efforts to enhance our Nation's defense. 
   Mr. Chairman, the polestar of this year's Defense authorization is readiness. Continued reports on the state of readiness for our ground forces, particularly our nondeployed and next-to-deploy forces, are of deep concern. To restore readiness and ensure our forces will be ready if they are called upon for the next fight, this bill fully funds the budget request for the Army and Marine Corps reset of equipment at $13.6 billion and $8.4 billion respectively. 
   They add some $1 billion in a strategic readiness fund to meet critical readiness requirements identified by a new Defense Readiness Production Board. 
   It increases training by $250 million so that our units may get more training time. 
   It requires a plan and a timeline for replenishing prepositioned stocks. 
   And it strengthens the National Guard by adding $1 billion for National Guard and Reserve equipment from their unfunded requirements list, ensuring that the National Guard is able to meet its homeland and civil support missions, and also adding a range of authorities through the National Guard Empowerment Act. 
   This bill looks out for our troops in harm's way by dedicating substantial resources to improve protection, including $4.6 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, known as MRAPs, and providing funds for personal body armor and up-armored Humvees. 
   To reduce the strain on our force and in keeping with the House Armed Services Committee's long advocacy of the need to boost end strength, that is, the number of troops, the bill has authorized an increase in the size of the Army by 36,000 Army troops and Marines by 9,000. 
   Our servicemembers and their families make countless sacrifices and our pride in them knows no bounds. We express our thanks to them through a 3.5 percent pay raise, by blocking TRICARE and pharmacy program fee increases, by expanding special compensation for combat-related disabled retirees, and establishing a special survivor indemnity allowance to begin to address the offset to the survivor benefit plan and the dependents indemnity plan. 
   Provisions also include the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which addresses many of the problems identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; and, Mr. Chairman, you will recall we passed that as a stand-alone bill just a few weeks ago. 
   Accountability with respect to our own ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is also an important component of the measure. The bill requires General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to report on the implementation of the Joint Campaign Plan for Iraq, as well as on efforts made by the Iraqi Government to achieve political reconciliation. 
   Secretary Gates is also required to report on the proposed force levels for the 6 months following September, to discuss the missions of our forces, and to inform Congress about contingency planning. The information from this report will help us ask the right questions, the tough questions, and make frank judgments about how we are going to pass the baton on to the Iraqis. I am convinced that the sectarian violence will only be overcome by Iraqi political progress, and thus far, I haven't seen much of that since then. 
   September's report will be an opportunity for General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to lay out the straight facts. Time is short with the American people, and the Iraqis must act soon. This report will provide real and substantial information. 
   Calling attention to the forgotten war in Afghanistan, the bill provides funds for the Afghanistan security forces and requires a long-term sustainment plan so that the Afghans can build the logistics and other capabilities they need for long-term security. 
   The bill establishes a new Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction to ensure accountability in contracting there and extends the authority of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. 
   The bill also brings more contracting accountability to both Afghanistan and Iraq by forcing the Departments of Defense and State to work together in assigning responsibility for overseeing the thousands of contractors in these places, particularly those who do carry weapons. 
   And finally, Mr. Chairman, the bill requires that the Secretary of Defense undertake an analysis of the Department's roles and missions. In 1947, a similar effort helped shape the Pentagon through the National Security Act. After 60 years, it is time for a new analysis to help eliminate duplication among the services, identify core competencies, and strengthen the Department of Defense and the military while helping us spend money much more wisely.  
   Before I close, let me spend just a moment talking about something that is not in this bill. The Military Commissions Act, which was made into law by the last Congress, precludes detainees in Guantanamo from petitioning courts under habeas corpus. This bill does not include a provision to restore the principle of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo, even though I feel strongly it should. 
   My judgment is that the most promising course of action will be for this House to take up this issue as a separate bill. To that end, I have prepared legislation to address the habeas corpus issue, and I intend to work with the leadership, members of our committee and with the Judiciary Committee on that issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a critical time in the defense and security of our Nation. This is a very important bill. I urge the Members in this House to support this Defense authorization bill. It does so much to restore readiness, to support our men and women in uniform, and to protect the American people. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And first I want the gentleman from Texas to know how much the committee appreciates his strong support for our Nation's Armed Forces, particularly for the United States Army. He is just superb. The Army is bearing the brunt of the burden of military operations in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, and our committee has worked to ensure that soldiers on the ground have the equipment they need to accomplish their mission and come home safely. 
   Beyond taking care of the needs of the warfighters in the field today, we must address the Army's long-term modernization and readiness requirements. That is why the bill before us here today fully funds the most critical elements of the Future Combat Systems program, which will keep the program on track to conduct the limited user test next summer. 
   While the bill cuts some funding for some redundant programs and overhead costs, along with parts of the program which are not scheduled to be fielded until 2015, the $2.8 billion in the bill includes full funding for all Spinout 1 activities, allowing them to continue as planned. 
   I want to assure the gentleman from Texas that we will continue our efforts to balance the Army's immediate near-term as well as long-term needs as we work through the conference process. As Congressman Abercrombie said last week during consideration of the bill in the committee, finding that balance is a work in progress. 
   To the gentleman from Texas, you have my assurance that we will provide funding for the FCS program so that the Army can move forward with modernizing its equipment and its networks. 
   As we focus our efforts, as we focus our dollars on today's soldiers, we can't shortchange our future forces.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chair, we are nearing the end of the general debate portion of the consideration of this bill. 
   I want to thank my ranking member, my friend, DUNCAN HUNTER, for his hard work and for his cooperation in getting us to this point. And it was difficult at times, but we have gotten here. So I just want him to know that I am appreciative. 
   And I also want to say that the purpose of our affection and attention is the young men and young women in uniform. Despite all of the procedural motions that we have had, out of all of this at the end of the day, and maybe  at the end of tomorrow, we will have done an excellent job, because this bill is basically a very good bill for the defense and for the young people of our Nation in uniform. 
   So let's not forget the purpose of what we are doing here. Let's not forget that we are doing this in a bipartisan effort. Let's not forget that, at the end of the day, we will make America one major step safer by passing a good piece of legislation for our country.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, if you are a young man or young woman in either Iraq or Afghanistan in American uniform, you would like to know that monies authorized and appropriated from this body for Iraq or Afghanistan will not be diverted to planning any operations elsewhere. That's what this is. This simply ensures that funds that Congress approved for other purposes are not diverted to planning operations against Iran. It's that simple. 
   It increases the ability of Congress to provide oversight for planning of military operations, and it would not restrict the Department of Defense from planning any necessary contingencies regarding Iran using the base defense budget. 
   This is a good amendment, and I compliment the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) for offering it.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I find myself in opposition to this amendment. 
   A $764 million reduction has already been made in the Missile Defense Agency programs. An additional billion dollars would terminate or cancel long-term missile defense programs which I think would not be in the correct mode for the United States. This amendment simply goes too far. 
   This amendment would effectively terminate most, if not all, of the Missile Defense Agency's longer term research and development programs. Given the dynamic security environment we find ourselves in today, I don't believe it is prudent to do this. 
   I oppose this amendment because, quite frankly, the committee strikes the right balance in cutting the amount of $764 million, and it should stay as the committee recommended.

   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I rise in opposition to this. A similar amendment was offered in committee and was defeated by a 34-24 vote. With the cuts that were correct, well thought out, on the committee level, our bill still authorizes $9.5 billion for missile defense programs. 
   This committee's reallocation is just over 8 percent of the Missile Defense Agency's budget or $764 million to such programs as are necessary. 
   For too long, the missile defense program's been focused on developing futuristic technologies rather than near-term capabilities. Our bill fully funds, or actually increases, funding for key near-term missile defense systems, and for this reason, I do oppose this amendment.

   Mr. SKELTON. Some things are hard to understand. I think this is a very bad idea. By adopting this amendment, we are sending a message to the Iraqi people that we are there forever. We are sending a message to the American people we are going to be in Iraq forever. And what we are doing there is, at the end of the day, trying to create trust among the Iraqi people, and this is a major step backwards. 
   The President has not affirmed one way or the other on this, and I think we in Congress should strongly say that we are not there permanently, that we are there to bring stability, that we are there to encourage the representative government that is struggling along; but we are not there as a permanent resident either on a base or otherwise. And this is a message amendment that is to the Iraqi people and to the American people, and it is just a downright unclear and bad idea. 
   I yield 1 minute to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. This is just downright good law enforcement. 
   You must understand that so many jurisdictions, so many States have videotaping of interrogations for the very reasons that you stated, to make sure that their rights were preserved, to make sure that they said what was said to have been said, and there is a taping that cannot be refuted. 
   And you must remember that everyone is a potential defendant before a military commission. And what better evidence is there to present before a military commission, either for the defense or for the prosecution, than what was actually taped during interrogation? I think that we are just trying to catch up with other States that do this and require this. It is just good law enforcement.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today the House begins consideration of H.R. 5658, which is the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   This bill is a collective effort in the bipartisan tradition of the House Armed Services Committee which approved the bill in markup by a vote of 61-0. It is an excellent bill. 
   I want to thank the members of our Armed Services Committee, particularly the subcommittee chairmen, the ranking members, and actually every member of the committee. 
   Let me take this opportunity to also, Mr. Chairman, recognize the ranking member and former chairman, DUNCAN HUNTER, for once again being a great partner on this bill, and he is certainly to be commended and thanked for it. I am proud that DUNCAN and I have worked so well together through the years and always with the common goal of enhancing American national security. 
   It is only fitting, Mr. Chairman, that as DUNCAN HUNTER plans to retire at the end of this Congress, our committee colleagues unanimously voted to name this bill in his honor, recognizing DUNCAN HUNTER's many years of service on the Armed Services Committee, and also recognizing his unfailing support of our men and women in uniform. And we thank him publicly for that. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me discuss some significant provisions of the bill. It reflects our committee's view that restoring military readiness must be our number one priority. This is serious business. If, after more than 6 years of war, our effort is to restore military readiness, then it must be sustained in order to meet not just current military challenges, which are monumental, but prepare for the unexpected conflicts we may face in the future. 
   We don't know what is around the corner. I might point out, in the last 31 years American military forces have been engaged in no less than 12 military conflicts, four of which have been major in size. 
   The bill directs approximately $2 billion toward unfunded readiness initiatives requested by the services. It includes $932 million to deal with equipment shortages as well as for equipment maintenance. The bill also provides for some $800 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment, and $650 million to keep defense facilities in good working order and to address urgent issues such as dilapidated military barracks.     
   To boost readiness and to reduce the strain on our forces, the bill increases the size of our military; 7,000 additional Army troops, 5,000 additional marines, and prevents further military to civilian conversions in the medical field by authorizing an additional 1,023 Navy sailors and 450 additional Air Force personnel. 
   The bill also maintains our efforts to support and honor the men and women who serve our Nation in uniform and their families, providing a much needed 3.9 percent pay raise increase, and again, prohibiting increases in health care fees, among a range of other initiatives. 
   I might point out, the administration recommended only a 3.4 percent pay raise, and we raised that, as we should have. 
   The authorization bill also keeps our focus on Afghanistan, which is the primary front in the war on terror. The bill requires the administration to submit separate budget requests to clearly lay out the requirements for the war in Afghanistan, and on the other hand, the war in Iraq. It requires a system be set up to measure the success of the U.S.-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and requires more robust congressional reporting on the training of the Afghan Security Force. 
   Finally, the bill requires the Department of Defense to address the issue of command and control for forces in Afghanistan operating under Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as the NATO International Security Assistance Force. 
   The bill authorizes a $70 billion bridge for the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we remain convinced that it's well past time for the Iraqis to step up and contribute more substantially to their very own security, as well as their prosperity. With the Iraqis' overwhelming budget and capital account surpluses, the bill requires Iraqis to invest more in their own reconstruction, as well as their own security efforts. 
   The bill also includes steps toward contracting reform after the substantial improvements in the law which we enacted in our previous bill last year. 
   This bill underlines our commitment to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It adds $31 million for the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs of the Department of Defense, and some $215 million from the Department of Energy's nonproliferation programs. That's important. 
   Finally, I want to say a word about the need for reforms in the way our government coordinates and executes its national security policy. Many here in Congress as well as the executive branch are working to improve our interagency system. It's a massive effort that cannot be accomplished in any one single year. 
   I remember well the now famous Goldwater-Nichols Act. It was an effort over 4 years in the Congress of the United States which, of course, made jointness part of the military culture, and this may well be along the same line, although hopefully it will not take 4 years to accomplish. But it cannot be done in one single year. 
   At the appropriate time during the bill's consideration, I will offer an amendment along with Chairman HOWARD BERMAN of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman NITA LOWEY to establish a standing advisory board to work with the Secretaries of State and Defense on interagency matters and report to Congress their recommendations. 
   Before I reserve the balance of my time, let me pay tribute to those Members who plan to leave Congress at the end of this session and for whom this will be their final defense authorization bill. In addition to the retirement of our friend and ranking member, DUNCAN HUNTER, I want to express my appreciation to two other senior Members who plan to retire, Congressman JIM SAXTON and Congressman TERRY EVERETT. Both these gentlemen have made a very important contribution to our committee through the years and, consequently, have been wonderful partners, as well as outstanding Americans. 
   In addition, two of the most capable and committed members of our committee, ROB ANDREWS and MARK UDALL, plan to leave in order to seek other offices. The House and our committee are all the better for their service, and we wish all of these members who are not going to return to our committee next year all the best. They will be missed. 
   This is a critical time in our Nation. This defense bill is a very important one. I urge Members of this House to support this defense authorization bill. It does so much in the area of readiness, to support our men and women in uniform and their families, and to protect the American people. 
   With that, and additional thanks to my friend, DUNCAN HUNTER, on his final bill, we appreciate your work, your efforts, your friendship, Mr. Hunter. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Let me add, if I may, an additional 30 seconds, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman spoke about the need to study strategy. After we passed the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1986, I chaired a panel on professional military education that did a great deal in upgrading the Senior and Immediate War Colleges. The Senior War Colleges really are the bosom of where strategic thought, both military as well as diplomatic, is taught and is learned. Sometimes the lessons that are so plain to those in the War Colleges do not seem to be learned by others in responsible positions. That is why I think the thought of working on strategic thought itself is an excellent one, and I commend the gentleman.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentlelady for raising this very important issue, and assure the gentlelady that I certainly share her concerns. The Department of Defense is facing the same shortage of nurses as we are across the Nation. However, the need for the Department is more directly felt as we are at war, and our military nurses are caring for our wounded and injured in addition to all their other duties.     
   Let me say to the gentlelady that we have taken serious, substantive steps to increase the number of nurses, both in the military and in the civilian community. In this bill we have mandated the establishment of a Department of Defense School of Nursing, following the successful models of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences to produce medical doctors, the Interservice Physician Assistant Program to produce physician assistants for the military, and the Army's new School of Social Work, which will enroll its first class this summer. 
   Although the graduates of the Department of Defense School of Nursing will initially provide much needed care for our troops, I'm confident that following their military service they will continue to serve our Nation as nurses in civilian communities. 
   Finally, we've included a demonstration project to encourage retired military nurses to become faculty members at civilian schools of nursing to help alleviate the nurse instructor shortage of which you speak.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman from California. And I must add that this is properly named for Duncan Hunter in honor of the hard work that you've done through the years. Thank you. 
   When you put a bill together like this that's $531 billion of taxpayer money for national security, there are unseen hands that have helped glue this together bit by bit and part by part. And that's the unsung but very valuable and absolutely terrific staff of the Armed Services Committee under the direction of Erin Conaton, and I particularly wish to complement her on her hard work. Everyone on this staff is outstanding and an expert in his or her field, and I want them to know that they are appreciated, and that we're very grateful for their work. 
   This will close out the general debate on this bill. It's an excellent bill, and I think that in truth and fact it has made a great stride toward increasing the readiness of our troops. People in the country should take a great deal of comfort in knowing that there's such bipartisanship on this committee. So I thank the gentleman from California. 
   I am very, very proud of the members of this committee, the Armed Services Committee.

   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Murphy of Connecticut) having assumed the chair, Mr. Ellison, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5658) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe military personnel strengths for fiscal year 2009, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. 
   I appreciate the fact that we will be again having a rule taken up in the Rules Committee. I look forward to the second rule for tomorrow. 
   I rise, Mr. Speaker, in favor of the rule. This is an excellent bill. It is, of course, the annual defense authorization bill, bipartisan I should say, very bipartisan in nature because the vote on final passage out of our committee was 61 Members to none. And I cannot be more pleased with the work that our committee has done, the ranking members, the subcommittee chairmen who really did yeoman's work, and I want to thank them for all their excellent and successful efforts.     
   I might mention at the outset that this defense authorization bill, which is for 2009, is named in honor of former chairman, now ranking member, who will not be returning to us next year, the gentleman from California, DUNCAN HUNTER. That is certainly fitting and proper that we do so to recognize his efforts on national security through the many years he served on the committee, as well as the leadership positions. 
   This bill authorizes $531 billion in spending for the defense and national security functions of the Department of Energy. It also authorizes a $70 billion bridge fund, which will be considered shortly. 
   The pay raise to the troops, 3.9 percent, is five-tenths of a percent more than the administration recommended. And it rolls back the administration's proposed fee increases on health care as well as pharmacy costs. It increases the size of the military, something I have been urging since 1995. It increases the size of the Army by 7,000 and the Marines by 5,000. They're overburdened and they're strained, and this is one step towards relieving that strain. 
   A major problem today is that of readiness, or a lack of readiness. We restore a great deal of readiness to the military in this bill in various manners, essentially in training and equipment. 
   There is $800 million in National Guard and Reserve equipment; $650 million to upgrade military barracks for those trainees that are coming through. It improves our efforts in Afghanistan. It bans permanent bases in Iraq. It requires Iraq to do more for itself in the reconstruction area, establishing a formula by which they, with their oil surplus, will have to contribute toward that end. 
   There are additional steps regarding contractor oversight.  
   Regarding nuclear nonproliferation, we increase the funding by $245 million. That's a very major step. The European missile defense effort was cut by $370 million. It does a great deal toward national security. 
   I want to take this opportunity to support the rule, and of course when the time comes, to support the bill itself. Hopefully we will have some excellent amendments that will be considered tomorrow. And we will send this on to the Senate and hopefully have an excellent bill at the end of the day. 
   The young people in uniform, of whom we're so very, very proud, deserve the best. This is one way we in Congress can make sure they get the very best through this defense authorization bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (EXPRESSING APPRECIATION OF CONGRESS TO THE FAMILIES OF MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, we recall that our Nation has been at war for over 6 years. It is often in times of conflict that our uniformed services are called upon, as in wartime now, to extraordinary duty. 
   It is their families that we seem from time to time to forget, but the support of their families is so very important. They are a very special group. Military families regularly face months of separation, one, two, three, and in some cases, four deployments. Children being born--I recall, Mr. Speaker, not all that long ago coming into port and then helicoptered out to the USS Harry S. Truman and seeing a good number of sailors being allowed to leave the ship first to meet their family and to meet the newborn children of those families that they had never seen before. Stories of children being born, of precious moments like graduations and birthdays being separated. 
   I think it is important that we in Congress recognize the importance and give moral support and comfort and thanks to those military families who bond together in times of crisis and help each other. And I think it's incumbent upon every American not only to say thanks and show appreciation to those we see in uniform but to do the same thing for the spouses and the children in those wonderful families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. I thank my friend from Connecticut for yielding and take this opportunity to mention the fact that my fellow Missourian, President Harry S. Truman, on the 26th day of July, 1948, signed Executive Order 9981 establishing the ``policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services with regard to race, color, religion, or national origin.'' That executive order also established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in our armed services. 
   On the 23rd of this month, our Congress will recognize the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the process of integration for our military. 
   African American men and women have served this Nation with honor, courage, commitment, even as they were denied the basic constitutional freedoms promised to all Americans. Their successful integration of forces paved the way for further integration of women, Asians, Hispanics, and other ethnic minorities. 
   The cosmopolitan make-up of our armed services is a testament to the American value that we hold dear, that all men are created equal. It is also a reflection of our society that we should treat all individuals, regardless of their race, their color, or national origin with respect and with dignity. And with these days of conflict, our forces, our military forces of our country, are an example of what can be achieved by respecting one's differences and working together to achieve a common goal. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 297 recognizes the 60th anniversary. I applaud those who have sponsored it, and I applaud the fact that we are taking it up today and recognizing the importance of this anniversary.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to share my strong support for Israel upon its 60th anniversary and to remind the House of Missouri's unique connection to the creation of Israel--a critical democratic ally of the United States. 
   President Harry S. Truman, Missouri's favorite son and the 33rd President of the United  States, was a long-time supporter of establishing a Jewish homeland and worked as President to ensure Israel's creation. 
   A supporter of the Balfour Declaration, a British statement issued in 1917 that endorsed the establishment of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine, when Harry S. Truman became President of the United States in 1945, he made clear his sympathy for the Jewish people and his concern for the sufferings they had endured during the Nazi Holocaust. 
   In 1946, President Truman urged British Prime Minister Clement Attlee to allow a reasonable number of European Jews to immigrate to British-controlled Palestine. The governments of the United States and Great Britain created the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry to study the situation. The Committee recommended that the United Nations establish a trusteeship over Palestine, with the goal of reconciling Jewish and Arab interests in the region. The Committee also agreed that 100,000 Jewish displaced persons should be admitted to Palestine. On the eve of Yom Kippur in 1946, President Truman issued a statement supporting these recommendations. 
   In response to a British request, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine was created in May 1947. This Committee recommended that the British mandate over Palestine be terminated and that the area be partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states. President Truman forced a reluctant U.S. State Department to support this plan. On November 29, 1947, the partition plan was approved by the U.N. General Assembly, thanks in large measure to vigorous American support. Palestinian Arabs and Arab governments remained strongly opposed to partition, and efforts to find a peaceful settlement disintegrated. 
   In February 1948, President Truman's close friend and former business partner, Eddie Jacobson, himself a Jewish person, sent Truman a telegram asking him to meet with Chaim Weizmann, the president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and the World Zionist Organization. Angered by criticism from some American Jewish leaders, President Truman refused to meet with Mr. Weizmann. In March 1948, Mr. Jacobson walked into the White House without an appointment and pleaded with his old friend to meet with Weizmann. The President relented, and when Weizmann came to the White House a few days later, Truman assured him that the United States would continue to support the partition of Palestine and the creation of a Jewish state. 
   At midnight on May 14, 1948, the British mandate over Palestine expired and the new State of Israel was proclaimed. Eleven minutes later, by order of President Harry S. Truman, the United States granted diplomatic recognition to the new Provisional Government of Israel. Following Israel's declaration of independence, Arab armies invaded the new nation, and a long and continuing struggle for security began for Israel. 
   Mr Speaker, throughout the time I have been privileged to serve in Congress, I have worked to foster a strong alliance between the United States and Israel. I am proud that Missouri's favorite son, Harry S. Truman, was first to recognize Israel and that our Nation has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with that country for these 60 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. This is a good bill in many ways. I particularly appreciate the bills' emphasis on holding the Coast Guard accountable for the funds the service receives from us, the Congress. The well-documented problems with the Deepwater program make it clear that more, needs to be done to ensure the Coast Guard's procurement policies are producing results. This is not just a budget issue, although that is certainly important, but it is also a national security issue. We depend on the men and women serving in the Coast Guard to defend our Nation's waterways, and for that critical task they need new ships and aircraft. Congress can no longer stand by while billions of dollars are wasted on a program that has failed to give our coastal defenders the tools they need. This bill takes steps to demand the type of accountability from the Coast Guard that we expect from the other uniformed services, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this good and necessary legislation. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of important language in Chairman Oberstar's manager's amendment to H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. This amendment is critical for my constituents who live in the Greenpoint area in Brooklyn. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and others on the Committee who saw the need for this language, and were willing to act on it. 
   This important amendment directs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a follow up study on the Newtown Creek oil spill. The new EPA study builds upon my earlier effort with my distinguished colleague, Mr. Weiner, to get the EPA to issue a comprehensive report on the oil spill. That earlier report by the EPA, issued last fall, was an important step forward but it raised as many questions as it answered. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is appropriate that we are considering this issue on a Coast Guard bill. It was the Coast Guard, nearly 30 years ago, that discovered the Newtown Creek oil spill in Greenpoint. The spill is massive, and scientists lack accurate measurements of the scope and impact of the whole of the plume. That's why we need a full site characterization of the Creek, so we know just what is in, around and underneath the Creek bed. 
   The basic condition of the Creek was not comprehensively addressed in the earlier report. It's past time for a full site characterization of Newtown Creek. The goal not merely oil plume containment, but plume removal. We must help give this important waterway safely back to the community, for its use and enjoyment. 
   I also am deeply concerned about what threat this material poses to the public. A full site characterization should also allow us to better measure the public health impact of the oil spill. Residents in this part of Brooklyn suffer from asthma, emphysema and bronchitis at a 25 percent higher rate than the rest of the city. Child asthma hospital admissions are especially high. A full site characterization can help public health professionals draw conclusions about the impact of the oil spill on the health of the local community. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Weiner for his long-term partnership and hard work in addressing the serious public policy problem posed by the Newtown Creek Oil Spill. I would urge the EPA to seize upon these clear instructions from Congress, and help New York understand just what it is facing at Newtown Creek. Only a full site characterization can accomplish this worthy goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (RETIRED OFFICERS AS PAWNS OF THE PENTAGON -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday the front page of the New York Times included a story about the efforts of the Pentagon's public affairs operation to influence retired military officers now working as military analysts for some of our Nation's largest media organizations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very angry about the issues raised by the New York Times story, as are many of my colleagues who have called me aside to discuss it. The story does not reflect well on the Pentagon, on the military analysts in question, or on the media organizations that employ them. 
   Mr. Speaker, maybe I am too idealistic, but this story is appalling to me on a number of levels. For me, it all comes down to trust and credibility. And it would be a dangerous thing for the American people to lose trust in the Pentagon, in our retired officers corps, and in the press, each of which has a critical role to play in preserving our Nation's freedoms. 
   Through the years, I have frequently urged our military services to improve their efforts to tell America about the good work that is being done by our country's sons and daughters in the uniform. Our military services have an important story to tell, and public affairs offices are critical to that task. But credibility is paramount. Once lost, it is difficult or impossible to regain. 
   There is nothing inherently wrong with providing information to the public and to the press; but, there is a  problem if the Pentagon is providing special access to retired officers, and then basically using them as pawns to spout the administration's talking points of the day. There are allegations that analysts who failed to deliver the message required by the administration mysteriously lost access to future briefings and information. I find this deeply troubling. We deserve to be able to trust the actions of the Pentagon. 
   We also deserve a retired officer corps that is worthy of the respect it receives from the American people, who place great faith in their judgment and their loyalty to our Nation. Americans trust our Active Duty and retired military, and rightly so. 
   I know a number of the retired officers employed by the media as military analysts to be honorable people. But the special access they are alleged to have received and the circumstances of their employment, without proper disclosure of their outside interests or biases, raise a number of uncomfortable questions that deserve serious answers. 
   Which master do these analysts serve: The United States Government, which supplies their retirement pay? The Pentagon, which may reduce the amount of analysis they actually need to do by providing detailed talking points promoting the current administration's message agenda? The defense contractors, who pay them for serving on boards for their defense expertise and, perhaps more to the point, for their Pentagon connections? 
   Will their analysis, either by design or just by lucky coincidence, result in contracts or other advantages for the companies from which they take home a paycheck? 
   Mr. Speaker, it hurts me to my core to think that there are those from the ranks of our retired officers who have decided to cash in and essentially prostitute themselves on the basis of their previous positions with the Department of Defense. I would hate to think that, because a few people have blurred ethical boundaries and cashed in on their former positions, that we might tarnish the military's hard-won reputation for professionalism and objectivity and love of country first and foremost. 
   Finally, I think our media have a serious responsibility to disclose potential conflicts of interest when they do their reporting. This applies to all of their stories, of course, and not just to those that include retired officer military analysts. I understand that different organizations have different rules, but perhaps it would not be out of order for our journalism schools and professional journalism organizations to develop ethical guidelines for dealing with such issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's military exists to protect America's freedoms for its citizens today and for future generations. The First Amendment guarantees the right of all Americans, including retired servicemembers and members of the press, to speak freely and without restraint. But with our rights come responsibilities to act honestly and ethically. 
   I have no doubt we will continue to discuss these matters in the days ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the Presidential debates of 2004, there was one point of consensus between the two candidates that is important for us in our debate today. In answer to the question of what is the single most threat to the national security of the United States, both candidates agree that nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists was the biggest threat. This view was shared by the 9/11 Commission, which recommended a vital effort to prevent and counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   H.R. 1 will help put the United States much further down the path to addressing the problem of weapons of mass destruction, proliferation, and terrorism. It will strengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction program also, known as the Nunn-Lugar program, as well as the Department of Energy's nonproliferation programs. It will strengthen and expand the multinational Proliferation Security Initiative started by this administration and will establish a new Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism. 
   The bill also establishes a new commission to follow up on the work of the 9/11 Commission focused on the issue of weapons of mass destruction, proliferation, and terrorism. 
   Specifically, the bill will repeal a set of limitations on nonproliferation programs which threatens on an annual basis to shut off access to program funding unless Congress or the President waives them. It simplifies the authority to use those funds outside the countries of the former Soviet Union when necessary and appropriate while strengthening oversight. The bill authorizes such sums as are necessary for these programs. 
   On the Proliferation Security Initiative, the bill calls upon the President to continue and to expand it. It directs the administration to develop and transmit to Congress a defined budget for this effort and initiates a GAO review. The bill further authorizes the President to use foreign assistance as an initiative to get more countries to join. 
   The coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism established by this bill will be a senior aide close to the President who can give the nonproliferation programs spread across the Federal Government the support they need and, of course, deserve. The bill requires a comprehensive strategy to fully use and coordinate these programs, and it calls for measurable goals and milestones by which we can judge progress. 
   The commission established by this bill will build upon the excellent work of the 9/11 Commission by examining in detail the existing nonproliferation programs and also any new and creative ideas for securing dangerous materials. 
   In addition, the commission would follow up on the work of the Baker/Cutler Commission, which made a series of recommendations in this area in 2001. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, as a fellow says back home: You can have your own opinion, but you can't have your own facts. As I said to my friend the gentlewoman from Florida a few moments ago: Read the language. It is not what folks on the other side are saying it is. 
   The Proliferation Security Initiative, as established by the President in 2003,  is among the newer elements of our many efforts to stop proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The PSI is all about the interdiction of weapons of mass destruction and materials, and supports American and international security interests. It is a voluntary agreement that we propose, but we have actively encouraged other nations to participate. 
   It is really pretty simple: It is in American interests to stop ships carrying weapons of mass destruction. It is in our own security interests, if not other countries', to join this effort and take on more of this critical work. The oceans of this earth are vast, and sometimes we are not closest to the ship that must be stopped. We need states all over the world willing to step in.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (HONORING THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE ON THE OCCASION OF THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hail from Lafayette County, Missouri. Its county seat is Lexington, my home. A few miles westbound on Highway 224 are the small towns of Napoleon, Wellington and Waterloo. These communities, which are nestled into the fertile farmland and rolling hills south of the Missouri River, are named after prominent figures or places in French history. They are a very long way from France. But their names and the namesake of my home county, Marquis de Lafayette, reflect a friendship that has existed between the United States and France since the early days of the American Revolution. 
   No one person better symbolizes that friendship and the assistance American colonists received from Europe in our struggle for independence than the Marquis de Lafayette. He occupies a considerable place in the history of the United States, which is why I was  pleased to author H. Res. 171, a resolution honoring the life of the Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of his 250th birthday on September 6, 2007. 
   Lafayette was a man of considerable military skill who sympathized with the American revolutionary fighters. After withdrawing from the French army and traveling across the ocean at his own expense, the Congress voted Lafayette the rank and commission of major general in the Continental Army. His military service during the Revolutionary War was invaluable to George Washington, earning him the reputation as ``the soldier's friend.'' Lafayette's strategic thinking and dedication as a general officer serve as a model for our present day military personnel. 
   After achieving military victory, Lafayette returned to France, helping the U.S. secure trade agreements and critical loans with European nations. He also became a prominent figure in the French Revolution, speaking out in support of universal freedom and human rights. 
   Because of Lafayette's commitment to America, Congress honored him with awards of money and land. Congress was also presented a life-size portrait of Lafayette that hangs here in the Chamber of the House of Representatives. The other large portrait is of President George Washington, Lafayette's closest friend and role model. 
   At the invitation of President James Monroe, Lafayette returned to the United States in 1824. He embarked upon a triumphant tour, during which he visited 24 States, including Missouri, and he became the first foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives. Lafayette also visited many Masonic bodies across America. 
   During this visit and thereafter, various American leaders honored Lafayette by naming cities, towns and counties for him or for his French estate, known as LaGrange. Schools, monuments and parks were named for him throughout the United States. One of the most prominent is Lafayette Park in Washington D.C., which is located directly across from the White House. 
   As we take a moment this year to honor the Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of his 250th birthday, let us remember how he helped secure American independence and helped establish the United States as an international presence. The values of democracy espoused by our Founding Fathers and by Lafayette have been the bedrock of U.S. domestic and international policymaking for generations. I urge all Americans, and especially those wearing the American military uniform, to study Lafayette as America pays tribute to him this year. 
   As we take to the floor today to honor a respected Frenchman, I would be remiss if I did not also take the opportunity to say a word of appreciation to the current French Ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte.     
   Through his time in Washington, I have come to know Ambassador Levitte as a fine person and an outstanding representative of the people of France. Last week, I learned that the newly elected French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, has appointed Ambassador Levitte to be his chief diplomatic adviser. Let me take this means to wish him well as he takes on more responsibilities. But more importantly, let me thank him for his friendship. 
   I ask Members to support H. Res. 171. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that we are able to take this resolution up today honoring the Marquis de Lafayette. Those of us who grew up in Lafayette County knew that there was some special meaning to the name of our county. 
   It was Lillard County once upon a time, and after Lafayette's visit to the State of Missouri, St. Louis to be exact, the General Assembly of our State named the western county which borders Jackson County, which now encompasses Kansas City, named it after Marquis de Lafayette and called it Lafayette County.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me give a special thanks to my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) who, among other assets, has a sense of history which has been exhibited this morning. I appreciate him speaking, as well as the gentleman from Louisiana speaking of his hometown of Lafayette. It was very kind of you to do so, as well as my friend from Texas coming here to discuss the Marquis de Lafayette. 
   As the gentleman from South Carolina has pointed out, Marquis de Lafayette was a very unusual man. Doing what he did at such an early age and making such a great impact upon this country, it is fitting and proper that we, as a body, honor him, honor his memory, and honor the fact that he was of such great assistance and help to General George Washington in those very difficult days. 
   As one leaves Lexington, my hometown, on the Missouri River and travels on Highway 224 towards Kansas City, one goes through Wellington, Missouri; Waterloo, Missouri; and Napoleon, Missouri, in that order, and it is rather interesting that part of French history between Lexington and Kansas City is reflected in the names of those communities. 
   History has not borne out who named them such. There is no way for us to record or learn the genesis of those three names except they do exist, Wellington, Napoleon, and in between, Waterloo. But whoever did it did us all a favor so we can discuss and learn more of history; and today we are learning more about the Marquis de Lafayette and honoring his memory.

   More recently in 2003, the city of Stockton was decimated by a large tornado. The storm damaged or destroyed over 250 homes, killing three residents and injuring numerous others. Since then, the city's been working with residents and both Federal and State authorities to rebuild the downtown and improve upon the public facilities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 47, which I introduced to recognize the extraordinary heroism and sacrifice of the Nation's  Medal of Honor recipients and to increase America's awareness of the significance and meaning of the Medal of Honor among our American citizens. 
   I want to thank my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for being here in support of this issue this afternoon. 
   The Congressional Medal of Honor is our Nation's highest military award for valor in action against an enemy that can be bestowed on any member of the Armed Forces. 
   Since the medal was created in 1861, more than 3,400 individuals who have served our Nation in uniform have been awarded the Medal of Honor. 
   The first medal was established by the United States Navy to recognize sailors and marines who distinguish themselves in war. President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law, and thus the first medal of valor was created. The Army shortly followed in 1862 by establishing a Medal of Honor to recognize commissioned officers and privates who distinguished themselves by their gallantry in action. The Medal of Honor became a permanent decoration in 1863. The first award was given to Army Assistant Surgeon Bernard J.D. Irwin for his bravery in rescuing 60 soldiers at Apache Pass, Arizona, in 1861. 
   It is very interesting, Mr. Speaker, that a Medal of Honor was awarded a Union soldier years after the 1861 Battle of Lexington, Missouri, my hometown, for his gallantry in helping to retake the Anderson House, which was the hospital at the time of that battle, September 18, 19 and 20, 1861. His name was Palmer. 
   The current conflict in Iraq sadly has posthumously added two heroic and courageous individuals to the rolls, Sergeant First Class Paul Smith of the United States Army, and Corporal Jason Dunham of the United States Marines. These two individuals continue to epitomize the recipients of the Medal of Honor, whose uncommon valor and extraordinary bravery are standard characteristics.     
   It is interesting to note also, Mr. Speaker, that in the history of the medal, 19 men received a second award. 14 of them received two separate medals for separate actions, and one was awarded to a woman. Of the more than 3,400 medals awarded, 266 of those were awarded for action during World War II, and 154 were awarded for action during the Vietnam conflict. Today there are only 111 living recipients of the Medal of Honor. America is rapidly losing its greatest and true heroes. 
   It is also important to note that when Missouri's President, Harry Truman, awarded the Medal of Honor to a soldier at the end of the Second World War, he said he would rather have this medal than being president. 
   The resolution before the House seeks to recognize the heroism and sacrifice of the Nation's Medal of Honor recipients, and to urge the establishment of a National Medal of Honor Day to ensure that all Americans continue to celebrate and to honor the contributions and ideals that the Medal of Honor recipients exemplify. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, our purpose is to defend America and American interests, American citizens. And this bill is a good bill. I speak for this rule. I speak for it because this is a balanced rule. On the one hand, it helps protect Americans; on the other hand, it is a balance in favor of the Constitution. We have to keep, of course, those two goals in mind, but keeping in mind the fact that we need good intelligence, and this is a means and the law to allow us to get good intelligence and protect America and American interests.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the Congress and the President have come together to find common ground on the fiscal year 2008 budget. It is often said that politics is the art of compromise, and the bill we are considering today--H.R. 2764--represents a compromise position that allows the Congressional majority to advance some of its priorities while adhering to the President's overall budgetary constraints. 
   H.R. 2764 funds a number of programs that are important to the American people, including investments in education, life-saving medical research, law enforcement, border security, veterans' health care, and energy independence initiatives. 
   H.R. 2764 is especially good for rural America. The bill rejects deep cuts that were proposed by the President in rural health care, housing, economic development, Internet access, and law enforcement programs. At the same time, the bill nearly doubles funds available for renewable energy loans and grants in rural areas, commits significant resources to fix aging bridges, and adds $1 million to the President's request for rural drinking water and waste water infrastructure projects. Additionally, the measure slashes funding for the Administration's efforts to create a National Animal Identification Program, reducing it by $23 million. 
   H.R. 2764 also extends through December 31, 2007, most of the agricultural disaster assistance programs included as part of the emergency supplemental spending bill signed into law earlier this year. These programs allow many American farmers to recoup some losses associated with drought and other natural disasters in 2005, 2006, or in the first two months of 2007. Between February and December of this year, Missouri farmers have seen their fair share of damaging weather events. I am pleased that Congress is extending disaster programs that may be beneficial to qualifying Show-Me State producers. 
   The measure also funds U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. And, while I would have preferred to send the President war funding legislation that sets a goal of redeploying most American troops from Iraq by next Christmas, H.R. 2764 will provide our service men and women with the resources they need to do their jobs while serving in harm's way and will alleviate any need by the Administration to reallocate funds from domestic military operations. 
   H.R. 2764 represents a compromise bill that is in the best interest of our Nation. I am pleased to support its passage and urge the President to sign it into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend and colleague, MARTY MEEHAN, the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. I would like to thank him on behalf of the committee for his distinguished service to our country and to the men and women who wear the uniform. 
   MARTY came to the House of Representatives in 1993 to represent the Fifth District of Massachusetts. He's worked tirelessly to encourage economic development in the area, to redevelop and maintain the military presence at Fort Devens, and to preserve over 10,000 acres of open space in Massachusetts. 
   Additionally, MARTY was the lead Democrat sponsor of the Shays-Meehan-McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002. 
   MARTY has served on the Armed Services Committee since coming to the House of Representatives in the early 1990s. Marty was the ranking member of the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and has been an active member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, where Marty has had a strong interest in helping Reservists and Guardsmen in their transition from military to civilian life. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, MARTY has led a bipartisan investigation into the development of the Iraqi Security Forces. The product of this investigation, a report on subcommittee's findings and recommendations, was unanimously agreed upon and signed by every member of that subcommittee. The report seeks to present information for the public debate and recommends increased transparency into the training of the Iraqi Security Forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish MARTY MEEHAN the best of luck as he leaves this institution to serve as the next chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, let me take this means to congratulate Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt, also a senior and well-respected member of the House Armed Services Committee, for crafting a strong, balanced budget for fiscal year 2009. I am pleased to support this bill that would provide for a strong national defense, would put our country on a path to budget surpluses in 2012, would promote tax relief for middle-class American families, and would invest in programs that have been priorities for those living in rural Missouri. 
   On defense, the House Budget Resolution would prioritize resources to restore military readiness that has been worn down by repeated deployments and more than 6 years of war. The resolution would reject TRICARE fee increases, provide funding to continue addressing problems such as those identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and would call for enhanced pay and benefits to improve the quality of life of our troops and their families. 
   On rural affairs, the House Budget Resolution would bolster commodity support, agricultural research, and animal and plant inspection programs. It would assume sufficient resources for the Farm Bill, which provides Missouri farmers with a secure economic safety. It would also set aside critical funds for rural development, for food and nutrition programs, and for conservation. 
   Also important to Fourth District residents are commitments in the House Budget Resolution to infrastructure improvements, to local police and firefighters, to the health care needs of Missouri's senior citizens and low-income children, to education, and to our cherished veterans. 
   The resolution would provide immediate and long-term relief from the alternative minimum tax and provide for additional middle-class tax relief and enhanced economic equity through tax policies. And, importantly, it would adhere to the ``pay-as-you-go'' rule adopted by House Democrats early in 2007. That rule requires new entitlement spending or revenue reductions to be offset so the budget remains in balance. 
   On behalf of the rural Missourians I am privileged to represent, I am pleased to support Chairman Spratt's work product.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Capuano, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent resolution (H. Con.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION MUST ADDRESS NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGES -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, we need to begin planning now for the issues our country must focus on when the new President takes office. 
   This will be the first presidential transition to occur during a time of war in many years. In addition, the next administration will face enormous budget pressures and national security challenges that will require sustained spending and the partnership of the Congress. Let me take this opportunity to discuss what I believe will be the top defense challenges for our next President. 
   First, we must develop a clear strategy to guide national security policy. Since World War II, the United States has been the indispensable Nation. But our Nation's ability to sustain this leadership role is jeopardized because we lack a comprehensive strategy to advance U.S. interests. 
   The next President must collaborate with Congress and the American people to formulate a new, broadly understood and accepted strategy to advance our national security interests. The next Quadrennial Defense Review of the Department of Defense must translate this strategy into a clear roadmap for organizing the Department and setting priorities in the next 4 years. 
   Second, we must restore America's credibility in the world. The full range of threats to our national security can only be addressed through the consistent and determined efforts of multiple nations working together. The new President will set the tone, but the U.S. can only lead and help reinvigorate international institutions if other nations believe we are credible, just, and intend our efforts to serve interests beyond our own. 
   Third, we must refocus our efforts on Afghanistan. The situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating. Violence by the Taliban and al Qaeda is rising. Attacks against the coalition are increasing. And, safe havens in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region are thriving. The genesis of the 9/11 attack was in Afghanistan, and any future attack on our homeland is likely to originate in Afghanistan or in the border region with Pakistan. 
   Until our country is prepared to lead and act decisively and persistently, problems in Afghanistan will continue to fester. Our efforts in Iraq have diverted resources and focus away from the war in Afghanistan. We must refocus our efforts, and work with the international community to provide the necessary leadership, strategy, and resources to Afghanistan to ensure success in that mission. 
   Fourth, we must responsibly redeploy from Iraq. The men and women of our Armed Forces have done a magnificent job in Iraq, but the citizens of both the United States and Iraq agree that it is time for the U.S. military to come home. Our challenge is to manage that redeployment and to ensure that it reduces further strain on our military without jeopardizing the gains made in Iraq. 
   We must continue to protect U.S. citizens in Iraq, pursue terrorists, and help train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces. U.S. combat forces must be freed up to begin the process of resetting, rebuilding, and also refocusing in Afghanistan. The United States will face new challenges to our security and our interests in the future, and we will need the military units that are in Iraq to be returned to their full capability to effectively address them.     
   Fifth, we must recruit and retain a high-quality force. Our forces are the most highly trained and educated in the world, but we face serious challenges to maintain the quality of force we have today. 
   The cost to recruit and retain servicemembers has skyrocketed in recent years. And the tendency of Americans to serve in uniform has significantly declined as fewer young people are exposed to the military experience. Finding men and women who are physically and mentally qualified and willing to serve is an ongoing challenge. 
   Sixth, we must ensure a high state of readiness for our forces. Our troops have been engaged in combat operations for nearly 7 years, and it has strained our military to the breaking point. Restoring readiness will take a significant investment of time and money, easily exceeding $100 million, but it must be done if we are to expect our military to respond ably when we need them. We are already at risk. Either we fix our readiness problems immediately, or else risk emboldening those who would seek to do us harm. 
   Seven. We must develop a more comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. With the al Qaeda and affiliated groups still presenting a major threat, the United States must apply ``lessons learned'' and be open to the advice of our allies. The key is to fight smarter and not necessarily harder by more effectively utilizing a range of tools beyond just the military-led, kinetic approaches to counterterrorism. 
   The new administration must more aggressively pursue strategic communications strategies, intelligence and policing work, targeted development assistance, and a range of other counterinsurgency and irregular warfare tools. 
   Eight, we must strike a balance between the near-term fixes and long-term modernization. 
   Each of the military services will have to address the fundamental imbalances in their current plans to simultaneously modernize and reset equipment, grow the number of ships in our Navy. 
   Nine, we must reform the interagency process. 
   And, ten, we must deal with the looming defense health care crisis.  
   With increasing defense health care costs, difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical professionals, and the overwhelming demand placed on the medical system as it attempts to support thousands of men and women returning from combat, as well as their families, there is a perfect storm brewing, and in the next few years, that storm will be upon us. 
   These and other national defense challenges will confront our Nation in the months and years ahead, and Congress and the administration must work together on a bipartisan basis to seriously address these issues. The security of the American people is at stake.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, as a representative of rural Missouri, let me take this opportunity to share my support for the 2008 farm bill. 
   I commend Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for producing a balanced and bipartisan bill that would bring a level of stability to commodity markets and ensure farmers throughout the United States can make long-term business decisions. 
   Important to farm families in the Show-Me State, the 2008 farm bill would extend the farm program safety net for producers while also reforming eligibility requirements and strengthening payment limitations for those who receive farm program payments. While I cannot overemphasize the importance of having a safety net in place to help farmers recoup some expenses associated with agricultural production and to ensure they are not put out of business if markets collapse, I am pleased that reforms were made to address some concerns of the administration and other farm program critics. 
   In addition to ensuring a strong safety net, the farm bill would make historic commitments to food security and nutrition, expand conservation, promote rural development, streamline agricultural research, and invest in renewable energy. 
   The farm bill would make essential commitments to the health of the American people and would help families in need by boosting nutrition funding by over $10 billion. In Missouri and elsewhere, food pantries are short of food and low-income Americans are having a difficult time affording groceries. The legislation would allocate resources to food banks, modernize the food stamp program, expand farmers' markets, extend food programs for low-income senior citizens and pregnant women, promote student health, and fight obesity. 
   The farm bill would expand popular conservation programs designed to preserve farmland, improve water quality, and enhance soil conservation, air quality, and wildlife habitat. In Missouri, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program, among others, have allowed farmers to more easily address conservation problems and comply with expensive, but important, environmental regulations. 
   By expanding USDA rural development loans and grants, the farm bill would foster critical investments in small town America. The measure would improve rural Internet broadband access, expand first responder and emergency medical services in rural areas, and authorize grants for weather radio transmitters to alert rural citizens about coming storms. It would also provide grants for drinking water and wastewater improvements, foster rural small business development, and provide for greater value-added loans and grants for small farmers. 
   With respect to research and development, the farm bill would create a National Institute of Food and Agriculture within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to maximize coordination throughout USDA's research  agencies. The bill would also create the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative to stimulate business development and access to capital in rural America and create the Energy Research Program to improve research on the production and sustainability of biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel. Additionally, the bill would address concerns raised by livestock producers and others regarding the high cost of corn by slightly reducing the corn ethanol producers' tax credit and creating a subsidy to accelerate commercialization of advanced biofuels, like cellulosic ethanol. 
   Also important to Missourians, the farm bill would continue price supports for dairy farmers and increase funding for fruit and vegetable producers. It also contains the first-ever Livestock Title, which would increase market access for small, state-inspected meat processing plants, better protect producers who have contracts with livestock firms, and better enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act. Additionally, the legislation would require that all meat sold to American consumers have a country-of-origin label. But, importantly, this labeling agreement represents a compromise that would simplify record keeping and other requirements associated with the law. 
   The farm bill would also prohibit the closure or relocation of county Farm Service Agency offices for 2 years, would encourage additional funding directed to Historically Black Colleges, like Lincoln University in Jefferson City, and would establish an Office of Homeland Security within USDA to better protect our Nation from terrorist attacks aimed at America's agricultural sector. 
   The people of Missouri and Americans from all walks of life do well by the 2008 farm bill. I am pleased to lend my support to it and hope it will pass the House with broad, bipartisan support. I further hope that the President of the United States will reconsider his threat to veto the farm bill, which would be a disservice to rural Americans and to low-income citizens of our Nation who would benefit from the bill's commitment to food security.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, from the time I was young, I was taught that a farmer's livelihood depends on two things: the weather and the markets. While the government can't control the weather, federal Farm Bills provide an invaluable safety net, bringing a level of stability to commodity markets that helps farmers stay in business, make plans for the future, and continue to feed America and the world. 
   The 2007 Farm Bill would ensure farmers have economic stability by continuing the direct payment program and by keeping in place a strong safety net that allows producers to recoup some of their losses when agricultural markets collapse. The bill would give farmers the option of participating in the counter-cyclical initiative that was created in 2002 or in a new, revenue-driven program. 
   At the same time, the legislation would make historic reforms by prohibiting those who earn more than $1 million in annual adjusted gross income from receiving federal agricultural subsidies, by closing loopholes that have allowed some people to avoid payment limits, and by re-balancing loan rates. These changes in current programs would free up additional revenue for the safety net and for the bill's investments in conservation, nutrition, rural development, and renewable energy. 
   The Farm Bill would make conservation a top priority by increasing funding and access to conservation programs that preserve farmland, improve water quality and quantity, and enhance soil conservation, air quality, and wildlife habitat. Missouri is a very conservation friendly state, and the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, among others, have allowed farmers to more easily address conservation problems and comply with expensive, but important, environmental regulations. 
   By extending and improving the food stamp program and making a strong commitment to other nutrition initiatives, the 2007 Farm Bill would promote the health of the American people and help families in need. The measure would also renew our commitment to rural development, agricultural research, forestry and energy. Important to Missouri's corn and soybean producers, it would authorize $2 billion in loan guarantees for biorefineries to help finance the cost of developing and constructing renewable fuel facilities. In Saline County, I have witnessed the overwhelming success of Mid-Missouri Energy's ethanol production plant. I am hopeful this bill will foster similar success stories in Missouri and across our land. 
   Also important to Missourians, the Farm Bill would continue price supports for dairy farmers and create programs for fruit producers. It would also require that all meat sold to American consumers have a country-of-origin label beginning in September 2008. The measure retains the current prohibition on creating a national animal identification to verify the animal's country-of-origin. 
   I praise Chairman Collin Peterson and other members of the Agriculture Committee for producing a good bipartisan bill. I support it, urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it, and ask them to defeat any attempt to strip away the meaningful safety net included in this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (AMERICA'S HISTORICAL AND NATURAL LEGACY STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me take this means to express my support for H.R. 3998, which includes a piece of legislation entitled the ``Harry S. Truman Birthplace Study Act,'' which I introduced on July 31, 2007. That particular bill would direct the Interior Secretary to study the feasibility of adding the Harry S. Truman Birthplace State Historic Site in Lamar, MO, to our system of National Parks. 
   I was honored to introduce this legislation on behalf of the people of Lamar, a community located in Southwestern Missouri that has done much groundwork for the inclusion of the State Historic Site in our Federal system. The bill would further honor the 33rd President of the United States and Missouri's favorite son, President Harry S. Truman. 
   On May 8, 1884, Harry Truman was born in a downstairs bedroom of a small frame house in Lamar, MO. The Truman birthplace, which the family occupied until Harry was 11 months old, was built between 1880 and 1882. In 1959, the United Auto Workers donated the home to the State of Missouri, after buying it some years earlier to preserve its rich cultural significance. Since its addition to the Missouri State Parks System, much work has been done to maintain the dignity and historical relevance of the residence, and many Americans make their way through the site each year. 
   When the Mayor of Lamar, Keith Divine, wrote to me earlier this year asking me to introduce legislation to begin the process of including President Truman's birthplace in our National Park System, I was honored to oblige. In my view and in the view of the local community, doing so would add perhaps the most critical piece of Harry Truman's life, the place of his birth, to the current group of national historic sites that honor the legacy of our 33rd President. And, doing so would foster economic development in Lamar and in Barton County. 
   As a matter of record, let me share with you briefly my personal connection with President Truman and with the legislation creating the original Harry S. Truman National Historic Site in Independence, MO. 
   I came to personally know President Truman through my father, Ike Skelton, Sr., who developed a friendship with him some 78 years ago at the dedication of the Pioneer Mother Statue--the Madonna of the Trail--located in my hometown of Lexington, MO. At that time, Harry Truman was a county commissioner in neighboring Jackson County and my father was a well-known lawyer and Democrat. Through the years, I developed my own friendship with this genuinely nice person we call the ``Man from Independence.'' 
   He was a son of rural Missouri whose handshake was firm, whose honesty and personal integrity were never questioned, and whose devotion to his beloved wife, Bess, to his daughter Margaret Truman Daniel, and to his friends was enduring. He led our country through some difficult periods and made courageous, principled decisions during his presidency. 
   In the past, Congress has honored President Truman by designating sites in Missouri important to his life as part of America's National Park System. In 1982 and 1983, I worked with the late Senator Tom Eagleton and former Senator Jack Danforth to pass legislation designating the home of Harry and Bess Truman in Independence, MO, as the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site. The site, which consisted at that time of President and Mrs. Truman's home at 219 N. Delaware Street, was willed to the Archivist of the United States when Mrs. Truman passed away in October 1982. 
   Because the National Park Service, rather than the Archivist, has the Federal responsibility of administering national historic sites, the property and its historic contents became stuck in limbo, with only minimal protection and threatened by possible vandalism, theft, or fire. At that time, there was an urgent need to protect this important property, so I requested the Secretary of the Interior to exercise his authority to designate and administer President Truman's home as a national historic site. The Department refused, and I quickly introduced legislation to establish the site. My bill passed the House on December 13, 1982, but the Senate failed to act on it before the end of the session. 
   Fortunately, the Interior Secretary came to his senses and signed a secretarial order designating the home as a national historic site. In 1983, however, I wrote legislation to codify the Secretary's directive. In May 1983, Congress unanimously approved and President Ronald Reagan signed into law my bill that created the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site in Independence. 
   Since that time, Congress has authorized the National Park Service to add other historically significant Truman family sites to the Federal property--in 1989, additional family homes near 219 Delaware Street and in 1993, the Truman Farm Home near Grandview, MO. 
   So, here we are on December 4, 2007, considering my legislation to direct the Interior Secretary to study whether it is feasible to include another important historic site--President Truman's birthplace--to our National Park System. 
   As someone who cherishes the life and legacy of Harry Truman, I am hopeful this bill will become law and that the National Park Service's study will proceed quickly and will yield favorable results. 
   Over the years, Lamar, the State of Missouri, and the University of Missouri Extension have put into place a development plan for the Harry S. Truman Birthplace State Historic Site. If approved, I am confident the Federal study will look favorably upon the community's work and will take into consideration the positive economic impact for the Lamar and Barton County area, which has experienced considerable economic hardship in recent months because a major employer, O'Sullivan Industries, closed its doors. 
   I urge my colleagues to approve H.R. 3998 today.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (ON THE UNITED STATES ROLE IN THE WORLD -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again to discuss the need for a comprehensive strategy to advance U.S. interests in the world. Last week I delivered two addresses on this topic. In the second speech, I argued that our understanding of the role the U.S. should play in the world is a foundation of our strategy. It will define our vital interests, and it will condition the means we use for advancing those interests. 
   Today, the United States is the world's dominant economic, political, and military power. There is no peer or near-peer competitor to us, nor does one appear likely to emerge in the near future. Some have characterized the U.S. as a hegemonic power or as the world's policeman, both those who approve and those who disapprove of such a state of affairs. President Clinton, echoing Winston Churchill, eloquently described a vision of the U.S. as ``the indispensable nation,'' not a world hegemon but a consistent and ever-present ally and arbiter acting around the world. 
   Still others advocate that the U.S. withdraw from a place of central prominence on the world stage to avoid the costs and implicit responsibilities of that role. I believe the U.S. should remain the world's indispensable nation and in a later speech, I will discuss the  ways in which this role should inform the formulation of our comprehensive strategy, but first let me discuss the other options. 
   Those who would have us significantly reduce our role on the world's stage cannot provide a credible description of who or what would replace the U.S. in the role of world leadership. The U.N. is not up to the task, nor is there any other international organization. As already mentioned, there is no other country in a position to fill the role of world leadership. 
   To embrace such an approach, we would have to accept that significant portions of the world would simply be left to their own devices. Yet we know that places as remote as the Hindu Kush are home to those who would attack us and our allies. What other corner of the world, then, do we judge to be so distant and so remote as to be beyond our interest? And how would world fault lines, such as the Taiwan Strait, the India-Pakistan Line of Control, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict respond to a world leadership vacuum? The answer is, not well. In short, for the U.S. to abdicate its position of world leadership would be highly detrimental to our national interest. 
   What then does accepting a role of world leadership entail? And if it is a current necessity, is it an inherent good to be indefinitely maintained? In other words, should the U.S. view our position as world leader as so necessary to our security that we act largely to maintain this position, which is the primary characteristic of a hegemonic power or empire? Again, the answer is no. To do so is to put our national interest in opposition to the national interests of much of the rest of the world. It is inconsistent with the desires of the American people, with the extent of the costs they're willing to bear for world leadership and, I would argue, with our sense of morality and fair play. Our vital interests should be defined as suggested by President Clinton, by our role as the world's indispensable nation: taking a leadership role in advancing and protecting our interests around the world in concert with our friends and allies as part of an open and evolving international system that is fair to all nations. To do so, we must restore the prestige and credibility of the United States, and repair and rebuild the relationship with our major international partners. With this role as our goal, we can define those interests critical to achieving it, and develop and adopt an appropriate strategy.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and compliment him on his efforts in this very, very difficult situation. 
   What is wrong with doing what we are doing? Yesterday in the Armed Services Committee, or I should say early this morning in the Armed Services Committee, we passed a bill out that had as its pole star the readiness of our military. That is what this effort is about. The readiness, the funding, more than the White House has requested of us, and that is what this is all about. The young men and young women are entitled to have the funding come to them, and that is what this does. 
   I find no fault with having our looking at it as a benchmark for us, as a benchmark for those of us who fund the troops. We are not rubber stamps; we are a co-equal branch of the government. And as such, our voices should be heard and there should be an agreement with what we are trying to do: readiness and benchmarks. And that is just what we are asking this body to vote upon. 
   In addition thereto, there is a proposal in this measure I suggested some time ago, actually in late 2005, to the President that there be a measurement of redeployment for the American troops. I suggested to him that for every three brigades of the Iraqi Army brought to level one that one American brigade be redeployed. I got an answer back from the President, and when I brought it to his attention, he said it was too rigid. When truth, in fact, it ought to be, and as it is in this legislation, this bill, for every one soldier or battalion or brigade that is brought to level one in the Iraqi Army, there would be a redeployment of the American soldier, platoon, battalion, brigade at any level. It should be soldier for soldier. It is their country. We have been there over 4 years, and I think it is time to pass that baton on for the security of that country to be taken over by the Iraqis themselves. That is what the formula does, one on one. And I strongly endorse it. 
   I urge the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Chairman, this evening I rise in strong support of H.R. 2082, the Intelligence Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2008. Let me take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from Texas, Silver Reyes, on the work that he does. 
   It is especially important, Madam Chairman, that he is a member of the Armed Services Committee, and he is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and it is one of those rare moments where the two very important committees are glued together, and he does that. And from our perspective, it is a good, good piece of evidence that he is the chairman and is doing such an excellent job in both respects. 
   Every day American men and women are deployed into harm's way and depend on the military intelligence capabilities authorized by this bill. It is important for them to achieve their missions. And this legislation assures continued delivery of our intelligence to our warfighters. It will lead to important improvements in the future. 
   I am also pleased to report that this bill reflects a new more cooperative relationship, as I mentioned, between the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee in guiding and overseeing the Nation's military intelligence program. 
   Chairman Reyes and I have been working together to craft common approaches on key issues by our shared jurisdiction. For example, both this bill and the National Defense Authorization bill that we marked up late last night in committee contain provisions requiring reports on the national security implications of global warming. And that is no small thing. 
   And the committees, we are working together on significant changes in key space programs to ensure that both the intelligence analysts and the warfighter receive critical information in a timely manner, and that is so important. 
   Again, let me take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Reyes for bringing this to the floor. Intelligence is the key to so many areas, in particular the military and security forums of our country. So I congratulate the gentleman from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (HONORING THE LIFE, LEGACY AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LAMAR HUNT -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the gentleman from Missouri, the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver, for spearheading the effort in Congress to honor Kansas City Chiefs Founder Lamar Hunt, who passed away in December 2006 after living a long and distinguished life. As the Fifth District's U.S. representative and the former mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Mr. Cleaver understands better than anyone in the House how special Lamar Hunt's Chiefs are to the Kansas City community and to people all throughout the Show-Me State. 
   Missouri's Fourth District, which I am privileged to represent, includes portions of the Kansas City suburbs and most of the rural, west central section of the State. Many of the Missourians who call the Fourth District home are proud Chiefs fans. They don jerseys, t-shirts, hats, and flags emblazoned with the red team color of the Chiefs and travel great distances to watch the Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium. Among the people, there is a great deal of pride for the Chiefs. 
   Missourians who love the Kansas City Chiefs and the National Football League, NFL, owe a debt of gratitude to Chiefs founder Lamar Hunt, who in 1963 moved the Dallas Texans to Kansas City. For 40 years, Mr. Hunt owned and was a critical participant in the Chiefs football club. Under his leadership, the Chiefs won the American Football League Championship game in 1966 and in 1969 and won the National Football League Super Bowl IV Championship in 1970. And, while the team has been competitive through most of its history, it experienced a renaissance after Mr. Hunt hired General Manager Carl Peterson in 1988. 
   Mr. Hunt also helped mold the direction of the modern-day NFL and served as the driving force behind the merger of the American and National football leagues in 1970. He founded the American Football League at the age of 27 and created and named the championship game known as the Super Bowl. Throughout his career, he advocated for innovative and progressive changes to enhance the NFL, including the inclusion of the two point conversion option for professional football, placing names on the backs of the uniforms, naming the Super Bowl trophy after Vince Lombardi, and adding another Thanksgiving game to the NFL schedule. 
   In recognition of Mr. Hunt's work in football, he was enshrined in the Professional Football Hall of Fame in 1972, was inducted into the NFL Alumni Association's prestigious Order of the Leather Helmet, and received the Francis J. ``Reds'' Bagnell Award from the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia. The NFL also named the American Football Conference, AFC, trophy, which is presented each year to the AFC champion, the ``Lamar Hunt Trophy.'' 
   In addition to football, Mr. Hunt was dedicated to other sports, including soccer, basketball, and tennis. He was also a highly successful businessman and philanthropist. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lamar Hunt was a remarkable man. Though he was born in Arkansas and lived much of his life in Texas, his decision to establish the Kansas City Chiefs in Missouri has endeared him to Show-Me State residents. And, he made his mark in the history of  the United States by helping to create the NFL, which is revered by so many Americans. As the House of Representatives prepares to pass legislation today to honor Mr. Hunt's life and legacy, let us remember his unique contributions to Missouri and to our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I strongly support H.R. 556, and I voted for it when it first came through House, passing by a vote of 423-0. I support the bill because it will protect the critical technologies and the critical infrastructure of this country by ensuring that these invaluable assets remain in friendly and responsible hands. In so doing, it strengthens our national security, and I think the bill makes many needed changes, especially by adding homeland security and critical infrastructure as essential elements to be considered for protection during national security investigations, and also by adding opportunities for congressional oversight in the process. In short, I'm in complete agreement with the intent of this bill. 
   I've been working with the chairman, however, to try and clarify some elements of the bill that may not make the intent of Congress fully clear. I believe that it is the intent of the Congress in this legislation to extend the current practice of seeking consensus in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. This practice requires that transactions being reviewed and investigated by the committee must satisfy the concerns of all the agencies involved. 
   I believe that it is also Congress' intent under this legislation that the appropriate committees of the House, including all relevant committees with a jurisdictional interest in the outcomes of specific transactions under review, be kept informed by the executive branch. 
   And lastly, I believe that it's the intent of Congress in this legislation to require the executive branch to monitor and enforce the mitigation agreements imposed under this legislation to ensure compliance and to regularly review compliance with these mitigation agreements.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, since World War II, America's middle class has been built and strengthened by the auto industry--not just by the companies that make cars and trucks but also by those that make parts for them. In Missouri, the auto industry is particularly important to our economy, creating hundreds of well paying jobs in Kansas City and St. Louis, and in smaller towns like Sedalia and Versailles. 
   Sadly, because of a variety of conditions that have been made worse by the global credit crisis, the auto industry has fallen on terribly difficult times and is on the verge of collapse. The urgency of the automakers' troubles has prompted our debate today in Congress. 
   The auto industry is unique in our country and must be given a chance to restructure and become more viable into the future. Without assistance, the industry will likely fail and millions of jobs will be in jeopardy. 
   Today's legislation has been carefully written with views incorporated from Congressional Republicans and Democrats and from the President. It would provide immediate help to the auto industry and its employees while simultaneously forcing them to become leaner, greener, and more competitive in the 21st century. 
   The bill would authorize a loan of up to $15 billion to the car companies in exchange for their promise to draw up more realistic business plans. To ensure the industry restructures according to the law, a powerful ``car czar'' would manage the process and have a great deal of authority with respect to lending money and recalling loans, if necessary. 
   The bill would further protect taxpayers by allowing them to profit from a participating  companies' recovery and by requiring that the government be repaid before other lenders. It also would prohibit auto company shareholders from earning dividends during the life of the loans, would ban excessive corporate pay and the ownership of private aircraft by auto companies, and would require strong, independent oversight by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. 
   I am unhappy that we find ourselves considering a loan of such magnitude to America's auto industry. But, after careful consideration and review, I am convinced that inaction by Congress would be far more catastrophic to American workers, to the fragile economy, and to our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring forward for consideration this bill, H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. This bill is the House Armed Services Committee's first step to address the challenges and the obstacles that wounded and injured servicemembers face during their recovery at Walter Reed Medical Center, and at all military medical facilities around the world. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am glad this bill is a product of a strong bipartisan effort to support our troops. While recognizing the ranking member of the committee, DUNCAN HUNTER, and the House Veterans Affairs Chairman, BOB FILNER, and STEVE BUYER, the ranking member, for their support and contributions to this bill, I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the substantial contributions of the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairman, VIC SNYDER, and JOHN MCHUGH, the ranking member, for their considerable help during the development of this bill in committee. 
   Their knowledge and insights and understanding of the complex medical and disability systems that our servicemembers and their families are undergoing help to ensure that the bill before us today will have an immediate and positive impact on the lives of the wounded servicemembers as well as their families. 
   Mr. Chairman, the committee moved expeditiously to make changes that can be adopted fairly quickly after hearing what our wounded soldiers and their families are continuing to face at Walter Reed Hospital. However, these soldiers were not alone. The committee has heard of similar challenges that other soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that are experiencing the same type of treatment across the country. 
   Sadly, what happened at Walter Reed was more than just a leadership failure in the Army. It is symptomatic of the enormous and complex factors that affect military medicine. 
   Yet while those in military medicine provide outstanding quality health care to wounded and injured soldiers, other factors brought to bear on this system also contribute to the state of affairs at Walter Reed Hospital as well as other medical facilities throughout our Nation. 
   Over the past several years, military medicine has been forced to convert thousands of military medical positions to civilian positions. One could ask how this could have an impact on our wounded forces, and the answer is clear and simple; fewer uniformed medical providers means fewer providers left at military hospitals back home treating injured and treating the wounded servicemembers. It also means that those in uniform who do remain will continue to face a high and sustained operational tempo, greater deployments and more time away from home. And yet the Navy, for example, has proposed for fiscal year 2008 to cut an additional 900 medical providers, including, Mr. Chairman, 100 doctors that provide needed health care to servicemembers as well as their families. That is why the committee chose to move quickly on this bill that will provide quick and immediate help to our troops. 
   It is clear that continued and persistent problems that were highlighted at Walter Reed Hospital require closer inspection and may demand a significant and comprehensive overhaul of the entire process. 
   As the Armed Services Committee continues to work on the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization bill, we will continue our efforts to examine greater comprehensive reforms to ensure that our forces receive the high quality care that our Nation has an obligation to provide for those wonderful young people in uniform. 
   However, H.R. 1538 is vitally needed now to provide immediate support for our wounded warriors. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is truly a bipartisan effort. I thank Mr. Hunter and Dr. SNYDER, our chairman of our Subcommittee on Personnel, JOHN MCHUGH from New York. All have done superb work on this bill. 
   It makes some improvements to the medical and dental care for members in an outpatient status. 
   It establishes a toll-free hotline for reporting deficiencies in medical-related support facilities. 
   It requires Members of Congress to be notified of combat-wounded servicemembers who have been hospitalized. 
   It creates an independent medical advocate for members undergoing a medical evaluation board. 
   It improves the training and reduces the workload for Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officers. 
   It standardizes the training program and curriculum for the Department of Defense Disability Evaluation System. 
   It enhances the training for health care professionals. 
   It would improve the transition for servicemembers between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   It provides a $50 million fund to support programs and activities related to medical treatment and care. 
   It would create an Oversight Board for Wounded Warriors. 
   It requires an annual report of the state of military medical facilities. 
   It requires an evaluation and report on the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Evaluation Systems. 
   It requires a study of the support services available for families of recovering servicemembers. 
   And at the behest of Mr. Ortiz, it places a 1-year moratorium on A-76 studies at any military medical facility. 
   It is clear, Mr. Chairman, that the continued and persistent problems that were highlighted at the Walter Reed Hospital require closer inspection and may demand a significant and comprehensive overhaul of the process.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Texas for giving me this opportunity to speak so I can applaud my friend, John Spratt, the gentleman from South Carolina, for bringing to this House floor a fiscally responsible budget, particularly as it relates to defense. It is an excellent budget. 
   The fiscal year 2008 budget resolution provides the same level of funding for national defense as was requested by the President. It provides for $507 billion for national defense and another $145 billion for overseas deployments, numbers consistent with the CBO's reestimates of the President's budget. 
   The budget resolution includes proposals that would reorient the national defense priorities, including more funding for CTR and nonproliferation programs, which I think are very important, and greater assistance for wounded veterans, including fixing the problems at Walter Reed. This is serious. 
   Earlier today we passed legislation that was the first step in fixing the challenges at Walter Reed Hospital, and this budget resolution gives us greater assistance in doing just that, and we will be able to do that in the Armed Services Committee. 
   The budget resolution also calls for a significant increase in funding for veterans' health, and I fully support this proposal which falls within the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Budget resolutions are difficult at best. But if you look at it through the eyes of the Committee on Armed Services and if you look at it through the eyes of national security, this is an excellent approach. It gives us the opportunity to work our will within the committee, to make things even better, particularly for the young men and women in uniform. They are our national treasures, and this budget resolution gives us the opportunity to do something positive about that. 
   Again, I thank my friend from Texas.

   Mr. Speaker, out of all of this Iraq business, there's one star, and that star, as every American should know and appreciate, is the young American in uniform. That is the purpose of this legislation, and I take this opportunity to compliment those who serve our country wherever they may be, those in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world or here within our United States. I'm proud of them. And they are our stars. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have been engaged in Iraq since March of 2003. And in hearing discussion on the rule, it's obvious that some people wish to confuse the effort in Afghanistan with the effort in Iraq. They are separate and distinct. 
   The war in Afghanistan is something that we needed to do. The Taliban government gave sanctuary to the al Qaeda terrorists in that country of Afghanistan, and we did the right thing by going in there. 
   The war in Iraq is one of choice. There have been discussions and difficulty and debate over how we got there, but we are there. But people should know that the insurgency in Iraq and the subsequent sectarian violence between the Shiite and Sunni is a different and distinct war from that in Afghanistan. 
   You know, in history, we learn from the past. Strategic mistakes have been made, and we're supposed to learn from that. And we have to go to our revolution in 1776, when the British General Howell did not follow up his victories against George Washington's troops on Long Island. Consequently, George Washington's troops were able to encamp at Valley Forge and later attack successfully Trenton and New Jersey. That was a strategic mistake that allowed our revolution to be successful. 
   Lee's invasion of the north, the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg, were strategic mistakes of the Confederacy. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, sadly, we have seen not only strategic mistakes in Iraq, we have seen irretrievable strategic mistakes; no plan for the aftermath, the initial victory, the number of troops was not as General Shinseki recommended, far too few; the unguarded caches of weapons and ammunition, allowing the insurgency to have free access to them; the dismissal of the Iraqi Army, rather than giving them a pay check and a shovel, the closing of the Iraqi industries, the deBaathification, which put thousands of people out of work, including thousands of school teachers. These irretrievable mistakes made it very difficult for us to have any sort of positive success in that country. 
   We hear the call, well, wait until September. There'll be another report. Well, we have been in Iraq for four Septembers. There is the old song that those of us with a little gray in our hair remember as the September song. And one line from that song of yesteryear, ``we haven't got time for the waiting game.'' That's where we are now. We don't have time for the waiting game. 
   The purpose of this is a matter of readiness. It's a matter of national security. It's a matter that we must face now, or else the strain and stretch on our ground forces, particularly the Army and, of course, the Marines, will be beyond repair for many, many years. 
   It's a matter of strategic importance that we redeploy from Iraq in a responsible manner, and that's what this bill does. And we are able to keep our forces strong. 
   We never know what's going to happen. The last 30 years, we've had 12 military contingencies in which our Armed Forces have been engaged, four  of which have been major in size; none of them predictable. We don't know what the future holds. But for national security interests, we need to have a ready force, particularly our ground forces, which are being strained so very much now. 
   Further, it is important that we pass the security of Iraq over to the Iraqi government and to the security forces of that country. We cannot hold their hand forever. They must step up to the plate and take over their own security. It's important that that happen. 
   This bill, Mr. Speaker, initially sets forth a sense of Congress that the authorization for use of military force against Iraq was enacted into law in October of 2002, and that the government of Iraq that was in power at that time has been removed and it's leader tried, convicted and executed by a freely elected government of Iraq; and further, that the government of Iraq, the current government of Iraq does not pose a threat to the United States, and for more than 4 years, the efforts of our Armed Forces have been valiant in their work and in their combat in that country. 
   We need a responsible redeployment. This legislation gives it to us. It states that the Secretary of Defense shall commence the reduction of the number of armed forces in that country beginning not later than 120 days after the date of enactment. It also states that such redeployment shall be complete to a limited presence which is spelled out in the bill, not later than April 1, 2008. 
   The question before us, are we, as a country, any safer now than we were when we went into Iraq in March of 2003? What has it done for the security of our country? 
   We see the sectarian violence, on top of the insurgency, the insurgency being aided by foreign fighters, many of them al Qaeda, and consequently, we know that the end must be done by the Iraqi security forces. That's what we are trying to do in this legislation; responsible redeployment of the American forces, cause the Iraqi troops and forces to take over their own security, and restore the readiness to our ground forces here in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I have, and I offer as part of the Record, Mr. Speaker, a letter I just received dated July 12 from Lee H. Hamilton from the Woodrow Wilson International Center of Scholars, who is the national president thereof. And I will  read just part of it and not take any more time. But it says, ``Dear Ike, thank you for sharing H.R. 2956 on responsible redeployment from Iraq. The legislation outlines the right change in mission for U.S. forces in Iraq, and redeployment within a responsible time frame. It effectively outlines the functions of the residual force that would remain in Iraq after redeployment, and makes an important contribution by focusing on the need for an accounting of U.S. interests in both Iraq and the wider region.'' 
   I offer this letter at this time.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I just heard the minority leader say that we are willfully ignoring the consequences of Iraq. That is what I'm talking about, the willful consequences of Iraq when I spoke a few moments ago about the stretch and the strain and the difficulty of gluing our Army and Marines back together again. 
   This is serious business. We have a readiness crisis due to our extended operations in Iraq. Readiness in the Army's combat units has fallen to a dangerous level. Half of the Army's active brigades are in combat, and the remaining units are preparing for deployment. Units preparing for combat do not have all of their assigned personnel or equipment when preparing for combat. Combat units are experiencing equipment shortfalls; and let me mention that we have lost over 2,000 trucks and Humvees, over 100 tanks and armored vehicles, and over 100 aircraft. Combat units' readiness is being sustained at the expense of nondeployed units through the use of emergency war stocks. 
   I am worried. My heart breaks because no one seems to be listening on the other side, and no one who is opposed to this legislation mentioned in this debate anything about the stretch and the strain on our ground forces of the United States. That concerns me. That is the willful ignoring of consequences of Iraq. Something must be done. 
   Lee Hamilton, the co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group, spoke in a letter to me, which I read a few moments ago, endorsing this legislation as a responsible bill: We must do something, and it must be done today. This is serious business. 
   Let me salute the eloquence of my friend from California, Mr. Hunter. He asked us to wait until September. We have had four Septembers already in Iraq. And you know what? It reminds me, and maybe some of those who have a little gray in their hair, Mr. Speaker, will recall a song that was popular decades ago, and that line in that song, the September song, that says, we haven't got time for the waiting game. We don't have time for the waiting game. 
   This is the right time, the right measure, the right issue. It is right for our ground forces. It is right for those in uniform. It is right for their families. It is right for our country. We have been engaged in Iraq since March of 2003. We have threats yet unforeseen. 
   If we continue to strain our ground forces as they are, we will not be ready for them. Hopefully they never come, but as sure as God made little green apples, those threats will be there. That's the purpose of this. The readiness of our forces and the capability of what they need to do for us in the days ahead, that is our job under the Constitution, to raise and maintain. That's what we are doing. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I say that we need to pass this legislation. We need to do so to pass the responsibility back to the Iraqis, to keep our forces in a higher state of readiness, and to make sure that the future is all the more safer for those of us here in our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the ``Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. 
   As a conferee on this legislation, I worked on a number of provisions that strengthen U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction programs, which the 9/11 Commission emphasized must be a top priority given the threat that weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation and terrorism pose to the American people. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill strengthens the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), which is an important tool for interdicting illicit transfers of WMD. The bill will help to expand PSI-cooperation with our allies and strategic partners; ensure that the PSI has the necessary budget, resources and structures; and enable Congress to exercise greater oversight of PSI activities. 
   I also strongly support the bill provision that establishes a high-level coordinator for preventing WMD proliferation and terrorism. This new coordinator will ensure that the U.S. strategy, budget, programs and initiatives, and interagency action are comprehensive and well-coordinated, and will provide leadership that has been lacking and is critical to the effectiveness of U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction efforts. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the bill repeals limits on Cooperative Threat Reduction Program assistance, which have impeded the effectiveness of this Department of Defense program in past years; authorizes funding to strengthen and expand Cooperative Threat Reduction and Department of Energy nonproliferation programs; and includes other measures to counter the threat that WMD proliferation and terrorism poses to the American people. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Our government has no greater responsibility than protecting the American people. By implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, we are taking real steps to close security gaps and provide a secure future for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, Article 1, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Through the years, Congress has recognized the President's role in negotiating trade deals and has granted the President a great deal of leeway with regard to trade. Congress, however, must ratify every trade deal, and the President has a great deal of responsibility to work with elected members of the legislative branch before pressing forward with any negotiated trade agreement. 
   One power Congress has occasionally authorized for the President is the so-called ``fast track'' negotiating authority. ``Fast track'' permits the President to negotiate a trade agreement while giving Congress an opportunity to ratify the agreement without amendment and within a certain time frame. ``Fast track'' allows the House and the Senate to set its own rules with respect to considering a trade agreement under these expedited conditions. In November 2006, using its ``fast track'' powers, the Administration signed a Trade Promotion Agreement with the South American country of Colombia. 
   In June 2007, I visited Colombia and met with President Uribe, other Colombian leaders, and U.S. embassy and military professionals serving there. Through the years, I have been extremely skeptical about U.S. involvement in Colombia's civil war and have voted in the House to reduce U.S. military aid to that country. That said, Colombia is an important ally of the United States and the trade agreement negotiated between the U.S. and Colombia is worthy of support. Should it pass, most U.S. exports to Colombia--including Missouri's agricultural exports--will enter that country duty-free. Under current law, nearly all Colombian goods enter the U.S. duty-free. 
   On April 8, 2008, the Administration took the unprecedented step of delivering the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to Congress without having fully consulted with the House and the Senate. In my view, the Administration's maneuver seriously jeopardizes prospects for the trade agreement's passage in the House. Without bipartisan support, I am convinced the House would reject it, sending a negative message to Colombia and derailing important benefits to Missouri agriculture that would be brought with the deal. 
   Mr. Speaker, in an effort to give Congress more time to review the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement and to prevent an embarrassing defeat of the agreement on the House floor, I will vote today to delay its consideration. I remain hopeful that the agreement can be considered before the end of the 110th Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. SKELTON. (AMERICA'S STRATEGIC CONTEXT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, yesterday I rose to speak about the need for America to embark upon a process to develop a comprehensive strategy to advance U.S. interests in the world. Today I rise to continue that theme; I want to take the conversation a bit further. 
   A strategy, as I said last night, describes the way we employ all elements of national power to advance our critical interests. Ultimately, determining these critical interests depends upon the place America occupies in the world. What do we see as our role? Who do we want to be, and how do we want to interact with the rest of the globe's inhabitants to get there? That's the fundamental question, of course, but we are not ready to answer it yet. 
   Instead, we must first consider the domestic and global contexts within which we must act. As our vision of where we want to go evolves, we must have an ongoing dialogue about the effort and the sacrifices we are willing to make. We must also look at the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be, and we must acknowledge that much of the world does not necessarily see us as we would see ourselves. We must look clear-eyed beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. Only with that understanding can we determine where we want to go and how we want to get there. But as this vision develops, we must keep in mind that it is no good if we cannot provide the means to achieve it, nor is it useful if it is not a realistic fit with the rest of the world. 
   The global environment is ever changing. While we cannot control the sea swell of change, we must prepare ourselves to navigate those waters. Regional power is shifting; some large nation states, such as China, India, Brazil, to name a few, are ascending and verge on global power status. Russia may already be there, again. Do their interests conflict or coincide with ours? Is their rise a challenge to oppose or an opportunity to engage? Some of our traditional security arrangements may fade in importance as others take on new meaning. But nation states are not our only concern. It's clear that a number of transnational issues will challenge us while others may provide positive potential. Fundamentalist terrorism and the proliferation of dangerous weapons are obvious examples of serious challenges, of course, but what about climate change, the fragility of increasingly connected world financial markets, or the outbreak of pandemic diseases? These are challenges that present themselves without any malicious intentional human action. 
   The point here is that the world around us bears significant scrutiny because it represents the context that binds whatever strategy we choose. This is not to say we cannot strive for an ideal. We can and we should. It's how this Nation was formed. The ability to conceive a vision that is breathtaking in scope and heartbreaking in its beauty is America's gift to the world. But while the goal may be the ideal, our understanding of our environment and our selection of the means to reach it must be firmly rooted in realism. 
   With that thought I close, Madam Speaker. In my next speech addressing these issues, I will talk about the need to return to the fundamentals of strategic understanding, a return to Sun  Tzu, to Clausewitz, to strategic thought rooted not in slogans but in enduring principles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to bring the DUNCAN HUNTER National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 to the floor today for approval by the House. 
   This bill represents a final agreement reached with the Senate, and I believe it can pass the Senate, which is critical, of course. The troops and their families need these authorities by September 30. 
   It's important to note this agreement was reached in a very short period of time. While the House finished its work back in May, the Senate approved its version of the bill just one week ago today. 
   The two Armed Services Committees have been working overtime ever since, and as a result we have not been able to provide all of the notice and time for examination of the bill that we normally would. I regret that fact. But I can assure the House that we observed all of the long-standing traditions of fairness and bipartisanship this committee is known for. 
   My good friend, DUNCAN HUNTER, and his team of members and his staff have been involved in every step of this process, and we have also worked hard to consult with the outside committees on the issues that are within their jurisdiction. We also placed the completed bill and report language on our Web site as soon as it was done last evening. 
   This is a good bill. It authorizes $531.4 billion for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. It also authorizes $68.6 billion to support ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year  2009, a similar amount to that which passed the House in May. 
   To restore readiness, this agreement provides $8.6 billion for the Army and $1.8 billion for the Marine Corps to repair and replace equipment. This agreement also provides $800 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment. To help manage demands placed on our servicemembers by our military obligations, the agreement increases the size of the military by 7,000 soldiers, 5,000 marines, over 1,000 sailors and 450 airmen. 
   To improve the quality of life for our forces and their families, the agreement provides a 3.9 percent pay raise for the troops, which is .5 percent more than the President's budget request. The agreement also preserves important health care benefits by prohibiting fee increases in TRICARE and the TRICARE pharmacy program and creating new preventive health care initiatives to improve the readiness of our force. 
   Finally, I would like to say a word about the person for whom this bill is named, as well as for others who helped us get the bill done under an extraordinary time frame. DUNCAN HUNTER has been a tireless advocate for the troops and a great partner, as well as a personal friend to me. The Armed Services Committee will miss him. I think it's deeply appropriate that we name this bill for him. 
   I also want to thank all the members of the Armed Services Committee, particularly the subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members. Finally, I wish to thank the bipartisan staff, fantastic staff, they couldn't be better. Our committee has been blessed with such a staff, and they have worked tirelessly to help get this bill negotiated and completed. It is an excellent bill. It's urgently needed by our military, and I urge my colleagues in the House, as well as in the Senate, to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, which is named for and in honor of DUNCAN HUNTER, the ranking member, former chairman of this committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SKELTON. I thank the gentlelady for raising this important issue. I also commend her for her long-standing support and advocacy for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
   At her request to the committee to support critical facility improvement projects in this year's bill, I am delighted to inform her that we have included over $30 million in capital improvement projects, including a critical Waterfront Support Facility and a Consolidated Component Improvement Facility. 
   I would also like to make it clear for the record that due to a clerical error, Ms. Shea-Porter's name was not included in the transparency table that accompanied the bill showing that she had requested the Waterfront Support Facility. This was an oversight and will be corrected in an addendum to show that she had requested and supported the addition of these facilities in the bill. 
   I commend her for her strong support of the shipyard and would support her continued advocacy for this critical national asset.

   Mr. SKELTON. Let me compliment the gentlelady from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) on her interest and her work on this issue, and I think in the days ahead the efforts will be understood and be fruitful as we move ahead with the defense of our Nation. I thank her for that. 
   We're coming to the end of a long, arduous process here in the House. Our wonderful staff has worked more than diligently, not just through the year but the last several days. In the last  five days actually, Mr. Speaker, they've done 6 weeks of work, phenomenal, miraculous, and I compliment them for that. Erin Conaton, the director, and Bob Simmons, the minority chief, have been superb to work with, and every member of the staff has been a professional in the finest sense of the word. I cannot brag on them more. And we're very grateful for their efforts, and their efforts will pay off for those young men and women, those families who wear the uniform of our country check as they do their professional work. 
   This effort is really for the security of our country and is done particularly for the young people who wear the uniform. They are, Mr. Speaker, our national treasures, and those of us on the committee understand that. We work toward that end, and as we vote for this bill and it passes, hopefully with a large, large majority, and goes to the Senate, and hopefully passes to the White House and to be signed by the President, those young gentlemen and young women who really make their life and their profession the national security of our country should know that we in Congress support them, back them up, and that we're immensely proud of the work that they do. 
   So, with that in mind, and thanks to all the Members of our committee, superb committee, subcommittee chairmen, subcommittee ranking, and every Member, our staff and those who give advice and recommendations to us have made this bill possible in a very, very short period of time. 
   So with that and a great deal of gratitude especially for my friend from California, Duncan Hunter, who we unanimously named this bill for, we will miss him terribly, but we thank him for his service to our Nation, to our Congress, to our committee as chairman and ranking member, and we appreciate him, and we'll long remember him.

   Rather than contesting it at this time, the inclusion of this authorization language in the State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriations bill, I rise to assure you that you will be involved in the Defense authorization conference on the SIGIR issue.

   Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, we are speaking about today and not 1983. 
   I have had the opportunity, since being a Member of Congress, to work in the area of professional military education. I must tell you it's important not just for American students, American leaders, American service personnel, but it's important for our friends and allies as well. 
   I have nothing but great respect, great respect for my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts. I know how strongly he feels in his beliefs. But I must say that we are doing the right thing by keeping this school going and going well. 
   We do not teach human rights abuse. This school bestows upon its students standards. It teaches them military art. It teaches them military-to-military relationships. It also instructs in the area of human rights. 
   I have been to Latin America several times. Three weeks ago, I travelled again to the region with Dr. Gingrey and Mr. Conaway, visited Colombia and Panama. There we met with President Uribe of Colombia, President Torrijos of Panama, and other senior military and political leaders. Without exception, the leaders of those countries touted the WHINSEC program in Georgia as an exceptional opportunity for their men and women in uniform to gain not only technical knowledge but a deeper understanding of human rights. 
   Furthermore, spending time in the United States gives them an opportunity to learn of American values, gives them the opportunity to make friends within the American military, with whom they will undoubtedly, in days and years ahead, will have the opportunity to work. 
   I spoke with our American commanders in the field. They reiterated what I have heard many times before. Individuals who have been trained at WHINSEC performed better on their missions in their host country than those who have not. 
   Our military commanders also cherished the relationships that they have built with their Latin American counterparts who participated in the program. 
   In addition to comprehending our military culture and its operations, the school of graduates often are promoted and rapidly rise through the ranks. They understand what it is to have American values, and they understand about human rights which are taught there. The message from everyone was simple: Please keep that school open. 
   Professional military education is so important, but it's also extremely important to allow our neighbors, our friends to the south. We can't forget them to participate in the professional military education of our country.
