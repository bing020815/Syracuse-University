<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   I will just make a couple of points in response to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton). One, I look forward to working with the gentleman in modernizing and working to overhaul the SPR. It is certainly in need of improved management. And I might also mention that a version of this bill was introduced back in May. And we also have been working on it to make it as bipartisan a bill as we could possibly make it since November. So there has been a great deal of effort to try to make sure that we've heard everyone's concerns and to try to address them. 
   And one of the points that the gentleman made about imports and where our heavy oil would come from to replace this, we purchase 14 percent, or 70,000 barrels, from Canada per month. Also the Gulf of Mexico has a significant amount of heavy crude that we also would be purchasing to put into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   And I might make the point that the refineries have made significant and actually great advances in technology. And they refine heavy crude just as easily as they refine light crude today. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, today we consider this legislation that I believe is an important step for our Nation's future energy security. It will make the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more compatible with modern U.S. refineries and thus more effective. Improving the SPR's flexibility will maximize its utility. Shoring up our Nation's energy reserves is just one piece of this energy supply puzzle which also includes increased domestic drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf as well as research and development for alternatives. 
   I would like to address national security concerns that have been mentioned. The day that we went to war with Iraq, the SPR contained only 624 million barrels of oil. Today we have more oil in the SPR than we have ever had. And this bill ensures levels will not fall below 90 percent of the current level. In 2006, President Bush declared the SPR is sufficiently large to guard against any major supply disruption with only 688 million barrels. Today it's more than 700 million barrels. Most  importantly, this change will strengthen the SPR and enable refiners to operate at full capacity during any potential supply disruption. 
   When Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 following the Arab oil embargo to protect the Nation from any future oil supply disruptions, refiners largely processed only light and medium crude. Advances in technology over the years have led to the ability to efficiently process heavy oil as it has become a larger part of the market. In fact, 40 percent of the oil accepted last year by refiners was heavier than the oil contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. With refiners planning to expand by 800,000 barrels worth of mostly heavy oil capacity in just the next few years, I believe it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the Nation's oil reserves match refining capacity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. The GAO stated if forced to rely on SPR oil, about half of the refiners subject to potential supply disruptions would experience an additional 5 percent or 735,000 barrels a day reduction in production, further exacerbating any supply issues. This exchange will ensure that the SPR will provide maximum protection for the Nation's energy supplies. 
   This will further strengthen our energy supply against potential disruptions because the exchange will raise funds that will be deposited in the SPR account that will allow the SPR to increase the total inventory level without the need for additional appropriations, further strengthening our energy supply against potential disruptions.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Barrow, for yielding me the time. 
   You know, advances in technology over the years have led to the ability to efficiently process heavy oil as it has become a larger part of the market. In fact, 40 percent of oil accepted last year by refineries was heavier than the oil contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's a critical point in my opinion.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a Member of this Congress which has delivered to the American people real and meaningful change. We are fiscally responsible. We have instituted pay-as-you-go rules and deficit reduction discipline. 
   Where our majority has made real progress is by creating greater opportunity and a chance for prosperity for  all. Already we have reduced the cost on student loans and increased the size of Pell Grant scholarships, and President Bush signed our college affordability bill into law last week. We thank him. 
   We gave millions of Americans a pay raise by increasing the minimum wage and restored government oversight lacking for the last 6 years, saving billions of taxpayer dollars and exposing corruption. These investments, done for all Americans, are a few examples of how this Congress is taking America in a new direction.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, as a longtime advocate and friend of the Muslim-American community, I am pleased to support H. Res. 635, a bill recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, and commending Muslims everywhere for their faith. 
   I have always admired the unwavering commitment Muslims show towards their faith during the holy month of Ramadan. It has been an honor to join many of my Muslim friends during this month of family togetherness, selfless service, worship and spiritual rebirth.  
   As the grandson of immigrants, I know true assimilation means preserving tradition while achieving success. I am in awe at how quickly the Muslim-American community has mastered both. In a matter of decades, the Muslim-American community has rapidly assimilated into American society. With shared values of hard work, discipline, community, family and culture, it's no wonder that Muslim-Americans are one of the fastest growing, most educated and highest earning ethnic groups in the U.S. 
   America owes much of its vibrant society and rich culture to the contributions of Muslim-Americans. From the medical professionals who care for us, the educators who teach us and the titans of industry large and small, Muslim-Americans are one of the most indispensable parts of our nation's ever-growing melting pot. Muslim-Americans are authentic Americans, and proof that the American Dream continues to thrive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to join Mr. Israel and all of my colleagues tonight for something that is special. I want to first start out by telling our colleagues and the Speaker and others that even though there is a tradition that typically a Democrat will speak from one side of the well, and the Republicans the other, tonight is not about where we will sit or stand in this room. It is more about where we will sit or stand in relation to the needs of the people of the United States of America. 
   The Center Aisle Caucus is an organization of Members of Congress who are indeed going to look for ways to move issues forward that can make a difference for our families, our communities, and our States and Nation. 
   My involvement with this began actually on a trip, I guess, with Mr. Gilchrest some years back; and then when I returned to Congress after what I found to be some very difficult times where camaraderie broke down and it was very difficult for us to feel comfortable working with each other and discussing difficult issues, where oftentimes it did break down into the partisan bickering and the screaming and shouting and little getting resolved, to the point where we gathered some of our colleagues to sit down and have coffee and ask: What can we do and do differently? What can we do to begin to get our friends to come and sit down with each other and talk about these issues respectfully, talk about them in the depth that I believe our constituents all expect us to be talking about, and find the acceptable solutions to the very difficult, difficult issues that face us in this Nation, and they are. 
   You said it, Mr. Israel. Politics are suffocating the debate on Iraq in nearly every issue that we have faced in this Congress. If we can't come together and work honestly to find compromise on a critical issue like Iraq, what can we expect for other issues that are facing us? 
   We can't allow for progress to be stymied by partisan politics and vitriol. We must not let any political organization or campaign detract for the purpose we are all here for, which is to work on behalf of our constituents for the good of our country. What is needed now is thoughtful debate that considers Republican and Democratic ideas. We are getting there. That is what tonight is going to be the beginning of, I believe, and I look forward to a wonderful relationship with all of the friends that we are going to make in carrying all of this forward. 
   We owe it to our troops abroad, to our children in need of health care, to our students, the hardworking taxpayers and the people that we represent to work together to provide a new direction for America. I believe that the Center Aisle Caucus is an organization within our Congress that is going to be able to help pull that together. 
   It is wrong for any party to think that they are solely right or wrong, and I am proud to be able to join those of our colleagues who have been willing to step forward, come to the middle and begin this debate. 
   I will yield back, but I would like very much to speak again in another few minutes as we go through this process this evening.

   Mr. LAMPSON. I certainly agree with everything that Mr. Dent has said and that Mr. Gilchrest has said and that you, Mr. Israel, have said. I think it's worth repeating some of it. I think it's worth emphasizing the importance of this being a first step and really trying to change the attitude of our body to achieve what the Founding Fathers of this Nation attempted when they designed this body, which is supposed to be deliberative. It's supposed to be able to come together with tolerance. 
   I was looking at the words that are embedded in this desk here before us that we should listen with respect to each other, and words that Mr. Dent just gave us as far as where we can go, what we can be doing to begin to craft a direction for us. 
   Just this past weekend, I was at a ceremony with many Gold Star Mothers, parents who had lost their sons or daughters in either Afghanistan or in Iraq. I guess all of us have friends or parents or grandparents or someone that has lost someone there, pastors in our districts, perhaps, who are mourning the loss of some of our best and bravest that America has to offer. 
   The best way that we can honor these soldiers, I guess, as Mr. Gilchrest was referring to a few moments ago, the best way that we can do things to honor them and family is to work together as our Founders and Framers envisioned to answer the difficult questions that are facing us. 
   I think that it's tremendous that the Center Aisle Caucus has taken the step. I wanted to congratulate you and the other members who have started to ask Members of our Congress to join us. I hope that other colleagues will grow this into a large body. 
   I would like to hear some of the things that you are proposing at this time to move us forward on the issue of Iraq.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Let me just raise another point. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Gilchrest spoke of the amount of time that many of our forces served without break. We saw just recently a proposal made in the Senate that I would like for us to add to the list of things that you have already delineated and that we will be discussing, a way that we can assure that our troops get at least the amount of time off that their last deployment involved before being sent back into the war activity. That is a proposal that, in the Senate, drew significant bipartisan support. It came very, very close to passage, and it's one that, again, finds something that hardly anyone will disagree with. It is a change in the policy that we have to make, obviously, to the way that our military operates, and again, is to be debated on this floor. But if I may put that issue on the table for us to discuss some during the evening, I would appreciate that as well. 
   And I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Chairman, I am honored to join my colleagues from the Science Committee to support H.R. 6063. I particularly want to commend Chairman Gordon and Chairman Udall, and Ranking Members Hall and Feeney, the committee staff, for all of their hard work and their effort to make this an inclusive process. This legislation enjoys broad support, and I believe that it provides the stability and direction necessary to sustain NASA through this transition period. 
   I am proud that we will be able to provide a much needed 11 percent increase in the funding over FY08 that will help NASA get back on track. This inflationary increase will allow NASA to operate the shuttle program, accelerate the development of Constellation, and refocus its efforts on science and research without having to rob Peter to pay Paul. 
   I'm also pleased that this legislation directs NASA to fly the ``contingency flights'' and to take all necessary steps to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer that we just heard about from our colleague, Mr. Weldon to the International Space Station. This will ensure the space station's viability and use for its intended purpose as a national lab well into the next decade. 
   In addition to being one of the most valuable foreign policy tools that we have, there is no doubt in my mind that research conducted on the space station will yield great discoveries that will benefit all Americans and all of mankind. 
   I would especially like to thank the chairmen and ranking members for adopting language on issues that I have particularly championed and believe will also help secure NASA's future. This includes the Small Business Alliance Outreach and Technology Assistance Program (SATOP). 
   Building on the partnership between NASA centers, institutions of higher learning, and industry partners, this initiative will further the agency's mission of technology transfer in a unique way by providing free technical assistance to small businesses who cannot afford to have an engineer or a rocket scientist on their staff. Solving technical problems will mean these businesses will help grow our economy and create and retain jobs. 
   I have also worked to make sure that, as we face the space flight gap and the loss of a highly skilled workforce, that we are cognizant of the fact that we risk losing the imagination of the next generation of scientists and engineers and diminishing their desire to serve our Nation's space program. 
   Well, the fact that we are already falling behind when it comes to awarding advanced degrees in math, science and engineering means that we must focus on K-12 education now more than ever so that we don't lose our technological edge. 
   This bill provides an 11 percent increase over FY08 funding, including NASA's educational programs. I believe that some of this increase should go toward continuing the EarthKAM program and expanding NASA's participation in robotics competition. Bringing NASA directly into classrooms across the country and encouraging hands-on learning is a great way to spark a hopefully life-long interest in math and science. 
   So as we continue with this transition from shuttle to Constellation and a new administration in about 6 months, we must be mindful of providing stability and support for our Nation's space program at this critical juncture. I believe this bill provides both, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Today I rise in support of my amendment to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. This amendment would clarify section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act, which addresses the procurement of fuels by a Federal agency. This amendment seeks to provide guidance for implementation of the provision by establishing conditions by which NASA would be allowed to enter into a contract to purchase a generally available fuel, so long as it is not predominantly an alternative or synthetic fuel. 
   Because section 526 doesn't define alternative or synthetic fuel or nonconventional petroleum sources, many stakeholders, including refiners in southeast Texas, believe that section 526 could have unintended consequences, preventing refiners from mixing fuel received from nonconventional sources such as oil sands with conventionally derived oil. 
   Oil sands account for about 5 percent of the total U.S. oil supply, and it's common practice to mix it with fuel that is derived from other sources. It's very difficult for an end user and consumer to determine whether a fuel contains petroleum from oil sands or other nonconventional sources. 
   With half of Canadian crude produced from these sources, this could have an adverse effect on the relationship that we enjoy with our largest supplier of oil. Additionally, most diesel fuel is mixed with some biodiesel, which could also mean that its procurement could be prohibited under this section. While the intention of this language may not have been to prohibit the purchase of fuel, the small amounts from tar sands or oil shale, section 526 is written so broadly, with no definition provided, that it could be interpreted either way. That's why a clarification is needed. 
   I know that our colleague, Congressman Gingrey, made a proposal the other day in committee. I viewed the proposal that we have come up with here as a compromise to that suggestion. 
   Adoption of this amendment will allow NASA to contract for generally available fuels, as it always, has as long as the fuel is not predominantly comprised of petroleum from nonconventional sources such as Canadian oil sands with a greenhouse gas footprint that is higher than conventional oils and fuels. This allows some wiggle room and recognizes the complexities of the refining process while supporting the original intent of not extending or exceeding current emission levels. 
   Finally, I would like to note that when the House passed the FY09 defense authorization act last month, a similar amendment was approved by this committee and accepted by voice vote on the floor. While that amendment had a government-wide application, this seeks to clarify section 526 in order to allow NASA to meet present and future energy needs. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. I yield myself 1 minute, Madam Chairman. 
   I agree with much of what Mr. Gingrey has said. I want to point out  that the intent of the law, as passed, the Energy Independence and Security Act, specifies that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, which are higher, oftentimes, in these oil sales, is what was intended to be prohibited. 
   If we were using, or NASA were purchasing all of their fuel for their operation, then it would not fall within the bounds of this act. But NASA can purchase generally available fuels that may include a blend of fuel from oil sands refined in existing commercial processes. The purpose of the contract can't be to obtain fuels from nonconventional petroleum sources or otherwise promote the expansion of nonconventional fuels with high life-cycle carbon emissions. We believe that the refiners within my district that are making many of the fuels that are actually being purchased by NASA will use some of these nonconventional sources of energy. 
   As it's blended, it can still be used by NASA so that there is some benefit to them.

   Mr. LAMPSON. They remain in effect, but this just clarifies what the intent of the legislation was and is. It's going to allow blends of those fuels to be used by NASA until we can do the research that shows that emissions are going to be reduced below the amount of emissions from traditional fuels.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Chairman, I just recognize in closing that this is not a complicated piece of legislation. It is one that does not stop these fuels from being produced or the research and development on these types of sources of energy. It allows NASA to continue to purchase the kinds of fuels without restrictions and without putting themselves into the jeopardy that is asked for within section 526. So it is a simple amendment that was voice voted in the defense authorization, and we believe it should be here as well as the bill came out of committee. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Speaker, on Friday I joined Congressman Green, who just spoke, and Congresswoman Jackson-Lee, who will speak shortly, at the Houston passport office. 
   Some people had been in line for hours, and some of them had driven hundreds of miles. Most were frustrated and confused. Many had applied months ago to comply with the new passport laws, but the last Congress failed to provide Federal agencies the resources they need to uphold our laws. 
   These passport delays have inconvenienced thousands across our country. Some State Department estimates range up to 12 weeks or even longer to process passport applications, forcing some people to either cancel travel plans or lose deposits. 
   We can't have homeland security without adequate resources. It is not enough to talk tough, we must follow through. The State Department has said that it would temporarily suspend the law to some countries so Americans can take their trips. Forcing agencies to suspend laws because they lack the capacity to enforce them sets a dangerous precedent. 
   We need more agents to provide border security, customs and immigration enforcement officers and Federal prosecutors and immigration judges to uphold our laws. Let's fix this problem now before it gets much worse.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me this morning for this rule. 
   I first want to thank the members of the committee and the subcommittee for their hard work on this very important bill, particularly including the part concerning NASA, which I want to speak about for just a minute. Chairman Obey and Chairman Mollohan have been tremendously dedicated to assisting me and making good things happen. I applaud them. 
   Mr. Speaker, my district includes NASA's Johnson Space Center, the crown jewel of the Nation's space program. The Johnson Space Center serves as a key component of the southeast Texas economy, employing the best and brightest minds who serve as leaders in the sciences, education, business, and human space exploration, not to mention the important roles they and their families play in our local communities. I will aggressively champion the work and dedication of these hardworking Americans and the many benefits they bring to all of our districts and our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we talk about fiscal responsibility and doing our best to practice good government, we must be mindful of programs that are important to fund, those that return more on the taxpayer dollar and are wise investments. And I can think of no better example than investing in our future and the future of NASA. Over the years, the math shows that every dollar invested in the space program is returned exponentially in the form of new products, new technologies, and new businesses. Relative to our entire Federal budget, NASA dollars' share comes to less than 1 percent, about six- or seven-tenths of a percent. By comparison, Americans spend over $45 billion a year on soft drinks. 
   NASA research and technologies have provided law enforcement with advanced equipment to detect suspicious liquids and substances, protective gear for chemical analysis, safer oxygen tanks for firefighters, equipment to treat children's cancer, improved cardiac care techniques, advanced aircraft technology for safer commercial flights, satellite technology to improve our understanding of the Earth's climate, and more accurate weather forecasting to better protect us from natural disasters. 
   So for less than one-third of our national soft drink budget, NASA pushes the boundaries of the final frontier, creating commerce, assisting with education, increasing our economic competitiveness, enhancing health care, monitoring climate change, building stronger bonds with our allies, and ensuring the survival of the human race. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I kindly ask my colleagues, take a good look at the myriad ways NASA has benefited our great Nation. For me and for many of the folks who work at NASA and on NASA matters on a day-to-day basis, this isn't a Republican or Democratic issue; it is a matter of keeping America at the top of the space race and continuing the unparalleled legacy of achievement that so many NASA employees and partners have achieved.     
   So I look forward to continuing to work with the committee members, the conferees and all my colleagues to increase NASA funding. I appreciate the work of the Rules Committee, and I ask all of our colleagues to support this rule.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, a few hundred miles above us the astronauts of Expedition 15 work around the clock on board the international space station. Their efforts have just been boosted by delivery of a huge new power element from the space shuttle Atlantis crew. The Atlantis astronauts, working with station crew mates, brought the orbiting base ever closer to completion and a whole new era of living and working in space. 
   The international space station is a remarkable achievement of global cooperation now entering its most critical period. Over the next 3 years, more than a dozen flights of the space shuttles Atlantis, Discovery, and Endeavor will complete assembly that began in 1998. The completed station will be home to a crew of six astronauts and generation-spanning research that will reach into the lives of every American family. Yes, completion and operation of the international space station is that important to America's future. 
   I am fortunate to represent one of the most enduring and important NASA facilities, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and have had the honor over my five terms in Congress to work with dedicated and amazing people at the Johnson Space Center. Their passion and commitment to space exploration led me to introduce the Space Exploration Act of 2002. I introduced the Space Exploration Act as a challenge to this country and the leaders in Congress and the White House to offer a vision and concrete goals for the human space flight program after the international space station. Many here on this floor joined me in that call to action, to invest in a space exploration vital for the future of this country. 
   In 2004, President Bush announced a similar plan, the Vision for Space Exploration. The President's vision outlined a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond. I fully supported the President in pushing for an expanded mission for NASA. But in the years that have followed, this Nation has seen rhetoric not supported by action. The administration's vision for space and subsequent authorized funding limits have consistently been ignored, and the President's yearly budget does not fund a robust vision for NASA's future. As a result, we now see a widening gap in the period of time between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 and the next generation Crew Exploration Vehicle and Crew Launch Vehicle. 
   This gap will impede access to the station for our astronauts in the years immediately following the shuttle's retirement. During that period, before the new Orion and Ares space vehicles are operational, NASA and America will be totally reliant upon Russia for access to the space station by our astronauts and to carry cargo into space. We will be forced to spend more money than could ever be spent to accelerate arrival of our new space vehicles. This year alone, the administration worsened that gap by making its budget request some $1.4 billion below the congressionally authorized level. 
   Adding to the strain, millions of dollars have been shifted from the station and shuttle accounts to pay for repairs made necessary by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which damaged NASA facilities in New Orleans, the Mississippi gulf coast, and Florida. 
   NASA now faces the stark reality that the timeline for next-generation human space exploration is becoming increasingly hard to meet. We as a Congress must do more to ensure viability of NASA space exploration programs. And I stand here not to criticize the past efforts of the President or previous Congresses, but to call on leaders of both parties to help us meet and even exceed the funding levels required to continue all the important projects in NASA's orbit. As this bill goes to conference, I believe we can find additional resources for NASA to reduce the widening gap between the shuttle and the Orion and Ares programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, now is not the time to trim our sails into space. I join with the heroes of the space program, past and present, our Nation's industry leaders, and other forward-looking supporters to urge our colleagues to fund NASA fully into the coming years at the amount authorized by Congress. In today's global competition, there is no substitute for keeping America first in outer space. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

In fact, just this morning I was joined by the majority leader and some of my Blue Dog Coalition colleagues to highlight many of the smart, fiscally responsible initiatives our new majority is pursuing in Congress this year. American citizens expect the Congress to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, and when we allow deceptive fiscal practices to continue in our government, we set a bad example for our Nation and create a reckless blueprint for future spending. 
   That is why I have introduced this amendment to today's bill, which will clarify guidelines for premium travel by Department of Commerce employees. The Department's Inspector General March 2007 report showed that these guidelines are not being followed or controlled properly. In fact, the report has a specific section entitled ``The Department Needs to Tighten Controls, Update Guidance for Premium-Class Travel,'' and includes very glaring findings, notably numerous instances in which the Department failed to authorize or approve properly premium-class travel. The report concludes that the two primary reasons for these oversights are outdated policy and poorly implemented internal controls. 
   Thankfully, Mr. Chairman, there is a simple solution here that can save the taxpayers their hard-earned dollars and continue good government practices, and it is embodied in my amendment. This amendment offers a direct method of guidance by referencing the Code of Federal Regulations 301-10.122 to 10.124 to withhold funds for such premium travel for Department of Commerce employees. A similar amendment applying to Department of State employees was passed by voice vote last year when the House considered the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. 
   As we continue to tackle large instances of taxpayer dollar waste and abuse, let's not overlook the small steps that we can take that will help lead the way for good government practices. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention to this quick and simple way to practice better fiscal responsibility. I ask for support for my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Texas (Mr. Hall). 
   I applaud the good work that you have done, Mr. Chairman, to bring this Interior appropriations bill to the floor. There is a provision in the Interior appropriations billing that I fear will do harm to our ability to smoothly transition our Nation's energy infrastructure to the clean domestic energy future that we all desire. 
   In the debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Mr. Hall introduced and shepherded through to enactment section 999, the Ultra-deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas Research and Development Program. Today, more than 23 research universities and four not-for-profit research institutions are actively engaged in the implementation of this program. 
   A draft annual plan of research has been submitted to the Secretary of Energy for review and should be finalized within the next few weeks. That program is designed to foster collaborative research and development work by the best scientists and technologists in the country to develop the technologies that are necessary to find and produce the more than 1,200 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable, but mostly unconventional, natural gas resources in this country. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. LAMPSON. The Energy Information Administration has observed that this program will materially increase domestic natural gas and oil production. That increased production will more than pay for this research and development program by generating more royalty revenue from increased production of natural gas and oil from Federal lands that are already available, already available to be developed. 
   It is important to note, Mr. Chairman, that as this Congress grapples with the issue of providing robust funding to move toward increased energy independence, our Nation's energy companies are also investing in these similar research activities. Achieving energy independence isn't an easy task. It is going to take a significant investment from both public and private entities to move our Nation forward.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, we in this House are working hard on energy legislation to provide the tools that will help the Nation transition to clean domestic energy resources and more efficient use of those resources. We are making progress, but we must not lose sight of the scale of this challenge. We are concerned that by deferring funding for this program in 2008 in this Interior appropriations bill, the work of the program will be jeopardized, the anticipated increases in domestic natural gas and oil production will not be realized, and we will become even more dependent on foreign sources of energy while we are transitioning our Nation's energy infrastructure for the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that will resolve this problem in the bill. However, in the spirit of comity, I will not move that amendment if I can have the commitment of the chairman to work to resolve this issue in conference so that this important program can move forward as it is authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank the chairman for allowing me to come in and weigh in on this important measure. I am proud today to vote for this comprehensive energy package which includes two bills that I introduced related to enhancing biofuels and also industrial efficiency research and development. 
   Diversifying our energy supplies will help our Nation lead the way toward greater energy independence. However, we must commit to even more research and development in order to remain the world leader that we have been. We are competing with China and Japan and Russia and many other nations to find new resources and technologies. As we grow our technologies, we grow the availability of resources that we are trying to seek and use. And if we don't rededicate our Nation's know-how and might to the pursuit of science and technologies, I believe we will relegate ourselves to second-class status in the world. 
   While this bill will not bring down energy prices overnight, it is an important step in the right direction. Estimates show that these provisions will  save Americans more than $400 billion and reduce energy consumption by at least 7 percent by 2030. We can achieve that and more. 
   Our Nation has reached a critical point, and the time is now for us to lead the way toward cleaner fuel, increased efficiency standards, and much-needed research and development. When we lead, we prosper. Passing this bill is a start. Making it better next year and the year after will ensure our leadership in the world. We can and we absolutely must achieve these significant goals by passing this bill. I encourage support for H.R. 6.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1312 which commemorates the 25th anniversary of the Space Foundation. The Space Foundation was founded in 1983 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with the purpose of helping to advocate the Nation's space-related endeavors. Over the past 25 years, it has carried out that mission in an impressive fashion. It has grown to the point where it now undertakes space advocacy and space education initiatives in all 50 States. 
   As someone who feels passionately about the importance of getting our young people interested and educated in math and science, I want to call particular attention to the foundation's educational activities. The Space Foundation has recognized that space exploration is something that can really inspire kids and propel them to study hard so that some day they, too, can be a part of the Nation's endeavors in space. The foundation is doing work, important work in promoting science education, and I salute them for it. 
   In addition, the Space Foundation has involved itself in seeking the best path forward for the Nation across a range of commercial, civil, and national security space issues, and it consistently provides a respected forum for policy discussion and debates. In short, the Space Foundation is at the forefront of promoting the development and use of space for all humankind. 
   I want to join Mr. Lamborn and other Members in congratulating the Space Foundation on 25 years of accomplishment and in wishing the foundation all the best for another 25 years of service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 375, honoring the goal of the International Year of Astronomy. Astronomy seems to capture the imagination of the public more than almost any other discipline of science. Children everywhere gaze with wonder and amazement at the night sky. Images from the Hubble telescope grace the screensavers and wallpaper of our computers. 
   Millions of people every year visit the many planetariums around the country, including the historic Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and the Burke Baker Planetarium in Houston, which is also used to train space shuttle astronauts in identifying starfields. 
   The International Year of the Astronomy Committee is taking advantage of the public's enthusiasm by engaging ordinary citizens in real scientific projects, such as tracking binary stars and their eclipses from many different locations. In fact, three of the major goals for IYA 2009 are: One, increase scientific awareness; two, promote widespread access to new knowledge and observing experiences; and, three, support and improve formal and informal science education. These are also priorities for the Science and Technology Committee as reflected in last year's landmark COMPETES Act. 
   I applaud the astronomy community for making the 2009 International Year of Astronomy not just a celebration of science by scientists but an opportunity to share the wonders and relevance of science with all citizens across the globe. 
   As a Texan, I am particularly proud of the role that NASA and NASA centers, including the Johnson Space Center in my district, will have in celebrating the International Year of Astronomy and in promoting astronomy and space exploration. I thank Ms. Giffords for offering this resolution to recognize these important efforts and honor the goals of the International Year of Astronomy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H. Res. 1313 which celebrates the 25th anniversary of the first American woman in  space, Dr. Sally K. Ride. I was pleased that the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Feeney), and the gentleman from Colorado (Chairman Udall), joined me as original cosponsors and I want to thank them for their support. This is a very special woman who has done something significant for the United States of America and a project which has touched this world. 
   On June 18, 1983, Dr. Sally Ride made history with her groundbreaking space shuttle flight. However, that has been by no means her only accomplishment. Dr. Ride has had a distinguished career of service to America as a veteran NASA astronaut and as an unwavering advocate for the next generation of women in space, mathematics and engineering. 
   She first flew as a member of the STS-7 crew, which achieved several firsts for the United States space program, including the first release and capture of a satellite using the orbiter's robotic arm and the first demonstration of a shuttle flying in formation with a free-flying satellite. And she then flew again in 1984. 
   She has served the space program in other ways as well. In 1987, she wrote the thoughtful report on future directions of the U.S. space program, entitled ``Leadership and America's Future in Space.'' And when tragedy struck the human space flight program, she served with distinction on both the Challenger and Columbia accident investigation boards. 
   In addition, Dr. Ride has worked tirelessly to encourage young women to pursue careers in science, engineering and mathematics through her science festivals and camps. She also has sought to engage young people through other creative approaches such as the EarthKAM program she established to allow middle school students to participate directly in the excitement of space exploration. That is one of the programs that we have seen dwindle and we hope to have a rekindling of support because it is a magnificent one to encourage students to stay involved and become involved in math and science and engineering courses. 
   As many of you know, I am passionate about the need to get our kids interested in math and science, and I think the Nation owes Dr. Ride a debt of gratitude for her efforts in that regard. 
   So to sum up, Dr. Sally Ride has done much to serve our Nation since she rode the shuttle into space 25 years ago. I urge my colleagues to join me in saluting her on this 25th anniversary of her first flight. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose many outstanding achievements have provided many immeasurable benefits for the United States and the world. 
   It was 50 years ago this month, specifically July 29, that President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that established NASA. At that time, the American public was still reeling from the impact of the Soviet Union's successful  launch of Sputnik 1 in late 1957 which led to the space race with the Soviets. That race came to an end less than 12 years later when American astronauts successfully landed on the Moon and returned safely to Earth. NASA was the agency that led the effort to create a human space flight program from scratch and make America preeminent in space. 
   Yet as remarkable as NASA's achievements were in getting America to the Moon as well as to building the Shuttle and Skylab and the International Space Station, NASA has excelled in many other areas. NASA's aeronautics research and development activities over the past half century have led to significant advances in both civil and military aircraft. NASA's aeronautics programs have also helped to make America's aviation system a world leader in safety and have improved our quality of life in numerous ways. 
   In addition to human space flight and aeronautics, NASA has created space and Earth science programs that are second to none in the world in terms of advancing knowledge of our planet and of our universe. One only has to look at the ways in which the Hubble telescope, for example, has rewritten the astronomy textbook since its launch in 1990 to know that NASA's space-based science programs are really some of the Nation's premier research endeavors. 
   In addition, NASA's technology developments have rippled through our economy in countless ways, delivering new materials, new processes, and new systems that have had a major impact on things as diverse as health care and weather forecasting. 
   And finally, NASA continues to be a source of inspiration to our young people and a symbol to the world of America's technological and scientific preeminence. These are important realities that we should not overlook when we debate funding for NASA. 
   Mr. Speaker, investing in NASA has been and continues to be an investment in our future. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution along with Mr. McCaul. I urge all of our Members to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. I yield myself 2 minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
   I've listened with interest to Congressman Gingrey's comments a few minutes ago about the advancements that NASA has made with regard to its energy usage. It has been tremendous.  
   On last Tuesday, I happened to have been at the Johnson Space Center watching the operation of the new lunar rover. It is a six-wheeled, actually double wheels, vehicle that runs entirely on battery power and has a magnificent amount of strength and longevity. It's the research that NASA has done in the development of better batteries, longer life for batteries, and the fact that they have been able to develop solar power to the extent that the International Space Station is entirely powered with solar collectors that are on that station, and the research that they are doing to increase the opportunity for us to be able to gather solar power in space and beam it down to Earth for our use, that continues to show the technological advancements and capabilities of our NASA, of our National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
   The work that they have done on the development of fuel cells and hydrogen, all of these magnificent technologies have come because of the commitment that they have had to look at new and different and better ways of doing things. And thank goodness they have looked at it in exactly the way Dr. Gingrey was saying, balanced. 
   We've got to find a way to make sure that we're looking at all sources of energy, and NASA is showing exactly how to accomplish that task. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

I remember taking students and classes myself back around 1970--actually, before we stepped foot on the Moon in 1969--and the wonderment, the excitement that all of the people who have had anything at all to do with NASA have been able to instill in young people, causing them to want to go and study math and science and engineering. What a great thing to do. And what a great day to be able to stand and say congratulations on 50 years of service and operation and advances in technology for our country and for the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (INVEST IN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in strong support of a piece of legislation that I recently introduced, H.R. 6067. It's called the Invest in Energy Independence Act. 
   Our Nation is at a crossroads, as we have been hearing tonight and on other of these Special Orders over the last several days and weeks. We know that we have a serious problem when it comes to our energy security. We rely too heavily, obviously, on foreign sources of energy, and we haven't done enough to promote the clean domestic energy sources that we have available right here in our backyards. 
   It's going to take every effort for us to find a whole multitude of sources of energy in order to address this energy crisis that we're facing as a Nation. I am hoping that we will not be shortsighted and think that only one particular area is the only solution to our problem; it's not. 
   The Invest in Energy Independence Act of 2008 takes a giant step forward in remedying this problem through responsible investment of over $1 billion in our energy future. This legislation before us today is vital in helping us become more secure in the world because it helps us develop our own energy resources in an environmentally responsible manner. 
   The Invest in Energy Independence Act invests heavily in domestic renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and geothermal, and it also helps us use the energy that we have more efficiently through key energy efficiency and weatherization measures. 
   Additionally, the Energy Security Fund established in the legislation will also fund carbon capture and storage technologies, which will help us significantly reduce future greenhouse gas emissions. 
   This legislation funds these vital projects through two main sources. First, it directs into the Energy Security Fund revenue from the prior sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is currently unused in a Department of Energy account. And secondly, it modernizes the strategic oil reserve by exchanging 70 million barrels, 10 percent, of more expensive light crude oil from the SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for 70 million barrels of cheaper, heavy crude oil in a step that will allow our stockpile of crude to more accurately reflect the capabilities of our domestic crude refineries. 
   Because the crude oil exchange will raise funds that will be set aside, about $84 million or so, for acquiring additional oil in the future, this legislation will actually increase the total inventory level of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve without the need for additional appropriations, further strengthening our energy supply against potential disruptions. 
   Now, this is a responsible and thoughtful manner in which to fund the most important energy projects throughout our country. By using funds from the past sale and future exchange of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to invest in clean, domestic energy projects, oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will do exactly what it is intended: increase domestic energy supplies for the United States and secure the country from potential supply disruptions. 
   And so I hope I have many Members who will join me. There are already more than 30 who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation with me. I believe that it will strengthen our Nation's energy security by increasing domestic supplies and by modernizing our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   One of the things that I know that has happened over the last several years is that there has been a dramatic decline in the amount of resources specifically budgeted for research for the Department of Energy. Their budget has declined by 85 percent in the last 30 years. Well, here is the time when we are in greatest need to be looking for every opportunity we can to learn of new ways that we can expand our sources of energy; yet we seem to be pulling in those opportunities to create those resources. 
   Those are the kinds of things that I think that it's critically important for our Science Committee, for all of us in Congress, to be looking at. It's what I have worked on as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and I look forward to continuing to work on this legislation. 
   Well, we have an honorable gentleman, John Hall, who is also one of the cosponsors of this legislation, and I welcome him in joining us tonight to come and talk about this legislation, and I would yield to Mr. Hall.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Before you leave, let me just ask a question. 
   Surely, you heard some of the presentations made by our colleagues earlier talking about the need to increase drilling. What are your feelings about what these needs for our Nation are? Clearly, we must produce everything that we can produce, but isn't there more to the picture than just drilling as a solution?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Reclaiming my time, so your point is very well made. You can't ignore the fact that we need to continue to rely on fossil fuels as we transition. And we must actually do what the United States Army told us to do in 1945, in a book they published on May 1, 1945, when they told us that it was necessary for this Nation to diversify away from our use of fossil fuels. And they told us how. And much of what they said then and much of what I believe our committees have said and what I believe this country is doing, and even the businesses, certainly like the smart people like T. Boone Pickens, who are looking at these diverse activities that we should be involved with that will give us new sources of energy. 
   We include in the legislation that we're talking about tonight significant funding for ARPA-E, which is advance research projects. And we talk about wind, solar, weatherization efficiencies, marine/hydrokinetic energy research, industrial energy efficiency. We have already passed many of these pieces of legislation as authorizing, and now we're looking for funding for it. Building energy efficiency, energy storage, batteries. We must find new ways to hold much of the energy that we are creating regardless of the manner in which we are creating the electricity to do it. Geothermal, carbon capture and storage, clearly it's a must if we're going to use some of the coal resources in this country. Natural gas, clean burning fuel, all of these are included in this legislation to be funded with the kinds of projects that will give us a much greater, diverse energy background. More energy storage, Smart Grid, and advanced vehicles research. 
   So I'm proud of the fact that we have so many people come together to bring us these kinds of projects that have already gone through, passed by this Congress. And I would like to know about the things that you have been specifically involved with, perhaps things that have been done in the State of New York, where you represent, very ably, the people in your congressional district. 
   I know that, for example, Texas has spent a great deal of time on wind energy. Arizona has spent a great deal of time on solar energy. Are there things that the State of New York is contributing to this mix of how we diversify our energy sources?

   Mr. LAMPSON. Well, you're so very right. And the ideas are not necessarily Democratic and they're not necessarily Republican ideas, they are American ideas. 
   We've got the knowledge. We've got the wherewithal. It's a matter of making sure that they have the opportunity to put that together. Too often, of late, we seem to have been pushing too many of our solutions to the political extremes, and we've got to find our way back toward the middle. And we think that this is a piece of legislation that does that. It recognizes that fossil fuels, much of what our colleagues earlier this evening were talking about as far as drilling activities, is not something that needs to be taken off the table. But at the same time, they can't tell us that the ideas that we're coming forward with are ideas that need to be taken off the table. We must look for diversity. We must look for balance. 
   We must look to encourage those kids who built that solar car and had the great success no differently than the college student that I spent some time with today, and I drove his hybrid vehicle. It was a group of universities who competed against each other to see if they could take regular vehicles and convert them into significantly greater, increased energy-efficient vehicles. The one that I saw today happened to have been a hybrid diesel engine that was placed into a General Motors SUV. I drove the car. It gets in the mid-30 range of miles per gallon of fuel. It meets all of the standards for emissions in our country. 
   So clearly, again, if college students can do it, if high school students can do it, the minds that have made the United States of America great are clearly here; they need the assistance to make sure that their ideas come to fruition and that we get to put them into the market. 
   There is a company that I'm working with in my congressional district in Texas who had the idea that they could make an external combustion engine. They're capturing it by creating a fire box that they attach to the outside of this engine. They are capturing the energy that is released in the combustion process and piping it into an engine, causing the compression activity to continue to the point where it causes the engine to move. There is great interest in this because it is twice as efficient as an internal combustion engine. Again, a good idea, one that was not a partisan idea, it was one that was developed by some guys that I have no idea what their political affiliations or interests are, but they're concerned about the United States of America and concerned about what we're going to be able to do to solve the energy crisis that we face. 
   This bill is intended to try to give them the encouragement, to give them the resources to make sure that we are doing everything that we possibly can to expand our opportunities to give greater sources of energy to all of us for our coming decades because we're clearly going to need them. 
   If we choose to spend all of our time--and I am certainly not the least bit concerned about drilling, I think that we must be continuing to produce fossil fuels and to use them as we have been, hopefully much cleaner than what we have been doing, but clearly that is only one part of this big picture that we have to address. 
   I want to talk for a minute about the renewable energy funding and just to make a point or two about the important strides in funding clean, renewable and, most importantly, domestic energy sources without impacting the Federal budget. 
   The Invest in Energy Independence Act, which is what we are talking about here tonight, provides $110 million for renewable energy research and development projects that include wind, solar, wave, geothermal, and hydrogen projects. The legislation pays for these projects. Clearly, this is something we're concerned about. We have PAYGO rules, pay-as-you-go. If we're going to put something new into our budget, then we must come up with the money to do it. This is a good way to do it. 
   So this legislation pays for these projects--and many other domestic research and development projects as well--through the modernization of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and use of available funds from prior sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The legislation modernizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by exchanging about 70 million barrels of more expensive light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for an equivalent amount of less expensive heavy crude oil, a cost differential that ranges from about $12 a barrel up to about $18; most recently it's been about $15 per barrel. This exchange of light crude for heavy crude is necessary to have our petroleum reserve more accurately reflect the capabilities of our domestic refineries. 
   The Invest in Energy Independence Act is crucial to help move us away from our dependence on petroleum and  shift our use to affordable and reliable renewable energy sources that are available right here in the United States. 
   For instance, the legislation will invest an additional $15 million in wind energy, helping us to develop the next generation of wind turbines that can generate clean energy in virtually every corner of the country, even in those areas where there is relatively low wind speeds. 
   The bill also provides an additional $30 million through the Department of Energy for solar energy programs to conduct research, development, demonstration, and deployment of solar energy technologies. Funding these will also be available for our public education campaign on the virtues of clean domestic solar energy. 
   Well, for those of us who are fortunate enough to live in coastal areas, the bill invests $30 million in marine and hydrokinetic energy. The majority of Americans live in close proximity to oceans, and this legislation will help fund the next generation of clean wave energy to power our homes and our businesses.     
   The Invest in Energy Independence Act also provides funding for geothermal energy projects. The legislation funds $30 million in geothermal research and development activities at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 
   And, finally, the bill advances hydrogen research and development by funding the Department of Energy's H-Prize program to reward researchers who are working to make our hydrogen economy a reality. The H-Prize program was authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but Congress hasn't funded it yet. Through this bill the program will receive $5 million that can be used to administer the program and reward successful researchers. 
   So, again, we're looking for our colleagues to come join us in the Invest in Energy Independence Act. It's these kinds of things that I believe will provide us with the funds necessary for clean, domestic, and renewable energy sources. That's what's going to give us the balance, the diversity, clearly broadening our whole range of sources of energy that we have available to us. And that's what's going to be the real solution to the energy crisis in the United States, making sure that we do the kinds of things that have always made this Nation great, developing the technology, encouraging our people to dream big dreams, and then make those dreams become reality. 
   But we're not going to do it if we continue to cut the research budgets of the Department of Energy or to discourage companies from putting money into research on their own. We need to find ways that we can extend the incentives that we are giving to many of these companies and have for a long time to try to jump-start new industries. I hope that we can find the wherewithal to make sure that we can look for all of these aspects. At the same time, we're going to give consumers a short-term benefit because we believe it will change the price of oil and consequently the price of gasoline at the pump who are feeling that pain. And, secondly, it gives us the longer-term benefit of increasing our access to alternative sources of energy.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Reclaiming my time, on that point, I know there is other research that is presently going on specifically to facilitate our military activities that would involve a number of alternative fuels. I know of a specific project that is being tested right now with the use of Air Force turbine generators to use biofuels, specifically animal fats as well as some of the oils that come from some of the nonedible plants that are growing. These are the kinds of things that are going to make our country continue to be great. We need to encourage those activities as much as we possibly can.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Beautifully stated and I totally agree. 
   You made the comment that you would hope that the President would sign into law the work that we would do whether it's wind or some of the other alternative energies, and I truly believe that he will when he sees that this Congress is choosing to work together. When we start putting aside the blame from one to the other and that we know that we are all in one boat in this country right now and our boat has a hole in it, if we don't all start bailing water together, we are going to sink and we will sink together. But we clearly have the knowledge. We have the intellect. We have the future with our children who are doing excellent things in their educational programs. We have to present them with the dreams and the wherewithal to make those dreams come true. It's exactly what we did following Sputnik in 1957. We responded with a resounding response to the challenge of President John Kennedy at the time. 
   And I have to agree with you. Our technological leadership will be there. If we will but make these things available to our young people, they'll solve our problems for us, and this bill certainly does that. 
   China and India are examples as well as Japan and a number of other places are, in my opinion, the beeps of Sputnik of today. Japan put a satellite not too long ago in orbit around the moon. China has set its goals to have a colony on the moon before the United States even returns to the moon. And we are going into a period soon where we won't even have the ability to launch a human into space because we're going to have a gap of 5 years from the time that we end the use of space shuttle in 2010 to the time that we have the constellation project up and running in 2015. That is a question of national security, in my estimation, no different than the question of energy security for our country. So we have got to maintain our technological advantage. That's what's going to help us maintain the standard of living. It's what's going to help us continue to encourage young people to stay in school to learn the math and the science and the engineering kinds of courses that will maintain the path that America traveled to its greatness and will make sure that we have that same greatness well into our future. 
   And I see that the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas, has joined us, Sheila Jackson-Lee, and I yield to her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank the gentlelady for joining us and for her thoughtful comments. A couple of the things that you said, one particularly comes to mind, on weatherization. Mayor Bill White in Houston Texas tried a pilot project that was an overwhelming success by helping those people who could make small change, couldn't afford to make them but the city chose to make them on their own, and got back several times the value that was invested in those homes to bring them up to currency. Those are the kinds of things that we need and want to do with this legislation. 
   The wind energy about which you spoke, we need also not just to have the better technology with the stronger, lighter materials to have the blades of the windmills, but we also need the materials that will give us the batteries to store the energy that is created when those turbines are turned. 
   Dow Chemical. Unfortunately, we could have seen a significant increase in the facility of Dow Chemical right there in our backyard in southeast Texas. Yet, they chose to go to another country because it was access to alternative sources of materials that they could use. In that case, they were trying to continue to make plastics, and they are making plastics from biomass. 
   Those are the kind of things that are addressed in this legislation. It's a matter of using, strategically using, the strategic petroleum reserve effectively, and strategically, if I can repeat that word yet again, to include our overall energy supply. We truly are. We are reaching an emergency situation. Leaving the strategic petroleum reserve alone exactly the way it is now, if we had to turn to it if we lost our sources of oil coming into the country and going into those refineries, we would see an 11 percent decline of gasoline production immediately and we would see a 35 decline in diesel fuel immediately just because of a lack of modernization. 
   So if we act and allow some part of this reserve to contain heavy crude, as opposed to light, we would see a lesser change in conversion of being able to rely on those strategically placed oil reserves. This is a good piece of legislation. It's one that has been thoughtful to draw in Members from different places in the country, to pull in Members from both parties, Democrat and Republican. 
   We think that there are significant opportunities for us to do a couple of things. One, as I said earlier, we would have a short-term benefit because we would very likely see a decline in the price of oil, the price of gasoline because of dumping significant quantities of oil into the market in a strategic way. Once we have the resources generated from the differential in light crude and heavy crude, we will be able to invest those very sources very effectively in already authorized research projects that have passed this Congress already.     
   So Members, Democrat and Republican, want these projects to be funded and to be put into place. This is the way to make that happen. 
   I am proud of this legislation. I am proud of Mr. Hall from New York for joining us and Ms. Jackson-Lee from Houston, Texas, for joining us tonight to talk about it. I look forward to working with our colleagues to make it yet stronger and achieve the real balance that we want to achieve for energy for the security of the United States of America. I thank you for joining me.

   Mr. LAMPSON. If the gentleman would yield for just a very short quick 30 second story or point to make, off of the coast of Florida we are saying that we should not be drilling. But let's look at the other way around. We won't get permission to drill within 200 miles of the Florida coast or any of the coast in the United States. However, Cuba is drilling within 45 miles of Florida's coast. So there is another country that is drilling within our boundaries that we are prohibiting our own people from being able to drill in. It does not make sense. 
   Clearly we have plenty of work to do, and I think it is wonderful if we have the opportunity to work across this magic aisles of ours and get it done for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and for allowing me to take a minute or two to talk of a person who has done something significant for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a distinct honor and a privilege to be a Member of this House and to be from the great State of Texas and to have in my district the home of American manned spaceflight,  the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, or JSC as it's called. The largest industry contractor at JSC is a company called United Space Alliance, or USA, and it operates the space shuttle for NASA and helps train our astronauts, who also call JSC home. 
   For more than a decade, the head of USA has been a gentleman whose name is Michael J. McCulley. The company's president and CEO, Mike has led his company through some of the most difficult, and some of the most exciting, days in the history of the space shuttle. In just a few short weeks, he will step down from USA to begin a well-deserved retirement. He probably won't go far away. I rise today to salute this good man and his leadership. 
   Mike came to his duties at USA from the front lines of space exploration. As a shuttle pilot, he has flown Atlantis into Earth's orbit and seen firsthand the majesty of this planet from space. But even before that, Mike was a naval aviator and test pilot, having operated more than 50 different types of aircraft, flown from the U.S.S. Nimitz and the U.S.S. Saratoga, and at the beginning of his naval career even served aboard atomic submarines in the depths of the oceans. That, my friends, is a true explorer of both inner and outer space. 
   People like Mike McCulley show that in some of our most challenging times, there will be those ready and willing to serve the American people, placing their lives at risk for exploration, discovery, and achievement. Only through that kind of courage, that kind of selfless service, will our Nation's scientific advancement in space be assured and be continued. 
   On behalf of this Congress of the United States of America, I hope that Mike and his wife, Jane, and their family will accept our thanks and our best wishes on his well-deserved next phase of an exciting, all-American life. Congratulations, Mike. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I may continue while our colleague who has control of the time has gone to make a critical vote in the Ways and Means Committee, in speaking about Michael McCulley, there are two other things I would like very much to raise as an issue. I started speaking about space because Mr. McCulley is one of the great Americans who has played a significant role in moving us forward technologically in this world, and I am concerned right now that we are not moving ourselves, as a Nation, forward in science and technology, engineering and math studies for our youth. We are not challenged, it seems, to have the same kind of commitment for research and development, for exploration as we once had. And, unfortunately, other nations are stepping up to the plate to take our place. So it is my hope that we will find a new and renewed interest in funding space exploration and making sure that NASA has the moneys necessary to perform the tasks that it is required to do as a science organization for our Nation. 
   I find it fascinating that in the early 1960s, when we were having difficulties as a Nation, when our Nation happened to be at war and we were having civil strife and were having financial problems in the 1960s; yet John Kennedy, a new, young, enthusiastic President, stepped up to the plate and challenged us to go to the Moon, doing something that not many people thought was possible. And at the same time many of the naysayers and doubters were saying, how can we possibly do that financially? But we made the commitment. We put the money where it was necessary. And our young people learned how to do it and made an unbelievable success for us and changed the world, created new industries. 
   The information technology industry has grown from our need to be able to communicate with people in space. We have seen medical advances to the extent that lives are now being extended. People are living a higher quality of life because of what we have learned, what the technological advancements have been because of our involvement in space. All of these things changed America and, to a large extent, changed the world. 
   But in the last several years, we seem to have had a continuous slackening of the support and the commitment that we made or we saw in earlier years in space. For example, during those Apollo years in the 1960s, when we were going back and forth to the Moon, and in the early 1970s, 6 percent of the Nation's budget was committed to NASA. Today, that number is around six-tenths of 1 percent, 10 times less. So we have expected a major science agency of this government to do more but to do it with significantly less, and we can't continue to do that. 
   Now we are starting to see the impact of other programs that we have learned along the way. We have critical satellite systems that fly overhead in space that give us information about weather and about Earth science, about the environment of the Earth. Those satellites in many instances are getting old. As they get old and cease to operate, we must have something to take their place, and that something must be in place before these existing satellites die or else there will be a gap in knowledge and information. And a gap in information, for example, on the gulf coast, where I live and where Mr. Meek lives, would put people in harm's way. They will not have the advance warning of an approaching storm and be able to prepare their property or prepare their families to get out of harm's way. Those critical areas are important for us to acknowledge, to commit to, to believe in, and to fund. A gap in that knowledge means that our families will not be as safe as they were with the knowledge. 
   As we weaken our commitment to science and to NASA and we lose some of the hope that these systems will continue to operate, and just think if our information technology satellites went out of service, what would we do without our PDAs? What would we do without our Blackberrys and our cell phones? If they stop working, then we stop communicating, and we communicate with the world. 
   So it is my hope that we will find a renewed commitment and fund NASA to a greater extent than what we have been doing so. It is my hope that the billion dollars that the Senate has found to put into the Commerce, Justice, and State portion of our budget, which we will be taking to conference very soon, will find the same kind of support in the House of Representatives that it has found in the Senate and that we will support this commitment so that, instead of having to choose between doing the work for space exploration or science, we can do both because it is the commitment that the people want us to make to give them the hope for a better tomorrow, to keep us growing with our quality of life, to keep us having hope that our children will go and get the education necessary to do the things that will give us the kind of lives that we have strived for for such a long period of time. 
   Mr. Meek, I appreciate your yielding to me. I got to talk about Michael McCulley, who is a friend of mine, who has led a major space effort for this country for a long period of time and also to just sort of put forth some of my passion, which is to make sure that we get NASA funded properly out here on the table so that we can continue that dialogue. 
   I don't know what your topic was, but thank you for letting me butt in, and I would be happy to answer any questions, if you have them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to come and speak on this. 
   I am proud to honor the Wings Over Houston Airshow because each year about 70,000 spectators from around the world gather in the 22nd Congressional District of Texas to view this historic Ellington Field and view re-enactments of great battles, see up-close views of vintage aircraft, and meet yesterday's and today's heroes. 
   For the last 23 years, as you've heard, pilots from our Armed Forces and around the globe wow audiences with their high-speed acrobatics. And how often do we get to see real-life daredevils? Well, this weekend, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds will demonstrate their seven- to nine-plane close formations, tight turns, and head-on passes. Crowds will get to view state-of-the-art military aircraft, along with planes from days of old. 
   This year, the air show brings history to life through authentic World War II vehicles, equipment and uniforms at a realistic military camp. They're going to re-enact part of the movie, ``Tora! Tora! Tora!'' As a former school teacher, I know activities like these help promote an understanding and appreciation of military history. 
   Visitors are going to be able to see trainers, fighters, and bombers from the World War II, Korea and Vietnam era, and even NASA aircraft. The air show presents a unique opportunity to tour some of the largest aircraft in the world, including the Hurricane Hunter KC-135 and a C-5 cargo plane, walk over the wings of vintage airplanes, and even sit in the pilot's seat. 
   Children have the opportunity to meet flying aces and decorated war heroes and to hear historical recounts from the people who were there. 
   This year's show features both Pearl Harbor survivors and the Tuskegee Airmen, who were recently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. I am proud of these folks, and I know that all Americans are as well. Meeting living legends and air show performers is inspiring for young and old alike, and this show is a rare opportunity to thank these heroes for their service and for their sacrifice. 
   Wings Over Houston has spent, in the last 23 years, a quarter of a million dollars to help challenge young people to go into aerospace, engineering, and aviation. Many go on to careers in the military and go to work at NASA where they can also gain valuable experience as interns at the Johnson Space Center, which is across the street from Ellington Field. With its important contributions, Wings Over Houston ensures that our Nation leads the way in math and science. 
   The air show has also donated proceeds to various local and national charities throughout the years, including the Texas Southern University Aviation Career Academy, the Exchange Club of Sugar Land, and the Commemorative Air Force aircraft restoration and flying historical programs. Together with their partner, Wings Over Houston, it has greatly contributed to the economy and growth of southeast Texas. 
   So I want to thank the members of the House Armed Services Committee, and many of my Texas colleagues, particularly, for their cosponsorship of this resolution. I am pleased to honor the Wings Over Houston Airshow as a leader in the history and the future in the United States Armed Forces.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, when Texans think of their home state, and frankly non-Texans do as well, a few key symbols come to mind. There is the instantly recognizable outline of Texas, along with the Lone Star, the Alamo, cowboy hats, barbecue, and so many other great traditions and institutions. Among them is the Texas state flower, the bluebonnet. The bright blue bloom of that flower throughout the roads and lands of southeast Texas is instantly recognizable. The reason why, of course, is that Lady Bird Johnson led the beautification movement to protect and grow our state flower, setting a fine example of state pride for all Texans. We Texans feel the loss of the former First Lady when we think of this symbol, but as future flowers bloom, so too will her memory live on for our great nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues have mentioned today, my brothers and sisters and I were the grandchildren of immigrants who barely knew English, and the first in our family to go to college. Although my mother was only able to attend school through the 5th grade, she instilled in us the importance of an education. My mother led by example, receiving her GED on her 80th birthday, and all six of us received at least one college degree. And we all worked our way through college, I myself swept floors. She wanted us to have a better life, to be able to provide for our families without constantly worrying and living paycheck to paycheck. And we have all led successful and happy lives thanks to her encouragement and strong will. 
   But this Nation has lost sight of the importance of an education. We have allowed our education system to fall to the wayside, and put our citizens at a disadvantage--when they try to move up the career ladder, and when our Nation competes on a global level. We have failed our constituents when we fail to not only provide access to education, but when we fail to encourage our young people to dream and to achieve. 
   America is now 39th in the world in math and science. As a former physical science teacher and the current representative for Houston's Johnson Space Center I find this simply unacceptable. During the Apollo years, our Nation united behind a vision, and backed that vision with proper resources, in turn inspiring millions of children to go into these fields. The technological and medical advances that followed continue to benefit our Nation and the world. We have lost our vision. Our commitment to education and our position as a global leader. 
   Now is the time to repair the foundation that our country is based on--equality. It has long been said that education is the great equalizer. In recent years, millions of working and middle-class families have been left behind as college tuition has skyrocketed and student loan interest rates have risen sharply. By taking this important first step--making college more affordable and accessible for all Americans--we are showing our Nation's young adults that we are dedicated to their future. We will not make it to Mars, grow new hearts in Petri dishes, or develop new fuels without a renewed commitment to education. 
   A commitment to education should include all types of post-high school programs. We must encourage young adults to attend vocational schools as well as universities. Those who work as skilled laborers, such as mechanics and electricians, keep our society running and deserve encouragement and aid as well. 
   This bill, H.R. 6, The College Student Relief Act of 2007, is a fiscally responsible measure that meets our new pay-go requirements. It will ease the burden students and families bear as they strive to improve their situations and contribute to our Nation's economy, but not increase the burden on taxpayers. This is not merely a win-win situation; this is a win-surplus. Our country will benefit immensely both globally and locally through a renewed commitment to education. 
   Our students deserve the best. They are our future, and by cutting student loan interest rates and expanding access to higher education we are ensuring our Nation's future.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding time. 
   I am awfully proud to be standing here again in the midst of this distinguished body representing the people of the 22nd Congressional District of Texas. 
   A wave of change rushed across America since I left office, a wave that carried me back here to Washington, D.C., and I couldn't be prouder to vote today on the very first day of the 110th Congress to reform the rules and code of ethics by which this body operates; rules that were abused and tore Texas and this country apart, and a code of ethics that was disregarded and caused the American people to lose confidence in us, their representatives. We can't afford to wait another day to restore the trust and hope to those who sent us here to represent them. 
   It is not about moving to the left or to the right, but about moving this country forward. And now is the time to start working together by reaching across the aisle that we allow to divide us. It is time to conduct the people's business openly and honestly in the light of day. 
   I urge all of you, my distinguished colleagues, to join together in supporting these vital reforms. This is the first step toward restoring pride in our democracy, and that means restoring fiscal responsibility. Passing our massive debt on to our kids and grandkids is not a legacy we want to leave. Those who elect us are our employers, and we must be diligent in spending their hard-earned money which they entrust to us. 
   The number of earmarks alone increased nearly 400 percent and spending doubled over the last decade. We must all make an effort, Republicans and Democrats alike, to trim the fat from the budget. We can once again have a balanced budget, fund important initiatives and be diligent in our oversight of agencies of government, all without raising taxes. 
   I am proud to cast one of my first votes in the 110th Congress in favor of pay-as-you-go rules and aggressive reform of the earmark process so that we can return to a government truly of, by, and for the people. 
   I am honored to be back in this Chamber. I am proud that this Congress is starting off on the right foot with the best interests of every American on our minds, and I am proud to ask all of my colleagues to support this significant package of rules, H. Res. 5 and 6.

   As a Texan, it gives me particular pride to help this effort to name the building after a man who did so much to enhance and improve the educational system for all Americans. Not only did he begin his storied career in public service as an educator, as I did, and some of my colleagues who have  already spoken, President Johnson also ushered in the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the Higher Education Act of 1965, all keystones in our efforts to provide excellent and enduring educational opportunities for all of our children. 
   The House should take this simple step to honor a great leader and educator and, of course, a great Texan. It is a fitting tribute to his family that remains, including Lady Bird. I ask for the support of all Members of this piece of legislation, H.R. 584.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Chairman Gordon, for your time and also for your great leadership on the Science Committee. All of us on the committee are doing great work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support the America COMPETES Act and to be a conferee on this important legislation. We are now showing that we are dedicated to investing in America's future. 
   More specifically, we are investing in students and teachers and businesses and hardworking Americans to keep our great Nation the leader in the sciences. This bill, the product of hard work and bipartisan efforts, is inspired, some might say, by the National Academies' report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which raised the alarm that America could lose its competitive edge in sciences and academics unless we, the Congress, acted quickly. 
   Well, we have acted, and this package of key bills addresses numerous areas, including stronger support for National Science Foundation and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, funding for more teachers in undergraduate education in science and engineering. Academics, industry and our economy all depend on strong Federal support. 
   By authorizing billions for our research and education programs, technology, career and academic development programs, we ensure that America sets the gold standard in these various fields. 
   I, of course, know the importance of this funding firsthand, having been a former teacher. My colleagues know how much of an advocate I am for NASA with the Johnson Space Center being in my district. 
   I am proud to represent many of the Nation's best and brightest minds who continue to turn our dreams of further scientific knowledge and technological advancement into reality. 
   It's not just talking about space travel. The energy industry plays a significant presence in my district, and the future of alternative fuels and higher fuel efficiency and stronger and more reliable infrastructure depends on training the energy experts of tomorrow. 
   Well, the Texas Medical Center, also located in southeast Texas, is a leader  in cutting-edge health care and technology and needs future health care providers who have a strong science background. Therefore, I know that the America COMPETES Act, by supporting both academics and science, will be a boon to southeast Texas for our Nation.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which was signed by the President in August of 2005, included four directed spending programs that will each make a significant positive contribution to the security and reliability of the energy supply and infrastructure of this Nation. The Energy Policy Act authorized these programs with full funding so that they could be implemented as soon as possible. It should be made clear that it is the intent of the Continuing Resolution to remove any impediments that may have arisen to the timely implementation of the four Energy Policy Act provisions--Section 105, the Energy Saving Performance Contracts; Section 384, Coastal Impact Assistance; Section 999, Ultra-deepwater and Unconventional Onshore Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research and Development; and Section 1211, Electric Reliability Organization. These programs were clearly authorized and directly funded by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and should be fully funded and implemented immediately.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (SECURING ADOLESCENTS FROM EXPLOITATION-ONLINE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable Mr. Conyers from Michigan for yielding me the time and for the great work that you've done on the Judiciary Committee and particularly on this particular issue, and I thank you for letting me be a part of this. 
   And for Mr. Chabot, the work that he has done on not just this, but other legislation having to do with child safety, child protection. 
   I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3791, the Securing Adolescents From Exploitation-Online Act of 2007. This bill modernizes and expands the reporting requirements relating to child pornography and expands cooperation in combating child pornography. 
   Stories of Internet predators preying on innocents making their way into our children's bedrooms with the simple click of a mouse, and they're seen and heard all too often in our media. The age of sweet 16 used to be about parties and learning to drive, but now it marks the threshold of Internet freedom. Popular social networking Web sites allow profiles to be public, providing predators with an encyclopedia  of pictures, personal interests and even addresses, which they can be used, or they can use to cause harm. 
   Well, this dangerous trend has become a feeding ground for pedophiles and convicted sex offenders. Parents, law enforcement and legislators must work together to bring social networking Web sites into the fight to protect America's children. And I've joined with one of my cochairs of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, I just mentioned Mr. Chabot, in introducing the Securing Adolescents From Exploitation-Online, the SAFE Act. 
   The SAFE Act provides increased resources for law enforcement to capture and prosecute and incarcerate these criminals. By expanding the system for service providers to report child pornography found on the systems, we improve child safety and prevent future atrocities. 
   Currently, Internet service providers are mandated to report child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Under the SAFE Act, all electronic service communications providers and remote computing service providers will have to report child pornography. For knowingly and willingly not filing a report after being made aware of a child pornography image, these providers will be subject to increased fines of $150,000 per image per day for the first offense and up to $300,000 per image per day for any image found thereafter.     
   This bill will also increase the efficiency of the CyberTipline, making it a better investigative tool for law enforcement by mandating that all information submitted by providers is consistent. The process outlined in this bill keeps law enforcement officials in the loop by making information more readily accessible and requires providers to retain key data that law enforcement agencies can use to investigate and prosecute child predators. 
   Over 10 years ago, I created the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children after a young girl in my district was kidnapped and murdered. And since then, I have continued to work extensively with organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on educating Members of Congress and others on legislation such as the SAFE Act that strengthen the National Center's ability to keep children safer online and on our streets. 
   Many of us have watched Dateline's popular series ``To Catch a Predator,'' and organizations such as Perverted Justice that actively look for Internet child predators. We need to become partners in this fight by talking with our children about the dangers of strangers online and making Internet use a family activity. 
   While parents should teach their children that the Internet may offer many different types of resources, from entertainment to educational, it also poses many risks. Parents are the first line of defense against online predators, and the SAFE Act will reinforce their efforts. 
   Internet companies will need to do their part as well. When we begin to hold Web sites accountable for the images that they host, we've taken the first step toward supporting parents in their efforts to protect children. Our combined efforts will help make the Internet a safer place. 
   I again want to thank and recognize some of the people who have worked so hard to make this legislation what it has become, those staffers who have worked diligently in bringing this legislation to fruition: Committee on Judiciary staffers Ted Kalo and Mark Dubester; Congressman STEVE CHABOT's staffer Kim Betz; and my staffers, Dan Easley and Abby Shannon, and a very special thank you to my distinguished Republican colleague, STEVE CHABOT, who has worked tirelessly on the issue of child safety, working with me as one of the cochairs of the Congressional Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children. I have great respect for the work that he has done here in Congress as well as for the work that he has done in his congressional district, and for championing this legislation on his side of the aisle and for helping to ensure that not only are Ohio's children protected but all of America's children are as well. 
   Once again, I would like to thank John and Reve Walsh for all the time that they have spent in helping us make this legislation successful, and Ernie Allen, who has spent, along with the Walshes, a good part of this day making sure that others of our colleagues were aware of it, and to be willing to support it. I thank them for their magnificent contribution that they've made to protecting children across this world, not just in the United States of America. It's because of their persistent dedication to this cause that so many of our children sleep more safely at night. 
   Again, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3791.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN COMES FIRST ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank Chairwoman McCarthy for the good work that she has done and for allowing me the time to participate in this legislation and to bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives. It is critically important. 
   My colleagues, I rise today to ask you all to join me in voting for H.R. 2517, the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007. This bill amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act to reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Department of Justice's missing and exploited children's program from 2008 to 2013. 
   Each year, thousands of children are abducted or removed from the control of a parent having legal custody without that parent's consent, under circumstances which immediately place the child in grave danger. 
   Recent video surfaced in Nevada, for example, of a young girl being molested time and time again. Our attention has also been captured by the mystery surrounding Baby Grace, another child who was murdered and put in a plastic box and dumped in Galveston, Texas, near my district. These gruesome acts remind us that we must do everything in our power to catch these creeps and protect our children. 
   Many missing children are at great risk of both physical harm and sexual exploitation, and in many cases parents and local law enforcement officials have neither the resources nor the expertise to mount expanded search efforts. Abducted children are frequently moved from one locality to another, requiring the cooperation and coordination of local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts. Growing numbers of children are the victims of child sexual exploitation increasingly involving new technology to access the Internet. Sex offenders pose a threat to children that increases as more offenders are released into the Nation's communities each year. 
   On May 24, I, along with my cochairs of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, introduced H.R. 2517. Since its establishment in 1984, the National Center has assisted law enforcement with more than 137,600 missing child cases, resulting in the recovery of more than 120,300 children. The National Center's congressionally mandated CyberTipline, a reporting mechanism for child sexual exploitation, has handled more than 540,000 phone calls and leads. 
   We are fortunate that this Nation has a national resource center and clearinghouse such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which works in partnership with the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Marshals Service, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security's Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Secret Service, and many other agencies in the effort to find missing children and prevent child victimization. The National Center operates a national and increasingly worldwide network and serves as a model for many other nations which are creating similar nonprofits. 
   The National Center provides activities and services concerning missing children, including those abducted to or from the United States; exploited children; training and technical assistance; families of missing children; and partnerships with State clearinghouses, the private sector, as well as children's organizations. It is a primary component of the Department of Justice's missing and exploited children's program and employs over 300 people at its Alexandria, Virginia headquarters and its regional offices in California, Florida, Kansas, New York, and South Carolina. These regional offices provide case management and technical support in their geographic areas. And the Austin, Texas office is scheduled to open in the very near future. 
   I would at this time like to recognize those staffers who have worked so diligently in bringing this legislation to fruition: Committee on Education and Labor staffers Denise Forte, Deborah Koolbeck, and Ruth Friedman; Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT'S staffperson Brian Colgan; and my staffers, Dan Easley and Abby Shannon. I would also like to extend a thank you to my very strong Republican colleague and fellow caucus cochair, JUDY BIGGERT, for championing this legislation and so much other similar legislation on her side of the aisle and for being such a tremendous benefit to America's children. I want to especially thank Chairwoman McCarthy. She herself is the victim of family violence. She lost her husband in a violent crime. And Chairman Miller for moving this legislation out of committee, and for their commitment and leadership to provide safety and security to America's children on playgrounds and on the Internet. And Mr. Ernie Allen, the president and CEO of the National Center; and Robbie Callaway, the president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs. And John and Reve Walsh, who have been with me all day today working on this legislation. They cofounded the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and they have been fighting the good fight since the tragic abduction and murder of their son Adam in July of 1981. Their courage and their strength, which has done so much to help millions of children throughout the world, is extraordinary. Speaking on behalf of other parents and grandparents, we owe them our gratitude, and we thank you. 
   Again, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation. It is time that we all step up to protect our children by authorizing resources for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children so children are safer on and off the Internet, where they are free to learn and grow. Thank you all. I look forward to the support for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, today is, indeed, a day for thoughtfulness and courage in this House. As we debate the future of our involvement in Iraq, we must not forget that our troops are engaged in armed conflict a half a world away. It is their future and their sacrifice which necessitated this debate today. 
   Now is the time when this hallowed institution must dig deeply within its own conscience and rise above the politics and the platitudes which have plagued us for far too long. The American people and our troops demand and expect no less of us. Yet no simple solutions face us. 
   Let's look first at the decisions we have made. 
   We were advised that the conflict in Iraq would require more troops, a longer engagement, and an exit strategy. We did not heed that advice, and now we face an escalating insurgency and civil war. 
   We were told the cost was $50 billion. We were wrong. It cost more than $380 billion and climbing fast, and we have not been good stewards of the taxpayer money, as there has been much corruption and waste in our spending. 
   We were told of eminent success in Afghanistan, and we pulled out our troops in order to provide an earlier surge in Iraq. We were wrong, and we have seen a rise in violence in both countries. 
   We must break this pattern. We can ill afford any further misjudgments, because it is our obligation in this deliberative body to consider every option available.  
   We stand here today to engage in the first substantive discussion of the policies we need to implement in order to succeed in Iraq and bring our troops home. It is abundantly clear that Iraq has been and remains deeply embedded in the conscience of the American people. As this world watches, we must demonstrate from the well of this House that democracy flourishes only when honest and open debate occurs. 
   In this difficult decision, I believe this body has two primary obligations to the American people: one, to fully support our troops with resources they need in order to accomplish the missions they are assigned; and, two, to ensure full accountability for the vital resources that we have sent to Iraq. This House has neglected both of these obligations for too long, and it is time for us to exercise our responsibilities on behalf of our troops, the American people, and the world. 
   I stand here today in opposition to the proposed troop surge. We all agree that cutting off funding for our troops currently serving in Iraq is an untenable option that will send the wrong message to our partners and our enemies alike.     
   I will never vote to leave our troops stranded. But the question facing us now is, how can we vote to put upwards of 20,000 additional troops in harm's way without adequate resources and without a clear and detailed plan? 
   Because I stand in support of our troops, I cannot support this proposed surge. It is clear that the burden of our Nation's current struggle continues to rest with the brave men and women in our armed services. 
   It is no longer fair to our troops to rubber-stamp this war. I want them to know that we were deliberative in our decision. I fear this surge will not by itself be sufficient today. It is time for Members of both parties to listen to the experts for whose opinion we have asked, yet have ignored: our military leaders past and present, the bipartisan members of the Iraq Study Group, and soldiers returning from Iraq. 
   It is time for a strategic change in course in Iraq, one including diplomacy and education and an honest reconstruction effort. These actions partnered with the actions of the military will show our dedication to improving the lives of all Iraqis in making their nation one of peace, freedom, and democracy. 
   I am not here today to criticize the President or to engage in partisan grandstanding. This war is not a partisan issue. I have no doubt that one day the actions of our Nation will help bring peace and democracy to the Middle East. However, the strategy we are here to debate today remains flawed. Too many questions remain unanswered. While my loyalty to and my confidence in our troops remains steadfast, this Congress and this Nation must today seek a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I stand in strong support of this resolution honoring the 60th anniversary of the breaking of the sound barrier, and I want to compliment Mr. Rohrabacher for introducing it. 
   Last Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of Captain Charles ``Chuck'' Yeager's historic achievement that led to the first piloted flight at supersonic speeds. 
   As an airplane approaches the speed of sound, shock waves build up, creating increased drag, loss of lift and loss of control. Airplanes had previously broken up under these conditions, and brave pilots died. 
   We now know that the passage from subsonic to supersonic speeds is accompanied by some unusual phenomena which lie in the realm of nonlinear mechanical events, events involving some degree of chaos. 
   America's bright engineers and brave pilots were not deterred. They were drawn to the challenge of bursting through this obstacle to learn what lies on the other side, where no human had ever been. 
   On October 14, 1947, Captain Yeager, sitting on four rocket engines, blasted through that invisible barrier. Folks on the ground heard the sonic boom, and they knew that he had made it. His successful test flight freed humankind to travel faster and faster by providing data that enabled the mapping of a path to a supersonic future. 
   This success required all of the ingredients of successful innovation: technical competence, teamwork, a spirit of optimism and adventure that accepts risk taking. 
   World War II fighter pilot Captain Chuck Yeager was recognized as the man for this job. The X-1 was a joint project of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, NACA, the Air Force, and Bell Aircraft, with the turbo-pump-equipped rocket made by Reaction Motors, Incorporated. It has been described as a bullet with wings on it, just 31 feet long and a 28-foot wingspan. 
   It's on display less than a mile from here over at the Air and Space Museum, surrounded by many other great achievements of NACA and its successor, NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
   The X-1 and subsequent aerospace achievements have kept us where the action is and kept us technologically competitive. We want to stay in this game for the next 60 years, and so I will continue to work to keep America technologically competitive in aerospace and in all other areas of innovation. 
   And with this resolution, I pay my respects to Chuck Yeager and to the many men and women of America's great aerospace tradition. I thus want to voice my support for this resolution, and I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the space age arrived with a roar of the Soviet launch of Sputnik, which propelled our Nation, the leader of the free world, into a space race. We recognized we faced a challenge, and we responded. We made smart investments in our people and in knowledge acquisition to enable us to compete technologically. 
   Specifically, we invested in what we now call STEM education, and we invested in science and engineering research. Those investments brought us preeminence in a new area of endeavor, and they inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. 
   And just 12 years later, two Americans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, stood on the surface of the Moon. The competition with the Soviet Union on a world stage is what drove us initially, but it was strongly coupled with America's innate yearning to explore and discover. 
   America was settled by people who already had lives elsewhere, but who wanted something more. They wanted to find out what was over the horizon. They wanted to determine if there was a better way. We are here today, we are the beneficiaries of that restless energy and that hard work. 
   An array of spacecraft high above works for us. Satellites monitor weather and climate, forest fires, pollution, the growth of cities, and even the shrinking of ice mass. They augment our infrastructure by providing positioning information, and television, radio, telephone and e-mail communications. They help our Nation remain secure. And they serve our restless need to always know more as they go on missions for us throughout the solar system and, soon, even beyond that boundary. 
   Every day people benefit: farmers, surveyors, pilots and sailors, and even moms using GPS to get the kids to soccer practice. For all of our relatively small investment, we get a lot back. That investment is a start-up payment that calls forth the strength of American entrepreneurship and taps America's restless energy. 
   Today we must not sit back, content with these benefits that we owe the previous generation. It is not American in nature to do so. 
   Congress recognizes that our Nation again faces a challenge. This time our adversaries are economic. In the space race we demonstrated the winning strategy and we need to maintain that commitment to a strong national space program. That includes human exploration beyond low Earth orbit, including missions to the Moon and beyond because rising to that challenge will bring out the best of us as a people. 
   In addition, we must renew America's investment in STEM education, in science and engineering research. 
   Congress got this under way with the recently enacted America COMPETES Act, and Congress will need to provide sustained support if we are going to maintain American technical superiority and if we are going to again inspire the world with our accomplishments. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon for his leadership in introducing this legislation. I also want to thank Representatives Mark Udall from Colorado and Ralph Hall from Texas and Tom Feeney from Florida who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. We want to honor this historic anniversary by offering this concurrent resolution. 
   I would like to close by quoting a few lines and key phrases, namely: ``Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House  of Representatives, that the Congress honors the 50th anniversary of the dawn of the space age; recognizes the value of investing in America's space program; and declares it to be in America's interest to continue to advance knowledge and improve life on Earth through a sustained national commitment to space exploration in all its forms, led by a new generation of well-educated scientists, engineers and explorers.''

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 716, a resolution to applaud the goals and activities of National Cyber Security Awareness Month. The Science and Technology Committee has been a leader in the Congress supporting efforts to promote better security in cyberspace, and I am pleased to be able to help raise awareness of this crucial issue. 
   Each year, Americans become more and more dependent on technology for their daily lives. More than 200 million people in this country use the Internet for shopping, for education, for socializing, for information gathering, for banking and entertainment. An increasing number of Internet users are children and seniors. The Internet is looking more and more like real life. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, with this growth in usage, we have also seen a startling increase in cybercrime. Bank accounts are being hacked, children are being bullied and harassed on social networking sites, and personal information is being stolen from retailers, universities, and even government agency databases.  
   The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, US-CERT, found that security threats to personally identifiable information grew 500 percent between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to 103,000 reports. Identity theft has topped the list of complaints consumers filed with the FTC for the 7th year in a row, accounting for 36 percent, or nearly 250,000 complaints. 
   Mr. Speaker, financial crimes are not the only issue; 32 percent of teenagers who use the Internet say they have been victims of cyberbullying. Criminals and terrorists can also use cyberattacks to affect infrastructure, potentially causing physical or economic devastation. 
   These data breaches and other cybersecurity threats come at a huge cost to consumers and to businesses. GAO reports that 31 companies that responded to a 2006 survey said that data breaches cost an average of $1.4 million per breach. Consumers lose valuable time and energy fixing their credit and recovering lost funds. Clearly, we as a Nation must make a stronger effort at securing cyberspace. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is why I join with my colleagues in applauding the efforts of the National Cyber Security Alliance, a public-private partnership focused on improving cybersecurity for home users, for small businesses and for educational institutions. 
   I especially want to thank Chairman Langevin, Mr. McCaul, Chairman Wu, Dr. Gingrey, Ms. Lofgren, Mr. Lungren, Chairman Thompson, Mr. King, Chairman Gordon, and Mr. Hall for introducing this resolution. Their leadership during National Cyber Security Awareness Month and year round will help protect us from cybersecurity breaches in all forms. 
   The National Cyber Security Alliance conducts public education campaigns to alert computer users to potential threats and provides guidance on best practices. They organize events for businesses, universities and the public to raise awareness of cybersecurity. This resolution draws attention to this important organization and the critical cause that they champion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution commemorating National Cyber Security Awareness Month. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the work that the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee and the sponsor of the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act and the rest of the committee are doing on behalf of small businesses, the lifeblood of America. 
   As we consider the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act, we must be mindful of how wasteful government spending impacts hardworking American families. Citizens expect Congress to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars; and when we allow irresponsible fiscal practices to continue in our government, then we set a bad example for our Nation and create a reckless blueprint for future spending. 
   So that's why I have introduced this amendment today. My amendment will clarify guidelines for premium travel by Small Business Administration employees when carrying out provisions of this act. A recent report by the GAO demonstrates that agencies are failing to follow Federal guidelines. This amendment will codify these regulations in order to curb wasteful spending by Federal agencies. Ending reckless spending is essential to regaining  the trust of American citizens and restoring fiscal responsibility. 
   This amendment also offers a direct method of guidance by referencing the sections of the Code of Federal Regulations related to premium travel for Federal employees. A similar amendment applying to the Department of Commerce employees passed earlier this year as a part of the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. 
   So as we continue to tackle large instances of government waste and abuse, let's not overlook smaller steps that we can take. I encourage support for this simple way to save taxpayer dollars and to reinstate fiscal responsibility and good government practices. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3775) to support research and development of new industrial processes and technologies that optimize energy efficiency and environmental performance, utilize diverse sources of energy, and increase economic competitiveness, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased that the House will consider my bill today, H.R. 3775, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Research and Development Act. I first wish to thank my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee for their support in crafting this legislation, especially Ranking Members INGLIS and HALL, who worked with me on this bill which highlights the critical need for research into technologies that improve industrial energy efficiency. 
   An expanding economy and growing population ensure that demand for energy will continue to grow, making energy conservation a key national goal. In the United States, industry is responsible for more than one-third of all energy consumed. Heavy industries such as chemical, glass and metals production, mining, petroleum, refining, and forest and paper products all require very large amounts of energy, making them particularly susceptible to high energy prices. Therefore, these and other energy-intensive U.S. industries are ideal candidates on which to focus Federal research and development efforts and apply new technologies to increase efficiency, raise productivity, reduce wastes, trim costs, and ultimately make them more competitive in a global market. 
   I'm very familiar with the difficulties these industries face. Texas has the highest percentage of large energy-intensive industries, 8 percent of the U.S. total. Over half the energy used in Texas is consumed by the industrial sector. There is significant pressure to reduce the emissions and energy use associated with their processes, while keeping costs low enough to maintain the region's attractiveness to industry. That's a tall order when costs for natural gas, one of the primary industrial feedstocks, are among the highest in the country. 
   The Industrial Technologies Program, ITP, at the Department of Energy, works to improve the energy intensity of U.S. industry through coordinated, cost-shared research and development. The ITP is considered one of the most effective Department of Energy programs, transferring over 170 technologies to the commercial market, improving an estimated 13,000 U.S. manufacturing plants, and saving nearly 5 quadrillion Btus of energy, or approximately $23 billion in energy since its inception. That's significant. 
   The ITP also sponsors university-based Industrial Assessment Centers, which utilize engineering faculty and students to provide no-cost energy assessments, mostly to small and medium-sized manufacturers. These centers serve as valuable preparation for  the next generation of energy and industrial engineers, training almost 250 students per year. 
   The Industrial Technologies Program has suffered dramatic budget cuts in recent years, dropping to just one-third of the funding levels of 2001. And this reflects a dramatic and untimely shift in priorities away from industrial efficiency research and development. 
   So H.R. 3775 authorizes and expands the Department of Energy's Industrial Technology Program through better coordination of interdepartmental research, enhancement of the industrial assessment centers program at universities, and support of more research and development of new innovations and technologies that improve the energy efficiency and environmental performance of most energy-intensive manufacturing processes. 
   This legislation is needed to ensure continued gains in these areas through research and development that makes the U.S. industry more competitive and enhances the quality of life for American workers, their families and the communities that they serve. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Inglis for working to make this a better bill. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3775. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the leadership of both Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton on what is being done and has been done for a long time with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in making sure that it stays strong and effective for us at a time that we do need it and will need it. And I think that if we keep cool heads and look for simple ways that we can reach and try to find commonsense solutions to some of the problems that we face, then we're going to have a good solution to those problems. 
   And we are taking one step today. That's all. One of hopefully many to try to curb the price of gasoline for the American consumer and invest in alternative energy research to provide for the long-term energy solutions that we're going to need. Many of these things are going to be required for us to get the price of gasoline down to the point where we're going to be comfortable again, and let's hope that we accomplish it. 
   This bill directs the President to suspend shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the end of the year or until prices drop below $75 a barrel. 
   High oil prices are straining family budgets at the pump, and we know that they're driving prices up on groceries and other household goods. And families are starting to rethink even summer vacations, and it's going to have a negative impact on so many of our communities that depend on tourism. This ripple effect, well, from the high price of gasoline and diesel, there's going to be a touch to every family, to every industry, to every person, to every business in the United States and even around the globe. 
   Not realizing the urgency of this situation is naive. Consumers need lower prices now, not later. This bill provides a quick first step, maybe not much, but at least it's an action on the part of our Congress. 
   When I first introduced similar legislation affecting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve back in January, gas was $3.11 a gallon. Now it's $3.73 a gallon. It has gone up 11 cents in the last week. And if the President turns a blind eye to the needs of the American people, we may see gasoline go to $5, $6, or $7 a gallon. 
   Consider this: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been tapped and suspended four times by the last three Presidents.

   Mr. LAMPSON. In 2000, as we have already heard, the prices fell by one-third, and they stayed low. Suspending the SPR will put an additional 70,000 barrels of oil on the market each day. It could help reduce prices at a critical time for us in our economy. 
   This action has widespread bipartisan support. It was supported by a near unanimous support by the Senate this morning. I got a letter a few minutes ago from the American Trucking Association saying that the additional $391 million that truckers are having to pay for diesel cannot be handled by them for long. 
   So I'm pleased that we are taking at least the first step. And I am looking forward to introducing other legislation later this week that's going to provide additional relief to consumers to provide and invest in our energy independence through research and development.

If we can try, at least we are doing something that may put it in the right direction. We have additional legislation that is going to be proposed.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to the State of Israel and to her people on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. 
   Last August, I had the honor of going on an enlightening and humbling visit to Israel. 
   As a child, I had heard the stories of Israel from my mother. I pictured busy markets and crowded streets, and men with yarmulkes in synagogues. Visiting the Holy Land was the experience of a lifetime, and I was entranced by the sheer beauty of the living history that surrounded me. 
   However, as I made my way through the striking juxtaposition of modern and ancient architecture, I worried that I might find a grim reminder of what this cherished place might become after years of fighting. 
   One mother with whom I spoke told me a sobering story. While driving in Israel with her family, as we do here everyday, a rocket exploded next to her family's car. Without thinking, she jumped over the front seat to cover her children from the shrapnel and smoke that filled the air around them. Protecting her children was all she could think to do--in Israel this is a conditioned response, a learned reflex. 
   Israelis want to live in peace. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told me that Israel is willing to make changes in the West Bank, release prisoners, or give up land if that means peace. Many Israeli leaders share Livni's optimism, as do I, that peace will come to the region. 
   We must begin to find ways to look beyond comfort zones to stem the tides that divide and find ties that bind. If we can take substantive steps to stop the violence and move towards peace and justice we will have moved mountains. 
   On May 14, 1948, Israel rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. Over these last 60 years, the American people have formed a profound and unshakable friendship with our democratic ally. 
   The United States must continue its commitment to Israeli sovereignty, security, and democracy. We face common threats, share common values and we must continue to work together to achieve our common goals. 
   I praise the miracle of Israel. The history of Israel and of her people is a story of freedom and rebirth that gives hope to oppressed peoples across the world and that will for millennia to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. On 9/11, many of us were here in the Capitol. As we saw smoke billowing from the Pentagon, we recognized the direct threat that faced our country. We stood together on the steps of this buildings, Republicans and Democrats together, and promised the American people that we would do our best to secure this Nation. 
   But we have failed the American people. The 9/11 Commission graded the administration in this Congress with five Fs, twelve Ds, and nine Cs; and we must accept no less than straight As. Our Nation responded with overwhelming support to the commission's recommendations, and that is why I urge all of you to join me today in voting for H.R. 1. 
   This bill will make us safer, but it is just a first step. A TV station in Houston recently uncovered serious security holes at the Port of Houston. I mean that literally, holes. As they walked along the perimeter, they found several holes in the fences. This security breach at one of the Nation's largest ports is unacceptable. 
   Today this threat, this hole in our Nation's security, is being patched. Our safety is nonnegotiable, and we can no longer shortchange our ports. A vote for this bill today demonstrates our dedication to securing our Nation. It is a first step towards truly securing the Nation from threats, not only in our backyard, but to threats half a world away. 
   When I go home this Friday and greet the hardworking men and women of the 22nd Congressional District as they leave their plants and port facilities where they work, I can thank them for the risk they take every day and look them in the eye and finally tell them they will be safe and so will our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us have no more smoke. Let us have no more holes. Let us do the right thing and pass H.R. 1.  
   On September 11, 2001 many of us were here in the Capitol. As we saw the smoke billowing from the Pentagon, we recognized the direct threat that faced our country. We stood together on the steps of this building, Republicans and Democrats together, and promised the American people that we would do our best to secure this nation. But for far too long we have failed the American people. In 2005 members of the 9/11 Commission graded both the Administration and Congress with 5 F's, 12 D's, 9 C's, and 2 Incompletes. We must accept no less than straight A's. Our nation responded with overwhelming support of the Commission's recommendations, and as their representatives, we should implement them. That's why I urge all of you to join me today in voting for H.R. 1. This bill will make us safer, but it's just the first step. 
   For too long we have ignored the threat and been unwilling to meet the challenge. This is a challenge that we ignore at our own peril. Our Nation's seaports handle over 95 percent of our foreign trade worth over $1 trillion a year. The 9/11 Commission report concluded that terrorists have the ``opportunity to do harm as great or greater in maritime and surface transportation'' than the 9/11 attacks. In 2003 the Coast Guard estimated that it would need $7.2 billion to fully implement the security requirements of the Maritime Transportation Security Act. Until recently, Congress had only provided $910 million for port security since the 9/11 attacks. We must fulfill our responsibility by fully funding these provisions, providing appropriate oversight and ensuring that these measures are implemented efficiently and effectively. Our safety is non-negotiable, and we can no longer short-change our ports. 
   In fact, a local TV station in Houston recently uncovered serious security holes at the Port of Houston, which borders the 22nd district. And I literally mean holes. As they  walked along the perimeter they found several holes in the fence. This is a fence that is meant to deter terrorists, yet there it is helping them gain access to these crucial facilities. This serious security breach at one of the nation's largest ports in one of the nation's largest cities is unacceptable. And today this threat, this hole in our nation's security and my constituents' peace of mind, is being patched. Our safety is non-negotiable, and we can no longer short-change our ports. A vote for this bill today demonstrates our dedication to securing our Nation. It even goes beyond the commission's recommendations--requiring 100 percent of U.S.-bound shipping containers to be scanned and sealed using the best available technology over the next five years, among other provisions. 
   This is the first step towards truly securing our Nation, from threats in our own backyard to threats half a world away. This bill will enable us to improve our own security while fostering improved relations across the globe. I urge all of you, my colleagues here in the people's House, and I implore our colleagues in the Senate, to vote for this important piece of legislation. And I urge the president to sign it into law. And when I go home this Friday, and greet the hardworking men and women of the 22nd Congressional District as they leave the plants and port facilities where they work, I can thank them for the risks they take everyday and look them in the eye and finally tell them they will be safe and so will our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (RECOGNIZING ANN RICHARDS' EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO TEXAS AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been able to call Ann Richards a friend of mine and of my family. Just like she inspired millions of young women in Texas and across this Nation, she inspired my oldest daughter, Hillary, who I often took along with me to meetings in Austin. 
   At one meeting with the Governor, Hillary pulled out this yellowed copy of Ann's keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention and proceeded to quote lines back to her. Hillary's favorite line from that speech was one that Ann had popularized in her famously wry tone: ``Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.'' To me, that line epitomizes Ann Richards: skillful, determined, and equal to any man's task. 
   She was a woman in what had been a man's rough and tumble world of Texas politics, but she never let anything or anyone hold her back. She believed education was the great equalizer. She believed redemption was possible, and she believed that a woman's place was in the dome. She aimed to create a new Texas; and when she broke through that glass ceiling, she reached her hand out to pull women, minorities, and the disadvantaged up with her. 
   Like the yellow rose of Texas, Ann was a beautiful and classic lady. She could also be thorny, though. She told you exactly what you needed to hear, using wit and candor to make her point. Her presence and her laughter could fill a room, even if all you could see was that big white hairdo peeking above the crowd. 
   Dorothy Ann Willis Richards is a Texas giant, and I am proud that my  daughters grew up knowing such a strong, independent, and caring woman. 
   I want to leave you with some words from Ann, words that all of us here today should take to heart. 
   She said: ``The public doesn't like you to mislead or represent yourself to be something you're not ..... They don't ask their public officials to be perfect. They just ask them to be smart, truthful, honest, and to show a modicum of good sense.'' 
   Ann, we'll miss you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to speak and also for the good work that has been done on this bill and everything that you and your committee has done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in voting for S. 1738. This bill would authorize funds for Federal grants and additional FBI agents to address the problem of online exploitation of children as well as to establish a new anti-child-exploitation  office at the Department of Justice as well. And this has been combined with the Securing Adolescents From Online-Exploitation Act of 2007. 
   The Lampson-Chabot bill, which passed this body last December, modernizes and expands the reporting requirements relating to child pornography and expands cooperation in combating child pornography. Last year I joined one of my cochairs on the Congressional Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, Congressman Steve Chabot, in introducing the Securing Adolescents From Exploitation-Online, the SAFE Act of 2007. 
   The SAFE Act provides increased resources for law enforcement to capture, prosecute and incarcerate these criminals. By expanding the system to service providers to report child pornography found on their systems, we improve child safety and prevent future atrocities. 
   Currently Internet service providers are mandated to report child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Under the SAFE Act, all electronic service communications providers and remote computing service providers will have to report child pornography. For knowingly and willingly not filing a report after being made aware of a child pornography image, these providers will be subject to increased fines of $150,000 per image per day for the first offense and up to $300,000 per day for any image found thereafter. 
   This bill will also increase the efficiency of the CyberTipline, making it a better investigative tool for law enforcement by mandating that all information submitted by providers is consistent. The process outlined in this bill keeps law enforcement officials in the loop by making information more readily accessible and requires providers to retain key data that law enforcement agencies can use to investigate and prosecute child predators. 
   Many of us have watched Dateline's popular series ``To Catch a Predator'' and know of organizations that actively look for Internet child predators. We need to become partners in this fight by talking to our kids about the dangers of strangers online and making Internet use a family activity. While parents should teach their children that the Internet offers many different types of resources, from entertainment to educational, it also poses many risks. Parents are the first line of defense against online predators, and the SAFE Act will reinforce their efforts. 
   Internet companies will need to do their part too. When we begin to hold Web sites accountable for the images that they host, we've taken the first step towards supporting parents in their efforts to protect children. Our combined efforts will help make the Internet a safer place. 
   I would like to extend a ``thank you'' to my colleague, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, for introducing the House-passed version of Senate bill 1738. I would also like to wish her a happy birthday. She has been a tireless advocate for additional funding for Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces. I would also like to recognize my fellow caucus cochair, Steve Chabot, for championing this legislation on his side of the aisle and for helping to ensure that not only are Ohio's children protected, but all of America's children are. It is because of their persistent dedication to this cause that so many children and their parents will sleep more safely at night. 
   Again I call on my colleagues to support Senate bill 1738.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Chairman Gordon, for giving me the time and also for the good work that you have done, not just in this bill, but in guiding this committee, this Science Committee, for a long period of time and the great successes, also, to Chairman Udall in working with you on this committee; Ranking Members Hall and Feeney for the work that you all have done and staff, obviously, in putting together, not just a good bill here, but making it a pleasure to work on the Science Committee for the last 2 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this NASA Authorization Act. The $20 billion authorization demonstrates Congress' real commitment to a NASA that can fully address exploration and scientific discovery. 
   I just read an article about the Chinese cheering as astronauts made their first space walk last night. It reminded me of what we have done over the last many decades, five decades, to be fairly precise, and how we seem to have lost some of the commitment, because we have seen the budget of NASA decline in the last many years from about 6 percent of our Nation's budget to about six-tenths of a percent of our Nation's budget. 
   When you recognize that NASA inspires children to study math, science, and engineering and see that we have slipped in relation to other places in the world, some say because of that, maybe we really need another crisis. We need another Sputnik to inspire us to recommit ourselves to what we can learn in space and what we can do in exploration and science in space. 
   Well, I maintain that we have those beeps that some of us heard from Sputnik in 1957, that every time something occurs like China's having its own space walker now, or another nation launching some special craft or accomplishing some other task, each one of those events is, indeed, a beep of that Sputnik that we heard in 1957. We need to make NASA a priority again in this country, because it has such an impact on our standing in the world, our knowledge and inspiration for children and certainly our own standard of living. 
   I would mention two other programs that are included in this bill. One is called the Space Technical Alliance Outreach Program authorized in this bill. It helps small businesses grow, it creates jobs, contributes to our economy, as do many other things in the bill; as well as a little bitty program like allowing children in their own schools here on Earth to be able to take pictures from space that ultimately inspire them to want to study, and do study, more on those areas of math and science and engineering. 
   I encourage each of my colleagues to vote positively on this bill and send a strong signal that we are committed to space and exploration.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMPSON. (BLUE DOGS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Ross. I appreciate the gentleman from Arkansas sharing some of his time and all of the good work that you're doing, and particularly promoting the work of the Blue Dog Democrats, the coalition of the fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives. It's a real pleasure to be a part of an organization like this that will concentrate on in part of the issues and look for common ground. 
   I think what we too often, unfortunately, we in the House have been best at producing is division, and it's time for that division to come to an end. It's time for us to start working for America. That's what I think this Blue Dog Coalition has stood for and so do many others. 
   It was out of a sense of, I guess, frustration of several weeks back when--Mr. Costa was talking about it a few minutes ago--when Members were watching what was happening on the floor of this body when there was an awful lot of finger pointing about who was to blame for the energy situation that we were in. But out of that frustration came a plan for many of us to go into a room and see what we could do to come up with a real solution. 
   And that real solution became H.R. 6709, about which Mr. Costa was speaking a little while ago. It's unfortunate that too often good things come out of a crisis. And we're in crisis. But what we've got to do is learn to work together in solving it. 
   What the public hears too often, Mr. Speaker and Members, is how divided we are. And we don't hear so much about how much effort is being made to pull us together, where there are good, reasonable commonsense solutions to the problems. 
   We know that only drilling is not a solution to our problem, and we know that only alternative energy is not a solution to our problem, but it's going to take a combination of them all. And that's what this bill 6709 sets out to accomplish. 
   And Mr. Costa talked about the first two sections. He talked about the offshore and onshore leasing and other energy provisions. He also talked about the title II, which was cleaner energy production and energy conservation incentives. 
   And what he left off at the title number III was the Strategic Petroleum Reserve modification and dedication of revenues to existing conservation and energy research programs. 
   The whole effort that we made in this bill was to find ways that we could get the resources necessary to pay for the research, development, and implementation of alternative energy. There is no question but that we have to grow our supply of energy if we're going to meet the continuing growing demand of this world for energy. 
   And you can't do that, typically right now, with what we have traditionally known. And certainly we don't want to continue to be dependent on other places in the world and ship our wealth off to other countries. 
   So what we knew that we could do is to develop something that would give us some short-term benefit to consumers by decreasing the price of gasoline at the pump, decreasing the cost of oil, and in the long term, give us continued independence and a long-term energy policy that would allow us to do the research to grow wind, and water, and solar, and other forms of energy so that we would have not only a growing supply of energy but one that would be cleaner made available to us in a different way. We can grow it rather than always pulling it out of the ground. 
   Well, our section number 3 of this bill had the plan of modernizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Right now we have about 700 million barrels of oil, like sweet crude oil, in storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and we wanted to propose that 10 percent of  that be taken and turn it into or replace it with a heavy crude which was of a lesser price. And the difference there would generate a profit, if you will, for the people of the United States. 
   And that money would be dedicated to the research, development, and implementation of a number of different areas of energy sources including advanced research projects, wind energy research, solar energy research, low-income weatherization, low-income home energy assistance program, marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy, advanced research vehicles development, industrial energy efficiency research and development, building/lighting energy efficiency research and development, geothermal energy development, smart grid technology development, nonconventional natural gas production and environmental research, hydrogen research and development, energy storage for transportation and electric power. 
   And those are the things that we know are some of what we have to do in order to expand our sources of 
   energy. 
   We have great knowledge. We are a long way on our way toward having the knowledge to be able to implement so many of these different sources of energy and grow our ability to take care of ourselves, be dependent on us, us as America and the United States of America instead of other places in the world. 
   So it's wonderful when we have the opportunity to come together as colleagues and when we respectfully have discussions, as the one that we're having tonight, to be able to put the ideas that we can discuss, maybe compromise on because there's not everything in this bill that I like. I know there's not everything in this bill that other of my colleagues like. 
   But I believe it was our Founding Fathers who wanted us not to have polarization and partisanship but to have compromise through debate. That's why this Congress has been the strong body that it has been for so very long. 
   And to hear such finger pointing that we are not able to get the solutions that we need and want to make America great again, that's what has to end. That's what this coalition is about. That's what this bill is largely about. 
   I'm proud to be a part of the National Conservation Environment and Energy Independence Act, H.R. 6709. I hope many people will look at it and encourage Members of Congress from all over the country to sign on as cosponsors. 
   So I thank you, Mr. Ross, for the work that you're doing with our Blue Dog Coalition, for promoting these energy matters that are so critically important to the people of the United States. And I'm proud to be able to join my colleagues tonight. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, energy is on everyone's mind these days. The price of fuel has been rising and awareness of the extent to which we are dependent upon foreign sources of oil has grown. At the same time, in an effort to reduce emissions of air pollution, we are also transitioning to cleaner fuels. 
   The good news is that we have developed and are continuing to develop alternative fuels and cleaner-burning versions of our current petroleum-based fuels. But we must ensure the availability of infrastructure and equipment for transporting, distributing and utilizing these new fuels at a reasonable cost. 
   For a number of reasons, biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are often incompatible with many components of the present-day infrastructure, forcing distributors and retailers to make heavy investments in new hardware if they want to carry these fuels. H.R. 547 initiates a program to research ways to mitigate many of these problems and make bio-based fuels more compatible with the country's petroleum-based infrastructure, thus avoiding the massive costs to the country of a whole new infrastructure. 
   The bill also initiates a program to develop less-expensive, easier-to-use testing methods and equipment for verifying the sulfur level of clean diesel fuels. Since infrastructure is used for various fuel products with sulfur content, ranging from 15 to 5,000 parts per million, there is a concern that distributors and retailers may sell fuel with sulfur beyond 15 parts per million limits of ULSD, ultra-low sulfur diesel. This simply gives retailers and distributors a way to ensure the quality and regulatory compliance of the fuels they sell. 
   To ensure consistent specifications throughout the fuels market, H.R. 547  instructs NIST to begin developing standards for biofuels as they would for conventional, petroleum-based fuels. There is also an authorization of $10 million to carry out all programs within this bill. 
   Mr. Gordon secured numerous endorsements and support for this bill from groups as diverse as convenience store and truck-stop owners, petroleum marketers and retailers, the Renewable Fuels Association, API and the NRDC. Given the relatively small cost, the very specific concerns it addresses and the carefully negotiated language and endorsements, it would be a shame to make this bill something it is not by amending it with provisions that are outside the scope or purpose of this bill. I ask my colleagues to please consider this as they bring amendments forward. 
   H.R. 547 is a good idea, turned into a good, bipartisan piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill without making major substantive changes or additions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank everyone for their interest in this particular matter regarding the subject of alternative fuels generally, but I have to support the Eshoo amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
   The problem of increased nitrogen oxide emissions with biofuels, and biodiesel in particular, relates to the combustion of the fuel in an engine and not to challenges retailers and distributors are encountering in transporting such fuels, and that needs to be the clear focus point here. 
   For this reason, we actually removed reference to the NO  
   X emissions in the manager's amendment in the committee markup. So Ms. Eshoo's amendment restricts research and development to evaporative emissions from infrastructure. 
   Therefore, I would support and ask for support for Ms. Eshoo's amendment to that amendment.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, this bill was very narrowly drafted to address a particular issue facing the country's energy infrastructure. This amendment does not fall within that narrow focus of the bill. The program areas which are in this amendment would be better addressed by a stand-alone bill or in some other manner. 
   The amendment specifically refers to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions do not occur from pipelines. This bill is attempting to address the issue of transporting additives or other fuels in a manner that makes it easier and less expensive for retailers to be able to accomplish that task. 
   I think there are going to be many opportunities for us to discuss the engines and the burning of these fuels within those engines at other times during this year, and I would hope that we would have the support joining us in making it happen.

There are going to be many opportunities for us to discuss how emissions come from these fuels.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the attention the gentleman from Pennsylvania is giving to what is undoubtedly a crucial element of the possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy. But I oppose the amendment because it has no relation to H.R. 547. 
   This amendment is simply outside the scope of what is a very carefully and narrowly drafted bill to address specific short-term research needs that would allow currently available biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and ultra-low sulfur diesel to be distributed in existing pipelines, and use other current liquid fuel distribution technologies. These are all fuels that can be used in a current generation of commercially available automobiles. 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania's amendment, in contrast, deals with problems of containing hydrogen, a fuel now derived from natural gas rather than biomass, and distributing it if and when hydrogen vehicles become available. 
   Hydrogen would require a new distribution infrastructure. So while the amendment uses similar words related to distribution, it is talking about an entirely new generation of distribution technology. 
   Also, while it is possible that some hydrogen could actually be developed from biomass, it is not today. So the references to hydrogen derived from biomass in the bill are not really related to the research on hydrogen distribution that would be conducted if this amendment became law. 
   It is also unclear what would be the funding source for the gentleman's amendment since it establishes a program at the Department of Energy while the funding in H.R. 547 all goes to the Environmental Protection Agency. For these reasons I would ask the gentleman to withdraw his amendment. 
   This amendment does address an important concern. I ask the gentleman to consult with his colleagues in the Hydrogen Caucus about ways to work the intent of this language into hydrogen legislation that the Committee on Science and Technology is likely to consider as it moves on to other energy research legislation later in the Congress.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I think the two gentlemen who have spoken on this are making very good points. 
   The EPA, however, has been an underfunded agency, and to take money from one area that has been appropriated is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. And I will give you a good example. 
   The Energy Star program. The Energy Star program is an investment that we have made in the future to help consumers, and the money that we spend on the Energy Star program, for every dollar that we put into it, we get about $10 back, a tremendous investment. So it is an area where government can do something positive and save a great deal of money. 
   What we are trying to do right now is to improve an infrastructure that will give us the ability to have access to cleaner burning fuels, that will give us an access to having a product or products that consumers are demanding, and we do it more safely, more conveniently, and hopefully with less expense. 
   We believe that the bill as it stands is one that provides for the new dollars necessary to make this project one that could be very appropriate for the citizens of this country. And the bill could save consumers somewhere between $5 billion and $30 billion a year, a total of close to $30 billion on a $10 million investment. That is one heck of a return, and it is the opposite of what I believe the gentleman, Mr. Blunt, was talking about a few minutes ago that we want to control the size of government. Government doing good works indeed brings us significant returns. This is an area where there will be a significant return, and we think that new dollars need to go into this program.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the gentleman's amendment says specifically ``to be derived from amounts otherwise appropriated to the EPA.'' To me that means we are going to take money from another project to make this one work. That does not work, in my mind. If we are going to have a new investment that we expect a huge return on, we need to put the money into it and make sure that it is a committed project and we believe it is one that will give us a great return.

   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his amendment and his dedication to what I clearly believe is an important issue, deploying the necessary infrastructure to carry biofuels. However, I find it necessary to support the point of order that this amendment is nongermane because it is beyond the scope of this very narrow research bill and squarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce because it uses the CAFE program as a funding source and essentially is an expansion of the Clean Cities program that was created under legislation coming from that committee. 
   While it is complementary to what we are trying to accomplish today and a subject which is potentially worth exploring elsewhere in this Congress, this is not the proper forum for this amendment, and I would oppose it.

Madam Speaker, when I last served in Congress, I made it my mission to discuss missing and exploited children at every opportunity, and I rise today to bring attention to the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing annually and to the thousands of children who go missing every day. 
   Pedro Maldonado is just one of those children. Pedro is missing from Camden, New Jersey. He is 17 years old and was last seen on September 14, last year. At that time he was 511" and weighed 180 pounds. He is biracial, white and Hispanic, and has black hair and brown eyes. Pedro has a scar above his right eye and may still be seen in the local area. He may still be in the Camden area and is considered ``endangered missing.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I ask that anyone who is watching this proceeding, especially if they are in New Jersey or New York, take a moment, look at Pedro's picture to see if you recognize him, and anyone having information should contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST or the Camden City Police Department at 856-757-7400.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMPSON. It is a pleasure to stand before this auspicious body yet again and express my farewell and make notice of the kind words so many of my colleagues made about me and my service. It has been a privilege to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   On this night, I would recognize the death of two friends of mine who provided significant service to the people of southeast Texas. 
   The electrical workers contracting industry lost a tremendous ambassador and friend when Charles M. ``Charlie'' LeBlanc died suddenly on Thursday, August 21. Charlie served admirably as the long-time governor of the southeast chapter of NECA. He formed relationships at the local, State, and national level that were very instrumental in benefiting not only NECA, but all of our associated industry partners and friends. 
   Charlie LeBlanc's career in the electrical industry began in 1970 when he became indentured as an apprentice in Beaumont, Texas. Charlie accepted employment around this time with Gold Crest Electric Company and formed a friendship with a co-worker, Wayne Brockett, that would transform into a highly successful business partnership. 
   The two hardworking, industrious men formed Crown Electric Company in 1980. Charlie's natural charm and technical acumen was vital in the continuing success of Crown Electric, Incorporated, and made him a favorite with customers, general contractors, engineers, and architects. Charlie's entrepreneurial spirit resulted in a company that has contributed to his community and the electrical contracting industry at large for over 20 years. 
   Crown Electric, Inc., became a NECA member in 1987, and Charlie LeBlanc's service to the southeast Texas chapter was immediate, continuous, and resounding. Charlie assumed a position in 1988 on the Chapter Codes and Standards Committee, where he applied his technical expertise for the next three years, and in 1990, Charlie was elected to the chapter board of directors, where he continued to serve until his passing. Charlie served with distinction as chapter treasurer from 1992 to 2000. And he served concurrently on the Chapter Manpower Development, Membership, and Finance Committees. Charlie sacrificed a great amount of his own personal time in his devotion to chapter affairs.     
   In addition to service on the board of directors and committees, Charlie served as division chairman of the Coastal Sabine Division for 4 years and has served on every negotiating committee from 1996 to present. Charlie served as trustee on the Greater Texas IBEW-NECA Annuity Fund from 1999 to 2004; trustee on the Southeast Texas Benefit Trust from 1998 to 2008; the Coastal Sabine Labor Management Cooperative Committee from 2001 to 2008; and Charlie served continuously on the Local Union 479 JATC from 1988 to 2008. Charlie's compassionate but firm leadership, especially on the Apprenticeship Committee, has had a profound and lasting effect on generations of apprentices and has left an indelibly positive mark on our industry's most important resource. 
   His service at the national level began with his appointment to the District V Apprenticeship Committee in 1997. Charlie understood the importance of political action and was selected to serve on the NECA National Governmental Affairs Committee from 2000 to 2001 and again in 2008. Most important to the chapter, Charlie assumed the role of Governor in 2001 and was an extremely effective and well-liked NECA ambassador at all levels of our industry. Charlie applied his boundless energy, infinite patience, and genuine caring and keen instincts to the service of our industry. 
   Charlie LeBlanc managed to devote himself to civic service in the City of Beaumont; service that is important not only to the beneficiaries themselves but to the positive perception of our customers, community leaders, and the IBEW. Charlie served with distinction in the past on the City of Beaumont Electrical Board and the City of Beaumont Board of Electrical Inspectors. Charlie served on the board of directors of the Southeast Texas AGC. He provided service to the Young Men's Business League and served on the board of directors of Boy's Haven, an outreach program designed to benefit disenfranchised youth. 
   Charlie LeBlanc will be terribly missed by all who were privileged to know him. 
   And Charles ``Chuck'' Wilson, who was the tax assessor/collector for 16 years of Galveston County, Texas, Chuck died the night before last. He was a very dear friend, one who had many friends across southeast Texas and in the profession of property tax assessors and collectors across the State of Texas, and he too will be missed. His family loved him and he was known and loved by many. 
   It has been a privilege to stand before the body of the United States House of Representatives for 10 years. I am wishing my friends and colleagues a farewell and Godspeed on the business of the United States of America. I wish them well.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank Chairman Thompson for the opportunity to offer an amendment to the DHS authorization bill. 
   My amendment would authorize the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General to assist the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in conducting reviews of inactive case files. Upon the Center's request, the Inspector General may assist in resolving cases involving a child or an alleged offender located outside of the United States. 
   Federal Inspectors General have recognized that they could help the National Center in a very unique way not covered under present partnerships. They envision using the talent and expertise of the IG community's cadre of special agent criminal investigators to review old, unresolved cases in the hope of identifying new leads. 
   Passage of this amendment would allow IGs, when they are not otherwise engaged in meeting their obligations under the Inspector General Act, to assist in bringing closure to many suffering families. Allowing the Inspector General the authority to provide this limited service could aid in identifying perpetrators and ultimately to the recovery of missing children. 
   This proposal requires no additional funding since it would only authorize Inspectors General to provide assistance to the National Center, as resources are available. I hope this amendment will lay the groundwork for future legislation authorizing IGs from other agencies to assist the National Center in resolving cold cases domestically. 
   Again, I thank you for the opportunity to offer my amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support this effort to bring our children home.

   Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Kind, for allowing me to have a little bit of time to talk. 
   I come to the floor in strong support of H.R. 7006, the Disaster Relief Act of 2008. 
   Last Saturday, September 13, Hurricane Ike barreled through southeast Texas and in its wake left some of the worst destruction in U.S. history. 
   I had the pleasure of working closely with my friend, Congressman Brady, and other colleagues in the Houston area, in trying to put our pieces back together again for so many people. 
   Hurricane Ike inflicted massive wind and flood damage, leaving many residents without a home, others in homes without power. Texans endured the largest power outage in our State's history, leaving millions without electricity and with limited access to water, food and fuel. People like my own daughter, who, thank goodness, had evacuated to some 300 miles away from her home, and when they returned, found that a tree had crashed through their house, left a 3-foot by 5-foot hole which flooded their home. Thank goodness, that tree, unfortunately, had fallen into the bed where  my 2-year-old granddaughter sleeps. But even in the face of devastation, we can find mighty blessings for which we can be most thankful. 
   Last week I spent every waking moment helping my constituents recover and rebound from this storm. I worked with House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Beard to establish a mobile congressional office with some 225 laptop computers and telephones. The mobile office allowed displaced residents with nowhere to turn to have an opportunity to quickly get information and to get in touch. Texans used that office for everything from registering for FEMA assistance, finding a hotel, to finding a loved one, or just getting in touch with someone to talk to. 
   After witnessing the expansive destruction and devastation left by Hurricane Ike, I am determined to make certain that essential Federal tax relief flows quickly to our communities. It is absolutely critical that the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008 pass this Chamber and be signed into law without delay. 
   By removing income limitations on personal loss deductions, this bill helps hardworking Texans affected by the storm get back on their feet more quickly. This bill also helps Texans rebuild by waiving mortgage revenue bond requirements to allow bond proceeds to be used for rebuilding purposes. 
   The storm left thousands of businesses shuttered and closed, unable to operate without power or with significant property destruction and flood damage.

I was amazed at how many neighbors welcomed neighbors into their homes, how many churches and hospitals and businesses and military facilities opened their doors to evacuees, how many volunteers showed up on our doorstep from around the State and around the country.
