<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (34TH YEAR SINCE THE INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 34th year since the invasion and occupation of the Republic of Cyprus. Since 1974, Turkish military forces have illegally occupied the northern part of the island republic. The Turkish occupation forcibly divides peaceful communities and deprives a sovereign nation the exercise of democratic independence in all of its territory. 
   The Turkish invasion divided Greek-speaking and Turkish-speaking Cypriots into two physically distinct communities for the first time in the island nation's history. The unlawful occupation of 37 percent of the territory of Cyprus continues unabated to this day. There are currently 43,000 Turkish troops garrisoned in the occupied areas, and Turkey has resettled over 100,000 mainland Turkish citizens into those areas. 
   The continued Turkish occupation of the island republic subverts the indigenous effort to establish a democratically free and culturally unique Cypriot nation. All that stands in the way of Cypriots celebrating their unique and diverse national heritage within the expanded borders of the European Union is the presence of the Turkish occupation forces. 
   Today, thousands of Cypriots continue to be refugees in their own land, blocked from the homes and the communities they inhabited for generations. Some have been marooned in tiny enclaves trapped by the occupation forces, cut off from the outside world and basic human rights. A new generation of Cypriots has inherited the terrible dislocation that military occupation brings. 
   In the face of all this, the Republic of Cypress has struggled and succeeded in building a strong society, one whose economic progress, development of democratic institutions and capable governance led to membership in the European Union in May 2004. Sadly, until there is an end to the occupation, the occupied areas of Cyprus will be denied the full benefits of EU membership. 
   For the United States, there is a clear imperative to resolve the situation in Cyprus as a matter of justice and the rule of law, principles we hold dear. But beyond that, achieving reunification of the island is critical to the strategic interests of the United States. The Cyprus problem pits American allies against one another. The strategic interest in facilitating a negotiated settlement is significant for the region, but also for the world. Cyprus can either fester as a potential flash point or become a starting point for reconciliation. 
   Reconciliation talks are now underway between the leadership of the two Cypriot communities. The opportunity for reconciliation is real. Since Cyprus' entry to the EU, many checkpoints along the infamous green-line have been opened. After nearly 30 years of complete separation, there have been more than 13 million bi-communal crossings without any serious incident. 
   Everyday Cypriots of the Turkish-speaking community cross into the free areas of the Republic of Cyprus to go to work. Indeed, nearly 3 percent of the Turkish-speaking Cypriot community is employed in the free areas of the Republic of Cyprus, and more than 35,000 have applied for and received passports from the Republic of Cyprus. 
   The Cypriot people want an end to the division of their island. Their efforts to negotiate reconciliation through the good offices of the United Nations must be free of Turkish interference. It is no secret that successive Turkish governments and, in particular, the Turkish military, use Cyprus as a shibboleth to rouse extremist and nationalist sentiment to enhance their own domestic standing. 
   We, in the House of Representatives, should heed the political storm engulfing Turkey. Today, in Turkey democratic expression is challenged at every turn. Today, in Turkey religious and ethnic minorities live in a state of credible fear and harm of persecution. Today and for more than 80 years, the Turkish military holds itself out as the primary political actor existing beyond the bounds of democratic accountability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States should not yield to violations of human rights and the rule of law by the government of Turkey or the Turkish military. The United States, and its allies, particularly the European Union, must stand in solidarity with all Cypriots and support their commendable efforts to reconcile their differences and establish a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation. 
   With the support of this body, it should be made clear to Turkey that perpetuating the status quo on Cyprus hurts its relations with the United States and the rest of the world. Worst of all, it forecloses Turkey's prospects for accession to the European Union. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the reconciliation efforts now underway, and demand from our Turkish ally that it refrain from interfering in the reconciliation efforts now underway. With a truly concerted effort by this body, next year we will commend the Cypriots on their courageous reconciliation, instead of observing the 35th year of Turkish military occupation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 294, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman, and Madam Speaker, I wanted to respond to some of the points that have been raised regarding what is going on with the gas prices right now in the country. 
   I am talking to constituents, just as my colleague on the other side is talking to constituents, and there is no question that people are hurting with the gas prices that are out there right now. That's one of the reasons the Democrats here in Congress have tried to take some very constructive steps to bring down the cost of gas at the pump. Among those, we're pushing very hard on the President to cease putting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He finally came around on that. So I think that made a difference. 
   Secondly, the push in recent legislation to try to curb the speculation in the oil and gas industry by interests, frankly, that don't know much about that industry but are in it to make a buck and have been driving the price up and up, and we want to crack down on that. 
   Finally, among the more immediate measures that we can take--you know, I'm privileged to serve, as is my colleague, on the Natural Resources Committee here in Congress. So we bring a very thoughtful analysis to what is happening with our Federal and public lands and making sure we're using our natural resources wisely. 
   One of the ways we do that is to have issued from the agencies that have responsibility for it, permits and leases so that the oil industry can explore right here in the United States. And I'm going to repeat the figure which has been repeated many times because it's an accurate one, and that is that there are 68 million acres right now for which the oil industry, oil and gas industries hold permits and leases where they are not producing, where they are not pursuing those leases. 
   So we hear a lot about we should be trying to buy American resources and buy American and buy American oil. Well, we have the opportunity to buy American oil only if we're producing American oil.     
   And the industry, for one reason or another--and it's kind of hard to figure out the industry--has not taken advantage of those permits that they have. 
   We tried to put through legislation last week. It was defeated in large part because of the opposition on the other side, a bill where we would basically force the oil industry to either use these permits or lose these permits, which we think is the right thing to do in order to take advantage of the natural resources that we have here right in our own country. 
   I'm trying to figure out why the oil industry doesn't want to drill, and then it occurred to me that, if you're an oil company, the current state of things isn't so bad. You know, people are paying $4, more than $4 a gallon for gas at the pump. The oil industry last year pulled down $100 billion worth of profits. So why would they think there's any problem? That's why we've got to push them, and the other side hasn't taken advantage of the opportunity here legislatively to try to push the oil industry to take advantage of these leases and permits that they already have. 
   Not only that, there are leases and permits out there with respect to the Outer Continental Shelf in terms of exploring our natural resources there, as well as the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.  
   You know, we've heard a lot about this visit that a contingent of Republican lawmakers took to visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge last week. They went to the wrong place. I mean, why not go to the place where you can actually get some oil and get it quick, if we would take advantage of the fact that permits and leases can be issued? We've already done the analysis on the NPRA, on this National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and the evidence is that we could get more oil from that location, for which we already have the authority to issue permits and leases to drill, than we could from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   So I want to caution Americans not to be misled by some of this rhetoric that we're hearing from the other side. 
   We need to break our addiction to oil. The President of the United States himself has admitted that we're addicted to oil. If you're addicted to something, you don't solve your problem by just going and finding a new supply of the same thing that you're addicted to. You try to move to something else. You try to transition, and we need to move over the long term to smarter policies with respect to energy and finding alternative sources of energy and renewable sources of energy. We can do that. We have the ingenuity in this country; there's no question about that, if we're given the tools and the right kind of policies to pursue it. And we can break this addiction. 
   In the meantime, there's going to be a transition, absolutely, and it's not like tomorrow we're going to wake up and we're not going to need oil anymore. I understand that. Everybody in this body understands that. So you have got to have a plan to transition, and during that transition, we absolutely should be taking advantage of the resources in our own country. They can provide some of the energy. 
   And that's why, again, I come back to wondering out loud why it is that our Republican colleagues are so adamant in opposing these efforts to try to get the oil industry to drill on lands and in waters where they already have permits. 
   So, I'd just like to say that what the American people are looking for right now is not a lot of rhetoric, not a lot of double-talk. They want to know that we're trying to create smart policy here in Washington. The Democratic leadership has been doing that, both with respect to the steps we can take in the immediate near term to deal with the price of gas at the pump, but also to show that we've got an idea of where we're headed so that we can move away from this oil dependency and addiction.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (COMMEMORATING THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE AMERICAN HELLENIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 71, which pays tribute to the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA, on the occasion of its 85th anniversary. I commend my colleague, the chair of the Hellenic Caucus for her leadership on this and other issues of importance to Hellenism. 
   AHEPA was formed in July of 1922 as part of an effort to combat the bigotry of the Ku Klux Klan and others who were espousing anti-immigrant sentiments toward immigrants, including those of Greek descent. It soon joined forces with the likes of the NAACP and B'nai B'rith to engage in the fight against discrimination and for a just and equal society. 
   Early on, AHEPA also sought to help newly arrived Greeks become United States citizens and to share in the civic life of our country by forming schools that taught English and the principles of American government. At the same time, AHEPA sought to educate all Americans about the significant heritage and contributions immigrants of Greek descent add to the American community. 
   As an organization, it fast grew to make enormous contributions to our society. To cite one early example, AHEPA raised more than $253 million in the U.S. War Bond drive during World War II, which earned it distinctive recognition from the U.S. Department of Treasury. 
   Today the AHEPA mission has evolved, but it still seeks to bring the ideals of ancient Greece--including philanthropy, education, civic responsibility, and family and individual excellence--to the modern day community. AHEPA's Educational Foundation now has an endowment of over $4 million which annually provides for more than a half a million dollars in scholarships at the local, district and national levels. Thousands of young men and women have benefited from AHEPA scholarships. From its Centennial Foundation and its Cooley's Anemia Foundation to its National Housing Corporation, the contributions AHEPA now makes, both here in the United States and around the globe are too vast to mention individually. 
   But Mr. Speaker, I take personal pride in each of these contributions and accomplishments because I myself am a member of AHEPA. So on this important occasion, I am especially honored to commend President Gus James and the rest of the AHEPA leadership not only for continuing AHEPA's phenomenal tradition of service and philanthropy, but also for their very thoughtful innovations which have helped AHEPA make distinct strides in the evolution of its mission for today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (ISRAEL'S 60TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Israel's 60th anniversary. 
   My first visit to Israel was in 1985. It was during the time of the Ethiopian airlift, before the first Intifada, before the second Intifada, and a decade before the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. 
   I can remember feeling deeply moved by the powerful mix of history, culture and religion, the sheer humanity that pulsated through the tiny nation of Israel and those charged with its stewardship. I realized, too, that America's stake in the existence and preservation of Israel was nearly as fundamental as the stake of Israel's own citizens, not  just because of Israel's role as a strategic military ally in what is a notoriously unstable part of the world, although that alone would justify the maintenance of strong aid and assistance to Israel, not just because of Israel's status as the only true democracy in the Middle East, although that, too, would call upon the United States to give its unwavering support. Beyond those things, for many Americans there is a deeper, usually unspoken reason that the United States must never depart from its staunch support for the State of Israel. In the wake of World War II and its tragic legacy for the Jewish people, the existence of Israel will always be a profound moral and spiritual imperative for the United States. 
   On a return trip just 2 years ago, I had the opportunity to witness the growth and change that has occurred in Israel since my first visit a generation earlier. From the technology being developed in the ``Silicon Wadi'' to the advances in health care and preservation of the ecosystem, Israel is a model for other industrialized nations. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last 60 years, Israel has demonstrated time and time again its value to the world, not just in geopolitical terms, but in what its people have given us in ingenuity, innovation and expression. This anniversary offers us an occasion to thank the people of Israel for their strength, their courage, and their enormous contributions to our global community.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOT PREPARED TO SEND TROOPS TO IRAQ WITH PROPER SUPPLIES -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, as we know, President Bush wants to send another 22,000 young American men and women into harm's way in Iraq in the face of overwhelming opposition, even within his own party and his own administration. Now we are learning that the military does not have all the equipment needed to safely send these troops to Iraq. The Washington Post reported last week that the increase in troop levels will create major logistical hurdles for the Army and Marine Corps, which are short thousands of vehicles, armor kits and other equipment. Even the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Force Development said, ``We don't have the armor kits and we don't have the trucks,'' and it will take months for the Army to obtain the necessary supplies. 
   This is simply one more piece of evidence that the administration's proposal to increase troops in Iraq is terribly misguided. It is another example of how the rhetoric of supporting the troops is not matched by the reality.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (STATEMENT ON JULY 8 AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing H. Con. Res. 405, which promotes the United Nations' sponsored efforts to bring about a negotiated reunification of Cyprus. The division of Cyprus has endured for 33 years, far too long by any measure. 
   Today, I met with Alexis Galanos, the distinguished mayor of Famagusta, Cyprus, which prior to the Turkish invasion was the main town of the second largest district of Cyprus, both in terms of its population and surface area. 
   A few weeks after the initial invasion on August 14, 1974, Turkish military forces bombarded Famagusta relentlessly. Greek Cypriots were forced to flee their homes in fear and terror, rendering Famagusta a ghost city. Turkish forces then sealed off the area with barbed wire fences; 45,000 inhabitants of Famagusta became refugees in their own country. They lost their land, their properties, their homes and businesses and many of their own people. 
   The city and the mayor elected by its displaced residents who can't go home have now become a symbol of the injustice that persists in the occupied region. The two waves of the invasion by  the Turkish troops forced nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots, over one-quarter of the Cypriot population at the time, from their homes, making them refugees in their own country. The equivalent in the U.S. would be around 80 million people. For the last 33 years, 36.2 percent of the island continues to be under occupation by 43,000 Turkish forces. 
   The July 8, 2006, agreements reached under the auspices of the United Nations Under Secretary General Ibrahim Gambari, by President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish-Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat establishes a set of negotiating principles that will lead to a unified Cyprus. 
   The July 8 agreement supports the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot efforts to find common ground for the peaceful reunification of their country within the framework of a federal bi-zonal and bi-communal nation state. These agreements call for the implementation of specific confidence-building measures, starting with the practical steps of establishing bi-communal working groups and technical communities to examine and discuss issues affecting the day-to-day lives of the people of Cyprus. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no viable justification for the continued division of Cyprus. The people of Cyprus have every reason to seek out reconciliation. They aspire to a reunified homeland. In the last 4 years, there have been more than 13 million peaceful crossings across the Green Line by Greek and Turkish-Cypriots, a remarkable achievement for an island whose total population is less than 800,000 people. Turkish-Cypriots cross into the Republic of Cyprus to go to work every day. Approximately 35,000 Turkish-Cypriots have applied for and received passports from the Republic of Cyprus. On the ground, there is clear momentum for peace and a desire on both sides to work together. 
   Today, Cyprus has evolved into a dynamic country, endowed with a robust economy and incredible democratic institutions. Its qualitative capacities are showcased by its recent entry to the European Union and its imminent membership in the Eurozone. Located off the western shores of the Middle East, Cyprus has the capacity to be a vigorous participant in the wider NATO security architecture. 
   For us in the United States, therefore, there is great purpose in facilitating peace and unification beyond any moral and altruistic imperatives. As expressed by the House last week, the July 8 agreement lays the groundwork for accomplishing this goal. 
   I commend the House for its passage of H. Con. Res. 405 and implore our government to continue its support for the full and immediate implementation of the July 8, 2006, agreements.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE COMPLETING 100-HOUR AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire for his amazing leadership of our class. And I am just so excited to be here and to be part of this debate. You will excuse me for looking at the clock every so often. The reason I am doing it is I am so amazed at what we were able to accomplish in 100 hours. I mean, it is almost unprecedented in terms of legislative activity to produce the results that we have. 
   Congressman Courtney earlier cited Tip O'Neill and the notion that all politics is local. And I think that it is difficult for a lot of folks in this country to understand the connection between what we do here, the action we take, and what happens in their daily lives. But I believe that what we did over the last 10 days is directly connected to making life better for millions of Americans. 
   All over this country, every day, Americans get up and what do they do? They work hard and they play by the rules. They work hard and they play by the rules. And all they ask, all they expect, and it shouldn't be a tall order, is that we do the same thing; that the people they send here to represent them work hard and play by the rules. We took a step right from the onset by passing an ethics reform package that really is going to make a difference in terms of the way things operate here. And that was the right thing to do. And the message that came from the American people that we needed to do that was loud and clear. 
   We also decided that we ought to conduct business here in the same way that an average household is conducted, and that is, you make your checkbook balance. So we implemented rules related to fiscal accountability. That makes perfect sense. That makes perfect sense. 
   Let me talk a little bit more, though, about this connection to people's daily lives in terms of the things that we did. It starts at 6:00 in the morning. If you are a senior citizen in this country, the first thing you do, the first thing you do is you take your prescription medicine. Now, is that an experience that is causing you anxiety because you don't know what trick is coming around the corner next? Or do you feel like your interests are being looked after? 
   Last week we took the vital step of allowing the Medicare program, on behalf of its beneficiaries, to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. That is going to bring drug prices down and that is going to do right by our seniors. So it matters what we do here in terms of people's daily lives. 
   The working mother who gets up at 6:00 in the morning, gets her two children off to school, and then goes to a job that pays the minimum wage. What we did last week, in passing an increase in the minimum wage is going to make a difference for that person and millions of people around this country just like her. 
   Families all over America who wake up every day burdened with the worry and the anxiety about a loved one who is suffering from a debilitating disease or condition where the hope that science can provide for treatment is something that can lift them up. We took the step last week, with significant bipartisan support, of approving the Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. That was the right thing to do for those families. 
   We have heard about the issue of security. We took steps last week, out of respect for the families of the victims of September 11, we took steps to implement, finally, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   My blood pressure is going down now because when I go to a gas station to fill up my car I am not seething at the fact that I am paying all this money for gas, and, meanwhile, the oil industry is getting big tax breaks, because we took steps to repeal those because they weren't fair. They weren't fair. 
   And lastly, we took action on student loans. I have said it before in this Chamber, but I have got to say it again because it is imprinted on me. A woman came up to me whose children are trying to go to college, and she looked me straight in the eye, and this is what she said. She said, I did everything they told me I was supposed to do. My husband and I worked three jobs between us, we saved our money and we told our kids if you work hard and you study, you can make it in America. And now we can't pay for college. We have a problem in this country if people are looking at us and saying, we did everything they told us we were supposed to do and we can't make it. We have to restore the bargain with Americans. 
   And let me finish by noting this, and it is something we should take to heart as people who have been sent here to make policy. Policymakers can get up in the morning and they can head in one of two different directions. They can get up and they can think about what can I do today as, sadly, I think this administration does, what can I do today to help people who don't need any help? If do you that, you make bad public policy. 
   But if you get up in the morning and, as I think all of us here do, and you are thinking, what can we do today to help people who really need help, to help the working families of America? Then, you know what? We won't get it perfectly right every time, but most of the time we are going to make good public policy. And that is what we did last week and that is what we did this week. We made good public policy for  the American people. I am proud to have been part of that effort. And I am proud to serve with my colleagues who stepped up and made this 100 hours so meaningful for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (COMMEMORATING THE 186TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in observance of the 186th anniversary of Greek independence. 
   In 1821 when Greek patriots revolted against their Ottoman oppressors, they sounded a clarion call for liberty that was heard by freedom-loving men and women all over Europe and around the world. 
   On March 25 we celebrate a courageous struggle for independence that spanned 8 long and hard-fought years, creating a foundation for the modern Greek state. 
   Americans and Greeks have long shared a profound commitment to the principles of democracy, and both peoples have worked to create societies built upon these values. Throughout history each nation has taken inspiration from the other's experience. 
   In 1823 Greek patriot, intellectual, and physician Adamantios Koraes wrote one of many letters to his friend Thomas Jefferson seeking counsel on how to draw up a constitution for Greece to use upon its liberation. Jefferson wrote extensively in response, expounding the virtues and the fundamentals of the freedoms we cherish today: freedom of religion; freedom of person, habeas corpus; trial by jury; the exclusive right of legislation and taxation reserved to the representatives of the people; and freedom of the press. Greek Independence Day marks the moment the people of Greece realized these freedoms. 
   A shared commitment to liberty has been the hallmark of our collective histories. In the two world wars, Greece fought heroically in the allied campaign to maintain liberty and democracy. Similarly, during the Cold War, Greece fought against totalitarian aggression and emerged as a democratic nation with a vigorous economy, a strong partner in the United States, and a full member of both NATO and the European Union. Most recently, Greece's tremendous performance as host to the 2004 Olympic Games has shone a light on what this longstanding commitment to democratic values and institutions can yield. 
   Mr. Speaker, this occasion also offers us an opportunity to reflect on the enormous and distinctive contributions that Greek Americans have made to every aspect of life in our Nation, including the arts, business, science, public service, and scholarship. As Greek Americans have made this remarkable progress, they have also preserved important traditional values of hard work, education, and commitment to family and church, principles that strengthen and invigorate our communities. 
   In one of his letters to Koraes, Jefferson wrote this: ``Possessing ourselves the combined blessings of liberty and order, we wish the same to other countries and to none more than yours, which, the first of civilizations, provided examples of what man should be.'' 
   In America and Greece we choose this day to celebrate the courage, the liberty, and democracy that is the foundation of every civilized society.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with the gentlewoman that I am and I know my party is pro-American energy. In fact, the more I listen to testimony on the other side, the more convinced I am that this legislation that we're debating right now is exactly what we need to make sure that the advances with respect to energy technology are there. 
   With respect to education stakeholders and their view of No Child Left  Inside, this is a list of over 700 organizations nationally representing 40 million members. Many of these organizations are education organizations who understand how important it is for our young people to get this sort of opportunity. 
   We can all agree, Democrats and Republicans, in this debate that we've been having over energy for the last few weeks and months that it's important for us to develop alternative sources of energy, renewable sources of energy. To do that, of course, we're going to need the scientists and the entrepreneurs who can make it happen, and they are not going to land on a spaceship from outer space. We are going to have to develop them right here, and the next generation is where we are going to find those scientists and those entrepreneurs that are going to make those sort of advances. But they are not going to be able to do it if we don't put the resources behind the kind of environmental education that this will provide. 
   And then just the last point I wanted to make is, yes, there are field trips that will be funded by this, but a lot of what this has to do is getting kids outside, and you don't have to take a bus from inside of the classroom to outside of a classroom. You can walk. And a lot of these young students are doing things right there in their own backyard, right there around their school, right there in a stream that's a quarter mile away, and they can use the walk. The idea is to get them outside and experiencing the environment. 
   It is my pleasure now to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), a member of the Education and Labor Committee and someone who brought a very important amendment regarding environmental justice to this bill in the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, the desire to move forward with the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind is one that certainly we shared on this side of the aisle, and we are prepared to do that this year. The problem is that the administration, for the last 2 years, sent budgets which suggested there wasn't going to be the resources behind that effort that needed to be there, and so we're where we are. But that doesn't mean that we can't, as we're going to do with this bill, begin to set the table for what can be a very comprehensive and meaningful reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act next year. And what I'm so excited about is, if we put our stamp on this bill today, we're going to be sending a very powerful message that environmental education should be part and parcel of that reauthorization next year. 
   I would like to thank, again, the members of the No Child Left Inside Coalition, as I noted, over 700 organizations across the country representing upwards of 40 million people. These are folks who just want to see this happen. They understand how important it is to get our children outdoors and into nature. I want to thank them for all the work that they did to make this possible, to get this to the floor. It would not be here without the work that they have done. 
   I want to close by noting some of the benefits of this. I've talked about the contents of the bill, but I want to talk more generally about the benefits that it offers. 
   Many of the witnesses that we heard from, many of the advocates who are behind this bill are public health advocates. They're pointing to epidemic levels, for example, of childhood obesity that we see now across the country. Kids just aren't active. One of the benefits of getting children outdoors, getting them engaged in environmental activities is they start to become more active, and that is going to be good for their health and the health of our Nation. 
   We've talked about the economic development benefits; that environmental education spurs interests, it leads to children wanting to go into science, into technology, and so forth. And so we are going to be unleashing a tremendous economic potential if we put resources into the No Child Left Inside Act. 
   It is a great way for kids to learn. There is all the evidence that shows that when kids are outdoors, it activates all their senses, it fully engages them, and their performance increases across the board because of that experience. And of course it raises awareness in the next generation of the environment and the need to preserve our environment. The fact of the matter is that the only way we're going to save our environment, the only way we're going to preserve treasures like the Chesapeake Bay in the State of Maryland is if millions of people develop good habits in dealing with the environment. That's what we can impart to our young people, to the next generation. 
   Let me just finish with two articles, or anecdotes. The first is from the Rochester, Minnesota Post-Bulletin. It's an article titled, ``Program urges kids to ditch couches for canoes.'' It talks about a program that a woman named Sara Grover founded, Project Get Outdoors, where she brings kids outside. She talks about a fifth grader on his first camping trip. She said he was practically crying and he said, ``This is the best day of my entire life.'' There are a lot of good days ahead for a lot of great kids if we get this legislation in place. 
   Just to put a punctuation mark on this notion of kids going into science as a result of their experiences outdoors, I just got this e-mail on my BlackBerry notifying me that a young man from my district was named a finalist in the science competition for middle school students. His project was, ``The Effectiveness of Limestone Aggregates to Mitigate Acid-Mine Drainage.'' He came up with the idea for this project while rafting and kayaking on the Cheat River in West Virginia. 
   This is what I'm talking about. This is what's going to happen if we provide our children, our young people, the next generation with the environmental education that they deserve and integrate it fully into the instructional program in their schools. 
   That's why I'm supporting this bill. That's why I introduced it. That's why the coalition of advocates that supports it is so excited about it. I urge this House to pass H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chairman, this amendment would seek to strengthen and improve the legislation in a number of ways. 
   First, it clarifies that funds that are issued under the National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program, which is the new program that's being created here under the U.S. Department of Education, that those funds can be used to address environmental justice issues that may arise in low-income communities. 
   We heard earlier from Representative Clarke of New York, who has made this issue a passion of hers and introduced the underlying amendment in the mark-up at the committee level. This is an important additional element for the bill. 
   Secondly, the amendment clarifies that funds used to develop and implement new policy approaches to environmental education will include a discussion of the benefits and the costs to the environment and to consumers with respect to increasing the supply of energy produced in the United States from a variety of sources. 
   This is, again, an important amendment. It signals, I think, that good quality environmental education--almost by definition--is going to focus the next generation on dealing with these very challenging issues and what the proper balance needs to be between developing our energy sources and conservation and other environmental issues, which is, frankly, at the heart of much of the debate that we're having these days. So this is also, I think, an important addition to the bill. 
   And thirdly, the amendment that we are proposing here provides that the policy approaches developed under this bill must also include a discussion of the best strategies for reducing energy consumption. Again, any meaningful environmental education should include looking at all of these various policy approaches. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, there are two ways to effectively kill a bill. One is to make a motion ``promptly,'' which would send it back to committee. That is not what has happened here. This is a ``forthwith'' motion which brings it right back with the instructions that have been put on it. But the other way to kill a bill is to put instructions on it that essentially gut it and completely undermine what it is supposed to do, and that is the nature of this particular motion to recommit. 
   I object to it on a number of grounds. First of all, the provision relating to priority with respect to LEAs, there are a number of eligible entities under this bill that can participate in the competitive grant process, local education agencies, State educational agencies, higher education institutions, nonprofits and so forth. They all should be part of the same competitive bidding process to get these dollars to try to fund environmental education. 
   Secondly, I object because this second provision that has to do with lobbying in fact will end up having the effect that some of the very organizations that are in the best position to provide good strong environmental education to the next generation will be prohibited from delivering. And as far as that goes, it means that A and B are internally inconsistent because A would give a priority to the very kind of organization that B seeks to prevent from getting these funds. So it doesn't make sense on its face. 
   So I would urge very strongly that my colleagues oppose the motion to recommit forthwith. 
   This is a good bill. It is an important bill. You don't have to take my word for it. There are 750 organizations across the country that are part of the No Child Left Inside Coalition. This is made up of public health advocates, sportsmen, environmentalists, educators, all recognizing the need to provide this critical education to the next generation.

This bill will provide so many benefits to the next generation, public health benefits by getting our kids outside and into nature and active, economic development benefits because we're going to be educating the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs that are going to make the difference when it comes to pursuing alternative sources of fuel and renewable sources of fuel. It will engage kids in learning, activate all their senses. 
   And finally, finally, it's going to raise awareness about the environment. The only way we're going to save our environment, save treasures like the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland is if millions of people develop good habits when it comes to the environment. Our children are the ones that are going to do it, but they can only do it if we provide them with this educational support. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to recommit. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak in support of the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008 which I was privileged to sponsor and which really, I think, sets a new foundation for focus on environmental education in this country as we move forward at a critical time in our Nation's history. 
   Before I speak to the merits, I want to make sure that I thank Chairman George Miller, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for his strong support of the No Child Left Inside Act and for being a champion throughout his career for environmental education. His involvement in this bill and his strong support signals that we are setting a foundation today to make sure that when it comes time to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act next year that environmental education will be a critical and important component of that reauthorization. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Dale Kildee, chairman of the subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the No Child Left Inside Act, as well as Chairwoman McCarthy whose committee has jurisdiction with respect to the National Environmental Education Act which this extends. 
   We persuaded Chairman Kildee to conduct a field hearing in Maryland at the Patuxent Wildlife Refuge, and we did it outdoors. I am not sure that he had done that before, but it went off beautifully. We got very, very powerful testimony from children and parents, teachers and environmentalists and other advocates for this legislation. 
   I want to salute the coalition, the No Child Left Inside Act Coalition, which consists at last count of more than 700 organizations across the country, national organizations, regional organizations, and local organizations who came together to support this important piece of legislation representing over 40 million members in these organizations. That coalition, and this gives you a sense of what this legislation means, that coalition included public health advocates, environmentalists, educators, sportsmen, zoos, parks and other outdoor education centers, faith-based organizations, as well as businesses. 
   I want to give some special recognition to my home State of Maryland and their role in leading and helping organize this coalition and to the Governor of Maryland, Governor O'Malley, and the Secretary of Education, Nancy Grasmick, for also stepping up and doing at the State level what we are trying to effect across the country. 
   Finally, I have to salute the children and parents who came to the rallies and to the hearings that we have conducted on No Child Left Inside Act over  the last year because it was in the eyes of those children, in their whole body language and the enthusiasm and excitement they had when they were outdoors participating in these environmental activities. That was reason enough for us to be steadfast in supporting this legislation and moving it forward.     
   And of course, the many parents who I think look at the fact that their children are spending so much time indoors on television, the Internet, video games, and remember a time when they used to play outside and want to get their kids back out and into nature. 
   Let me just briefly address the contents of No Child Left Inside, what it seeks to do. It is an extension of the National Environmental Education Act, and it has a number of key components. 
   The first is to enhance the teacher training programs and teacher development programs that have existed and been overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency. We've enhanced them in this bill so that there's more of a focus on training teachers on how to deliver environmental education at the school level. We've enhanced it by putting in new provisions to recruit teachers, particularly in underserved areas to enter the field of environmental education. 
   In addition, this bill establishes, or asks, rather, that States across the country develop environmental literacy plans, in other words, a framework on how that State is going to make sure that when children graduate from high school, they have a fundamental awareness of the environment and the need to preserve our environment. 
   Lastly, and I think in some ways most importantly, this creates a new grant program, a National Capacity Environmental Education grant program which will allow local and State education associations, institutions of higher education and nonprofits, to apply competitively for grants that would fund a variety of environmental education initiatives, including developing new policy approaches to environmental education, developing curriculum framework, academic content standards and achievement standards focused on environmental education, and replicating and distributing information about tested and model programs that get children into nature and really have them experiencing the environment. 
   I'm so very pleased because I think this legislation reflects the commitment in this body, in this House of Representatives, in the people's House, but it also reflects the commitment that exists across our Nation today to environmental education and to the importance of focusing on the environment and getting our children out and into nature. 
   There's many, many benefits of this legislation and the programs that it will fund. I will turn to those shortly, Mr. Chairman. 
   For the moment, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that one of the things that is so exciting about this bill and the advancing of environmental education that it represents, and we heard this in some of the hearings we conducted, is you're going to get young people very interested in the environment from the standpoint of what business opportunities, economic opportunities exist. And some of these folks are going to go out and come up with cutting-edge ideas in terms of energy, new energy technologies and so forth. 
   In fact, we heard from one young man who testified that when his interest in environmental education developed, he took that and he channeled it into his own start-up business which is looking at biofuels. And so I expect to come from this sort of legislation which gets our kids focused more on environmental education all sorts of new economic opportunities and things that advance us when it comes to energy. 
   Before I yield, I just want to make one other point. This legislation, in my view, is really responding to initiative and creativity that is coming forth from the citizenry all across this country. Many communities and schools have, on their own, sort of stepped forward and started to pilot things in the environmental education arena. But they need some help. They need some resources to jump that up to the next level. I view as a very appropriate role of government to step forward and offer some leverage and help facilitate good ideas when they emerge from the public. 
   It's been 27 years since the U.S. Department of Education had a meaningful role with respect to environmental education. This bill will make sure that that happens, and that's one of the reasons we're so excited about it. 
   At this time I would like to yield, Mr. Chairman, 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), a member of the Education and Labor Committee.

   Ms. Woolsey just a moment before mentioned just how this brings children alive, and I want to make one point before I yield to Representative Andrews. That is, we had testimony in our hearings for all those who are concerned about this, you know, whether introducing in a meaningful way back into our curriculum things like environmental education and other subjects are somehow going to detract from this important focus on math and reading proficiency, for example. 
   The testimony that we had from one teacher was that her fourth graders are writing grant applications to local foundations for funding that can help support local projects that they're involved in with their local watershed right there in their own backyard, backyard streams and so forth. And nothing is enhancing their reading and verbal proficiency more than engaging in that exercise. But it's all motivated by their love of the environment. 
   It is my pleasure now to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. 
   When the Japanese invaded Guam during World War II, six U.S. servicemen remained on the island. Rather than surrender, these six men fled into the jungle. The Japanese soon learned of their presence and demanded that they turn themselves in. They threatened execution of anyone found helping the American soldiers. 
   Despite these threats, the American soldiers refused to surrender and the people of Guam continued to help them avoid capture. They faced long odds with the Japanese military conducting intense searches of the island, but one soldier, George Tweed, survived. Tweed was later awarded the Legion of Merit medal for his efforts. One of his protectors, Antonio Cruz Artero, was awarded the Medal of Freedom. Countless others who aided Tweed received nothing but the satisfaction of knowing they helped save the life of a man who symbolized hope for Americans to return and liberate Guam.  
   Today's vote will recognize the patriotism of the people of Guam, who risked their lives to save a U.S. serviceman. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1595.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Black History Month. This gives us an opportunity to acknowledge how far we have come as a society, and to recognize the strides and extraordinary contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history. 
   Today our cultural diversity is a source of strength and enrichment for our Nation, and is a particular source of pride for the State of Maryland. But Black History Month also serves as a time for us to reflect upon the progress that still needs to be made. 
   Thirty-eight years ago, Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to Congress. Earlier this month we saw the appointment of Lorraine Miller as the first female African American Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Madam Speaker, as long as there are still firsts to be achieved, we must be tireless in promoting the ideals and values of the civil rights movement and its leaders.  
   Unfortunately, our Nation's history is one that includes harsh divisions along racial lines and, in many cases, deeply institutionalized racism throughout society. As a result of strong leadership, vision and tremendous sacrifice on the part of many, we have made significant progress over time and African Americans have made remarkable and enormous contributions to every sector of our society. Today, our cultural diversity is a source of strength and enrichment for our Nation and it is a particular source of pride for the state of Maryland. 
   This month gives us an opportunity to acknowledge how far we have come--to recognize the strides and extraordinary contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history. It serves as a time where our museums, cinemas, schools and other community centers can showcase the work of African American artists, entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists, public officials, teachers, and the like. 
   But Black History Month also serves a time for us to reflect upon the progress that needs to be made. It is a time to consider the range of experiences within African American heritage and to redouble our commitment to equality for all. Some 38 years ago, the first female African American U.S. Representative, Shirley Chisholm, was elected to this Congress. Earlier this month, we in Congress saw the appointment of Lorraine Miller, the first female African American Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. As long as there are still firsts to be achieved, there remains a reason to promote the ideals and values of the civil rights movement and its leaders. Indeed, the movement continues to represent a beacon for social justice in all of America's communities. 
   So as we remember the struggle of Dr. King and of the many others who were with him, as well as those who came before and after him, we honor those like Lorraine Miller who are still blazing trails. We honor the special contribution African Americans have made to the greatness of our Nation, reflecting on how far this country has come and reminding ourselves of how far we have to go.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, when our Nation is at war, it is our government's responsibility to provide the best protection and care for the men and women who willingly volunteer to serve in our armed services. 
   Now as we enter the fifth year of the Iraq war, it is no secret that the administration's strategy has dangerously eroded our military readiness. Troops are being sent overseas without the proper training, equipment and armor necessary to keep them safe. 
   And as the conditions at Walter Reed's Building 18 starkly testify, we must bring much more attention and support to our troops when they return home. 
   Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress is committed to supporting our men and women in uniform. The supplemental legislation coming before this House will provide an additional $1.7 billion for military health care, including conditions at Walter Reed, $1.7 billion for veterans health care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness of our troops, and $1.4 billion for military housing. As long as they are at war, our troops deserve our support.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and for his support of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Bilirakis, Congressman Space and many, many others in this body, in support of H. Res. 629, expressing the deepest of sympathy to the families who have incurred enormous loss and who continue to suffer the effects of the terrible fires that have raged across Greece since June. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and their staffs for their assistance in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Official reports of damage from the Greek Government will be forthcoming in the next few weeks, but on Monday, the New York Times reported that over a 10-day period an estimated 4,000 people saw their homes destroyed by the wildfires which razed dozens of villages, destroyed livestock and charred an estimated 469,000 acres of mostly forest and farmland. 
   As of Sunday, the official death toll had risen to 65. According to the Greek fire brigade, thousands have been rendered homeless, and hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine forest have been destroyed. The fire has also affected a substantial part of Greece's agricultural sector. According to Reuters, hundreds of thousands of mature olive trees, vineyards and thousands of animals perished in the flames. Overall damage to the economy is estimated at 1.2 billion to 4 billion Euros. 
   As the resolution reads, we take this moment to stand with the people of Greece and vow to come to their aid as they have done for us and others throughout the world time and time again. There is no doubt that the people of Greece will prevail in the face of this difficult time. There is no doubt that they will succeed in the recovery effort. 
   My colleagues and I have been working to identify areas where the United States Government can assist in the near term and as part of the longer commitment that will be needed in reversing the damage. We are grateful that the U.S. Government has already extended funding and other support in this regard, and we are very proud of the commitment already demonstrated by our friends and organizations in the Greek American community who are coordinating a substantial relief effort of their own. 
   I'd like to thank the Greek ambassador, Ambassador Mallias, for his leadership in reaching out and helping to coordinate assistance to his country. He's here with us today in the gallery. 
   Madam Speaker, I'd like to tell a story briefly. I had the opportunity to visit Greece in 1985, more than 20 years ago, with my grandmother who had not been there for almost 30 years. I remember her taking me by the hand as we walked through her village, which  is in the southern Peloponnese, and the Peloponnese has been particularly hard hit by these fires. 
   And as we walked the paths of her childhood, I remember that she was looking for one particular olive tree that she remembered not from 30 years prior but from 60 years before that she played under as a small child. It was a touchstone of her childhood and of her memories, and it made an incredible impression on me, the love, the connection that she had to this village and to that land. 
   Today, for many Greeks and for many Greek Americans, these touchstones, these sacred markers have gone up in flames. Beyond this, the loss of life is tragic. For these reasons, Americans all across this country are moved to reach out to the citizens of Greece. 
   Madam Speaker, the spirit of the Greek people is indomitable. It will triumph over this tragedy, and with this resolution, America signifies that it stands with Greece and its people in this hour of need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding his time and for his support. I thank Congressman Duncan for his support of H.R. 3218, which it was my privilege to introduce in the House. 
   This legislation honors Cal Ripken, Jr. on his induction into the pro baseball Hall of Fame by renaming Interstate 395 in Baltimore, which runs into the city and ends near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, as ``Cal Ripken Way.'' It is fitting that we would pass this measure today on the eve of the 12th anniversary of Cal's setting the consecutive games record. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his assistance in bringing this measure to the floor. 
   Cal's stellar career no doubt made him worthy of induction into the Hall of Fame. In fact, he was elected to the Hall with the highest vote total ever, the highest vote percentage for any position player, and the third highest vote percentage in history. 
   But the numbers don't even begin to explain what he means to our national pastime. Too often, our sports stars are famous for all the wrong reasons. But time and again Cal Ripken, Jr. has been a source of pride for baseball. 
   Cal was a spectacular player but not a flashy one. He played fundamental baseball, always doing the little things and setting the example for how a professional should perfect his trade. And he showed up every day. 
   From the heights of the World Series championship in 1983 to the depths of the 21-game losing streak that began the 1988 season, Cal was there every day. After the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, many fans mark September 6, 1995, the night Ripken played in his 2,131st game, as the night that America came back to baseball. 
   Ripken's commitment to working hard and playing by the rules became known as ``The Ripken Way.'' He inspired the people of Baltimore every season with his quiet and unassuming dedication to his work and continues to do so in retirement through numerous charitable works and his youth baseball foundation. 
   In fact, I believe that Cal has inspired Americans all over the country. I think Tony Kornheiser captured this well in a column that appeared in the Washington Post on September 7, 1995. He wrote: ``When I look at this record, I think I hear the rhythms of America. This celebration of Cal is the fanfare for the common man. Going to work every day ..... building a career, providing for our family like our fathers did before us is something we can all relate to.'' 
   Madam Speaker, if we pass this legislation, when travelers come to visit Baltimore or pass by on their way to another destination, they will not only be reminded of a terrific ballplayer whose name has become synonymous with the Orioles but also a model American and the promise of doing things the ``Ripken Way.'' I hope my colleagues agree that this is a fitting tribute to one of the best loved and most enduring figures in the history of baseball.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, 10 years ago the Children's Health Insurance Program was instituted. Since then, 6 million children have been given access to private health care insurance in this country. It was absolutely the right thing to do. 
   But new evidence from the Census Bureau released last week suggests that we are now slipping backwards. The number of children without health insurance coverage in this country increased from 8 million in 2005 to 8.7 million in 2006. That is why we passed 4 weeks ago the CHAMP Act which would increase insurance coverage for children to an additional 5 million children in this country. That's the direction we need to be going in. 
   Unfortunately, the President is threatening to veto the CHAMP Act. I hope the President will reconsider, stop posturing on this issue, and do the right thing by America's children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I thank my colleague very much. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 1692 which will grant this Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association. This day, as has been said already, is long, long overdue. Later this summer will mark the 55th anniversary of the armistice that ended the full-scale fighting in Korea. 
   I am very pleased the House will today pass legislation to finally grant the Korean War Veterans Association a Federal charter. My father, Senator Paul Sarbanes, introduced this legislation over several Congresses in an effort to get these veterans the recognition that they deserved. And although this legislation had been a priority of his and Leader Hoyer's for many years, we had been unable to get certain opponents to move out of the way and allow it to pass. 
   Now, thanks to the majority leader and to Senator BEN CARDIN and to others who stepped forward with their support, we will finally send this legislation to the President for his signature, and it will become law. 
   Madam Speaker, this is about recognizing the 5.7 million veterans who fought in the Korean War and more than 36,000 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country in that conflict. 
   This is also about fairness. A Federal charter will give the Korean War Veterans Association the same status as other major veteran services organizations and allow them to more efficiently assist their membership. 
   The Korean War is often called the ``forgotten war.'' By passing this legislation, we take a modest step to reassure the Korean War veterans that we will never forget them and their tremendous sacrifice to our Nation.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, as Americans across the country begin planning their summer vacations, one major constraint they will have to face is the severely high price of gas. We are once again seeing record gas prices this Memorial Day, making the prospect of travel daunting for many families. Why is this trend continuing? For 6 years, President Bush and the Republican Congress failed to enact a comprehensive energy strategy to provide relief from these skyrocketing costs. 
   This Democratic Congress is ready to act and move our Nation in a new direction on energy. Already we have voted to roll back billions of dollars in subsidies to Big Oil and instead reinvest those funds in renewable energy. And now this week we will take up the issue of price gouging by the oil industry. We have seen the first quarter reports. The oil companies are making record profits, and it is time they were held accountable. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress will work hard to pass legislation that can establish a new, smart, and fair energy policy for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I want to thank the chairman of our subcommittee, Representative Davis, for yielding this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4106, the Telework Improvements Act of 2008. 
   As a daily commuter from Baltimore to the District of Columbia, I know how frustrating it can be to spend hours a day traveling. And with a focus on gas prices that we've heard repeatedly today, we need to explore pragmatic and innovative alternatives. 
   I've worked closely with Subcommittee Chairman Davis and with Chairman Henry Waxman on this legislation, and I thank them for their leadership. Last year, when I offered a similar amendment to the energy bill, they helped to ensure that the amendment passed the House by voice vote, and I am pleased we will now pass this measure so that we can begin to expand telework options for the Federal workforce. 
   This is a win, win, win. A stronger telework policy will be good for the Federal Government, it will be good for the Federal worker, and of course it will be good for the environment. At a time when a large percentage of the Federal workforce is at or approaching retirement age, we need to recruit and retain the best and brightest of a new generation of workers. By crafting strong and effective telework policies, agencies can compete for these workers and retain them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, last week the White House released an interim report on Iraq that unfortunately reaffirms what we have known for quite some time: The President's troop escalation plan is not working and we are desperately in need of a new direction in Iraq. 
   Since the President announced his surge 6 months ago, we have lost 600 American troops and spent another $60 billion. And yet by the Bush administration's own admission, there is unsatisfactory progress on all of the political reconciliation benchmarks announced by the President in January. 
   Mr. Speaker, just days after this report was released, the White House once again asked for more time to pursue the President's failed strategy. But the American people and this Democratic Congress know that more time and lower standards are no substitute for real progress. 
   It is time for a new direction in Iraq. The House acted last week. The Senate has the opportunity this week. They should join us in changing course.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007. 
   Now, more than ever, public safety employees are being stretched to capacity. With the deployment of our National Guard to Iraq, our local communities are being asked to respond to emergencies with often depleted resources and manpower.  
   Our local first responders represent the highest in public service. By providing them with collective bargaining rights, we can help these patriotic men and women secure adequate equipment, ensure workplace safety, and promote pay and benefits that will allow us to recruit the best and brightest to these important professions. This legislation represents an effort to put words into action. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation's firefighters, police officers, and EMS personnel do right by the American people every day, keeping our families and communities safe. It is high time that we honor their service by enacting this legislation and providing them with the Federal resources they need to do their job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, before I say anything else, I would like to extend my deepest sympathies and prayers to the families and friends of the victims of yesterday's tragedy, and to the entire Virginia Tech community. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 293 which recognizes the diligent efforts of federally funded and volunteer programs, and generally observes the role of volunteers in the life of our country. When somebody volunteers to perform a service, it is not only a service for other people, it is a service for them as well. 
   Now more than ever, Americans need a restored sense of greatness and purpose. On the release of the Corporation for National and Community Service's report on volunteering in America, CEO David Eisner's remarks poignantly address the importance of community and national service. He said, ``Service and volunteering aren't just nice things to do, but are necessary parts of how our Nation deals with its challenges.'' 
   In the wake of tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of thousands of lives have been changed for the better because of the dedication and hard work of volunteers all across the country. But it is not enough. We can do much more. According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, while there has been a significant increase in the number of volunteers nationwide, one in three Americans dropped out of volunteering between 2005 and 2006. Volunteer programs need more than just willing and able volunteers, they need national support. 
   By reinvigorating national and community service programs, and honoring our volunteers, we feed our democratic spirit and cultivate citizenship. Being engaged in democracy through service, we bolster the best of what citizenship is about. The result will be more vibrant communities and a stronger America, cultivated through experiences that all people share regardless of their background. No young American should be deprived of these opportunities due to a lack of commitment from Washington. 
   I ask for your support of H. Res. 293.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, which would provide the most significant investment in higher education since the GI bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank Chairman Miller for his leadership. 
   What we do here in Congress does matter. It does matter to ordinary people and to the average American. I was struck by an article in USA Today earlier this year about a family whose daughter was pursuing an undergraduate degree in art. Despite the fact that their daughter received scholarships to cover about a fifth of her cost, this family had to clean out their emergency savings account and their college savings fund and then borrow from the family's 401(K) plan. Still their daughter will graduate with $45,000 in loans. That's just not right. It doesn't have to be that hard. And it won't be that hard if we pass the College Cost Reduction Act, which cuts interest rates for student loans, provides fiscally responsible and targeted loan forgiveness, and increases and expands the Pell Grant program. 
   I was thrilled to be able to work with Chairman Miller and others on the committee to ensure provisions that would advance loan forgiveness. 
   This is a terrific bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2669.

   On March 31, 2007, the University of Wyoming won the Women's NIT by defeating the University of Wisconsin Badgers 72-56. The Cowgirls won the title in front of the largest women's basketball audience in school history, with over 15,000 in attendance. 
   Wyoming had their most successful season in team history, winning 21 regular-season games and tying for second in the Mountain West Conference. Overall, the Cowgirls finished 27-9, besting the previous team record of 25 wins, a record which had stood for nearly 30 years. They also advanced deeper into postseason play than any Cowgirls basketball team before them. 
   I want to congratulate head coach Joe Legerski, athletic director Tom Berman, University of Wyoming president Tom Buchanan, and the student athletes who won the NIT title.  
   I also want to extend my congratulations to the University of Wisconsin Badgers on their impressive season. Wisconsin finished their season with a school record 23 wins. Their 17 home wins were also the most in program history. 
   Winning the NIT title for the first time proved the Cowgirls have arrived as a force on the national scene, and I know all the fans of the university will continue to be proud of this team for years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I thank my colleague for yielding his time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask for my colleagues' support of the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Act. 
   At the outset, I would like to thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall for their support of this bill all through the process. 
   This legislation is the product of thorough study and planning by interested parties such as the Park Service; local jurisdictions in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia; and historians and experts on the War of 1812. 
   There are too many to mention here, but over several years these individuals have been dedicated advocates for creating the Star-Spangled Banner Trail. This legislation represents the culmination of their efforts and hard work. 
   With the bicentennial of the War of 1812 fast approaching us, now is the time to pass the legislation and begin the process of implementing the Star-Spangled Banner Trail, which will measurably enhance the celebration of one of the seminal moments in American history. 
   The Star-Spangled Banner Trail, through the Park Service at the Fort McHenry National Monument and Shrine, would commemorate the routes used by the British and Americans during the 1812 Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812. 
   The trail, which, in fact, is quite clearly demarcated, would begin with the June 1814 battles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla in St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County, Maryland, and end at Fort McHenry, where Francis Scott Key composed our national anthem as he witnessed the Battle of Baltimore and the British met their ultimate defeat. It would also mark the British invasion of Washington, D.C., the burning of the Capitol and the White House, and other battles in between. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has special meaning for me because of the time I spent growing up in Baltimore and the long relationship my family has had with the centerpiece of the trail, Fort McHenry. On countless occasions, I've enjoyed the fort's history, its vistas of the Chesapeake Bay, and the surrounding wetlands. I highly recommend that Members visit the site themselves. 
   Many refer to the War of 1812 as the ``second war of independence.'' When the war began, our fragile experiment in democracy was still in its early stages, and the Nation found itself under attack from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Many wondered whether a democracy could hold together through the trials of war. The War of 1812 proved that it could, and set the stage for the spread of democracy around the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. And I yield my time back, again, with many thanks to Chairman Grijalva for his strong support.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, there are millions of workers in this Nation in desperate need of a pay raise. They work full time, struggling to make ends meet and support their families while bringing home a little more than $10,000 a year in pay. These workers are currently making the minimum wage, which has not moved from $5.15 an hour for almost a decade, making it the lowest minimum wage in 50 years when adjusted for inflation. 
   This is a national embarrassment. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: In this rich Nation, it is a crime that any American should have to work for starvation wages. 
   Today we have an opportunity to come together and give American workers an urgently needed pay raise.

   Madam Speaker, the cost of college education is becoming the great separator in American society. It threatens to make access to the American Dream a matter of means and not merit. If we let that happen, then we guarantee the decline of American competitiveness and risk a slow and steady slide into mediocrity. 
   We can do better, and today we will do better. By passing the College Student Relief Act of 2007 and cutting the interest rates on student loans, we will take an important step in providing fairness and opportunity to the next generation. 
   I want to tell you about a woman I met in Maryland during my campaign.  She is the mother of three college age students, a professional woman who works here in D.C. She came up to me, she looked me right in the eye, she said, ``I have three children who are going to college and I can't afford it.'' And then she said, ``I did everything they told me I was supposed to do. I worked three jobs, my husband and I between us, we saved our money, and we told our kids if you work hard and study, you can make it in America. And now we can't afford college.'' 
   What she was saying is what millions of Americans are saying, which is we worked hard and played by the rules, and then we found out we couldn't make it. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a chance today to begin restoring the bargain with America that so many fear is in jeopardy. No student who works hard and achieves should be denied the opportunity to attend college because they cannot afford it. Our country needs these young people if we are going to be strong. I urge passage of H.R. 5.

   In the wake of Katrina, we learned that years of requests for investment in infrastructure and basic human needs had been ignored. After sending our troops into Iraq, we learned that they lacked basic protective equipment because this administration was looking to save pennies even as it was wasting billions of dollars on private contracts run amok. 
   Now the scandal at Walter Reed Hospital is revealing that behind the curtain even our neediest veterans are not being spared the double whammy of inadequate resources and lax accountability. 
   All Americans should be outraged at this and demand accountability. But we should also be outraged at the cynical agenda this administration has brought to all government functions. Resources are cut, making it impossible for the affected workforce to deliver high-quality services. At the same  time, critical functions are contracted out to the private sector without adequate oversight. Then the administration turns around and says, see, government doesn't work. 
   Madam Speaker, it's time we reversed course and put adequate resources, attention, and accountability towards the needs of all our citizens but most especially our veterans.

   Mr. Chairman, I am quite aware that I am the last one in line before the Committee rises. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer the Sarbanes-Wolf amendment to promote telework options for the Federal workforce. The amendment is in keeping with the provisions of the energy bill that seek to promote a new carbon neutral Federal Government. In fact, it is estimated that about one-third of carbon emission in the United States is transportation related. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Waxman for his support of the amendment. 
   This amendment, combined with other provisions of the bill, such as higher emissions standards for vehicles owned and operated by the Federal Government, seeks to ensure that we in government do our part to reduce automobile emissions. 
   I would like to salute the distinguished gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Wolf, who has joined me today in offering this amendment, and is a tireless advocate for telework in the Federal Government. Over the last decade, he has put telework on the map as a management option within the Federal workforce, and I want to thank him for his leadership. 
   The amendment requires that agencies establish a telework policy within 1 year. Employees who handle national security or intelligence materials or special equipment would be exempted from the policy. It provides for training and monitoring, designates a senior telework managing employee in each of the agencies, and requires the GAO to examine and evaluate the telework policies of each agency. 
   I thank Congressman Wolf for his leadership in this area, and I hope all of my colleagues feel this is a win-win for the Federal Government and the Federal workforce.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman Miller, Chairwoman McCarthy, and others for putting together the GIVE Act, which reauthorizes the National Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973. This act supports the Nation's priorities in a number of important areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans are hungry to serve. Last year, 62 million Americans contributed 8.2 billion hours of volunteer service. And the question is, are we ready to absorb that energy? Do we have a way of capturing it and channeling it? 
   What the GIVE Act does is it creates that infrastructure; and that's why we need it, because if we don't have an infrastructure to respond to that volunteer energy, then people will go away even more disillusioned. So the GIVE Act steps up and does exactly the right thing. 
   And here are some of the things that it does: it sets a goal of 100,000 AmeriCorps volunteers by 2012 putting 25,000 additional volunteers into our communities; it engages youth through a summer of service; and it creates a new energy conservation corps. That corps will focus our service corps apparatus on some of the Nation's most pressing problems: energy efficiency and conservation training for green jobs and rehabilitation of our Nation's critical infrastructure. It will enlist both seniors and young people in that enterprise. 
   The act will also do right by our veterans. I was pleased to work with Mr. Miller and Mrs. McCarthy to include language in this bill that would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to initiate a national conversation by commissioning a study to develop and test a service corps program that both targets veterans as recipients of community service and utilizes their service as participants and volunteers. This national conversation would provide a framework for better targeting the needs of veterans in the community. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the committee on its work on these important issues. It is said that the pulse and time of a Nation are best reflected in its service to others. The GIVE Act launches a new era of service and, in so doing, will showcase the best of what America has to offer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague Representative Pallone on his work on H.R. 4848 which is important for us to support because it does extend certain mental health coverages. But as we've all been saying here today, it is just as important that we continue to work very hard to enact and pass H.R. 1424, which is the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, and I want to salute Representatives Ramstad and Kennedy for their tremendous work on this bill. 
   Mental health parity is the right thing to do. Clearly, there are so many individuals and families that are in pain in this country because they are not receiving the mental health counseling services, the substance abuse and addiction treatment services that they deserve and that our society ought to provide to them. 
   But it is also the smart thing to do. All of the statistics, even if you just wanted to look at this through the cold, calculating lens of what the bottom line represents in terms of cost to our system and our society, all of the studies that have been done show that there are tremendous savings to be had if we focus on these kinds of service. 
   There have been many statistics that have been cited today. I will cite a few more. Depressed workers lose 5 1/2 hours per week of productive work time. That adds up to tens of billions of dollars lost a year to employers. Alcohol-related illness and premature death cost over $130 billion in lost productivity in 1998, and the statistics go on and on and on. 
   Even the most tightfisted insurer will discover very quickly once we have mental health parity in place that the costs are a lot and that, in fact, there are savings to be had as you reallocate dollars to mental health treatment and substance abuse treatment in terms of the savings in related medical treatment. 
   So it is absolutely the right thing to do, and particularly at this time when we have so many stories of returning veterans who are suffering from traumatic brain injury, from mental health issues and need the support that can come from this, from this larger bill, from the Paul Wellstone Act. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this extension through H.R. 4848 of certain mental health coverages, but I join all those who are advocating very strongly that we move forward and enact the larger bill, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join others in commemorating the life and legacy of Congressman Parren J. Mitchell. Growing up in Baltimore, I came to understand the tremendous positive impact this great man had on my community, the State of Maryland and indeed this country. 
   The first African American Congressman from my State, Parren Mitchell fought against racism at every turn, but he fought on other fronts as well, wherever he saw injustice, and inhumanity. At his memorial service earlier today in Baltimore, we heard again and again of a man unafraid to speak truth to power. 
   I would like to share my own personal story of how I felt the presence of this man. 
   Some years ago, Congressman Mitchell was honored at the 15th anniversary of the Public Justice Center, an organization committed to building systemic change in our society. 
   It was an easy choice to salute Congressman Mitchell, but it was not easy for him to attend the event. He was by then quite frail, and as he was helped to the stage to receive the honor, I remember wondering whether he would have the energy to speak. 
   I needn't have worried. A steady and resonant voice filled the hall, and from this slightly built man, at that point in his life no longer able to stand up, came simple and powerful words of gratitude and inspiration. 
   He spoke at length and without hesitation about his core principles of honesty, justice and compassion. It was, Mr. Speaker, a tour de force. I can only imagine what that voice was like when it held forth in this Chamber and carried the day on so many critical issues. 
   Something else happened that night that is worth relating. After Congressman Mitchell finished speaking, the organization honored a young man from the community who had struggled and succeeded in overcoming unfair labor practices in his industry. That young man, looking out on a crowd of 500 people, said this: ``We need to make sure that the big corporations pay the little guy for the hard work.'' 
   I looked at Congressman Mitchell, and I saw a smile creeping across his face. It was truth to power at its very best, all that Parren Mitchell had ever stood for. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to salute this fine American and great son of Baltimore.

   The President refuses to give our troops, this Congress, or the American people any timelines as to when this war will end or under what conditions he would finally bring our troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President says that things are getting better in Iraq, but that's simply not true. Last month was  one of the deadliest months for American troops in Iraq. One hundred four soldiers were killed. 
   It's time for a new course. It's time for the President to sit down and work with this Congress so we can finally produce the change that will end this war.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I thank my colleague. And I know we have a number of people here that are going to speak, and if at any time I say something where you would like me to yield to add to the discussion, please let me know as we move forward. 
   There is no more important issue than children's health insurance coverage. And I think it's incomprehensible to certainly all of us here this evening who are talking about the issue, but I think to most Americans, that the President of the United States initially even threatened to veto, but then today took the action of vetoing this bill which would increase to 10 million children the number that are covered under this health insurance program. 
   I wanted to speak just a moment about two faces on this issue that my life has intersected with. They come from the State of Maryland, and actually over the last few months they've become known to millions of Americans across the country. The first face is the face of Diamonte Driver, who was a young man in Prince George's County, Maryland who had a toothache and ended up dying because he didn't get the treatment that he needed. If his family had had the coverage available that SCHIP provides, his mother could have gotten him to a doctor, a dentist. He would have been seen early, like is the experience of most of us when we have a toothache, and his life would have been saved. 
   I came to know Diamonte because I worked for years with an organization called the Public Justice Center in Maryland. And the Public Justice Center has been championing increasing Medicaid coverage for children in the State of Maryland. And they had worked with the Driver family. They were actually working with Diamonte's older brother, trying to get him some help that he needed through the Medicaid program, and got to know the family that way, and then Diamonte's situation occurred. So that hit me right there because I was aware of what had happened with this family through my personal interaction with that organization. That's the terrible tragic face on this issue. That's what happens when the coverage isn't there, when children don't get the health care coverage that they need. 
   There is a positive face on this issue, which was illustrated by the Frost family, Graham and Gemma Frost. Graham Frost was part of the Democratic statement across the country this past weekend where he talked about how his sister and he were in a terrible car accident, and because they were covered by the SCHIP program, they got the treatment they needed, it did not bankrupt the family, and that family is intact, healthy and able to move forward because of the SCHIP program. 
   So, on the one hand you have the example of Diamonte Driver, someone who didn't have access to this kind of coverage, and on the other hand you have the experience of Graham and Gemma Frost, who did. 
   I don't understand how the President can line himself up against 10 million children in this country. It is mind-boggling to me, and I've been trying to figure out why he would do it. I think there's maybe a philosophical imperative that he is laboring under, this notion that somehow a government program, already proven to work well, can't continue to work well because there is this investment in the notion that government can't do good things, that government can't design programs that work effectively. And so that philosophy apparently this administration is prepared to sacrifice. At the alter of that philosophy, the government can't do anything right, they're prepared to sacrifice the interests of millions and millions of children across this country.     
   The President made a statement the other day where he said, ``Well, what's the problem? If children need to get treatment, they can always go to the local emergency room.'' I know we all heard that. Some of us were stunned with the callousness of that comment. But I was impressed as much with its callousness as I was, or in addition to its callousness, as with its lack of insight. 
   I have spent 18 years working with hospitals. I know that the emergency room of a hospital is the highest-cost part of our system. Why would you want children to go there to get treatment when you could build clinics and otherwise empower our health care providers, through the SCHIP program, to provide service at an earlier stage? Not only is it less expensive, but you intervene before children reach a more acute condition where the cost of treating them is going to be higher. So this, I think, illustrates a fundamental lack of understanding of how we can enhance coverage in our health care system. 
   Let me just make a couple of final comments here. We didn't send the SCHIP bill to the President. We, the Members of the House and the Members of the Senate who voted for it, didn't send it to the President. We delivered it to the President. We delivered it on behalf of America's children. That is what we did. That is our job. We are an instrument of the American people, and in this case, of America's children, so we delivered this to the President on behalf of America's children. His decision to veto it is not a rejection of this Congress. It is a rejection of the interests of America's children. 
   What I hope Americans all across this country will do, starting tonight and going forward over the days to come, is make it perfectly clear that they want this Congress to override the veto of the President on SCHIP. Call us. Call every Member in this Chamber and make that point. Because if you do that, you are going to send a powerful message to the President that he made the wrong decision here. In spite of the decision he made, we can move forward on behalf of America's children. 
   I yield back to my colleague and thank him for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (FOUNDATION FOR A FIT NATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Foundation for a Fit Nation Act, legislation to establish the National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation which would fund the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. 
   Despite the undisputed benefits of physical activity, most Americans continue to lead alarmingly inactive lifestyles. Studies by the Center for Disease Control show that more than 50 percent of American adults do not get enough physical activity to provide health benefits, and 24 percent are not active at all in their leisure time. According to the CDC, 61.5 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 13 do not participate in any organized physical activity outside of school; however, the American Heart Association found that schools are cutting back on physical education, the best method to combat childhood obesity. 
   In the United States, obesity among both children and adults has become a problem of epidemic proportions. The number of Americans who are overweight and obese is staggering. The American Obesity Association reported 127 million overweight adults in the United States. The most disturbing statistics, however, revolve around the growing rates of obesity of American children. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that 20 percent of American youth will be obese by the year 2010. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to ignore these statistics any longer. We owe it to ourselves and our Nation to support a healthy lifestyle for our constituents. We should be especially cognizant of the importance of instilling in our young people an appreciation of the value of maximizing physical fitness. The creation of the National Foundation on Physical Fitness serves as an important first step towards reaching these goals. 
   The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is an advisory committee created in 1982 to promote physical activity and fitness in the United States. Currently, the President's Council on Physical Fitness operates on a shoestring budget, a mere $2.1 million, a figure which is vastly incommensurate with the importance of the PCPF mission. The Council is among several departments within the Center for Disease Control which are eligible to receive private contributions, however it is currently not authorized to solicit contributions. 
   When the Foundation for a Fit Nation Act is passed, it would direct the President's Council on Physical Fitness to establish a nonprofit foundation designed to promote and encourage the solicitation of private contributions as an independent source of funding for the Council. This budget increase would allow the President's Council on Physical Fitness to expand its scope and activities with no cost to taxpayers. This bill would help further an important national goal, encouraging and fostering physical fitness and well-being through three specific measures: 
   First, establishing the nonprofit National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation to promote and improve physical fitness and sports programs in conjunction with the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports; 
   second, allowing the Foundation to solicit, receive and administer private contributions for the President's Council; 
   and third, establishing a bipartisan nine-member board of directors to oversee the Foundation. 
   Physical activity is not only vitally important for our health, but serves as an enjoyable means for the development of commitment, perseverance and teamwork, all of which foster strong societies. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation which would provide a private source of funding for an organization critical to the well-being of our constituents.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION TO PLAN AND COORDINATE THE BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE WAR OF 1812 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce two related bills. The first would create a Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail to commemorate the Chesapeake Bay Campaign of the War of 1812. The second bill I am introducing would create a national commission to plan and coordinate the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812. 
   The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail would match some of the most important events of the War of 1812. The trail commemorating the only combined naval and land attack on the United States begins with June 1814 battles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake flotilla in Saint Leonard's Creek in Calvert County and ends at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where our National Anthem was composed and the British met their ultimate defeat.     
   Maryland is blessed with a multitude of historic and cultural attractions across the State. Fort McHenry is a classic example of this rich heritage and a centerpiece of the legislation I introduce today. Francis Scott Key best captured the essence of Fort McHenry in his poem written as a prisoner aboard a British frigate during the bombardment of the fort. The text of the poem later became our National Anthem. 
   For decades, my family has enjoyed Fort McHenry's history as well as its tremendous vistas of our beloved Chesapeake Bay. Just recently, I spent the morning there with my son, an avid birder and budding naturalist, exploring the wetland restoration area that abuts the fort. 
   The second bill I introduce today would create a Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to plan and coordinate the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and the composition of our National Anthem. The Commission would be made up of citizens from States that the National Park Service has determined to be the most historically significant, as well as National Park Service officials, historical experts and other individuals selected by congressional leadership. 
   With the bicentennial of the War of 1812 quickly approaching, we should move swiftly to approve this measure and enable the Commission to plan a suitable bicentennial celebration. 
   Mr. Speaker, the War of 1812 was a seminal moment in American history. Many refer to it as the ``second war of independence.'' When the war began, our fragile experiment in democracy was still in its early stages, and the Nation found itself under attack from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Many wondered whether democracy could hold together through the trials of war. The War of 1812 proved that liberty and security are not mutually exclusive conditions and set the stage for the spread of democracy around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, just this morning I met with War of 1812 experts and historic preservationists from throughout the State of Maryland at Fort McHenry. For years, these individuals have been dedicated advocates for creating the Star Spangled Banner Trail and Bicentennial Commission. This legislation represents a culmination of their interests and hard work. I am very proud to be introducing it today, and I hope my colleagues will join with me to pass both bills during this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding his time. 
   I rise to strongly support H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act, and I want to thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership in shepherding this bill through to the floor. 
   This will establish a structure that will rein in the abuses in government contracting that we have been having hearing after hearing about over the last few weeks. By putting emergency no-bid contracts into position where they are limited to 1 year, requiring agencies to develop plans to try to limit the number of those contracts, and also to promote fixed-price contracts instead of cost-plus contracts, we can promote much more transparency in the way these contracts are let. 
   One particular way in which these emergency no-bid contracts can be exploited came to our attention during a hearing, and that is, often the cost structure is not put in place for some time after the contract is let under emergency conditions. This allows the contractor to front-load a lot of costs that can be very difficult for the auditors to come in and question later. And so in limiting the number of no-bid contracts and emergency contracts that are let, we can discourage that kind of activity. 
   Madam Chairman, the administration is really engaged over the last few years in sort of a two-step shuffle that seeks to discredit good government, and bad contracting gives a bad name to good government. 
   On the one hand, what they have done with many of our Federal agencies is they have cut resources. That makes it more difficult for good Federal employees to do their job, and they point at that and then they say government doesn't work. And on the other hand, they have this impulse to outsource and contract things to the private sector in situations where that may not be warranted, without any accountability or oversight. And then, when things go wrong, they point to it and they say, see, government doesn't work. 
   There are going to be times when we have to outsource things, when we have to procure services from the private sector. At a very minimum, when we do that, we need to make sure that it is done with transparency and accountability. If we do that, we can restore faith in the notion of good and accountable government.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5540, legislation that will reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network which will otherwise expire at the end of 2008. 
   First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their leadership in getting this bill to the floor. They've been stalwart advocates in this effort. 
   The Chesapeake Bay has a tremendous tale to tell.     
   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Program connects those who live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to the natural, cultural and historic resources of the bay, and thereby encourage individual and citizen stewardship of these resources. 
   I guess the best way to describe the Gateways program is an insurance policy on our larger investment in the Chesapeake Bay. There are three parts to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay; there is funding, which of course is extremely critical, there is regulatory guidance, and then there is citizen stewardship. Without individual responsibility, without widespread engagement by the 16 million people that reside in the watershed, it would be impossible to achieve and maintain the goal of cleaning up the bay. For a very modest investment, the Gateways program helps to foster the citizen stewardship that will be necessary to advance bay clean-up and maintain the gains that we hope to make. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the Chesapeake Bay is our Nation's largest estuary. It is a national environmental treasure and an economic catalyst as it pertains to the region's tourism and seafood industries. Unfortunately, as many also know, the bay's health in recent years has been significantly and negatively impacted by multiple factors, such as increased nutrient runoff, chemical contaminants, and other forms of pollution. As a result, there has been a severe deterioration in the bay's water quality in recent years and a rapid loss of living resources and natural habitat. 
   To combat these trends, in 1983 the Chesapeake Bay Program was created. It is a partnership between the States of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the Federal Government, which is dedicated to restoring and protecting the bay. I am also committed to reversing these trends and restoring the bay's water quality and natural habitats, and that is why I have introduced this legislation to continually reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network. 
   The Gateways program is the National Park Service's component of the greater Chesapeake Bay program. The Park Service has entered into a memorandum of understanding under the Chesapeake Bay program that tasks the Park Service with ``conserving the Chesapeake Bay's national and cultural heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.'' It goes on to say that the Park Service will provide assistance to the bay program through resource planning and grants management, rivers and trails conservation assistance, public education, interpretation, and cooperative heritage planning support. 
   That is precisely the purpose of the Gateways program. It provides grants and technical assistance to parks, volunteer groups, wildlife refuges, historic sites, museums, and water trails throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It also provides assistance to the critical volunteer groups that have stepped forward to support the Gateway sites. 
   The network ties these sites together to provide meaningful experiences and to encourage individual citizens to invest their own time and energy in the clean up of the Chesapeake Bay. Since 2000, the network has grown to include 156 gateways in six States and the District of Columbia. That is why the Park Service has repeatedly praised the Gateways program. 
   In September of 2004, the Service released a special resource study recommending that Gateways be a permanent Park Service program. It goes on to say that an enhanced version of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network would be the most effective and efficient way for the National Park Service to help protect and tell the story of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   In 2005, the White House Conference on Cooperative Conservation recognized Gateways as ``a cooperative conservation success story.'' And therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we act now to reauthorize this program so that the network and its partners can continue to educate residents of the Chesapeake Bay watershed about the natural, cultural, historic and recreational sites throughout the bay region, and how their communities relate directly to the health of our largest estuary and a national treasure, the Chesapeake Bay. 
   By maintaining the network and providing access to these sites, we can help develop the next generation of environmental stewards, which is one of the best ways to truly save the bay. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, a couple of points. 
   First of all, the gentleman from Utah spoke to the livelihood of people who work on the Chesapeake Bay, but the biggest threat to those who make their living on the Chesapeake Bay is the decline in the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the fisheries in particular that are in the Chesapeake Bay. So if we have the interests of those people at heart, we ought to be committing ourselves wholeheartedly to this continuing authorization of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network, because it is designed to enhance and improve and protect over the long term the health of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   To address another point, one of the reasons that the Democratic majority has been so steadfast in urging the pursuit of alternatives to fossil fuels in terms of energy sources is to reduce our dependence there, which obviously could go a long way towards the concern over fuel prices and gas prices. But another reason is because it will reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, which, again, impact the environment. If we don't take steps to do that, then there is not going to be any environment for us to enjoy. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Program, it has been alluded to the fact that this is noncontroversial bill, that it should have come up on suspension. I agree. The minority resisted our desire to have it permanently authorized, and that is why we are in the process we are in today. But that permanent authorization I think is very much a part of the strong statement that we are seeking to make to the citizens in the watershed and to the many millions of visitors who come to the watershed every year, that our national government stands steadfast in this partnership with our citizenry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, again, I am gratified the gentleman from Utah plans to vote for this bill. I do note that the reason that we are here, the reason this was under a rule in part was to allow the gentleman to present an amendment, which I guess is going to be coming next. 
   In terms of safeguards, the appropriations process provides that on an annual basis in terms of looking at the program and deciding what kind of support ought to be given to it. The permanent authorization is about making a statement, making a statement to the citizen partners that we are asking to step up and be part of this effort to preserve the Chesapeake Bay. 
   The way we are going to save the bay, the way we are going to enhance its health over time is not by turning it over to experts, but by taking ownership at the community level, having every citizen understand what they can do in their own backyard, working with nonprofit groups, working with museums, with wildlife refuges, with historic sites, et cetera, to stake a claim in the future of the bay. And that is what the Chesapeake Bay Gateways program is all about; it is a gateway to this national treasure, 156 sites, 1,500 miles of water trails, and a tremendous investment on the part of ordinary citizens in the future of this national treasure. That is why we sought a permanent authorization. That is why we continue to seek it. That is at the heart of H.R. 5540, and I urge my colleagues to support it when it comes to the vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman indicated some anxiety that the program would languish if it was permanently authorized. And I can assure him that this is one program that will not languish, because it has so stimulated the interest and the engagement of so many citizens and volunteer groups across the six States and the District of Columbia that make up the Chesapeake Bay watershed. And that is the point. That is the point of permanently authorizing it, because the citizenry has stepped up and they have shown that they are ready to work in partnership with their national government, and it is time for the national government to make an equally powerful statement to the citizenry that, when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay, we are going to be here as a steadfast ongoing supporter of that partnership. 
   Gateways has a proven track record. Initially authorized in 1998 and reauthorized in 2002, the Park Service conducted a special resource study on the program in 2004, and it concluded that Gateways should be made permanent and expanded. That is because the program is tested and proven. Park Service has already made the Gateways network a permanent unit of the Park System. Again, another reason it certainly will not languish, and a reason why the kind of oversight that the gentleman from Utah is concerned about will be there in terms of the agency's responsibility. 
   The appropriations process, which he dismissed as a significant way of overseeing the program and providing scrutiny to it, is there on an annual basis and can certainly serve that purpose. 
   So it is the essence of this bill in fact that we permanently authorize it, because we want to make the statement to those volunteers and citizens who stepped into this tremendous partnership to preserve the Chesapeake Bay that we understand the commitment they have made, and we are prepared to make an equal commitment from our side. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I am new to Congress, but I have already sat through a number of hearings in the  Natural Resources Committee where we scrutinize the appropriations requests and presentation of various agencies that are under our jurisdiction. So I have high confidence that the congressional oversight that is needed for this kind of program will be there through the annual appropriation process. 
   And I say again that this is about making a statement to all of those citizens who stepped forward and have supported the Gateways program, that are there to back these sites, to preserve our environment and the Chesapeake Bay, its heritage, its cultural legacy. And if we vote today as I hope we will, to permanently authorize this program, we will be saying to all of those citizen stewards that we are thankful for the commitment that they are making, and that their national government is ready to step up and make an equal commitment to protecting and preserving the Chesapeake Bay. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, this is an odd motion as you read it and one that I don't think takes full account of how aware people are of the effect of gas prices, which is the issue that the other side has talked about all day. It says that there will be education of the public regarding the effect of high fuel prices. I think the public is fully able to educate itself with respect to that impact. 
   This is a distraction. It doesn't really connect to the underlying bill. It was not offered in committee. It was not offered as part of the rules process. But more importantly than that, this is styled, as was just indicated, as a ``promptly'' motion and, therefore, effectively would kill the bill. And I can't imagine why anybody would want to kill this bill. 
   What this is designed to do is to recognize the incredible commitment that has been made by ordinary citizens on behalf of the Chesapeake Bay. It would reauthorize on a permanent basis the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Program and Watertrails Network, which was first enacted in 1998. This is a successful, efficient and effective program. The White House Conference called it ``a cooperative conservation success story.'' 
   It includes 156 sites across six States and the District of Columbia, parks, wildlife refuges, museums, historic sites, watertrails, and most importantly, it reaches out to volunteer groups that have stepped forward to take stewardship of the Chesapeake Bay, millions of visitors from around the country and around the world every year. 
   It's an efficient and effective program, and this reauthorization makes an important statement. And that's why I object to the motion because the ``promptly'' nature of it would effectively kill this bill, and we need to make a statement now to those citizens that have stepped forward, that just as they have made an important and steadfast commitment to the health of the Chesapeake Bay, so their national government will make a similar commitment to the Chesapeake Bay and the watershed by stepping forward and permanently authorizing this outstanding program. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, once again, we have a vivid, vivid example of this President's misplaced priorities. Earlier this month, the President vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program, which would have extended private health insurance coverage to 10 million children in this country at a reasonable investment of $35 billion over a 5-year period. It costs too much, the President said. We can't afford it. Yet, last week the President requested additional funding for this misadventure in Iraq to the tune of $189 billion. We can't find money for children and health care in this country, but we can find, apparently, endless supplies of dollars to fund the war in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, this President on this issue and on many other issues is gravely out of touch with the American people.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to one of my constituents, Shalonda Fredderick, whose recent correspondence with my office reflects the struggle that's facing many Americans across my district and throughout the country. 
   Shalonda writes, ``I'm sorry to disturb you. I don't know where else to turn. I'm 32 years old. I live with MS. I just started to receive SSDI of $1,251 a month. I have applied for housing assistance. As of August 8, my rent will be $860, plus we'll be paying $30 for water, $15 a month for BGE, plus I'm paying $185 for school loans. That's my entire check. 
   I've tried to find help, but all I hear is that I'm too young or not disabled enough. I don't think I deserve anything more than the average person, but I know unless I find help in six weeks when my lease ends, me and my dog will be homeless.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we've been working with Shalonda to try to help her address these immediate problems, but what she needs are pragmatic policies to ensure that people like her never reach such a perilous point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the people's House to give voice to the pain and courage of Rebecca Showers, one of my constituents. I do so, believing that we must take every opportunity in this Chamber to tell the stories of the American people. 
   With Rebecca's permission, I would like to read part of a letter she sent to me earlier this month. Rebecca's husband had every expectation of completing his service in the Army after two tours in Iraq. But recently he received word that he now faces a third deployment, this one for 15 months. 
   Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Showers writes this: ``I don't want him to miss a year and a half of our lives. Our son is 2, and he will miss the most important times in his life, the forming of sentences, learning new words, learning the alphabet, even two of his birthdays, which, by the way, he already missed him turning 2 on October 17. 
   ``He will also miss two Christmases and two Thanksgivings. Just to let you know, in the last 6 years he has only been home twice for Christmas, and not once for Thanksgiving. I'm sure you hear this a lot from other Army spouses, but I just want my husband to be home with his family, where he belongs. I would like to know what the government is willing to do about getting our guys home sooner, or at least if they are willing to send them over for shorter tours. A year and a half is just too long, and I am not sure they understand that. 
   ``Is there anything you can do for me and my son or know anything else that maybe I could do? Please help me, Mr. Sarbanes. He shouldn't have to go for so long. It's tearing me apart.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether it's possible to accelerate this young man's return, but I have contacted the Department of the Army, asking for its consideration based on these circumstances. In the meantime, my colleague, Ellen Tauscher, has introduced  legislation to require that between these extended tours, our troops would at the very least receive the same amount of time home with their family that they have spent deployed in Iraq. 
   I again salute Rebecca Showers's courage and her husband's service to our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Jewish American Heritage Month to recognize the contributions the Jewish people have made to our country. 
   I have come to understand that to the Jewish people, the word ``heritage'' has deep meaning. It is not simply a sense of pride or history. It is a belief that each person should in some way improve the world. The often quoted Rabbi Hillel asked the question, ``If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, who am I?'' 
   It is this same set of values that brings Jewish groups to the Hill advocating not just for so-called Jewish issues, but for issues that affect everyone; better education, better healthcare, more protections for the environment, free speech, and separation of church and state. The Jewish community feels a special obligation to repair the world, one little piece at a time, for all people, not just their own. 
   I am grateful to the organizations in my own district for their contributions to our community. From providing educational and social services, to involvement in local and national policy,  the commitment to improving our society is one of the many values I have come to respect in the Jewish community in Baltimore and across this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (33RD ANNIVERSARY OF INVASION OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 33rd year since the invasion and subsequent occupation of the Island of Cyprus. 
   Since 1974, Turkish military forces have illegally occupied the northern part of the island, forcibly dividing communities, and depriving a nation of its cultural heritage and peaceful existence. 
   The Turkish invasion of Cyprus physically separated the Greek Cypriot community and Turkish Cypriot community along ethnic lines for the first time in the island nation's history. The unlawful occupation of 37 percent of the territory of Cyprus continues unabated to this day. There are currently 43,000 Turkish troops garrisoned in the occupied areas, and Turkey has resettled nearly 100,000 mainland Turkish citizens into those areas. 
   The continued Turkish occupation of Cyprus stops the Greek and Cypriot communities from building national institutions, from building intercommunal trust, and from promoting the diversity and uniqueness of a truly Cypriot culture. In short, because of Turkey's continued occupation and division of the island nation, the people of Cyprus are prohibited from reclaiming a true Cypriot national identity. 
   Furthermore, thousands of Cypriots continue to be refugees in their own land, blocked from the homes and the communities they inhabited for generations. Some have been marooned in tiny enclaves, trapped by the occupation forces, cut off from the outside world and basic human rights. A new generation of Cypriots has inherited the terrible dislocation that military occupation brings. 
   In the face of all this, the Greek Cypriot inhabitants of the Republic of Cyprus have struggled and succeeded in building a strong society, one whose economic progress, development of democratic institutions and capable governance has led to membership in the European Union in May 2004. Sadly, until there is an end to the occupation, the reunification of the island under a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation will be impossible, and the occupied areas of Cyprus will be denied the full benefits of EU membership. 
   For the United States, there is a clear imperative to resolve the situation in Cyprus as a matter of justice and the rule of law, principles we hold dear. But beyond that, achieving reunification of the island is critical to the strategic interests of the United States. 
   The Cyprus problem pits American allies against one another. The strategic interest in facilitating a negotiated settlement is significant for the region, but also for the world. Cyprus can either fester as a potential flashpoint, or become a starting point for reconciliation. 
   Today, we have a new opportunity. The opportunity for reconciliation is real. Since Cyprus' entry into the EU, the borders between the occupied areas have been partially opened, and there have been more than 12 million crossings of Greek and Turkish Cypriots without serious incident. Turkish Cypriots cross into the Republic of Cyprus every day to go to work. Approximately 35,000 Turkish Cypriots have applied for and received passports from the Republic of Cyprus. 
   The people of the island want reunification to occur. The Turkish government now must demonstrate a legitimate will to participate with good faith in U.S. and U.N. mediated efforts to resolve this conflict. Perpetuating the status quo hurts not only Greek and Turkish Cypriots, but the nation of Turkey and its relation to the United States and to the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have in place, brokered by the U.N., a workable framework for reunification. The so-called ``July 8 Agreement'' reached in 2006 calls for an immediate initiation of comprehensive negotiations on two different levels; one that addresses everyday issues to build confidence and momentum, and the other addressing more serious disputes over territorial and power-sharing arrangements in the prospective federal state. 
   This agreement is a real way forward to the reunification of Cyprus within a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. But a year has passed, and the process as laid out by the U.N. has yet to be meaningfully engaged by the Turkish representatives. It should not stall any longer. 
   As my colleague, Mr. Bilirakis, has urged through legislation introduced earlier this year, the United States can and should play a powerful role in moving forward and pushing for immediate implementation of these U.N.-backed negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1051, which celebrates James Madison University's 100 years of service and leadership. Founded in 1908, the State Normal and Industrial School for Women eventually became what is now known as James Madison University. Beginning with only 150 students and 15 faculty members, the small school has grown into a prestigious university. 
   Today, James Madison enrolls over 17,000 students and offers a wide range of courses. With 68 undergraduate majors, 40 graduate and certificate degrees and six doctoral programs, JMU boasts a strong academic program. By coupling this strong educational base with student support, the university is able to graduate 81 percent of its students. According to the United States Department of Education, JMU is ranked 16th nationally for its graduate rate and is first among all schools in the South. 
   Much has changed in James Madison University's 100 year history, but some of the core principles have remained consistent. The university still strives to empower its students to make a difference and use their education to positively impact the world around them. In fact, JMU ranks 14th on the Peace Corps list of top volunteer producing universities and the ONE campaign listed the school among their top 100 most active schools in the Nation. 
   This year, James Madison University grew its impact with the graduation of its 100,000th student. As the university community celebrates this accomplishment, JMU will take a moment to reflect on a century of achievement. The university will also take a look ahead to the next 100 years of inquiry, learning and discovery. 
   Madam Speaker, once again I express my support for James Madison University, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I don't know what James Madison would have thought specifically about the issue raised, but I know he had an abiding confidence in the ingenuity of the American people, as did all of our Founding Fathers and I think every President since. And we have been held back from the kinds of investments and partnerships that the American people could join with that ingenuity to move us forward, we have been held back by a lack of investment and emphasis on that kind of investment from the current administration. So I look forward to a time when we can join in partnership with the American people and take advantage of that ingenuity that James Madison and so many others recognized from the earliest days. 
   What an accomplishment for any university to just be there for 100 years. The fact that James Madison University has reached this milestone with such a terrific list of accomplishments is truly deserving of the recognition that we seek to bestow upon the university today, and I urge my colleagues to support H.

   Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1242, which honors the life and recognizes the importance of Louis Jordan and his contributions to America as a musician, composer and entertainer. 
   July 8, 2008 will be Louis Jordan's 100th birthday, the celebration of his 100th birthday. And in celebration of this day, we should recognize Jordan's contributions to this country. 
   Louis Jordan, born in 1908, is a Brinkley, Arkansas native. Under the musical tutelage of his father, who was a local band leader, music found Jordan at an early age. He expanded and mastered formal components of music through his collegial experience at Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock. Jordan majored there in music. He learned to play the saxophone, sing, and entertain audiences through his personal experiences and watching his father. 
   Highly touted musicians, such as B.B. King, Ray Charles, James Brown, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Sonny Rollins, all pointed to Jordan as an influence on their own careers. His prolific musical success consists of 54 hit singles and 18 number one songs on Billboard's R&B charts. Two short musical films were centered around his songs. 
   Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, Jordan's contribution to his art is immeasurable. Rolling Stone Magazine named him one of the 100 greatest artists of all time. 
   Though Jordan passed away in 1975, his legacy flourishes through the work of other artists. He helped shape rock and roll. On this day, I would like to commemorate Jordan's work. Let us recognize his contribution by honoring his 100th birthday. 
   I urge support of this resolution.

   Today, as we recognize our valedictorians, we reaffirm our commitment to education and encourage our youth to discover the many learning opportunities they will encounter throughout their lives. I hope that by saluting these valedictorians we help make high achievement infectious and help every student appreciate the countless opportunities that await them beyond high school. 
   Valedictorians are not only the highest academically ranked students in their class; they are also peer role models who represent the ideals of their families and communities. They inspire fellow classmates to become involved in improving the community and motivate their peers to achieve academically. 
   Long after high school, the title of valedictorian is still upheld as a significant accomplishment. By recognizing the accomplishments of this year's high school valedictorians, I hope to support and promote inquiry and learning across our Nation. I know that this year's valedictorians, and all graduating seniors at our Nation's high schools, are our future leaders. We owe it to these students to give them the best education we can and celebrate high school graduation as an important step toward achieving their goals.

And they're the ones, I think, that are going to join with enlightened policy makers across the country to make sure that we liberate ourselves from that dependence on fossil fuels and we move forward and explore alternatives to that, which is really going to be the solution to our energy crisis over time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1050, which recognizes Pittsfield, Massachusetts, as the birthplace of our Nation's great sport: baseball. This great sport is interlaced into American culture, history, and tradition. Baseball is our Nation's national pastime, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, helped create the American sporting culture. Legendary players such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Cy Young, Hank Aaron, Cal Ripken, and other Hall of Fame players raised the level of play and integrity of the game. 
   The first recorded mention of baseball in known history occurred when a Pittsfield bylaw passed on September 5, 1791, banned the playing with bats and balls near the town's newly constructed meetinghouse. This ordinance is the first known reference to the game in U.S. history. 
   Other notable historic moments took place in Pittsfield. The very first collegiate baseball game in the United States took place there on July 1, 1859, between Amherst College and Williams College. Ulysses F. Grant, the most prominent 19th century African American player, was born in Pittsfield. Wahconah Park, a famous ballpark and grandstand built in 1892, is located there. The Boston Red Sox won their first game in that park. Lou Gehrig made his professional debut with the Hartford Senators there where he hit a home run into the Housatonic River. With every great baseball moment, Pittsfield is a part of the significance. 
   The first home plate project will erect a bat, ball, and glove statues in Pittsfield. These monuments symbolize great virtues, innocence, purity, and parallels to American culture. Let Congress at this time recognize and honor the contribution Pittsfield plays in our Nation's history. 
   I would like to recognize Pittsfield, Massachusetts' role in our Nation's history, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Obviously, we have got to do more of that going forward so that we can conserve. That can help drive down some of the gas prices that have been alluded to.

   Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 2, which recognizes the contributions of individuals from Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands to the United States. Many individuals from these territories have added and continue to add tremendous cultural, political, and athletic contributions to America. 
   Some examples of these remarkable individuals include Roberto Clemente, David Hamilton Jackson, and Agueda Iglesias Johnston. Roberto Clemente, a native of Puerto Rico, was a legendary major league baseball player with the Pittsburgh Pirates and an altruistic global public servant. I will say as an aside that Roberto Clemente put the Baltimore Orioles in fits during the World Series when I was growing up, and I have a vivid memory of that. While displaying extraordinary athletic feats on the baseball diamond, his selfless nature, not his play, cast him as an national icon and an exemplary role model. Unfortunately, Roberto Clemente died in a plane crash as he was trying to deliver aid to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. 
   David Hamilton Jackson is another outstanding individual to recognize. Jackson spearheaded the transfer of the United States Virgin Islands territory from the Danish into the hands of the local residents. Jackson, born in the Virgin Islands, parlayed his power into making local Virgin Island residents also United States residents. Jackson served as an educator, legislator, labor leader, and lawyer, and is known as one of the most important figures from the West Indies. 
   Agueda Iglesias Johnston was Guam's leading educator and well-known patriot. After Japan invaded the island in 1942, she both served as a teacher and principal during dangerous times in Guam. Amidst the perilous state, Johnston showed bravery when many feared. She communicated over  the radio about the progress of the war, and she also aided an American Navy soldier, George Tweed, to escape capture by the Japanese. In Guam, she is known for her outstanding commitment, bravery, and service. 
   Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have many, many historical figures, events, and pivotal historic moments that highlight the legacy of their respective homelands. Children in the United States should understand and appreciate the contributions of citizens from the territories of the U.S. Ensuring America's youth know the contributions of these great territories and their impact on American culture creates a better understanding of our Nation's history. 
   Madam Speaker, once again, I express my support for recognizing the important contributions of individuals from these territories of the United States.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I know it is incredibly difficult for the minority to resist the impulse to lob this energy rhetoric into every single discussion we have here on the floor. I am not going to take the bait, particularly on this resolution because this is such an important resolution that has been put forward. It encourages and it guides us on how we can teach this valuable, valuable history of the U.S. territories to all Americans so that they can gain a deeper appreciation of it. I want to thank those who spoke today, Congresswoman Bordallo and Congresswoman Christensen, for contributing their perspective on this important bill, and I want to urge my colleagues to support it unanimously if they could.  
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. Madam Speaker, I am tremendously proud to be a co-sponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 2, which expresses the sense of this Congress that schools in the United States should honor the contributions of individuals from the U.S. territories by including such contributions in the teaching of American history. This Resolution will encourage schools to teach--and students to learn--about the rich history and vibrant cultures of the U.S. territories and the many achievements of individuals born there. I want to commend Congresswoman Christensen for introducing H. Con. Res 2. 
   In the case of Puerto Rico, the impact that our native sons and daughters have had on every aspect of American society cannot be overstated. Can you imagine preparing a history of Major League baseball without devoting at least a chapter to Roberto Clemente and the hundreds of Puerto Rican players who have followed in his wake? Likewise, consider how much the film industry owes to great actors like Jose Ferrer, Raul Julia and Benicio del Toro--to name just a few. Beyond athletics and the arts, many Puerto Ricans have made important contributions in the fields of politics, business and law. With respect to national service, students and teachers may not be aware--but should be--that residents of Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories serve in the U.S. military. They ought to know that Puerto Rico sends a higher percentage of its residents to the armed forces that all but one other U.S. jurisdiction and that four Puerto Ricans have won the Medal of Honor. H. Con. Res 2 will help ensure that students in our Nation's schools learn basic but largely unknown facts about the U.S. territories--how they were acquired, what political and civil rights residents of the territories have and do not have when compared to their fellow citizens in the states, and the prospects for change. 
   Unsurprisingly, there are still many people in our great Nation--children and adults--who do not know the names of the U.S. territories or their location on a map. It is my hope that, by teaching students about the history of the territories and the individual accomplishments of their residents, we can foster better understanding of and greater appreciation for the many contributions that the territories have made to American life.  
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF BLACK MUSIC MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 372, which supports the goals of Black Music Month. This is an appropriate time to honor the outstanding contributions African American singers and musicians have made to the United States. The Nation benefits culturally and economically from the experience of black musicians. Today, I stand to honor the influence of African American musical artists. 
   African American music has strong ties to African heritage. The complex rhythm, melodic harmony, and active call-and-response nature of African American music are products of deep African traditions. Many Negro spirituals performed and written by African Americans not only commemorated the African Diaspora but helped to create social change. 
   In April of 1960, in Monteagle, Tennessee, a 16-year-old girl named Jamila Jones stood in a crowd of nonviolent segregation protestors and began singing, ``We Shall Overcome'' to a group of armed and hostile deputies. That night, the deputies withdrew and let the students sing. ``We Shall Overcome'' is a Negro spiritual taken from Reverend Charles Tindley's, ``I'll Overcome Some Day.'' Other songs, such as, ``Swing Low Sweet Chariot,'' ``There is a Balm in Gilead,'' and ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' are all prominent African American ballads that were instrumental in the Civil Rights movement. 
   Other genres of music are rooted in the black experience as well. The origins of gospel, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rap are all closely linked to African American culture. These genres have enormous impact on our Nation at large. 
   President Carter acknowledged the influence and contribution of black music when he first declared June as, ``Black Music Month,'' in 1979. Black musicians inspire people across generations and around the world with their creativity, vision, and ability to speak to the human experience. The long history of African American music has helped shape our Nation and musical heritage. 
   There are millions of African American music fans of different races and ages all across our Nation. I support this bill and I honor the goals and ideals of Black Music Month, along with the many contributions of black musicians to the American people. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 986) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes, as amended. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 986 would designate 25.3 miles of the Eightmile River and its tributaries in Connecticut as a national scenic river. The bill was introduced by my friend and freshman class colleague, Representative Joe Courtney, who has been a strong and effective advocate of this designation. 
   This legislation would protect portions of the Eightmile River that have been found to have ``outstandingly remarkable'' values, including an intact watershed with a natural flow, very high water quality, unusual geological features, and large numbers of rare plants and animals. 
   The bill would designate five segments of the river and its tributaries as scenic under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The designated segments would be managed according to a plan produced pursuant to the 2001 Eightmile River Wild and Scenic River Study Act. 
   The administration supports the bill, as we were told by a National Park Service witness at a hearing before the National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee on April 17. In a draft study, the agency found these portions of the river and its tributaries to be eligible and suitable for designation. 
   The bill is cosponsored by the entire Connecticut House delegation. Both Connecticut Senators support the designation, as does the Republican Governor of Connecticut. The bill also enjoys ample support from the local community, including the local governments of the towns of Salem, East Haddam and Lyme. 
   The river would be managed under a partnership agreement as envisioned in section 10(e) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has found that the bill contains no unfunded mandates, and will impose no  cost on State, local or tribal governments. CBO also says the bill will not affect direct spending, and will not significantly affect the National Park Service's costs.     
   During committee consideration of the bill, there had been expressed some concern about the private property protections in the bill. To ensure that the bill is absolutely clear on this point, my subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) offered, and the committee adopted, language that expressly deems the zoning ordinances adopted by the towns of Salem, East Haddam, and Lyme to satisfy section 6(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and limits the Secretary's acquisition authority to lands that are donated or bought from willing sellers. That provision tracks the language used in several wild and scenic river designations in the east, including the designation of Connecticut's other wild and scenic river, the Farmington River. The language has been in effect for over a decade without questions or ambiguity on those rivers or in court. According to the National Park Service, the administering agency, that language is absolutely unambiguous. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. And I want to commend my colleague from Connecticut, Representative Courtney, for his commitment and leadership on this matter. We support passage of H.R. 986, as amended, and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the purpose of H.R. 1337, introduced by our colleague, Congressman TOM COLE of Oklahoma, is to direct the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on alternatives to augment the water supplies of the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District and cities served by the district. 
   The Norman Project was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation for municipal and industrial water supply, flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife purposes in central Oklahoma. Population growth in the area is increasing pressure on already constrained water supplies, and the demand for water is expected to surpass the supply that the Norman Project in its present form can provide. 
   A preliminary report on alternative measures to augment water supplies at Lake Thunderbird has already been completed. The report concluded that a need exists to improve municipal and industrial water supplies from the Norman Project and that a number of alternatives are available to meet that need. A feasibility study is required to fully evaluate all the alternatives. H.R. 1337 directs the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct such a study.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the sites associated with the life of Cesar Estrada Chavez and the farm labor movement. 
   Representative HILDA SOLIS, my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, has worked tirelessly for the last 6 years to move this important legislation forward. I am proud to join Representative Solis and 68 other Representatives as a cosponsor of this bill, and I want to thank Ms. Solis for her efforts and leadership in getting this important study authorized. 
   In 1962, Cesar Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farm Workers of America, working to protect farm workers' rights. Chavez led the United Farm Workers for 31 years and gained increases in wages and better working conditions for farm laborers. Through his work, Chavez became a national leader on civil rights and social justice and an inspiration to millions of Americans and people around the world. 
   H.R. 359 directs the Secretary of the Interior to consider sites in Arizona, California, and other States that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement in the western United States. The bill requires the Secretary to determine the appropriate methods for preserving and  interpreting the sites and to determine whether any of them meet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic Places or possible designation as national historic landmarks. The Secretary has 3 years from the date on which funds are made available to submit a report describing the findings of the study as well as the Secretary's recommendations. 
   The Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands held a hearing on this bill in March of this year where we heard testimony from the administration in support of this bill. Later, at both a subcommittee markup and a full committee markup, this legislation advanced with bipartisan support. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359 is a bill whose time has come. Similar legislation has passed the Senate once before in 2003, and I am pleased this bill is finally making it to the House floor. We need to move forward with this congressionally authorized study so that we can learn about and evaluate options to protect the resources associated with Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement. The longer we wait, the more likely it is that these resources may be lost to development or the ravages of time. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 483 was introduced by our colleague from Texas, Representative CIRO RODRIGUEZ. And I know that Representative Rodriguez wanted to be here today in the Chamber as we speak to this legislation but has been caught in the storms outside. 
   H. Res. 483 recognizes the 63rd anniversary of Big Bend National Park in west Texas and honors the National Park Service for their service to the Big Bend region and Big Bend National Park. 
   I want to commend Representative Rodriguez for his efforts to bring congressional recognition to this special place and to the agency and hardworking employees who care for it. 
   Big Bend National Park is a spectacular 800,000-acre scenic treasure on the Rio Grande in west Texas. The park protects the largest representative example of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem within the United States. The park's river, desert and mountain environments support an extraordinary richness of biologic diversity, including unique plants and animals that exist nowhere else in the world. The park provides outstanding recreation opportunities to over 300,000 visitors a year. 
   Big Bend is not only nationally significant but also internationally significant. Big Bend National Park manages nearly one-quarter of the approximately 1,000-mile stretch of the Rio Grande River that also serves as the boundary between the United States and Mexico. 
   Together with two Mexican protected areas, Big Bend is now part of the largest transboundary protected areas in North America, serving as a model for international cooperation. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 483 recognizes the importance of Big Bend National Park to the ecology, history and economy of west Texas. It also recognizes the hard work of the National Park Service and its employees and honors their service to the region and the country as a whole. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

This bill would put into place a coordinated public-private approach to sediment and nutrient monitoring in the Upper Mississippi River Basin as part of an effort to improve water quality. 
   The Upper Mississippi River is extremely important not only to the communities and States along the route it flows, but also to the Nation as a whole. Twenty-one years ago, Congress designated this river segment as both a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant navigation system. It is the only inland river in the United States to have such a designation. Our colleague, Ron Kind, has worked hard to secure enactment of this legislation. I commend him for his diligent effort on this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge an historic victory that occurred over last weekend, when the United States Naval Academy football team, for the first time in 43 years, upset the University of Notre Dame. 
   As we recognize the accomplishments of this Midshipmen football team, we also recognize the commitment that each middie has made to our country. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Midshipmen for their historic victory over the Fighting Irish. 
   It is in this spirit that I submit further remarks for inclusion in the Congressional Record as well as an editorial from the Baltimore Sun recognizing the extraordinary accomplishment of these young men. 
   And also for the record, I would like to say, Go Navy. Beat Army.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the United States Naval Academy Football Team for Saturday's thrilling victory over the University of Notre Dame. 
   The Midshipmen defeated the Fighting Irish 46-44 in triple-overtime, marking the first Navy victory in the annual match-up since 1963. 
   A tradition since 1927, the Navy-Notre Dame series is the longest uninterrupted intersectional series in Division I college football. This year's installment of this great football rivalry was, for the first time, tied at the end of regulation and featured 90 combined points, the most ever in the 80-year-old series. 
   The Midshipmen victory in the third overtime snapped Notre Dame's 43-year win streak in harrowing fashion. Navy made what appeared to be its last stand against the Fighting Irish Offense, stopping a Notre Dame attempt at a two-point conversion to tie the game. A controversial pass interference call allowed Notre Dame one more chance to force a fourth overtime. It looked as though the streak was destined to continue. 
   But the Midshipmen again held their ground and defeated Notre Dame. On this Saturday, the disadvantages that a service academy team has to overcome relative to its ``Big Name'' Division I competition did not matter. The Naval Academy does not have an exclusive television contract. Its recruiters cannot promise top-tier high school seniors access to a network of NFL scouts and alumni. 
   When the United States Naval Academy beat the University of Notre Dame, a team of  young men celebrated an athletic victory that had escaped two generations of Midshipmen--two generations of Academy graduates who led our Navy and our country through the Cold War and into the twenty-first century. 
   As we recognize the accomplishment of this Midshipmen Football team, we also recognize the commitment that each Middie has made to our country.

It starts at 5 or 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning, when millions of senior citizens in this country begin their day by taking prescription drug medicine. That should be an experience that makes them feel like someone is looking out for them. Instead, the current part D program has left our seniors feeling anxious and confused. What they cannot understand, Madam Speaker, what no one can understand, because there is no rational explanation for it, is why the Medicare program has been prohibited from negotiating for lower drug prices. Of course there is an explanation: a deal was struck to benefit the insurance and pharmaceutical industries at the expense of our seniors. 
   Madam Speaker, the legislation before us today will repeal this prohibition and empower the Secretary to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. 
   H.R. 4 makes common sense, and it does right by our seniors. I look forward to bipartisan passage of this important legislation.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Chairman, I rise today to commend Chairman Miller, Chairwoman McCarthy, Ranking Member McKeon, and others for putting together a very strong reauthorization of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.     
   It supports the Nation's priorities in a number of important areas. In particular, I'd like to thank the committee's leadership for recognizing the critical role that veterans and older Americans can play in solving problems and strengthening communities, by recommending several new provisions. 
   Our veterans are simply the best of what this country has to offer, both with respect to their exemplary character and the technical, professional, and administrative expertise which they acquire during their years of service. They are an invaluable and untapped resource to underserved communities. America should embrace the opportunity to establish a well-defined veterans-centered and -integrated community support system based on national and community service. The GIVE Act begins a national conversation on how to make this happen. 
   Every day nearly 8,000 of the Nation's 78 million baby boomers turn 60. We know from research that the vast majority plan to work or stay engaged in their community well past traditional retirement age. This is a wonderful opportunity, given their stated interest in helping others and the ever-worsening labor shortage in education, health care, government, and nonprofit work. 
   I'm a strong supporter of the idea that those who have finished their mid-life careers can be a force for social good in the 21st century. By turning the aging of America into a positive story, we can tap into this energy. It is going to take creativity, experimentation, bold action, and looking to the future more than the past. Congress has a critical responsibility, along with the States and the private sector, to ensure baby boomers will have the opportunity to serve. 
   We talk about this wave of returning veterans, and we talk about the demographic wave of aging Americans. How you respond to a wave depends on how you position yourself. That wave can either come crashing down on us, or it can be a wave that lifts us up and moves us forward. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and this Congress to explore additional proposals to capture the energy, idealism, and talent of our veterans and millions of older Americans who want to make a major contribution to the public good.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, I rise as well to oppose this amendment, which really overlooks the incredible positive impact that a summer of service can have on our youth. 
   The Summer of Service is a program which fills a policy gap which helps communities create positive alternatives for young teens. The middle school years in particular are extremely pivotal years for young people. Most youth are making the difficult transition from middle school to high school, and many of them have no organized activities during those periods when they are out of school. Many are left unsupervised and at risk of being engaged in potentially harmful activity. We want to engage them. We want to make sure that they have something to do.  
   I was recently, Mr. Chairman, at a conference held in Baltimore that is focusing on what some refer to as the summer learning slide or summer learning lost. Basically, what do you do to engage students over those summer months to make sure that you are complementing the educational opportunities that they have during the regular school year? And the Summer of Service is a perfect opportunity to do that and to support them so that continuum, that trajectory is always upward. It is not a kind of roller coaster where you get two steps forward and you slip one step back. 
   How our youth spend their time during the summer period may determine whether they embark on a course of active citizenship and civic engagement and engaged learning or whether they go down a different path. This was a conclusion of a conference that the White House convened in 2000 to look at the issues that are facing teenagers. The Summer of Service initiative will offer youth the chance to spend a summer in service to their communities. I urge that we vote against the Flake amendment that would eliminate the Summer of Service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I rise today with pride to introduce legislation honoring Cal Ripken, Jr. on his induction into the Pro Baseball Hall of Fame. 
   My bill would rename as Cal Ripken Way Interstate 395 in Baltimore, which runs into the city and ends near Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
   Calvin Edwin Ripken, Jr. grew up in Aberdeen, Maryland. A baseball standout from an early age, he led his little league team to the Little League World Series and was a baseball star at Aberdeen High School. 
   As a professional, Cal spent his entire career with his hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles. Drafted out of high school, he rose through the minor leagues, joining the Orioles full time in 1982 when he was named Rookie of the Year. He then won American League Most Valuable Player honors and led the Orioles to their third World Series Championship in 1983. 
   From May 30, 1982, until September 19, 1998, Cal never missed a game. He played in an incredible 2,632 consecutive games, passing Lou Gehrig's record of 2,131 on September 6, 1995, in front of family, friends and fans at Camden Yards. 
   His career redefined the shortstop position, setting multiple offensive and defensive records, and paving the way for a new generation of players. 
   Cal's stellar career no doubt makes him worthy of induction into the Hall of Fame. In fact, he was elected to the Hall with the highest vote total ever, the highest vote percentage for any position player, and the third highest vote percentage in history. But the numbers don't even begin to explain what he means to our national pastime. 
   Baseball fans, and especially parents, are too often disappointed when our American idols fail to live up to our American ideals. Too often, our sports stars are famous for all the wrong reasons, but time and again Cal Ripken,  Jr. has been a source of pride for baseball. 
   Cal was a spectacular player, but not a flashy one. He played fundamental baseball, always doing the little things and setting the example for how a professional should perfect his trade, and he showed up every day. 
   From the heights of the World Series Championship in 1983 to the depths of the 21-game losing streak that began the 1988 season, Cal was there every day. After the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, many fans marked September 6, 1995, the night Ripken played in his 2,131st game, as the night that America came back to baseball. 
   Ripken's commitment to working hard and playing by the rules became known as ``the Ripken way.'' He inspired the people of Baltimore every season with his quiet and unassuming dedication to his work. In fact, I believe that Cal has inspired Americans all over the country. 
   ``The Ripken way'' is in many ways synonymous with ``the American way.'' When you ask people about American values, they often mention dependability, loyalty, humility, and old-fashioned hard work. Cal Ripken embodies these values. 
   Madam Speaker, I think Tony Kornheiser captured this well in a column that appeared in The Washington Post on September 7, 1995. He wrote, ``When I look at this record, I think I hear the rhythms of America. This celebration of Cal is the fanfare for the common man. Going to work every day, come hell or high water, building a career, providing for a family like our fathers did before us is something we can all relate to. I think America looks at Cal Ripken playing every game, playing them in the same small town where he grew up, putting his hand over his fluttering heart as the ovations pour over him like tidal waves and signing autographs afterward, and says to itself, here is a man I can respect, here is a man with values I admire. You don't often hear that about professional athletes anymore.'' 
   Madam Speaker, if we pass this legislation, when travelers come to visit Baltimore or pass by on their way to another destination, they will not only be reminded of a terrific ballplayer whose name has become synonymous with the Orioles, but also a model American and the promise of doing things ``The Ripken Way.'' 
   I hope my colleagues agree that this is a fitting tribute to one of the best loved and most enduring figures in the history of baseball. 
   Cal, congratulations on your induction into the Hall of Fame.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, the resolution we are debating today is simple and direct. It declares strong support for our troops on the ground in Iraq and opposition to the President's decision to send an additional 21,000 men and women into harm's way. I wholeheartedly endorse the resolution and pray that the President will heed its call.  
   Most agree now that it was a mistake to invade Iraq. Hearings in the Senate and the House are stripping away the last thin veneers of justification for that fateful decision. They are offering compelling evidence that the administration sacrificed wisdom, judgment, and conscience in favor of shock and awe. 
   Many of us sense a similar impulse at work in this administration's dealings with Iran. Let us serve notice, this Congress will not allow the administration to pursue yet another ill-fated mission. Madam Speaker, bringing our troops home from Iraq is no longer a whispered prayer; it is now the clarion call of the American people. 
   One year ago those proposing a new direction in Iraq were labeled as unpatriotic and marginalized in the national discourse. But we have come a long way. Elections do matter. On November 7, the people in my district in Maryland and across the Nation sent a strong message. 
   The next day Secretary Rumsfeld resigned. Shortly thereafter the Iraq Study Group issued its report sharply criticizing the war. And in the next few days the United States House of Representatives will pass this resolution signaling stiff opposition to the administration's proposal for a troop surge in Iraq. 
   To those patriotic Americans who have been relentless in their call for an end to the war, know this: collective voice has been heard. In my home State of Maryland, nearly 400 men and woman have died or been wounded in Iraq. 
   Two days ago, one of my constituents reminded me that the war is no longer being measured in time, but in lives. To the families who have sacrificed so much and who have suffered the ultimate loss, do not fear for a moment that a change in our policy in Iraq, that the effort to stop the escalation and begin drawing down our troops in any way dilutes the value this country places on the service of your loved ones. 
   History will treat harshly those policymakers at the highest levels who let ideology trump sound and informed judgment. It will fairly criticize politicians who have exploited this war for partisan gain. But it will reserve only pride and lasting gratitude for the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform amidst this sad tale of bungled intelligence and ill-advised policy. They alone are untarnished. 
   Madam Speaker, I have never been to the war. Never kissed my wife and children goodbye, wondering whether I will ever see them again. Far from the harsh reality in Iraq, I am blessed with the sweet ebb and flow of life's daily routines. 
   But like many Americans who witness our soldiers dutifully pushing forward every day under impossible circumstances, I am ill at ease. I know that the current policy in Iraq will only lead to more pain for many families and for our country. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are tired, they are tired of rhetoric, they are tired of promises to put politics and partisanship aside when all they see is bickering and recrimination. Let's give them hope. Let's send a powerful message contained in this resolution, but let's not stop there. 
   Let all of us, the President, the House, the Senate, have the decency and dignity of purpose to put differences aside and work every day, beginning this day, to bring our troops home to their families, to their communities, and to a Nation that stands humbled by their sacrifice

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (LIHEAP -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, in the wake of skyrocketing energy prices, I rise today to urge this Congress to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, as part of the economic stimulus legislation that's being considered. 
   Americans are feeling the pinch. Sixty percent of families are cutting spending as they struggle to pay for rising electric bills and gas prices. Let me speak directly about the situation of one Maryland family. 
   Mr. Delatore works part time as a counselor and gets partial disability because of complications from cerebral  palsy. He's had a tough time making ends meet, especially in the last year. Mr. Delatore is a LIHEAP recipient. He has expressed severe anxiety that he can barely afford to buy what he needs. Without energy assistance, he will be pushed over the edge. 
   Madam Speaker, many families are living close to the economic edge, and they rely on this LIHEAP support, this critical support, to make ends meet. We have to fully fund this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. SARBANES. (STAR-SPANGLED BANNER AND WAR OF 1812 BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I want to thank Chairman Davis for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1389, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act, which I had the privilege of introducing. This legislation would empower a commission to plan and coordinate what I believe is going to be one of the most spectacular and memorable commemorations in recent history in this country, and that is the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and the Francis Scott Key poem written during the British bombardment of  Fort McHenry, Maryland, which later became the Star-Spangled Banner, our national anthem. 
   The Park Service recommended the creation of such a commission in a 2004 study. Its membership would be drawn from citizens from historically significant States, from National Park Service officials, historical experts, and other individuals selected by congressional leadership. 
   Because we are fast approaching the bicentennial of the War of 1812, I am pleased the House has taken up this legislation. I hope that the Senate will do so as well and the measure can be signed into law in the near future. 
   Mr. Speaker, many refer to the War of 1812 as the ``second war of independence.'' When the war began, our fragile experiment in democracy was still in its early stages, and the Nation found itself under attack from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Many wondered whether a democracy could hold together through the trials of war. The War of 1812 proved that it could, and set the stage for the spread of democracy around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Chairman Davis for bringing this measure to the floor. I hope all of my colleagues will support the bill, which will help ensure a fitting celebration of the War of 1812 and the Star-Spangled Banner bicentennial.
