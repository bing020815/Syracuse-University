<DOCNO>Mr. FARR. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Thank you, Madam Chairman, for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support and with a congratulatory note to Chairwoman NITA LOWEY for her bold leadership on this bill, and also to the ranking member, FRANK WOLf. 
   I am particularly proud of the fact that the committee, for the first time in many, many years, fully funded the Peace Corps. As a returned Peace Corps volunteer, a volunteer that served in Colombia, I am also a strong supporter of that country and the programs we are doing there. I want to thank the committee for rebalancing the United States-Colombia policy in the Andean Initiative. 
   I believe Colombia is a country of enormous potential. But Colombia's full potential as a democratic nation is not being realized because of its coca production. The Colombia that I know and loved as a Peace Corps volunteer is often not seen through the debate of the coca problems. 
   Eighty percent of the U.S. assistance has been allocated on military assistance and aerial fumigation, yet 80 percent of rural Colombians still live below the poverty line. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the rural Colombians still live below the poverty line. 
   Tragically, after 7 years and $4 billion-plus in U.S. assistance, it is overwhelmingly apparent that we must change our course in this country. Imagine if 80 percent of rural Americans lived below the poverty line. There would be riots in the streets, and every farmer would be growing coca in their backyards to feed their families. 
   Folks, we need to wake up and smell the coffee, preferably Colombian coffee. It is the poverty in Colombia that breeds the problems. Coca is a symptom. 
   The bill realigns Colombia-U.S. assistance so that 45 percent is allocated to economic and alternative development, which enables campesinos to grow crops like coffee, tropical fruits and chocolate that command better market prices so they can feed their families. 
   Why does this matter to you? Because stemming Colombia coca production stops the flow of drugs to Main Street USA. 
   Yesterday in El Tiempo, a Colombian newspaper equivalent to the New York Times, in an editorial stated ``Alternative development should stop being a little sister charity case to the antidrug strategy, and a substantial part of the assistance should go to rural development.'' This committee does that, and I commend them. 
   I hope soon that the State Department will comply with U.S. policy and force contractors to reach benchmarks when they must transfer their counternarcotic programs to Colombians to run. 
   I must urge my colleagues to support the Foreign Operations bill. Help Colombia realize its potential to eliminate the root causes of the culture of poverty. Support these increased funds for economic and alternative development.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 76 honoring the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, IGY, and its past contributions to space research, and looking forward to future accomplishments. 
   I would like to recognize the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year and its past contributions to global observations and ocean research that led to the discovery of ocean ridges and creation of the Scientific Committees on Ocean Research and Antarctic Research. The memory of the success of the International Geophysical Year during the height of the Cold War should serve as inspiration in this age of global warming. The impacts of global warming will have impacts in all nations and addressing it and its repercussions including sea-level rise, increased number and strength of storms, and ocean acidification, will take a coordinated scientific effort, such as that generated by the International Geophysical Year, to monitor these changes, develop new technology to address them, and the ability to provide timely hurricane warnings.

<DOCNO>Mr. FARR. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGRESSIONAL CEMETERY -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleague, Mr. WALSH, for his efforts in bringing attention to a marvelous memorial and historical site at the other end of the Capitol venue. I speak of the Congressional Cemetery and the resolution we consider today, H. Res. 698, to commemorate the cemetery's 200th anniversary. 
   Many people think of cemeteries as dreary places. But I see them differently. Cemeteries are the great repositories of more than just the long dead. They are centers of civilization. 
   They teach us about our heroes. 
   They teach us about our faith. 
   They give us clues about our culture and architecture and art. 
   They are our history all wrapped up in one place. Places like this deserve to be preserved and appreciated. 
   The Congressional Cemetery was first established to accommodate the repose of our predecessors who met their end while in Washington. Back in those days refrigeration was not available and the deceased had to be dealt with quickly. Many members, so far from home, needed a resting place of some dignity. The Congressional Cemetery became that place. 
   The cemetery passed out of congressional control and unfortunately later fell into neglect and disarray. More recently a local effort by neighbors and community renewed interest in the history of the cemetery and that, I believe, is evidence of a reinvigorated dedication to what ultimately unites us all: our humanity, our mortality. 
   And what a wonderful thing that it can be manifested in such a magnificent surrounding! This cemetery has many famous residents, not the least of whom is John Phillip Sousa. I can think of no other artist who knew that to feel most alive, you need music. I am tickled to know that every year on Sousa's birthday there is a musical celebration at his gravesite honoring him and the very American music he gave to our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 698 and commend it to my colleagues with gusto. I hope each of you will take a walk down to the cemetery, visit our forbears and revel in the history of this site with quiet reflection. Take your time, too: there's 200 years of history to catch up on.

<DOCNO>Mr. FARR. (HONORING JACK VALENTI -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 361, recognizing and honoring the life of Jack Valenti and expressing the condolences of the House of Representatives to his family. 
   Jack Valenti was an American icon who holds a special place in the history of the United States. He was a principled leader, a fiery advocate, but always a gentleman. For over 40 years Jack dedicated himself to one of our country's most enduring and influential cultural exports, the motion picture. While most of the world knows Jack for his work at the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), many of us would be surprised to know that Jack was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, not Hollywood. 
   Prior to his life promoting and defending the motion picture industry, Jack piloted a B-25 bomber for the Army Air Forces during WWII, founded his own advertising company and worked for an oil firm in Texas. It was Jack's Texas roots that helped propel him into national politics following the assassination of President Kennedy. As a loyal political advisor to President Lyndon Johnson, Jack cemented his roots in Washington, DC. This city and this country have lost someone that practiced the art of advocacy and consensus that is rarely achieved and sorely missed. 
   My father, California Senator Fred Farr knew and worked with Jack when they both served in the Johnson Administration and I can say from personal knowledge that Jack was indeed a gentleman who would always offer a kind word, even to his greatest antagonists. The difficulty of Jack's job for the MPAA should not go overlooked, for uniting and assuaging the heads of major Hollywood studios would probably drive even the most savvy party leader batty. That ability to form consensus was only overshadowed by the eloquence in his usage of the English language. 
   Jack is survived by his wife of over 45 years Mary Margaret Valenti and their three children, John, Alexander and Courtenay; his sister, Lorraine Valenti Dinerstein; and two grandchildren. 
   As Jack's love of classical literature is well known, I find it fitting to quote Shakespeare in honor of a man that lived several lives in one lifetime: 
 All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.  
   I was pleased to call Jack Valenti a friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Capitol Hill Oceans Week. The President has declared June as Oceans Month, and this Friday will be an international celebration of Oceans Day. 
   Why do we need to pay attention to the oceans? Well, the oceans are dying, and the earth is dependent upon them. We are dumping everything we don't want into the ocean and extracting every living thing we can to eat. 
   We've created commissions by Congress and by private trust of the best talent in America to advise Congress on what we should do, and they recommended national ocean governance policies, new policies that can be adopted by this Congress. 
   I've introduced that bill, H.R. 21, and as National Oceans Week, Day and Month, I'd like to ask all my colleagues to seriously consider cosponsoring H.R. 21. It provides solutions to the problems of the earth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman. 
   First of all, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee. Many of you remember, last year I was down here haranguing the committee for dropping the ``O'' for oceans out of NOAA, and I want to thank the chairman for putting the ``O'' back into the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in this year's CJS appropriations bill, and I want to thank the gentleman for providing ample funding for the National Marine Sanctuary program as well. 
   It is the funds in the sanctuary program's construction account that I would like to ask the chairman about. 
   The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary would like to build a visitor's center in the city of Santa Cruz. This center will be the only one of its kind in the country. The site was chosen because it attracts people that do not regularly have access to the ocean. 
   It is my understanding that this project is one of NOAA's highest priorities, and they intend to grant the city of Santa Cruz $5 million from the construction account for the visitors center. 
   The question is, is it the intent of the committee to support the partnership between NOAA and the city of Santa Cruz by providing NOAA with the necessary funds so that they can grant the $5 million to the city of Santa Cruz for the construction of the visitors center? The money is included in the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I didn't come here to speak on this issue. I've certainly, I think like most Members of Congress, been following the sensation that television and others have made of this issue. But in the debate, I just wanted to share a couple of things that I've observed as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security and as Member of Congress who spent several days traveling all along the border with the Border Patrol. 
   It was very interesting because I ran into a lot of people that had been detained. I speak Spanish and was able to interview many of the people that were detained, and we don't really get into the day-to-day administration of the detention, release and so on. What was very interesting and kind of surprising to me, because this case has been argued in the media and certainly here on the floor, I was a little bit shocked by the last speaker who indicated that this is not a matter of facts. It is a matter of facts, and I think that we don't always deal with the facts. 
   I would point out that the drug dealer, the person that was shot in this case, was released. Did you know that the U.S. Attorney's office does not prosecute anybody who brings less than $5,000 worth of drugs across the border, less than $5,000? A lot of those marijuana packs that the smugglers carry are determined to be less than $5,000, and so nobody who is essentially  a mula is arrested, arrested but not detained. 
   We also, when we detain people, we give them the option, Do you understand you're now arrested? You have the right to a trial by jury as anybody in this country would have a right to unless you waive it. And 99.9 percent of everybody waives that and, therefore, gets released to their country of origin. 
   So this catch-and-release is not unusual. In fact, it's the norm, and the fact that this gentleman wasn't prosecuted for his drug record is of other facts. 
   What really struck me, and I'm just sharing, this is anecdotal information, but I think this amendment and the Congress bringing this up, in my opinion, is an abuse of power. Why? Because if, indeed, and I don't know the sentencing of these border patrolmen, but I know that there is a process if these sentences are extreme, you can appeal those. We have a sentencing commission, and the courts certainly review that. And so I think there is a remedy within our justice system to appeal where the sentences are too harsh. 
   But here's the thing that's most interesting to me. I didn't find one single member of the Border Patrol that supported these two people that had been arrested, who had been convicted by trial of law. So, on this floor, you're making them out as national heroes. They were convicted in a court of law in the United States for wrongdoing, and I think that, as the chairman has indicated, that it is not wise for the Congress to second-guess and make this a sensational case. 
   I've visited high school friends who were convicted of drug issues in prison, and I sympathize with everything that people say about these gentlemen, about their families and about the situation of being incarcerated. But I'm also concerned as a Member of Congress that we ought not to override the jurisprudence system that we've established in this country, and that I do think that the remedies in law lie in a court of law, and therefore, this amendment is not appropriate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 853 honoring those who have volunteered to assist in the cleanup of the November 7, 2007 oil spill in San Francisco Bay. 
   My district lies roughly 50 miles south of the area affected by the oil spill. Even though they were not directly affected by the spill, the institutions and people in my district offered their help and support to their northern neighbors. The Marine Wildlife Center at the Long Marine Lab in Santa Cruz treated birds injured by this spill, the NOAA Weather Service in Monterey played a pivotal role in providing wind and sea forecasts necessary to predict the spill's trajectory and assist in containment, and local organizations such as the Santa Cruz Surfrider Chapter organized volunteers to assist cleanup efforts in the San Francisco Bay. 
   I am proud of all of the people who unselfishly volunteered to assist the cleanup. Their unselfish response to this environmental disaster highlights just how important marine resources are to our communities. But, despite our best intentions ``business as usual'' is killing our oceans. We can no longer rely on the generosity of the citizens of this country to clean up the mess created by big business and poor governance. 
   When my constituents invest their valuable time to take care of the environment, I take notice. Actions speak louder than words, and with their actions in November, the people of the Central Coast are asking us to do more to ensure that we protect the environment while we conduct our business. If there is one thing that this oil spill shows, it is that if we don't make protecting the environment a higher priority, it will come back to haunt us ..... look at climate change.

<DOCNO>Mr. FARR. (FEDERAL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4174, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2007 authored by my friend and fellow co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus Representative ALLEN. 
   Since the industrial revolution, the human species has begun a dangerous experiment with our planet. Humans have become, according to Alan Weisman, a volcano that has been erupting continuously for 150 years. We have taken tons of carbon from the earth and put it up in the atmosphere. It is now clear that the increase in atmospheric CO  
   2 is causing drastic and rapid changes in ocean chemistry. 
   The ocean has no choice but to absorb the increase in CO  
   2, in fact, the ocean will continue to absorb CO 
   2 long after we reduce our output. Recent research from a study led by Dr. Feeley, a NOAA scientist, has found that ocean waters from the 1950s were much more acidic than expected. We do not know the outcome of our global experiment, but we know that it will change the chemistry of the ocean. 
   Many fisheries off of our coasts are already collapsing. We do not know how this increase in acidity will affect these collapsing populations or the fisheries that are currently healthy. An increase in ocean acidity will dissolve the shell of the endangered black abalone of the California coast. We know that corals, already under stress from the increased ocean temperature will have their skeleton dissolved by a more acidic ocean. 
   We must have more research to discover how this unprecedented change will affect shellfish, corals, and the food chain that fish, and mammals, including humans, that depend on the ocean. We must create collaboration between the federal agencies who manage and study the ocean to address this problem. This bill will provide funding for research and collaboration between researcH and management agencies necessary to address this serious problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough the need to show our ocean stewardship now, so we can turn the tide on the dire consequences facing our oceans and Great Lakes. The oceans and the Great Lakes belong to all the people of the United States and it is our duty to understand the implications of our actions on them. I strongly support the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act and I urge my colleagues to help understand and protect our shared ocean.

   Mr. FARR. I thank Chairman Rahall for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FLAME Act. I rise in support of the act with background experience of having been a seasonal firefighter for the U.S. Department of Forestry when I was a young college student. And I rise with the experience of being on the base and complex fire in Big Sur many times last week. 
   What I have learned from my experience throughout my life is that what we have done in responding to fires has been the best organizational structure in government. The whole incident command structure is now being used--it started in a California fire, and being used all over the United States and the rest of the world for how we should manage emergency incidents like fires; in fact, our whole structure within homeland security, which is essentially a lot of money that we spent to bring to one stop so that we can bring the resources necessary for prevention and response. 
   The one area, though, that has never been addressed has actually been in the area where we have to respond year after year after year, which is wildland fires. Last year, the U.S. Forest Service spent $1 billion on fires. And essentially that spending is an emergency process. And what happens at the end of the year is, when you want to say, okay, now it has stopped, the fire season, we have some time, let's go and do some prevention, let's do some control burns and do things like that, and we have no money to do it. And what this great bill does is it sets up a special fund that essentially recognizes that we need to have that emergency money there available to respond to emergencies. 
   And I would just like to say that in California we have really changed the nature of our whole State through our fire experiences. And we have changed the Department of Forestry in California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. I rise, supporting this resolution, with the backing of almost all the Members of Congress and certainly many co-authors that are on here. 
   This resolution commends the firefighters who are fighting. On this incredible map, you can just see what the extent of fires are in California. Having come off the fire in the Big Sur region that I represent, you can't help but have an incredible amount of pride for the ability to call to order firemen and women from all over the United States, and in this case, because we are so over strapped, we are now asking help from Mexico with both crews and equipment. We have had firefighters come down from Canada and, as I understand, CAL FIRE is negotiating now with New Zealand and Australia to even bring in more personnel. 
   These firefighters work nonstop. They are on 12 hours and then off 12 hours. But they have to work every day. They don't stop on weekends. They just keep going out of the camps and into the fire lines. As was pointed out by the Speaker just a moment ago, the tragedy for two of those workers, one a volunteer fireman from Anderson Valley Fire Department, Robert Roland, died on the fire line of heart failure. John Hermo, who is a firefighter, full-time professional firefighter from Oregon, came down to fight the California fires and got some time off after so many days on the fire, and during his rest, just not being on the fire line, drowned in the river there, in the Kern River. It's really a tragedy. Here, these families have sent off these young folks to help us to respond as first responders, as emergency responders. 
   So this resolution is a profound debt of gratitude to them. I know that those firefighters can't see this on their C-SPAN at home, but certainly the parents and relatives of all of those who have sent loved ones to these fires. 
   Fires have threatened 9,000 homes and businesses. There are still 223 wildland fires burning in California. More than 14,000 fires have already been contained because of the work of the firefighters. There are 18,000 personnel, firefighters on the lines right now, and there have been evacuation orders in Kern, Mendocino, Santa Barbara, Plumas, and in my county, and I'd like to personally thank our sheriff, Mike Kanalakis, for lifting the mandatory evacuation, which made people leave their homes in the rural area, many of whom felt that they were best suited to protect those homes. That evacuation order has been lifted and now the Big Sur Highway, Highway 1, is back in order for local personnel. 
   So our firefighters are working nonstop, and some for 4 weeks without rest. They are going to need rest. You can't stop the fire burnings. You're going to have to bring in more personnel. That's why we are reaching out to other countries. 
   So I want to thank those who I saw on the lines, the people I talked to, the communities that rallied around them. This is a heartfelt thanks from the Congress of the United States of America to the personnel in this country who respond on a basis to keep our cities and rural areas safe during wildfires. Thank you very much.

   Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in observance of a National Day of Silence, and in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 328. 
   This Friday marks the 12th National Day of Silence, a day in which students remain silent for a day to highlight the discrimination some of their peers endure when they speak out about their sexual orientation and their personal gender identity. 
   Though the United States has made great progress toward ensuring civil rights for all of its citizens, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals still face persecution, often violent, from teachers, school officials, and their classmates in our schools. 
   This year the National Day of Silence will be held in memory of Lawrence King, an 8th-grade student in California who was shot and killed by one of his classmates because of his sexual orientation. 
   Our country was founded on the ideal of equality for all, with the self-evident right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must always be mindful that our Nation's history is a chronicle of the blending of many formerly separate cultures and languages, ideas and lifestyles, into one American identity  that celebrates its diversity. I look forward to a day when we can all be tolerant.  
   The National Day of Silence recognizes that diversity is a cornerstone of American democracy--that all people are individuals and have a right to be treated with dignity and respect. 
   I look forward to a time where anti-GLBT harassment is no longer a problem in our schools. But until that happens, I am pleased to celebrate those students who recognize and appreciate the diversity of their classmates. I urge my colleagues to do the same and support H. Con. Res. 328.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership and vision on this issue. I would also like to thank the Foreign Affairs Committee staff for their meticulous work. We have a better bill on the floor for it. 
   This legislation is important because future stabilization operations are going to rely on a different set of skills, different than we currently have. We talk about stabilization and peace building, but how exactly do you do that? That is what this bill is about. 
   It is a bill that allows the Secretary of State, working with the Secretary of Defense, to essentially bring the core of people that have the talent, have the linguistic talent, the knowledge talent, the experience of careers, to come together to form an emergency response team, much like we have in the domestic program with FEMA. 
   Even Secretary of Defense Gates has noted that future conflicts will be fundamentally political in nature and will require an application of all elements of national power, not just the Defense Department. On another occasion, Secretary Gates called for more resources to be given to our civilian agencies, so that they will have the civilian professionals capable of carrying out reconstruction and stabilization operations. 
   Why would the Secretary of Defense ask for more money to go to the State Department and to USAID? It is because he sees the future threats and our capacity to deal with them and understands that a safer and more secure and more peaceful world depends upon adequately funding our civilian agencies. He knows that the best way to avoid war is to stabilize countries by creating stakeholders for peace in those countries. 
   USAID, our foremost development agency, has the expertise, but lacks the manpower and regular training to conduct stabilization operations. With this bill, USAID will receive additional personnel to implement stabilization operations. The State Department will also be enhanced as it takes on the role of coordinator of these complex operations. 
   Again, I appreciate all the hard work that went into this bill to get it to the floor. I appreciate the strong backing from Secretary Gates and from Secretary Rice. I would also like to thank Congressman Saxton, my colleague, for his stalwart support and his work on H.R. 1084. It is my earnest hope that improved American civilian capabilities will yield fewer and shorter conflicts and will build a more peaceful and prosperous world. In order to do that, I need your vote, and I ask for that for the betterment of America and the world.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to commemorate the creation of the Peace Corps. Forty-seven years ago this month, March 1961, President Kennedy called upon Americans to serve abroad. Since that time, nearly 200,000 Americans have responded to that call, including five sitting Members of Congress. They left behind the comforts of family and friends and decided to forego high-paying jobs to share their abilities with people across the globe. 
   Peace Corps volunteers work in the poorest communities of the world's poorest countries, where they build lasting relationships, inspire young people to become leaders, and simply make good friends. Peace Corps volunteers improve America's standing worldwide, one community at a time. 
   Today I have introduced a bill to reauthorize the Peace Corps and to double its size by the year 2012. I look forward to bipartisan support for the Peace Corps and ask all Members to join the Returned Peace Corps Volunteer Members of Congress who cosponsored the Peace Corps reauthorization.

   What every Member of Congress ought to worry about is that we have so many bases that have been closed in the United States that have not been able to finish their cleanup. That means that they can't do economic development. They just sit there with fences around them because they have unexploded ordnances. It is what they call ``warm basing'' a property. Mayor and city councils and local government folks are furious about this. 
   There is a $3.5 billion cleanup necessary. What Mr. Blumenauer is saying is, let's just put $50 million more towards that. That will go a long way toward getting those high-priority communities cleaned up. 
   Frankly, there is no movement that can be taken until this is done, because the only government that can clean up unexploded ordnances is the Federal Government. You can't delegate it out. It can't be a State or local issue. 
   If you want to do economic development in your States and home communities which have been affected by these numerous base closings over the years, for those of you that have base closures, just the recent base closure, there is a separate account. But the reason we have to put more money into this is, there are only two ways of getting money into there, either from sales of property or from direct appropriations. The sales of property haven't filled up this account. So the only way, if we are going to address the unexploded ordnance cleanup, to amend the bill is to add an additional $50 million. It is urgent for economic development at the local level. It is good government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I want to just reiterate on what Mr. Blumenauer indicated. This isn't a ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' case. But if you are from the Jefferson Proving Ground, you have been waiting a long time. If you are from Fort Ord, California, where I am from and why I am really interested in this, we closed in the 1992 round, and we are doing massive economic development, and it is foreclosed if you can't get into cleaning up the unexploded ordnance. Fort Meade, Fort McClellan, Savannah Army Depot, the list goes on and on. These are the kinds of projects that are out there, ready to go. Just take the projects off the shelf, fund them and get it done. 
   I am on this committee and I am very sympathetic. I am very appreciative of what the chairman has done, increasing the account by $50 million. We are going to have an amendment in a minute to cut it, which would be the worst thing we could ever do for all these reasons. Mr. Blumenauer is trying to increase it by $50 million so we could actually have enough money to get some of these projects started. I think it is good government. It is promises made, promises kept, and that is what we ought to do.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to respond to the gentleman from Georgia about his amendment. 
   First of all, I think it is an ill-conceived amendment, and here's why. 
   In order to build veterans facilities on former military property, you have to have that property cleaned and cleared and transferred. I happen to represent a base where we have that problem. We have to clear the area. So if you want to provide health care for your communities, you have to do this clearance. 
   Your statement that this money couldn't be spent is totally false. These are projects ready to go. It is the newest BRAC round that can't be spent until 2008 because they have to have all their plans in place. 
   You are cutting $50 million out of something that is very critical for a lot of communities and can do a lot of good, and you are adding it to a program where we just put in $3.4 billion. $3.4 billion. So $50 million more in that account is not going to help. 
   Frankly, we have already raised that account in committee with strong bipartisan support by $1.7 billion over what the President asked for. So you are going to steal from essentially accounts that are critical and put it into an account that has been plussed-up and is fat. The consequences are going to be that people who are wanting to provide health care services for veterans in their community won't be able to build that facility or get that facility refurbished because the environmental cleanup hasn't been done because we didn't have enough money in the old account. And the only way we can get that money in the account, as I said previously, is to appropriate it. 
   I think this is a very reckless amendment. I would prefer that we even add more, but that was opposed. But this one, I would hope that you might withdraw your amendment because you are going to do more harm than good.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, the problem with this bill is there is never a last word. There is a big debate going on about earmarks, when there are none in the bill. There were none in last year's bill or the year before's bill. This is the first bill to come before the floor, and they attack this bill saying where are the earmarks. 
   Well, there are none. Speakers on the other side of the aisle can't stand the fact that there is a new congressional leadership here. It's rolling up its sleeves and doing the oversight work, the oversight work for an agency called Homeland Security that was created just a few years ago, the biggest bureaucracy in modern American history, 200,000 employees, $36 billion in expenditure, made up of all kinds of things from airports, seaports, Border Patrol, immigration, the list goes on and on. 
   The leadership of this committee decided to really put some fact-finding into it. It had more hearings than any committee in history in this subject matter, visited more sites, visited the borders, the hot spots, visited Katrina sites, talked with Customs and Border Patrol, with harbor district patrol, with Coast Guard, with truck inspectors at the Ota Mesa truck center, the biggest truck inspection center in the word; with the San Ysidro crossing, the largest traffic crossing in the world. 
   You know what every one of those patrolmen and inspectors told me? We can't do our job unless you pass a comprehensive immigration bill. It's not just about more fences and more assets on the border. It's about the whole enchilada, the whole immigration bill. 
   I think there is an underlying current here. They don't want an immigration bill, and they know that this is the agency that deals with it. So it's a delay tactic. 
   Now, a delay tactic, we have been here for 24 hours. We have taken up two amendments. The first amendment cuts $79,000 out of the administrative office of Homeland Security, $79,000 out of a $36 billion bill. But, wait, they adopted a second amendment. It was for a cut for $300,000. 
   We have successfully cut $379,000 out of a $36 billion bill. It's taken us 24 hours, numerous procedural votes to adjourn, to rise, to do anything but deal with the issue. We ought to be very proud of ourselves. 
   We have been able to cut one one-thousandth of 1 percent. That's what the great might of the United States Congress has been doing on this bill. 
   Now, I know that the other side of the aisle likes to cut, squeeze, and trim. They are cutting the agency that they like the most. They are cutting an agency created by President Bush, they are cutting the money that President Bush asked for in this bill, and they have introduced another 110 amendments to deal with more cuts, more frivolity. 
   Where's your leadership? This is an important bill. It's probably the best-combed bill, best-managed bill in the history of this agency. You ought to be proud of it. You were proud of it in committee, because nobody voiced a negative vote. 
   So it was unanimous in the Appropriations Committee, everybody liked the bill. Where is your leadership? Where is your responsibility?

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word. 
   I rise on this issue with just some concern here that we don't lose perspective of what we're really trying to accomplish. 
   This was an issue brought up in the committee, probably the most popular issue of all, which was that we wanted ICE, which is the second largest law enforcement agency in the country next to the FBI, at the rate it's growing, it's going to be bigger than the FBI, we wanted them to do their job of being able to determine whether people who had been arrested at the local level and were in jail, maybe not yet sentenced, but were pending trial or were being held, that somebody would review their legal status. 
   The question is that this program that we are debating and wanting to put more money into, and frankly, the committee doubled the amount of money that's going into it, which is a grant program to local governments, not all local governments are keen on wanting to do this. Why? Because they  have emphasized what they call ``community policing.'' 
   They want the local law enforcement officer to be a friend of the community in order to be involved with the community, to have communities trust them. And if they think that the local law enforcement is also the Border Patrol, they are going to shut up and stop talking to cops. And you get all kinds of issues with this, particularly when it comes to children who are afraid of law enforcement, and so on, if they are the ones that are going to arrest their moms and dads. 
   So, let's put this into some perspective. What we really need to do is make sure that the ICE, the Federal law enforcement, does their job. Why? Because they are trained. 
   I have a note here from my sheriff saying that the ICE comes to our jails in Monterey County, a small rural county in California, three times a week. He said the number of confirmed, undocumented prison inmates varies. Last quarter, there were 52 identified undocumented inmates in Monterey County. The previous quarter there were also 52; prior to that, 72. 
   Some of the inmates claim citizenship status or legal permanent residency and don't have their documentation order. It takes some time to label them and do all that legal background work.     
   That is not what the legal background work is. We have that information. That is Federal information. 
   As we pointed out before, we have no national ID. None of you in here can prove you are an American citizens by any card you carry in your wallet, unless you want to show your voting card, but they won't accept that in the airport so I don't know what valid status that has. 
   The point here is, let's not stop making ICE do their job. They should be doing these local jail checks. If you want to do additional training for local jailers, that is fine. That is what this program is about. But don't substitute it so the local government has to do it, because I think you ought to believe that criminal management up to your local elected officials, your sheriffs and your police chiefs, to make that decision. 
   This is the second largest police force in the United States. It ought to be doing jail checks. They are the ones that have the qualifications to look into the Federal Information Bank to see whether these people are properly documented, and I think we ought to make sure that they do their job.

   Mr. FARR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise as a member of this committee and want to commend the style of this committee. I don't think any committee has had more hearings with more substantive issues than this Committee on Appropriations for security. 
   In fact, this bill appropriates a record amount of spending, $36.3 billion. What we tried to do in the committee, and I want to commend Mr. Rogers and Mr. Price, was starting out asking what are the risk issues that we really need to face in the Nation. This whole emphasis has been essentially an antiterrorism effort, when, in reality, in creating this huge, huge bureaucracy and moving the Department of Agriculture and everybody else into it, what we have found from a lot of experts is that you really have to deal with issues such as the first responders would be the same for a terrorist activity as they would be for a natural disaster, and that we really have to base our decisions on risk-based management. 
   It was no more clear than in a place that we are just sort of throwing money at, which is the border between Mexico and the United States. In testimony, we found that there are more terrorist incidents--in fact, there have been none on the Mexican-U.S. border, but there have been several on the U.S.-Canadian border where we have very little security whatsoever. So if you were acting just on risk management, you would put more assets on the Canadian border than on the Mexican border. But the emphasis here isn't about homeland security; it is more about immigration. 
   I think hearing all the things put together, this is a really good bill. 
   One of the things Mr. Rogers mentioned that I would like to just disagree with, all of our local law enforcement say that the biggest problem they are having is they arrest people who don't have papers and then they release them because nobody from INS will come around and check it out. Everybody on the committee was concerned about the fact that there wasn't enough effort put into what they call ``jail checks,'' and this committee bill addresses that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the Members, and point out that this is not just a spending bill, because they cut a lot of things and they put conditions on spending.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise as a member of the Appropriations Committee subcommittee. I want to give you a little bit of background of how this whole thing started. 
   Homeland Security was an agency created after 9/11, and as admitted by many Members on the other side of the aisle, the agency itself was the biggest bureaucracy created. As you remember, it just took employees from all different agencies, including Department of Agriculture, and put it into one agency called Homeland Security. And we created an appropriations committee and essentially just funded it with what it asked, without all the first instance. 
   And I remember Mr. Rogers, who was the first chairman of that committee, bringing to the Appropriations Committee the bill last year and indicating this is a huge bureaucracy. It has almost 200,000 people in it, very hard to wrap your hands around it, just sort of hold your nose and vote for it. There were no earmarks in the bill, as there aren't any earmarks here tonight, and we adopted it. 
   What happened with the new chairmanship with Mr. Price is that first thing he did was ask, we better look at what this is all about. Homeland security for what? Security, what are we fighting? So we invited in all these experts to sort of give us an overview of what is risk, what is fear, what should we be looking at, and it was very sensible. 
   What they suggested is that you're talking about people that are going to respond to incidents, and in an incident like Katrina, an incident like a disaster, like a terrorist act, you're going to need to prepare responders, people in the Intelligence Community, people on the ground in local communities. And in essence what they said is that homeland security is really hometown security, and you need to have your towns prepared for this, and you need to do it on a risk management basis; just don't throw money at everything. 
   And Chairman Price went on CODELs seeing what disasters were like, going to Katrina, going to New Orleans and later along the border, where we put a lot of money, and what we learned in the committee, ironically, was that the only terrorist that was ever apprehended or found evidence of was not on the border that we've all been looking at, which is the Mexican-U.S. border, but, in fact, on the Canadian border where we were doing very little, if anything, on homeland security. The committee found that very interesting and put a lot of money and assets and said let's start securing the northern border as well as the southern border. 
   The chairman took a bipartisan CODEL along the whole border from Tucson to San Diego, every inch of it, flew it, saw all the assets we have. My God, you'd think that we had the entire war in Iraq being fought on the Mexican border. We have everything from aircraft of all kinds, helicopters, we have ATVs, we have dogs, we have horses, people on horseback. We are covering that border like you can't believe.     
   In San Diego, we even found a Border Patrol out on the boats in San Diego Harbor. It was everything. We saw fences, all kinds of fences, vehicle fences, human fences, and areas that it's just unbelievable, as far as the eye can see. This border is longer than the distance between Washington and San Francisco. 
   What we found is that we had better do this thing wisely. Let's listen and let's use some smart risk management. 
   It all comes down to this bill tonight. What this bill is all about is, this is the best Homeland Security bill this country has ever had. We are spending all this time just on procedural delays. 
   It's ironic that you are going to be hoisted on your own petard, because this process that Mr. Obey and the leadership has put in the process requires each one of you, when you ask for something that's called an earmark, some people call it pork, it's essentially that thing that you think is important. You have to disclose why you are asking for it.

   The committee rightfully has stated that this is not the bill to attack earmarks, because there haven't been earmarks in this bill. So if you want to continue to delay this, rather than getting to the point of adopting an appropriations bill to allow the Department of Homeland Security to do its job, then let's get on with it. 
   I think this has been a night of ridiculous waste of time on something that is very, very important on a bill that is very important, the first appropriations bill we have had here, one that must pass if, indeed, we are going to have homeland, hometown security.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1700, COPS Improvement Act of 2007. Since 1994 the COPS program has allowed local law enforcement agencies to hire an additional 117,000 officers. It is unconscionable that over the past several years, the Republican-led Congress has repeatedly cut the COPS program and eventually eliminated all funding in the 2006 budget. 
   I'm proud that my district has benefited significantly from the COPS program. In fact, in 1996 President Clinton came to the City of Salinas, CA, to commend Mayor Caballero and Salinas law enforcement officials on a successful community policing program. In addition, Salinas was awarded one of a handful of COPS grants for tracking weapons. These tools enabled the City of Salinas to reduce gang violence. As funding for the COPS program dried up, gang violence in Salinas spiked and in 2005 there were 24 homicides. This time, on its own dime, the City of Salinas and the County of Monterey have busted their budgets to implement a community policing gang task force. Reauthorization of the COPS program, with full funding, will enable Salinas and other communities all across the country to again implement effective community policing programs to combat crime. 
   Reauthorization of the COPS program should not be a partisan issue. After all, all crime is local. Community policing is effective because it addresses crime at the local level. H.R. 1700 will allow for the hiring of up to 50,000 new cops on the beat over the next 6 years. In addition, the bill authorizes $600 million a year for COPS hiring grants, $350 million a year for COPS technology grants, and $200 million a year for hiring community prosecutors. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 1700.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for yielding to me. 
   I am the only Californian that sits on the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, and I am very proud that this bill is in partnership with the progressive new provisions that were adopted last week in the farm bill. This spends the money to implement those provisions. As the Chair just said, this bill takes us in a new direction, a direction that rural America can be really proud of. 
   Many people know California as the most populous State and think of our large metropolitan areas. But few know that California is the number one ag-producing State in the United States. Every one of the 58 counties in California produces agriculture, from the smallest county in San Francisco, which has nursery and flower stock, to the most populous county in California, Los Angeles County, with row crops and cattle ranches. 
   The new leadership in Congress has taken us in a new direction. That direction is good news for rural America. That is good news for fresh foods, for fresh vegetables and fresh fruits to get into the diet. This bill takes us in a new direction for consumers. A new direction so that people have choices. A new direction for green technology to be used in the energy field. A new direction for conservation to be a part of good management practices. 
   I applaud the committee's new Chair for taking us in a new direction and the opportunity for farming in America to be economically viable. This is good because it preserves open space and preserves the rural character, which is such a strength of this country. 
   For California, this is good news. Our agriculture is like our technology. It's changing, always changing. It needs to be state-of-the-art of technology, of research, of university work. We are the leaders in organic growing, from wines to artichokes. I am proud to represent the part of California that is called the ``Salad Bowl Capital of the World.'' The farmers who implement the best management practices in caring not only for their farm workers, and there is a big discussion on that in issues with immigration, but we have the largest farm worker force in the United States and they are now getting paid good wages. In fact, a lot of them have their own health care plans, which most Americans don't have, and they have 401(k)s for their families and scholarships for their children to go to school. This is a new attitude about farm workers. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro, the Chair of this committee, for taking America into a new direction, a more healthy direction. 
   Let's reject the reckless amendments to this bill that undermine the positive gains made for America. This is a good appropriations bill. I applaud the Chair, Mr. Obey, for bringing it to the floor and to the members of the committee, and I urge all my colleagues to adopt this bill.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 137, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have had a lifelong love and compassion for animals of all kinds. That is why I am simply shocked that it is not already illegal to take animals across state lines for the purpose of fighting. This is an inhumane and cruel practice that must not be allowed to continue. Another reason why this practice must be outlawed is because animal fighting spreads disease and poses an enormous public health risk. At a time when  avian flu is at the forefront of this county's health-related worries, it should be of the utmost concern to people that animal fighting is occurring all across the country. It makes one wonder, what kind of person could enjoy a ``sport'' like this? 
   In the forty-eight states where animal fighting is already outlawed, illegal gambling goes hand-in-hand with this gruesome activity. H.R. 137, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, makes it a felony to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal or to use interstate commerce for the purposes of fighting. This bill would impose a prison sentence of up to 3 years. 
   I have supported this legislation since 2003. I am pleased that this legislation has overwhelming bipartisan support, with 303 cosponsors. Obviously we need stronger laws on this because this practice still continues.

It was 62 years ago when 50 countries gathered in the great City of San Francisco, California, to make the cause of international peace and security a global mantra and launched the United Nations. It was a good idea then, and 62 years later, it is still a good idea. 
   In a world that is tense with war, the U.N. fights for peace every day. Where hunger plagues the poor, the U.N. provides food aid to more than 80 million people every day, every year. In 166 nations that suffer devastating poverty, the U.N. offers proactive programs to buttress economic development. And, most important of all, the U.N. deploys 100,000 peacekeepers around the world on missions vital to stabilization of regions under threat of conflict. 
   The answer to global distress is found in solving the problems that are the root causes of poverty, the lack of health care, shelter and legislation. The U.N. is the only organization worldwide dedicated to this grand mission.

   Mr. FARR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise as a former member of this committee and to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member and the fellow committee members for bringing this bill to the floor. Much of the committee work in the past, I think, was focused a lot on the Federal lands in the West. This bill, interestingly enough, focuses on land mostly east of the Mississippi. 
   Congressional authorization is essential to sound management of these important places. But this just isn't about land designation; it's about the beauty and heritage of American spirit, our cultural spirit. 
   As cochair of the House Tourism Caucus, we have learned that we need to increase travel in this country, particularly outreaching to foreign visitors, because the image of the United States around the world is not that good. 
   However, visitors coming to this country, seeing this beautiful land, and meeting the people in this country, and looking at our history and our beauty of what I think is the best culture in the world, the American spirit, can only be done by showing them places that we have preserved, so that it's just not all sort of sprawled-out urbanism. 
   These special places need to be protected, because they need the guidance of a good government structure like the Federal Government along and in partnership with State and local government. I want to associate myself with the words of the other speakers that have long been involved in land-use planning and land use, and there has never been an eminent domain or taking of this land.     
   In fact, the prices, if they do buy them, are agreed upon by the landowner, and they're agreed upon without having to have any disputes. So I think it's worked very, very well. 
   America is a beautiful place, but it's beauty is not just in its scenery. It's also in its people and the people's heritage. 
   I urge my colleagues to authorize the celebration of America's great assets, this bill, the heritage of our people.

   Our world is defined by its ocean. Planet Earth could be better named Planet Ocean. We are truly an ocean nation. In fact, more than half of the United States lies underwater and all people in the United States and in the world are affected by the ocean. The ocean helps control our climate, influences our weather, and affects our health. 
   The ocean gives us rain, oxygen, food, medicines, and minerals and energy sources. The ocean supports our nation's economy: it is a highway for transportation of goods and people. Even our national security is affected by the ocean. 
   Our ocean is important as a heritage to many cultures throughout the world and to our cultures throughout the United States. This one world ocean we all share is also a constant source of wonder and discovery. 
   In spite of its importance, little of the ocean has been explored. The ocean is our last and largest frontier. More is known about the moon  than is known about the deepest parts of the ocean. 
   This bill will add to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ability to conduct research and exploration of the ocean. The bill will foster collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of the Navy. 
   The ocean exploration program and the undersea exploration program will drive technological advances and will increase our knowledge about the ocean to help us understand how to best manage, use, and preserve this resource. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and show that the age of discovery is not over.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   Myself and my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Jon Porter, formed the Congressional Tourism and Travel Caucus. Jon Porter is an outstanding cochair of that Tourism and Travel Caucus, and we have worked very closely with the authors, because this is a totally bipartisan bill, with Mr. Delahunt and Mr. Blunt. It has been a work in progress for about the last 10 years, something the industry has really needed and America has really needed, particularly after 9/11, to try to expedite travelers coming to this country from especially those countries where we already have the Visa Waiver Program. 
   There is no taxpayer money in this. It is a congressionally created nonprofit corporation based here in Washington, D.C. It will have a 15-member directorate. They are not civil employees; they are not government employees. Those 15 members represent all aspects of American business, travel and rural areas as well, because, frankly, to boost the travel economy in this country boosts jobs in everybody's community. So this is one of those economic stimulus plans for America that has long been sought. 
   As you turn on the television and listen to these ads from other countries trying to woo Americans to travel overseas to their countries, to Australia, New Zealand, Europe and so on, we are going to be able to compete with that kind of travel promotion and really do what I think is so wonderful about promoting America, not a particular commercial destination, but just America as a country and a place to visit and see the wonderful people here. We will live that American Dream, with people seeing what an incredible country and what wonderful people make up this country. 
   So I am very excited about the opportunity to really boost tourism in America, to boost world understanding of American culture and Americans, and really I think this is a big step towards global peace, and it is good for business in this country as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Women's History Month. April was designated as Women's History Month in 1987 to honor women and the achievements they have made throughout the years. I want to pay special tribute to my female colleagues in the California delegation. 
   I am proud that California has led the way in electing women to some of the highest offices in the federal government. Currently, there are 19 women from California in the House of Representatives, more than any other state. Among these are the Speaker of the House, a Chair and a vice-Chair, and 12 subcommittee Chairs. These women, who hold leadership positions, wield an enormous amount of power that was un-heard-of just a couple of decades ago. 
   In the fall of 2006, the American people elected the Democrats to the majority and as a result, they put into motion a process that would ultimately break one of the ``glass ceilings'' for women in politics. After she was sworn in, NANCY PELOSI, the first ever female Speaker of the House said, ``It says to women everywhere that not only a glass ceiling but a marble ceiling can be broken and that anything is possible.'' This was an historical day for women, not only from the United States, but from around the world. I have talked to numerous women who have mentioned watching this momentous occasion on TV. 
   These women hold their positions in part because of the hard work of women like Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who served from 1917-1919 and again in 1941-1943; Mae Ella Nolan of California, who served from 1923-1925; Florence Kahn of California, who served from 1925-1937; and Helen Douglas of California, who served from 1945-1951. These women were pioneers in the field of politics at a time when politics was a man's purview. Thanks to these women, we have elected the first woman Speaker of the House, who is third in line for the Presidency. 
   Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute to the women across the country, and around the world, who have made history by their varied accomplishments. And the women who have come before you and have helped lead the way for women in the political arena.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, the death of Lady Bird Johnson was a sad day for the country. It was also a sad day for my district, and for me personally. 
   Mrs. Johnson also played a key role in drawing my father, California State Senator Fred Farr, to Washington. She successfully lobbied for his appointment as the Federal Highway Administration's first Highway Beautification Coordinator, wisely drawing his energy and insights to Washington. 
   Lady Bird was a fervent supporter of so many of the values my constituents and I hold dear. She was a lifelong supporter of the environment, an advocate for preserving the special places in communities around the country. Lady Bird visited California's Central Coast in 1966, where she dedicated Highway 1--now known to all as the Big Sur Coast Highway--as the first scenic route in the state. She even helped plant a redwood tree near Monterey's historic Colton Hall. 
   Mrs. Johnson was a passionate environmentalist. She argued against the blight of roadside billboards, instead calling for more trees and her beloved wildflowers. And many of the beautification projects that make Washington a gorgeous capital city were the product of Mrs. Johnson and my father. She was responsible for raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the city's streets. 
   Mrs. Johnson's beautification projects and scenic designation programs were so important to drawing attention to areas that deserve protection. I encourage all of our communities to continue her work. We need more people like Mrs. Johnson in the world, more people who appreciate the beauty that is around us and who strive to preserve it.

   I would further like to thank Vic Snyder, Mac Thornberry, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman for making sure the military will have a strong and capable civilian partner to do stabilization work in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, included within this en bloc amendment is a provision that will improve what is already a very good bill. For nearly half a decade, Members of Congress and foreign policy experts have been wringing their hands about our civilian capacity to effectively conduct stabilization and reconstruction operations. 
   Now, in a bipartisan fashion, in this bill and with this en bloc amendment, we are strengthening our government's ability to respond to crisis by standing  up a civilian response corps. Our Nation must do a better job, not just in waging wars, but also in winning the peace. If we cannot translate security gains into economic growth, social well-being and justice and reconciliation, all of the military power in world cannot secure long-term peace and prosperity for the world. 
   This bill, together with this en bloc amendment, will improve our Nation's ability to win the peace. I encourage all the Members to support the en bloc amendment.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, leadership is about getting results. I want to thank our leadership for bringing a bill to the floor for the first time that gets results. 
   I've never voted for funds for this war, and I've been waiting a long time to vote for a bill that would bring our troops home. 
   On March 20, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. It was a mistake then, and every day we've failed to correct this mistake costs us in cash, in credibility, and in lives. Every day we are not working to get out of Iraq, we make our Nation weaker and less safe. Every day that we do not get our troops out of Iraq is another day of mistakes. 
   The road out of Iraq starts with the first step. This bill is the first beginning. To start a withdrawal, this bill jump-starts that withdrawal. It starts in 30 days. 
   Passing this bill tonight makes clear that the U.S. House of Representatives has acted to bring our troops home, to end this war, and to put our country back on the right track. This leadership deserves your support.

   Whether we like it or not, this bill before us is the first serious binding legislation to come before the House since the war began 4 years ago. This bill contains benchmarks and time lines for withdrawing our troops. 
   Even so, in my opinion, this bill does not go far enough. I think it should prohibit U.S. military action in Iran without explicit congressional authorization. But without this bill, the alternative is not acceptable. A supplemental without benchmarks is stay the course. 
   I have received thousands of letters from my district in support and opposition to this bill. The only way to bring the troops home is to vote ``yes.'' I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I am one of the Members that served with Leo McCarthy. I was a member of the California legislature. And like Speaker Pelosi, he was the one who convinced me, when I was a young staff member working for the California legislature in 1975, that I ought to return to my district and start running in public life for politics. And that is what got me into being a county supervisor, and the rest is history. 
   But serving with Leo McCarthy indeed is distinction for all the reasons talked about. But I loved his youthful energy. The shock of Leo McCarthy dying is that he never looked old, never seemed old. He always had the energy of youth; looked young; and just was a remarkable person. He twice ran for the United States Senate. And doing that in California is indeed a tough problem because the State is so big, so expansive, and it requires so much time, and Leo would never abandon his family. 
   I remember, Leo was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and I remember going on a trip to Auckland, New Zealand with him. He was welcomed home as a town hero. He pointed out that because he was born in that town, he could never run for President of the United States, not being a native born. I also traveled with him to Canada, when we went on several of the communications issues. And I remember him so devoted to Jackie that he took all his life savings to make sure that Jackie could have a wonderful coat that she wanted, and I know that she still has that. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, Leo McCarthy was the kind of person you want in public life. And indeed, California is better off for having him serve. It is a great State, and he made it greater. He produced a lot of us that are serving in Congress. And certainly, almost like a daughter, Anna Eshoo, the author of this resolution, and Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, he has a lot to be proud of. We are very proud that we were able to work for him, serve for him and be in public life with him. 
   All our condolences go to Jackie and the family.

We are booming with energy alternatives. And do you know what we have done? We have banned offshore oil. The public in California does that unanimously. We are not about oil in California; we are about investment in the future. 
   This bill allows the utility companies, which now every utility company in California gives a rebate. There are companies in California that are buying cars for their workers if they are hybrid cars. This allows the incentive to be increased, doubled, tripled. 
   This is about investment, and I just totally disagree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle. It is not about looking at the future through the rearview mirror; it is about investment. That is what this bill is all about. This is the best gift you could ever have in the tool box to help California grow economically.

   Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and in strong support of the underlying bills.

They talk about how much we love the veterans side of it, but we don't like the Health and Human Services side. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot have a veteran without having a family, without having a home. 
   This bill puts more money into the areas where the President cuts it. In an area where the oil is going to $100 a barrel, they oppose this bill because we give more money to LIHEAP for elderly people and people who have low incomes to heat their homes in this winter that is coming. 
   They cut the budget for special ed, the President cut. We put it back in. We put in money for autism. We put in money for people for research, for strokes, for cancer, for Parkinson's Disease. These things are related to veterans. 
   You can't stand a veteran alone. A veteran has a family. If that veteran's family needs some help, by God, it's the government's responsibility to provide for that good public education and that great institute of health. That's in this bill, education, health, labor, the essence of America, essential to having good veterans.

I am proud in the MilCon-VA appropriations bill that we have appropriated $124 million to provide 1,800 new claims processors to work on the 400,000 backlog of claims. I thank the committee for extending for another 2 years the claims adjustment.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment for a very practical reason. The State of California, which is probably the most populous State in the United States, has done more for cutting energy costs by doing energy conservation and renewable energy. It has built all kinds of plants, all kinds of opportunities for renewable energy. It has reduced the per capita energy use in the United States to the lowest per capita in the country, doing the best job. And every one of those facilities was built under Davis-Bacon law. 
   It is not a problem. We have built every courthouse, every schoolhouse, every road, every capital in this country. It has been on the books for a long, long time. And this is just a get at labor, get at people, try to cut wages, go to the lowest cost. Essentially, it increases all kinds of imported labor.

   None of this money comes to my State or the universities in California involved in this consortia, but the State of California and other States, including Mr. Flake's own, are very interested in the outcome of this. I will tell you why. Because the rangelands  of America are under great threat; and certainly in those rangelands in the rural areas, you raise cattle and sheep and bison, which we don't raise in our State. 
   But what this grant does, why you ought to be interested in it, is that they're learning new ways in which to graze. What they're doing is studying the effects of grazing herds of cattle, horses, sheep all together, because they eat different kinds of grass, and if you herd them essentially, move them on, you can preserve and bring back the native grasses, which is what we want to do. 
   Our cattlemen are very interested in this process, and this is the place to do that study. You get kind of a funny name for some of these things like this Ruminant Nutrition Consortium, but, in fact, it's a grant program. It is competitive, and the benefits of it are I think what keeps America strong. We've got to keep putting money into research dollars.     
   You know, if this was medical research, you wouldn't be criticizing it, but it's agricultural research, and it sounds funny. But, you know, you didn't take on my earmark, which was about lettuce and germ plasma. That's a pretty funny one, but it's very important if you like lettuce and you want to keep America ahead in the lettuce world. 
   So striking these few earmarks, by your time, trying to do this, fortunately, I think you are a great Member and you get an A for effort; but you also get A for 100 percent failure in being able to strike earmarks, because these are good earmarks.

   Mr. FARR. No, I will not yield; and I want to say why. 
   In law, you learn an old adage that says, in order to get equity, you have got to show equity. 
   The other night we were on the floor with a bunch of amendments, and the amendment was debated, and it was accepted by the chairwoman. And then we went on and debated with motions to adjourn, motions to rise for a number of hours. 
   The gentleman who offered the original amendment that was adopted also had 11 other amendments. This is a $100 billion operation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, $100 billion. His amendments were to cut $50,000, another amendment for $60,000, another amendment for $7,000, another amendment for $39,000. And it went on. The list went on and on. He could have put all of those into one amendment. It still wouldn't have even matched $1 million. 
   So the point is that these were all dilatory amendments to just try to delay the time; and I think that equity was not shown, partnership was not shown, bipartisanship was not shown. And that is why we have a rule that is fair, allows these amendments, 12 more, to be debated, and the self-executing rule did self-execute some Republican amendments as well. 
   I urge the adoption of this rule.

Res. 152 recognizes and reinforces a two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, I urge Congress and the Administration to move away from rhetoric and actively engage in steps that will foster lasting peace in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only grossly disrupts the lives of Israelis and Palestinians, it destabilizes the entire Middle East and enflames extremism, threatening U.S. national security. 
   U.S. involvement in Iraq has consumed the Administration's attention, but resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict is an integral component for long-term peace in the region. Efforts to bring resolution to this conflict should not be put on the back burner because of the Administration's political fumbling in Iraq. I urge the Administration to reinvigorate its role as a fair and balanced broker and call on the U.S. Congress to recognize that securing peace in the volatile Middle East will require a sustained financial commitment. And, I urge our friends and allies in the region to recognize that peace in the Middle East is in their own countries' best national security interests and to become more actively engaged in the peace process.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise also in opposition, and I'll tell you why. I've been to the border and I've traveled the area that you're talking about. It's in the Barry Goldwater range. It's a very rural area. It's actually an area where you have Indian tribes. I mean, this is so rural you can't believe it. I am really surprised that the gentlewoman rose on this because she doesn't have any border in her State, nor fence. I come from the State of California which not only has a border; it has the busiest border in the world. 
   I am also in opposition to this because I have talked to the Border Patrol. This is not a fence that they are asking for. What this fence is for is a fence in the military range. It should be coming out of the military budget because it is just in the middle of absolutely nowhere, where there is very little, if any, crossings. You would be much more effective in detection rather than fences. Border Patrol once said, you know, a 12-foot fence, you just need a 13-foot ladder. 
   I respect the fact that you think that this is going to get you somewhere, but I can tell you that it's not wisely spent money. There are much more cost-effective ways to do border detection than building a fence in the middle of nowhere.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I'm just sorry that my colleague and good friend wasn't on the border with us, because he would have heard from the mayors. 
   And I'm also kind of shocked at the statements here that this is what the American people want. Who do you think these people along the border are? They're on our side of the border. They're our communities, they're our city councils, they're our mayors. And if this were any other Federal entity coming into your hometown and saying that you don't have to tell anybody about what you're doing or consult with them or get any cooperation, you're going to have border failure. 
   This is the community that supports the homes of the Border Patrol, supports the children of the families that protect the border, and you're saying that they, with removing this language, the chairman was very astute in pointing out that the administration has not asked for this. 
   This language does not allow any veto. It allows for a consultation process. And that's absolutely essential, because if you don't have that, you're going to have those mayors coming back here and city council persons and saying, What the hell are you doing building this without talking to us? We're going to try to stop it. And they'll try to file lawsuits and things like that. 
   So if this border is going to work, it's a living border. My frustration is that we're all paying attention only to one  side. And I can assure you that meanness and arrogance and just trying to plow your way through it is not the way to build a secure border. It's the way to build people that hate the Federal Government.

And what you are talking about here is striking language that gives some ability for comparing the expenditure of costs on one piece of intelligence equipment versus the other. And what the gentleman didn't tell you is that of all the assets on the border, this is the most expensive, $10 million, $8 to $10 million per unmanned vehicle. The other assets that are on the border, which everybody agreed was much more effective, is the new radar system, which costs about $700,000, that are portable. 
   We have others. We have balloons. We have helicopters. We have as many assets looking at the border as there are in Iraq. And what the language in the bill says is that before you go out and just buy more Predators at 8 million bucks, there is already $50 million in the account and we want to know before you spend that whether it is cost-effective compared to other issues that you have to do. 
   You have on the border not only the Customs and Border Patrol, and I would submit that the arrests were not made by that unmanned vehicle, and I don't think that was the only system they used to discover that. It was just one. It happened to be a very, very expensive one. The radar systems are the most effective. The most effective. And you have responding to that Customs and Border Patrol that are in aircraft, in different kinds of helicopters, including Black Hawk helicopters, you have all-terrain vehicles, you have Border Patrol on horseback, you have Border Patrol with SUVs, with four-wheel-drive vehicles. You have all kinds of response mechanisms and all kinds of detection mechanisms. 
   But to suggest that we shouldn't even ask the question of whether an $8 million expense is more cost-effective than another kind of assets, I think, is just ridiculous. 
   And, frankly, that is one thing the committee found out, that there isn't all the money you always want to spend on everything here. There have got to be some priorities. And if you have made the priority that of the Customs and Border Patrol, this is not what they would spend it on.     
   So I think the amendment and the language in the bill is particularly appropriate. It doesn't prohibit the expenditures. It just says before you come back and spend up to another $8 billion, compare this to what other assets you can buy, and you make the suggestion to us as to what is the best expenditure of limited public funds.

   Mr. FARR. First of all, the Predator has to be monitored. There is manpower on the Predator. And as I recall, there are three people that it takes to fly it. 
   But that's not the issue of this, because you would have money to buy Predators. All it says is that the same people that operate them, Customs and Border Patrol, that this isn't a high priority for them. That is all it says.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, the language is that the very people that are operating these vehicles, the Customs and Border Patrol, certify that these are the higher priority and the more cost effective than other items included in the Air and Marine Strategic Recapitalization and Modernization plan. It puts the burden on them. If this is what they think is the most cost effective, fine. It doesn't block it; it just says do that analysis. 
   I am really just surprised, because I sat here all these days and just heard riling after riling, people getting up on the other side talking about money, and we need to be very conscientious about how we spend money. There is language in there that says, Customs and Border Patrol, you certify that this is a high priority for you and it's cost effective. What's wrong with that? Why do you want to strike that language? It doesn't make any sense at all.

   Mr. FARR. Because as the gentleman knows, this is an almost $10 million per cost item. And you know what? The one we had crashed, and the other one we have is about to be delivered. And there is $50 million in the account. If they want to come back and use that $50 million to buy more of them, that's what we are asking. You tell us what is the most cost-effective use. Frankly, and I wish you were there, the new equipment that is coming out, this technology on radar, for 100 miles can detect when even rabbits are crossing the border. It's very cost effective. The Border Patrol is very excited about it. They would like to have more, but they can't because they're spending money like this. 
   So, with all due respect, these are professionals that are on the job every single day, you want to let them tell you what they think is the most effective tool to do their job. That is all this language does. I don't know why you would oppose that.

   Mr. FARR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for yielding. 
   I wasn't even going to speak on this issue, but I have to concur with my Chair and ranking member, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Bilbray. The Deepwater project, the first Deepwater vessel is being delivered to Alameda, California. As you know, the Alameda office is in charge of the entire ocean from California to the Indian Ocean, half the world. The other half is monitored by this side. If you think that that operation isn't about national security with the vessels that are in the entire Pacific and with the drugs that are being run up through the ocean from South America, I don't think we can afford to take the newest vessel which is going through all its trials and sea trials and is going to be stationed in our own State and cut funding that's going to affect that. I hear you. I think we need to do something about identification, but I frankly think that if you're thinking that REAL ID is going to solve that identification problem, all IDs tell you is that you are who you are. There is no national ID. There is no citizenship ID. There's nobody in this room that has a card in their wallet that shows that they're an American citizen. You may have a driver's license. You don't have to be an American citizen to have a driver's license. You may have a Social Security card. You don't have to be an American citizen to have a Social Security card. There is no card. You may have a passport. Very few Americans have them, but those who have them, that shows that you are an American citizen. 
   The issue is whether these fake IDs which the States are working with can be made more secure, and I think that's important to do, but I don't think that's going to answer your national ID issue. It's not.     
   Frankly, this is a debate worth having. We are not having it here, we are not having it on your amendment, we are not having it tonight because I think the real debate is: Is this the time in the development of our country where we really ought to form an ID? I have been opposed to it. If you look at the politics, the left and the right have been very much opposed to having a national ID program. But if you are going to do it, it is going to need to make much more sense than 58, our States plus our territories, all having different measurements and not having any one way to tell if it is a citizenship issue which you want to talk about, which is what this Border Patrol and Customs is all about. This is not the way to do it, and certainly not cutting money from a budget that has already been whacked and oversighted and conditioned more than any other budget item than in this bill.

   Mr. FARR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. 
   I rise as one of the cochairs of the Travel and Tourism Caucus, and I rise because I think you are trying to fix something here that isn't broken. 
   We have not had problems with the Visa Waiver Program. In fact, it has worked very well. And the reason you get qualified as a country for the Visa Waiver Program is because the visitors from that country, all who have passports, those passports all are screened and have to pass the screening before they get on an airplane. And so if there is such a traveler that is on the ``no fly'' list, they would be selected out at that point. 
   The reason these countries have qualified is because they haven't had people visiting our country who have skipped, who have stayed on, who have violated. The visa is time certain. These are frequent travelers; they are from the countries that are our allies, most of whom are members of NATO or other security forces. I think it is a very bad way to go. One is it's going to alienate the travel and tourism industry in the United States that relies a lot on foreign travelers; they spend a lot of money in this country. And, frankly, right now visiting America is a bargain. It is one of the best vacation packages you can buy compared to costs in Europe and so on. And what you do by cutting these funds, you would prohibit funds from this act from carrying out the Visa Waiver Program. 
   Now, within that program is also the ability of DHS sharing information with the State Department, maintaining records of these visa-waiver applications. Remember, you have to apply for that. You would prohibit the administering of programs which air carriers use relating to verifying travelers as qualified, visa-waiver residents. 
   So what you are going to do is you are not going to stop the program. You are just going to stop the sharing of inside information. And I think it's a fear that hasn't been demonstrated as a problem. Therefore, nothing is broken that needs fixing. There isn't support for this program among the travel and tourism industry, and particularly the air carriers. And I think the fact that all these visitors have to have a passport and those passports have to meet our standards, that these Visa Waiver Program visitors are very well protected.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, none of the facts stated by the gentleman have anything to do with the amendment. The amendment cuts the ability for us to manage a program which is working very well. Every one of these travelers has to get a passport; those passports have to meet our standards. They have to go through the screening at airports. If they are on a ``no fly'' list, they won't be allowed on an airplane. This is not the way to try to prevent good visitors to this country who are allies of the United States. 
   And, frankly, adopting this amendment is not only going to create an incredible bureaucracy for us; it is going to create an alienation among countries that we get along with very well and have allowed a visa waiver. Without it, every one of these would have to flood a foreign council. And you would have frequent travelers unable to get to the United States and be a good tourist and good visitors of our country and good friends. 
   I don't think in nation building that this is the way that you want to attack the problem. So I ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and must say it has been very interesting tonight. There has been a lot of discussion about fences and very little discussion about Homeland Security which is what this budget is all about. 
   It is interesting, in traveling the border and talking to the Border Patrol, there was never, never a request for this. What you are doing, very interesting in this amendment, you say ``none of the funds made available in this act for customs and border protection fencing, infrastructure, and technology may be used for anything but at least two layers of reinforced fencing and roads.'' 
   No technology, no infrastructure, just got to build two fences. Wait a minute. This committee went to a lot of effort to find out how to prioritize spending. What we heard from the experts is follow risk management principles. 
   And the question was asked in committee: Where is the risk on our border? Where have we seen terrorism? And guess what the head of the Border Patrol said, the Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner said, when asked about how many terrorists we have apprehended or found on the Mexico-U.S. border? The answer was zero. How much material have you apprehended on that border? The answer was zero. 
   When asked about the northern border the answer was yes, we have apprehended terrorists coming across that border, and we have apprehended material coming across that border. 
   So based on risk management, if this is about terrorism, the fence is not an issue. I think this fence discussion here has created fence bulimia. That is all we can talk about, and it is only one fence, and now you want to build it double when the customs people don't even ask for that. 
   We are sitting here as fence managers here in Washington and have nothing to do with trying to patrol that border. This is cutting off funds for technology and infrastructure. If there is anything that is needed along that border, it is infrastructure. This is like building a huge levee on one side of the river and not taking care of anything on the other side. 
   I will tell you, if you are going to have security, you are going to have to have a much more comprehensive approach. Mexico is our important ally. It is our neighbor. It is our leading trade partner with the State of California which the gentleman is from. It has the busiest border between California and Mexico. More people cross that border every day and more legitimate commerce cross that border than any other place in the world. 
   And we are doing that with existing resources. Guess what, they are working because the committee has put in some very good detection systems using smart cards and other things. 
   I think this amendment does absolutely the opposite of what you want to do. This doesn't secure the border, this takes money away from technology and infrastructure development. Without a problem, you don't need to fix it. 
   If you want to build a fence where the terrorists are coming, then build that fence across the Canadian border. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1907 the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation and Protection Act authored by my friend and fellow co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus from New Jersey, Mr. JIM SAXTON. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for all that Mr. SAXTON has done during his distinguished career in this House to help protect and promote the oceans. He has been a great ally in the fight to keep our oceans from harm and make sure that they will be healthy and productive for our grandchildren's grandchildren. Mr. SAXTON joined me in coauthoring a comprehensive ocean management bill, H.R. 21, known as Oceans-21, that would create a national ocean policy and create coordinated State and Federal management of our oceans. I will continue the fight for the oceans but I will miss having the leadership, friendship, and vision of JIM SAXTON next year. 
   The conservation of coastal habitat a necessary action identified in the final reports of both the Pew Oceans Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. Coastal areas are vitally important to our ocean health, since most of our use of the oceans, both recreational and commercial take place in the coastal zone. Estuaries provide even-more important services such as mitigating the impacts from runoff and are known to be the nurseries that support our country's fisheries. 
   This bill is necessary to authorize a coastal land conservation program and extend the utility of one of our best ocean management laws: the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Coastal Zone Management Act allows States and the Federal Government to cooperate in the management of the resources and environment of the coasts. States which have approved coastal management plans and National Estuarine Research Reserves will be eligible for grants to conserve coastal lands and estuaries that have significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural, undeveloped, or recreational state to other uses or could be managed or restored to effectively conserve, enhance, or restore ecological function. 
   I also lend my support to this bill because I have seen the good that this program can do. The Elkhorn Slough, covering 1,330 acres in my district, is one of the relatively few coastal wetlands remaining in California. It became a part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1979. The main channel of the slough, which winds inland nearly seven miles, is flanked by a broad salt marsh second in size in California only to San Francisco Bay. 
   Elkhorn Slough is home to more than 400 species of invertebrates, 80 species of fish and 200 species of birds. The channels and tidal creeks of the slough are nurseries for many species of fish and help support fishing off of the West Coast. At least six threatened or endangered species utilize the slough or its surrounding uplands, including peregrine falcons, Santa Cruz long-toed salamanders, California red-legged frogs, brown pelicans, least terns and Southern Sea Otters. The slough is also an important stop on the Pacific Flyway, providing feeding and resting ground for many types of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes a program that is necessary for the protection of our coasts and our oceans for future generations. I cannot emphasize enough the need for this Congress to provide for ocean stewardship now. I support the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation and Protection Act and I urge my colleagues to join me.

   However, the public should not be angry that the Congress has tried to respond, not to the President's request but to the public's need for checks and balances. We wrote an entirely new bill, the contents of which are on every Member's Web site. It provides relief with checks and balances, oversight for taxpayer safeguards, and addresses obscene salaries and abusive golden parachutes. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a responsible bill. 
   The best thing that came out of the last 10 days is that the institutions of government became responsible for governing the affairs of this Nation in a bipartisan manner. Now let's hope that this House will follow the leadership of the Senate last night in passing a responsible recovery plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. 
   Simply put, the current patchwork of State laws alone does not fully protect the rights of all Americans from violence based upon actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. I am frankly astounded that current Federal laws are not more inclusive. 
   It is unconscionable that we are only now voting on this legislation today. Almost 150 years after our country enshrined the freedom from violence based upon race, with the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, we still have not extended those same protections to all of our citizens. Today, this body has the chance and indeed the responsibility to rectify this injustice. 
   Hate knows no borders, so even though 38 states already provide some of the protections that would be extended by Federal law if H.R. 1592 is enacted, only a Federal law can ensure equal protection under the law for all Americans. 
   Remarkably, this legislation faces opposition. These opponents have claimed that H.R. 1592 is somehow an attack on free speech or a person's religious beliefs. H.R. 1592 does not criminalize freedom of speech or religious  expression, but it does criminalize violence against a person based upon their perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. In fact, a long and diverse list of religious organizations have spoken out in favor of H.R. 1592, including groups representing Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim and Sikh faiths. 
   No longer will this body be silent for the millions of Americans that too often have no voice in the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.   
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to show my support for H.R. 1592, The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. 
   Freedoms of speech, expression, and equal protection under the law are the founding principles of this country. The Constitution guarantees these rights to all Americans. I believe that it is our duty to fight for the equal rights of all Americans, regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. 
   I abhor all violent crimes. Attacks that are motivated by hate are attacks on a whole class of people. Such hate crimes are intended to instill fear in an entire community and are particularly heinous. We must give law enforcement the proper tools to investigate and prosecute crimes that are motivated by hate. 
   Laws punishing hate crimes are not intended to value one group over another, but rather to acknowledge the historical bias against certain minority groups and opinions so that all can enjoy the same legal protections as the majority. Hate crime laws protect innocent people and allow them to engage in everyday activity without fear. 
   I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this important legislation. This bill helps to better define a hate crime and prevents the erosion of civil liberties critical to our democracy.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I want to yield some time to my chair, Mr. Edwards. But I just want to say how bothered I am by the attacks on this particular bill. 
   This is about military construction. And there are construction projects in here--and not many--but when you're dealing with a lot of construction, there's a lot of slippage. And what happens, if you have an opportunity to move one project ahead of another, it makes a lot of sense. And these aren't projects that are invented by Members of Congress that come here and know the specifics, these are projects that come from the military itself. 
   For example, Mr. Flake's amendment would cut out, in Arizona, the State that he comes from, in Fort Huachuca, the Air Tactical Command Radar Operations Building. Now, I don't think a Member of Congress thought that we have to go and add this in here. What happens is the opportunity, Fort Huachuca that's seeking this, comes and says if there is an opportunity buy, let's be able to use it. That's what strikes me, that there's some kind of devious action going on here, and it's just not true. 
   And the other gentleman's discussion in California alone, Edwards Air Force Base near his district, to strike out a main base runway repair that's in this bill. And that wasn't some legislator coming along and thinking about, we've got to add this in as an earmark. No, this came out of the Air Force saying, we need this; if it's possible, can we put it in the bill? That's how we discuss these things in committee. 
   These are priority opportunity buys. And I resent the fact that this amendment is a reckless amendment and just strikes it across the board, regardless of the impact. 
   And so as Mr. Edwards so eloquently said, it does a lot of havoc to the men and women who are serving our country in uniform and to the bases that they operate out of. 
   I would like to yield the remainder of my time to my chairman, Mr. Edwards.

   What is wrong? What is broken that needs fixing? I have never had a constituent in the 32 years that I have been in elective office come up and say, you know what? This library or this road or this school was built wrong because it was built under Davis-Bacon. 
   This is an annual thing, people coming up and complaining about it, because the prevailing wage oftentimes is what the unions pay, and that can get the union contract. And what is wrong with union labor? This effort to amend this is essentially just another strike against organized labor in America, against a fair, decent wage, at a time when the cost of living is almost at an all-time high. It is always tried, it always fails, because there is no need to fix it, because it ain't broken.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5618 the National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2008 authored by my friend and chairwoman of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, Representative Madeleine Bordallo. 
   The National Sea Grant College Program has, since 1966, provided research grants, traineeships and fellowships which help graduate students and researchers study areas of the ocean which have strong effects on people. This is mostly done through the State Sea Grant programs which operate in most coastal States in conjunction with major universities. The Sea Grant programs provide valuable research and education into the economics, public health, and environmental impacts where people connect with the oceans. I have trouble thinking of a better return to the public on our research investments. 
   The National Sea Grant program operates the Dean John A. Knauss National Marine Policy Fellowship which provides graduate students in ocean science and environmental studies the opportunity to bring their expertise as a fellow in a Congressional office or in a Federal agency office to gain experience and impact ocean policy. In my tenure in Congress, I have had 11 Sea Grant Fellows in my office. They have provided invaluable knowledge and passion for the oceans that have improved my understanding and helped to bolster my fight for the oceans. 
   In California, we are lucky to have two Sea Grant Programs: the California Sea Grant program operated through the world class University of California system and the Southern California Sea Grant program operated through the University of Southern California. These programs are on the ground in California connecting the research and policy community, providing research grants, and educating the public, scientists, and policy makers on the importance of human interactions with the ocean. 
   Mr. Speaker, the National Sea Grant programs have done a lot with a little money and I am confident that they will continue this tradition. I cannot emphasize enough the need for this Congress to provide for ocean stewardship now. The oceans and the Great Lakes belong to all the people of the United States and it is our duty to understand the implications of our actions on them.

It's continued while northern California's Iron Mountain spewed nearly a quarter of the copper and zinc discharged by industries to the Nation's surface waters; during the decades of efforts to control acidic, metal-laden discharges from old sulfur mines southeast of Lake Tahoe; as historic lands of the Indian Pass in the area of Southern California in the desert area faced destruction from the proposed Glamis mine; and as California cities spend millions of dollars to treat hazardous mine discharges and fight giant mining corporations in court. 
   Like the pollution problems it creates, the 1872 Mining Law persists, but that will now change with passage of this bill, and we owe that hard work to Chairman Rahall and to my colleague JIM COSTA from California. 
   While this congressional debate has continued after all these years, we've allowed mining companies to take billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, and other minerals from our public lands for free. However, we will no longer treat that as we have not treated oil, coal, natural gas. So they will all now have to pay. 
   While countless hearings have been held, nearly 3.5 million acres of public lands have been deeded to mining claim holders for as little as $2.50 an acre. We've had to buy back some of this land to protect the unique ecological, recreational and cultural values, paying prices much higher than those set in the Mining Law. 
   And during our long deliberation, the price tag for mining cleanup has risen astronomically. Since the House last acted on reform legislation, more than 20 mines and mills have been added to the infamous Superfund National Priority List, and the EPA Inspector General has warned that nearly $24 billion in cleanup costs from mine sites now exists, some of which will require treatment in perpetuity. 
   However, this is about to change. For today, the Hardrock Mining Reclamation Act of 2007 will do what it should have done years ago. I urge the passage of this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of overriding the President's veto of this Medicare bill. I may not sit on the Ways and Means Committee but I have followed the progress of this bill minute-by-minute, it seems. The seniors in my community need this bill. The doctors in my community need this bill. If this country wants to assure affordable health care for its elderly, this country needs this bill. 
   The President's veto of this bill was a poorly cloaked nod to the insurance industry. While the rest of us are trying to find a way to reform the Medicare system, the White House is trying to find a way to privatize it. Whereas government has the charge of making sure the program delivers health care efficiently, private insurance has the charge of making sure the program brings a profit to shareholders. Taxpayer dollars should not be making insurance companies rich. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote to override.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, in the Peace Corps we say, ``Once a volunteer, always a volunteer.'' There was a time when I thought that those words were just a slogan. However, over the years I've watched the friends I made in the Peace Corps in Colombia continue to volunteer in their communities and around the world. And this continuity of volunteerism is not unique to the Peace Corps. 
   In fact, it has become clear to people who understand public service and volunteerism, that to `'give back'' is a habit. And you can get more of it, if you open up more opportunities to people involved in volunteer service. There is a virtuous cycle in volunteerism and it is a cycle that we do well to encourage. 
   AmeriCorps is one of the great innovations in public policy that has created opportunities for Americans all across the country to volunteer. From working in inner city schools to working in food back in small towns, AmeriCorps opens the doors for people to volunteer and in so doing provides a stepping stone to a life of service. 
   I commend AmeriCorps for all it does and for all the doors to service it has opened. So, today as the House of Representatives recognizes AmeriCorps, I encourage all those who can do so to find a way to volunteer in their community and to give back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be able to speak in support of House Resolution 322, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel. 
   For the past six decades, Israel has persevered in its quest to establish a free, open and democratic society--a society that reveres the same values that we do here in the United States. It is for that reason that we have been a stalwart ally of Israel. And it also for that reason that we will be allies for the next 60 years to come. 
   For as long as it has existed, Israel has been a beacon for the Jewish Diaspora and a lone democracy in the Middle East. It has given refuge to those in search of a homeland and provided a safe haven for people around the world who have fled from persecution. 
   While it has struggled with its neighbors to find a workable peace, Israel and its people have never ended its pursuit for a permanent solution. Over the years we have witnessed too much bloodshed and considerable sorrow, but we have also seen the enduring faith that peace will reign. 
   Israel has proven itself capable of monumental achievement and I see no reason to despair that peace with its neighbors will not be yet another of Israel's achievement. 
   I commend Israel on its 60th anniversary and believe its future is bright. And I continue to hope that its future will be free of the violence of much of its past.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, in mid-March, the Chinese government conducted a bloody crackdown, grossly violating the human rights of the peaceful protestors in Tibet. 
   The protest by the Tibetans touched a nerve and rapidly spread beyond the capital city of Lhasa into other areas of Tibet and around the world. The peaceful protest drew a violent and disproportionate reaction from the Chinese government who sought to tamp down the Tibetan desire for autonomy and self-determination. Not only did the Chinese government react with terrible force upon the protesters, the authorities also tried to discredit the Dalai Lama and his movement for a free Tibet. 
   The Dalai Lama is as determined and committed to nonviolence as he is to seeing the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous, autonomous and self-determined Tibet. The brutal crackdown that seeks to derail the inevitable movement toward a free Tibet resulted in the deaths of more than 100 Tibetans and caused a great deal of social upheaval. 
   While we live a safe distance away from the struggle, comfortably ensconced in a liberal democratic society, we cannot act as though we do not have a role to play to support the Dalai Lama. We do. 
   I am enormously grateful to Speaker Pelosi, who has offered this House resolution which calls upon the Chinese to end this crackdown. This violent reaction is shortsighted and unproductive and, furthermore, it's not the long-term solution that respects the human rights and dignity of every Tibetan. 
   Rather, the Chinese Government must enter into a serious, substantive negotiation directly with the Dalai Lama and must allow independent monitors into Tibet. Only then will we be on the path toward a solution to this crisis. Furthermore, I join Speaker Pelosi and other supporters of a free Tibet, to ask for the immediate release of all Tibetans who were arrested for non-violent protest. 
   I am pleased this evening to express my support for the struggle toward a free Tibet, and I would encourage all my colleagues to join me by supporting this important House resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, today my community celebrates the birthday of  John Steinbeck, one of our famous native sons, born in Salinas and raised in and around Monterey Bay. At home in my district this month, the National Steinbeck Center will get the whole community to read one book together, ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' one of the best, well-known tomes by Steinbeck. 
   The book is being read across the country as part of NEA's Big Read program, designed to bring reading for pleasure back into our lives. Since I am a citizen of Monterey County myself, I would like to offer my own participation in this celebration by reading the following passage from ``The Grapes of Wrath'': 
   ``The people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their noses from it ..... Men stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn, drying fast now, only a little green showing through the film of dust. The men were silent and they did not move often. And the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men--to feel whether this time the men would break. The women studied the men's faces secretly, for the corn could go, as long as something else remained ..... The children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and women would break ..... After a while, the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant. Then the women knew that they were safe and that there was no break. Then they asked, What'll we do? And the men replied, I don't know. But all was all right. The women knew it was all right and the watching children knew it was all right ..... The men sat still--thinking--figuring.'' 
   This is Steinbeck at his best.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. First of all, thank you for doing this Special Order. It's very important for the American public to know that their Capitol, this is a public building, the people of this country own it. But we, as caretakers of it, are changing it into a model place to work and to have as a seat of government. 
   And just a few things that Mr. Blumenauer talked about, we're eliminating plastics and Styrofoam from the food service has totally been eliminated. As he showed, they're using compostable food service items. We're running a commercial composting operation, reducing waste by 50 percent. We've installed 30,000 compact fluorescent lights and use one-quarter of the energy that will last 10 times longer than the regular light bulbs. 
   We've changed the settings on heating and ceiling fans to reduce the run-times by 14 percent. We've replaced 84 vending machines with energy efficient equivalents. People don't think about these vending machines. They're all plugged in and they have lights and everything on them. 
   Analyzing the electrical energy usage throughout the 6 million square feet of the House buildings, the offices that we occupy, we're doing that audit now to find savings. We've activated economizers on building air conditioners, which cut the annual cooling cost by 20 percent. And we've initiated a study to relight the Capitol dome. Those lights are on all night, and I think we're all proud of it, but that study will reduce the energy requirements and do very efficient lighting. 
   And as you said, what you see here is that I think this is a real response to what the voters asked for last November, which was a change in direction in America in their House of Representatives and their Senate. They elected new majorities. The new majorities elected new Speakers. And the new Speaker has led us in a new direction.     
   And in just a short period of time, a number of months, we've done some dramatic changes in this building, and it's just historic. And I would like to compliment both of my colleagues, we're all west coasters, Washington, Oregon and California. And I think what we're reflecting here in the Capitol is what we bring from your own States, that have been very conscious about the sound economics of energy efficiency. 
   And the last thing I would just like to say is that this blast that the Republican leadership put out about the greening of the Capitol is so un-business, it's so dumb, it's sort of that dinosaur politics that just says, you know, don't change. If you look at the businesses in America, the new investment is in all the stuff that we're doing. And this is the direction this country is going. It's the direction the planet is going. It makes good economic sense and it makes great environmental sense. And we ought to be applauding ourselves for stepping up to the plate and not criticizing those who have taken the lead.

   Mr. FARR. We didn't recycle, and we put an effort into doing that. Where that has grown now is all of the paper that's sold to all the offices, and there are 70 million pieces of paper per year used in the U.S. Capitol, we are replacing all that virgin paper, which cut down about 30,000 grown trees, it is all now 100 percent post-consumer waste recycled paper. So just that alone. And in the store where we buy all our supplies, that store sells recycled printer cartridges. That store becomes the receptacle for all the batteries that are used, for cell phones, and for BlackBerrys. So that they will all be part of the recycling stream. So we have just changed the entire approach to how we do business just in our office supplies in this Capitol.

   Mr. FARR. Can I just tell you our offices led this effort on recycling, and my staff really got involved with it. And I'm really surprised how much we are doing, and I am sure a lot of other offices are doing the same. 
   We use only recycled paper products. The paper that is printed on only one side, we go through and have our interns make sure that that becomes the fax paper so that the clean side is used again in the fax process. The white paper, mixed paper, and newspapers each have their own recycling bin. Cardboard is set aside to be recycled. As long as they have a clean side, mail campaign postcards are bundled and used as scratch paper. 
   Each work station in my office has three bins, one for white paper, one for mixed paper, and one for wet trash. The officer manager will spot check the bins to make sure that everyone is separating their trash correctly. And we also have a separate bin for plastics, glass, and cans. Now, that's just one office. And the point here is we can all do this. And there is money to be made by the government in these recycled products. 
   What you are talking about is the Department of Agriculture just down the street has about as many employees as the House of Representatives. They were making tens of thousands, I think about $80,000 a year profit on recycling in the Department of Agriculture. And as you pointed out, the United States Congress was making about $21 a year. 
   So that has all changed thanks to this new leadership. And I am very proud to be a part of this greening of America by starting here in the Capitol of the United States.

As you know we have cafeterias in buildings and take-out centers. We have a lot of food service here. They redid the contract for all the food services, and a firm won this contract. It is a big one. I think it is about $20 million. They are going to provide all fair trade coffee, which is the coffee that is paid the best price because you grow it for organic conditions, for taking care of the employees, paying good wages of doing it environmentally sensitive, and Starbucks and everybody else is participating in this. Also, the foods in our cafeterias are going to be organic. We are going to make sure that the eating habits of Congress become a lot healthier along with the way we are doing business in our offices. 
   Lastly, I am going to walk home with GEORGE MILLER, so I will leave, but I want to tell you, that in our office and I think other offices, we don't throw out the magazines, as we send them to the VA and community health clinics and senior centers. We don't put any dead batteries into the trash. We deposit them in a single place so they can be recycled. This is interesting, all the CDs you get sent in the mail for promotional advocacy efforts, they are not thrown out. They are provided to local gardeners to use to scare off birds and squirrels in their vegetable garden.

   Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor, as many of us have today, the Veterans Day this weekend that's coming up. 
   Congress has spent a lot of time this week talking about veterans. We've talked about how this Congress provided the largest increase in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. We've debated which side cares more about veterans and who's to blame for the delay. 
   I think the American people can see who really is holding up the latest VA appropriations bill, but I'm here to remind each and every Member of Congress that, as you go home this weekend and speak to veterans and their families in their district, to honor them, ask yourself what have you done to honor your pledge to our veterans and their loved ones? 
   I hope the President also takes a hard look in the mirror before he decides on how he intends to honor veterans on Veterans Day. 
   We have to remember that in honoring our country's veterans that you cannot honor a veteran without honoring their families. They don't come alone. They have parents. They have loved ones. They have children. 
   And the bill that takes care of that is the bill that we're voting on today, which is the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. In order to support veterans, you've got to support their family. Be family friendly, vote for the appropriations bill.

   As co-chair of the Congressional Tourism Caucus, along with my co-chair Jon Porter of Nevada and nearly 100 Members of Congress, we recognize the importance of the tourism industry to our national economy and to our local communities. 
   It is the fastest growing industry in the world. From mom and pop restaurants to local unique shops to local State and national parks to this Capitol, which is a tourist attraction, there is so much to experience in this great country. 
   The tourism industry also shows America's best face. Travelers experience warm, friendly and compassionate people that make up our country. This person-to-person contact between different cultures can help dissolve stereotypes and misconceptions. As Mark Twain once said, ``Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness.'' 
   So remember that while our economy grows, tourism plays a multibillion-dollar aspect of that, employing more than 7.5 million people. I hope you will join me in welcoming the representatives of the tourism industry that are here this week and celebrating National Tourism Week. 
   The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to express my support for the Jubilee Act for Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Cancellation Act. 
   This Jubilee Act is a vital piece of legislation that will liberate poor countries from the burden of heavy indebtedness. These countries simply cannot invest in their futures if they are tethered to the illegitimate debts of their past. 
   Today we have the opportunity to take a major step forward in our effort to combat global poverty and elevate our Nation's moral standing in the world. For that we should all feel a great sense of accomplishment. 
   By one simple act here in the U.S. House of Representatives, we have the ability to strike a blow against one of the great scourges of the world: poverty. I have spent a lifetime in public service fighting the root causes of poverty--from my time in Colombia as a Peace Corps volunteer, straight through to this vote today as a Member of Congress. 
   It has long been apparent to me that steady and adequate investments in health care, education, housing, and sanitation are absolute minimums to be able to eliminate poverty and hopelessness. And this bill makes those investments possible for a whole swath of the world where they would not be otherwise. 
   This bill lifts the burden of past debts off the backs of governments that are behaving responsibly and have a proven record of investing in their own people. This is important to note, because many of these indebted nations incurred their debt, not under their current democratically elected governments, but under past autocratic regimes that pilfered the money and left the people of these countries in utter poverty. 
   The Jubilee Act is a follow-on extension to a debt relief program with proven results. Since 1996, 30 countries have received nearly $80 billion in some form of debt relief. The money that these countries have saved in debt financing charges have gone directly into fighting poverty. By passing this bill, an additional 24 countries will have the opportunity to throw off the yoke of severe debt and begin anew to confront the conditions that perpetuate poverty with additional resources at their disposal. 
   I am pleased to join today with so many of my colleagues, from both political parties, to reinvigorate our effort to fight global poverty. I am pleased to join today with so many of my colleagues, from both political parties, to reinvigorate our effort to fight global poverty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my comments for the record on this Medicare bill that we debate today. 
   Yes, it is a critical bill. It will prevent a 10.6 percent cut in payments to doctors who treat America's senior citizens, the wide network of doctors in the Medicare system. In addition, it shores up those payments with a 1.1 percent payment increase in 2009. 
   But though I applaud what is in this bill, I bemoan what is not in the bill. 
   The negotiators on this bill have heard from me--and others--long and loud about the flaws in the formula that determines Medicare doctor fees. In a number of States across the country the formula knowingly and erroneously designates some areas as being rural in nature when they are by all other definitions clearly urban. The result of this deliberate misclassification is to pay doctors at low rural reimbursement rates rather than at their true costs of operating a medical practice in a high-end urban setting. 
   Doctors in my district and 9 other counties in California are paid upwards of 10 to 12 percent less than the law--yes, the law--says they ought to be paid. But because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, won't make the necessary technical formula adjustment in a factor called the Geographic Practice Cost Index or GPCI, these doctors are underpaid. Doctors in Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Monterey, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, El Dorado, Marin, and San Benito counties in California are mistreated by CMS. But nothing in the bill we debate today will help them. 
   Previously this House did take a step to correct this inequity. In H.R. 3162, the original CHAMP bill that we passed last summer, Section 308 fixed the GPCI factor. But despite my efforts and those of my colleagues from affected counties throughout California and in similarly impacted States of New York, Texas and elsewhere, H.R. 6331 maintains the flawed formula and perpetuates the clear disparities of this CMS payment policy. Even the GAO in its report last year, GAO-07-466, showed that without a doubt the CMS formula did not fairly compensate doctors and needed serious reform. Despite mountains of evidence and years of engaging the Ways and Means Committee on this issue, H.R. 6331 ignores an opportunity to do what's right by these doctors. 
   I am not going to vote against this bill. But I have to say that it is a sad day when this House votes to pass a doctor payment reform bill that only reforms doctor payments for some and not for all.

   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 and the manager's amendment offered by House Education and Labor Committee Chairman, Representative GEORGE MILLER. 
   It is globally accepted that the higher education system in the United States is the envy of the academic world. Paths to college often have different origins but always have the same destination, to enlighten our minds and expand our horizons. 
   A path that often goes unnoticed but traveled by a hidden portion of our population is the path of those with dyslexia. Dyslexia is often the butt of many jokes, but for those affected by it, it is anything but funny. Reading and writing are two fundamental skills that are essential to how we learn from the time we enter school to the end of our lives. For people who suffer from dyslexia, like myself, our ability to learn by traditional teaching methods is more challenging, and dyslexic children often fall behind at an early age. Imagine trying to follow along with your classmates and simply not understanding why you cannot read at the same level as everyone else. Being young, you don't know that you have this condition. Your teacher, who has not been trained to identify dyslexia, assumes that you may be slow or lazy. The longer the problem goes unidentified, the greater the challenge to overcome and adapt. As a young child with dyslexia, I quickly lost interest in school and became a class disruption. If it had not been for a science teacher who encouraged my interest in the sciences, who knows where I would be today? In science I had the opportunity to learn with my hands and not solely through a bunch of jumbled words in a textbook. This newfound appreciation for learning spilled over into other subjects and inspired me to succeed every day. Most students with dyslexia go unidentified and are more likely to struggle in early grades, which may mean they stay back a grade, lose interest in their studies, can become increasingly disruptive in class and may be sent to alternative schools for troubled youths or special education classes. All this because our teachers are not trained to recognize dyslexia in the classroom. 
   As part of the manager's amendment to H.R. 4137, a study by the Center for Education at the National Academy of Sciences will examine teacher education programs at institutes of higher education to determine if teachers are adequately prepared to meet the needs of students with reading and language processing challenges, including dyslexia. 
   For too long, the Department of Education has resisted efforts to increase awareness and training for students with dyslexia. We owe it not only to our children but also to our teachers and parents to fully recognize dyslexia as an impediment to accessing their full potential. A simple recognition of this condition can change a child's life forever and help set them on a path to be a productive member of society. I was lucky, but a good education policy should not be based upon a collective crossing of fingers. 
   Mr. Chairman, I again urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4137 and the manager's amendment offered by the House Education and Labor Committee Chairman, and my good friend, Congressman GEORGE MILLER.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2419, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 and urge my colleagues to pass this meaningful legislation. 
   I want to thank Chairman Peterson for crafting this legislation and I also want to again thank the Chairman for visiting my district and talking and listening with my farmers and ranchers on the Central Coast of California. 
   I am glad the Chairman got to experience the rangelands of South County Monterey and the mile after mile of nutritious fresh produce as we drove through the Salad Bowl of the World, the Salinas Valley. 
   As the number one agriculture State in the union, California for too long has been the stepchild of farm policy. My own district grows more than 85 crops commercially with a value of more than $4 billion. 
   Our region leads the nation in the production of artichokes, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, celery, garlic, several varieties of lettuce, spinach, strawberries, flowers and foliage. 
   The Central Coast contains some of the most fertile and productive farm land in the world. It's a combination of soil, climate, and private risk capital because for too long specialty crop growers in California have sat on the sidelines as other commodities received the largess of Federal assistance. 
   H.R. 2419 takes farm policy in a new direction, for the first time in the history of the Farm Bill we have a package that has something for everyone. 
   Specialty crop growers finally will get the investment of mandatory funds for vital research, technical assistance, pest detection, market promotion, and much needed produce food safety will all receive mandatory funding. 
   With this influx of money we can go beyond new farm policy, we can promote health policy as part of the farm bill. 
   This great health debate is taking place in American homes, in the medical community, and in schools. For the first time we now have a link from farm programs to healthy nutritious fruits and vegetables. 
   Here we are as a society, talking constantly about obesity and diets, and yet until now our farm policies were not structured to encourage the kind of diet that the food pyramid suggests we should adopt. 
   I have said it many times--if people would eat more of what California grows we would be healthier for it. Specialty Crops are now taking its rightful place at the center of the debate on how to solve the problem. 
   The Agriculture Committee's version provides funding for important conservation programs, nutrition programs, and a strong farm safety net to protect America's farm economy. 
   H.R. 2419 includes additional funding for conservation programs, $350 million to expand the fruit and vegetable snack program to schools throughout the country, $365 million to fund the specialty crop block grant program, funding for pest exclusion activities, $215 million for specialty crop research, and $30 million for organic research. 
   I want to make special note of the $25 million in mandatory spending for the produce food safety grants included in this bill. As ground zero for the spinach E. Coli outbreak last year I understand all too well what happens when the food system breaks down. 
   I am thankful for the $25 million investment in mandatory research grants so we can gain the needed knowledge and understanding so we never have to go through this kind of outbreak again. 
   All of these provisions provide significant benefits to California's specialty crop growers, who make up the majority of California agriculture.

<DOCNO>Mr. FARR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Thank you for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair tonight. 
   I would like to thank the new leadership in the House tonight for the opportunity and the time to allow this body and the Members of this body to go on record about the President's war strategy. 
   Of course I would prefer that we were debating my bill, H.R. 413, which would rescind the authority that we gave the President to invade Iraq back in October of 2002. I voted against this war then, and I will continue to do so now. 
   We just cannot thank, though, our leadership. We have to thank the American people, the people that went to the polls in November, who voted for a change and a new direction for this country. You, our constituents, voted for this change, and now you are witnessing the historic debate on the President's policy in Iraq. 
   This resolution that we are voting on is very simple. It has two sections. The first section affirms our support for our troops who are serving and have served in Iraq. 
   The second section expresses disapproval over the deployment of 21,000 combat troops in Iraq. These two simple statements aren't legally binding. But they are binding promises to the American people who voted for us to change the direction. Promises are important. When soldiers and their families go to war, our government promises to support them, and that we should. 
   Just think, if we made the same promise to the school children when they go to school, that we would protect them from school violence and fully support their efforts to get an education, and that we should. 
   Just think, if we made that promise to provide health care for 47 million Americans who are without health insurance today, and that we should. The promise and the list of promises goes on and on, many unmet domestic needs that are not getting attention because of the war in Iraq. 
   Some say this resolution is meaningless. I disagree. It is a promise, and promises are important. 
   If we can support our troops and we can support the teachers who are educating their children, we can support the health care providers that are caring for their loved ones. 
   By voting for this resolution, we are making a promise to the American people to change United States' policy on the war. This resolution doesn't end the war, but it begins a new direction. 
   This is the first time that we have said ``enough is enough'' to the President. It is a good start. If we go on record in opposition to troop surge, we can express our disapproval to the country's addiction to oil and to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. We can express our disapproval of the policy that keeps homeless people on the streets, that keeps one in six American children living in poverty, and allows our skies and oceans to continue to be polluted. 
   So to the American people, I thank you. I thank you for getting involved, because when you do, politicians respond. You have empowered us to chart a new course for the war in Iraq, and I am proud to cast my vote for this resolution. 
   Today we are keeping our promise to the people, for what we do for our brave troops, we can do for all of God's children. Yes, Mr. President, we can tell you that you are wrong. 
   In closing, I think what this debate is about is to wake up the world. America is coming back. It is coming back with the most powerful force on Earth, the energized electorate. This resolution is a breath of fresh air in our Nation's Capitol. It is time to get out of Iraq, it is time to lead. 
   Thank you, Speaker Pelosi, for bringing us this far in just a few short weeks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I call on Castro to not fear political dissidents in Cuba, nor free press, nor trade or travel with the U.S. But I also call on our government to consider the following: the U.S. has tried 45 years of an embargo and restrictive travel; the State Department has tried democracy assistance programs; and, the Treasury Department has tried restricting U.S. farmers from easily selling their products to Cuban consumers. 
   All these U.S. government policies have failed to bring about a change of leadership in Cuba. Unfortunately throwing more money at TV Mart&#237; or democracy programs is not going to bring about a real change in Cuba. Real change can only be brought about by revolutionizing U.S. policy towards Cuba. Lifting the travel embargo--allowing for the free exchange of ideas and people between our country and Cuba--that's how we will support Cuban political discourse! That's how we will support freedom of expression in Cuba. Support lifting the embargo--vote against the Diaz-Balart amendment and support a saner policy towards Cuba!

   Mr. FARR. Thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to put a little bit of a face on this across-the-board cut, squeeze and trim, the sort of idiotic approach to spending here in this United States government, particularly in this budget. 
   We happen to have a global war of terrorism going on. In that global war, there are a lot of people that don't like the United States. 
   But there is a program that the United States has that they very much like. They like it because countries are asking at an all-time high, send us more; we want more. More countries signing up wanting more people. 
   What is that program? It's the Peace Corps. And guess what? It's funded in this program. 
   You know what? The American public out there wants to join the Peace Corps at an all-time high. No, it doesn't matter. Just cut the program. Cut the program. Don't separate the good from the bad. Just cut it. 
   Well, this is why it's also idiotic. Because, as you have heard, this program funds an international military education program. 
   A few months ago at this roster, we had a Joint Session of Congress; and giving that address was King Abdullah of Jordan. Guess where King Abdullah found his love for the United States? Studying at the Naval postgraduate school in Monterey, California, where 500 foreign officers come and study along with our officers every year. 
   But, no, that doesn't count. We want to work on trying to get mutual understanding to our allies. Cut that program. Cut it across the board. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard from a lot of cut, squeeze and trim fiscal conservatives on the other side of the aisle tonight. I would hope that their hometown press is looking whether they, example of leadership, are cutting their own budgets from what they have spent last year. If they have done that in their own offices, cut their own spending, then they have a leg to stand on. But to come up here and tell everybody else we ought to cut across the board foreign aid is a danger to Americans all over the world.
