   Mr. RANGEL. My colleagues, as we move toward the end of this legislative session, I would hope, at some point, that the minority just not be guided by blind ideology and to see whether we can prepare ourselves to work together in the future. In all of the years that we have had this administration, they have talked about the unfairness of taxes, and yet they have not seen their way clear even to suggest what we should do about it. 
   I know they are busy starting wars in various places, but it would seem as though the executive could take a deep breath. 
   They talk about entitlements, how we have to get rid of them, that it is causing us to go into bankruptcy. And unless I missed something during my brief illnesses, they have never suggested what you do with Social Security; not a note, not anything private, not a call from Paulson saying, can we talk? 
   And now we talk about----

   Mr. RANGEL. Well, all I am saying is that you are not setting a tone that we can work next year in an administration that totally are not blinded, whether you call it entitlements. We are talking about providing services for the 40 million people who really don't have it. So let's stop talking about what the heck you intend to accomplish in 2 weeks. It's over. Get over it. Forget about it. Do what you have to do politically, see what you can salvage, and let's come back next year and get the job done.

The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to thank Mr. McCrery for getting his views and his willingness to listen to mine, with both of us understanding that, at the end of the day, that people are not concerned with our differences, but they are concerned about the United States Government responding to their needs. And to that extent, of course, I want to thank our Speaker in recognizing the legislative and political pressures as she negotiated with using the skills of Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson and working with the distinguished minority leader in recognizing that we were a part of trying to make certain that the American people knew that we weren't able to do everything that we wanted to do, but we did not ignore our obligations to come together with some type of a compromise. And I think it was historic as we expanded to reach people who would have been ignored had it not been for changes that were made in how we get the money to people. 
   So I want to thank the leadership of the House, but make it abundantly clear that all of us thought, at the time that we agreed to this agreement, that the Senate was prepared to accept our agreement without change. It's my understanding now, as we talk, that the Senate Finance Committee is marking up their own stimulus package, and I assume that it will not deviate substantially from what the leadership of this House has done. But I do hope that it's made abundantly clear that the House has done its responsibility, and that if there's anything that impedes the Senate from complying to the mandate that the President has set on our Congress, that they too have an obligation to make the type of compromises that's necessary so that we can move forward. 
   I also would like to add that sometimes it's very difficult in being chairman of a committee that not only do we have partisan differences, but we have differences among my own party.     
   And while we are reaching out to provide assistance to people who are suffering economically, I cannot help but remind myself that these people were not selected out of any compassion of wanting to help the poor and those in need. 
   Indeed, the main reason that these people are targeted is because economists, conservative or liberal, agree that the assistance that we are giving has to be timely, fast. It has to be targeted to people that are going to have to spend the money, and it has to be temporary so that we don't do severe additional damage to the deficit. 
   I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that we are talking about the heart of America, hardworking American middle-class people that are now being targeted because they can't afford to take care of their families. 
   Yes, they have to spend the money to put food on the table, put shoes on their kids' feet, put clothing on their backs, to pay for shelter. And I submit that we shouldn't walk away from this House, because we give economic assistance, proud of the fact that millions of people in this country find themselves in that predicament and for that the Congress cannot be charged. 
   And I do hope after we finish going through this bipartisan effort, which we have to do, that we might find some way to tell these people that we are going to provide relief without considering a stimulus, but we are going to provide relief because it's the right thing to do. 
   And no man and woman in this country that works hard every day should have to be stigmatized that they can't afford to provide a different type of lifestyle for their family because they can't meet their obligations. 
   And so I hope in the way we, in a bipartisan way, have cooperated with this administration, that they recognize that the Tax Code, which is tilted toward the wealthy and therefore supposed to create the jobs of the wealth for the middle class, didn't work this time. And maybe we can think in terms of how we can bring more equity to the moneys that are available to disposable income to those people who work hard every day and not have to target them because of their inability to meet their needs, but to know that we did what we should have done, and that's to provide them with the dignity and the means to continue to contribute toward the economy of this great Nation of ours. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with the gentleman from Indiana the fact that we should blame the Congress for this because clearly we have had no leadership from the executive branch. So I guess the blame has to fall on us. For those who are concerned about tax reform, we waited 7 years, and we have got nothing. So either accept what we have got, or ask the President to at least bring something to the Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott), who is a subcommittee chairman of this committee, that has fought hard for the creation of jobs but has just as much compassion for those who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend and colleague for yielding and giving me the opportunity to rise in support of this bill. 
   I am confident that this Congress will be noted for the initiative that we are voting on today and that the American people will not be as concerned with the process and the procedure as they would be as to what did the Congress do in terms of dealing with the issue of global warming as well as relieving us of the dependency on foreign oil. 
   These are the crucial issues that Americans have looked to us to deal with. And I don't think it can be challenged that although there are those who have objections that it is not all that they would want it to be, it is a step that all of us in Congress should be proud that we moved forward. 
   The Clean Renewable Energy and Conservation Tax Act of 2007, as included in H.R. 6, presents a step in the right direction to present solutions to the problems that our great Nation and, indeed, the world are facing. 
   What did we do? To accelerate the use of clean, domestic, renewable energy sources and alternative fuels; to promote the use of energy-efficient products and practices and conservation; and to increase research and development in the deployment of clean, renewable energy and efficiency technologies. 
   The tax title of H.R. 6 makes good on this promise. The compromise package includes robust incentives for renewable energy production, increased efficiency, plug-in electric drive vehicles, and incentives for carbon capture, as well as the sequestration of coal demonstration projects. 
   The package facilitates and advances the development of advanced electricity infrastructure, it contains incentives to mitigate carbon remissions, it promotes the production of renewable energy and security of our domestic fuel supply, and it encourages energy savings and efficiency. 
   This package cost is fully offset by including certain provisions that were  loopholes that were undeserved of being given to oil and gas giveaways, not to the smaller suppliers of oil, but to the very largest that have had obscene profits without the benefits of the technology necessary to remove the dependency. 
   Specifically, the package will repeal the domestic manufacturing incentive for the top five integrated producers while freezing reductions at 6 percent for all others in the oil and gas sector. The package tightens foreign tax credit rules for foreign oil and gas extraction income and foreign oil-related income.     
   I want to take this particular time to thank Steny Hoyer, Nancy Pelosi, and, more particularly, John Dingell for bringing together the interests and concerns of the standing committees and having us come forward as a body to fulfill the commitment that we made earlier on that we were going to respond to the needs of the people of our great Nation and certainly to the people of the world. 
   I do hope that while there has been a lot of partisanship in terms of lack of cooperation on the other side, that at the end of the day when people at town hall meetings or our children and grandchildren would ask the questions, what did we do, we can say we supported this great historic piece of legislation.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, here we are again, once again fighting for the dignity of millions of Americans who worked every day of their adult lives, paid into a trust fund, believing if there ever was a need, that their Congress, their Members would respond to it. 
   The compensation that we are offering in this legislation is so meager that it is almost embarrassing to have to fight to get it, and the whole concept that maybe the President believes that if they are given assistance, they would rather not look for a job but rather have these checks. But I think I want America to know that as long as good people want to work, as long as they don't have money to pay their bills, as long as oil prices are up, education, health care, as long as these good people cannot survive and begin to lose their dignity and their pride, as long as these great Americans, middle Americans find themselves in this position, that we on our side will continue to fight no matter what you do. 
   So you can attack us on parliamentary grounds, you can talk about PAYGO, you can talk about suspension, you can go get a veto, but the American people should know that we are not going to give up. We are not going to give in, and that we will prevail. So whatever tactics, language, rhetoric you come up with, at the end of the day when the family says I know I can depend on our Congress, they will be asking: And how do your congressmen vote on this issue? And I hope that you will be guided by your conscience and not your party. 
   So I would like to yield the balance of my time to Dr. McDermott to get into the specifics, but I hope that we will be able, with our vote today, to get into the heart of the American people and let them know that this Congress and this country will not let them down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I think we are all proud that we are able to at least go back home and face the people who are going through this economic crisis. They are sitting around the table. They know America is not going to let them down. They know that they have hope and vision for the future. They know that they, and others, have had economic setbacks. Because as David Dreier, my dear friend has said, they are in trouble now. They are not working and they are losing hope, but they are depending on everybody, Republicans and Democrats, to be there for them. At the end of the day they will look at each other and ask, What does it look like in the Congress?     
   Are they going to give us a little assistance, a little dignity, a little pride? Can we keep our kids in school? Can we pay the rent? Can we go into the supermarket and have a decent meal over the weekend? They're not going to let us down. No. 
   I don't know about you. I've been here 38 years. And the one thing that I always hear when I get back home is, ``And how did you vote on that?'' 
   I would suggest to you that you staple David Dreier's statement to your newsletter so that they can interpret it with you and say, I didn't vote for you, but I didn't want to let you down. I didn't vote for you, but I did advocate a permanent extension of the President's tax cut. I didn't vote for you, because I really believe that if I give you some money, you're not going to get out there and try to get a job. 
   So you have to take this very carefully. But I hope that when you get home, you'll be able to say, you know, when they first started this, I didn't like the way the Democrats handled it. I didn't like the way they put it on the suspension calendar. I thought that perhaps we should, even though $35 billion is there, I would have liked to have seen it handled different. And I expressed myself about it. 
   But at the end of the day, because I know so many people who know so many people that are not the least bit interested in the parliamentary procedure; they're going to ask the question, ``How did you vote?'' Be able to say I voted the right way.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   My friends, this is almost an historic occasion because, like the President of the United States said, it is our intention to extend health care to cover 10 million kids. 
   I don't care how you cut it. You can call it socialized medicine. You can say it's outside of the budget. But when you go home, the question basically is going to be were you with the kids or were you not? It is not just the human and right thing to do, but from a fiscal point of view, how many billions of dollars do we save by providing preventative care to these youngsters? And certainly from a tax writer's point of view, how many of these kids are going to grow to be productive workers so that they can pay taxes and make a contribution to this great Republic?     
   I don't know how you're going to explain how the kids can go to emergency wards if they get ill, as the President of the United States has indicated; but I know one thing, those of us who have kids and grandkids want the very best for them, and we do have this occasion now. 
   Now, there are a lot of complaints from the other side that they did not participate in the writing of this bill. Having been in the minority for so long, let me say that every one of you on the Republican side that did not participate, that complained, you have good cause. You were not involved. And I might heartily add, neither were Members on the Democratic side involved. 
   If you really want to find out who called the shots on this bill, which is not the House bill, it's those people on the other side of the Capitol that believe that everything that has to pass the Senate, that you need 60 votes for. And that's the long and the short of it. So, you may call it the Democratic majority, as I once did, but they're being held hostage by the Republican minority. 
   And so I participated in terms of seeing what they wanted to do. And believe me, what they said to the House of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats alike, take it or leave it. And so if you want to join with me in looking for someone to criticize, after the debate we can meet in the lobby and talk about it. 
   But you had an opportunity to vote for a better bill; it was here. And for those who are concerned that legal immigrants can't get services, I hope you voted for the House bill because it was in there. But if you really want to complain about it being un-American, walk with me to the other side, and we'll find the culprits who did it, and they're not Democrats. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

So if you want to join with me with your criticism, don't criticize anyone here. It is not my fault that your leaders were excluded from the so-called ``conference.'' We had no conference. 
   I know how it feels to have been in the minority, having been there for a decade. So I share with you why you were left out. But had I been in charge, and not the Senate, I would have wanted you there, your judgment. Even if it was just to read the bill over and over and over, at least you would have been participating. 
   I yield to the chairman of the Health Subcommittee. No one is in a better position to let you know that this is not the House bill. As hard as he worked to reform Medicare, to make certain that we preserved it, to reform that bill, to get $5 billion for the people in the rural areas, to help the aged poor, and really to help the doctors that work hard every day and deserve a decent reimbursement, that, my friends, was in the House bill. But our friends on the other side, the Republicans said, ``No, take it or leave it.''

Mr. Speaker, when Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi shattered the glass ceiling and made history as the first woman to become Speaker in the history of the United States Congress, the one picture that remained to commemorate this great event was the children that were there when she was sworn in. It wasn't a symbol of the war or the deficit or the Republicans or Democrats; it was this Congress sharing with the rest of the country our deep commitment to the children of our country. And that is our investment. 
   Whether you are liberal, conservative, Republican, or Democrat, no one can challenge that our most precious human beings are those who cannot protect themselves. We have this opportunity to join with the Speaker as she closes this argument to set aside the partisanship and to be able to say, no matter what our differences, it was the children, it was the children that prevailed, and I voted with them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to support some of what Mr. Barton has just said in terms of being critical about the manner in which this bill, albeit it helps 3 1/2 million more children, how it got to the floor. And I also want to sympathize with him, having been the ranking member of Ways and Means when the Republicans were in charge, so I know what being excluded means. But I want to assure him that he was not excluded by the House leadership, not the House Democratic leadership and not the House Republican leadership. The criticism that so many people have about this bill is misfounded. 
   This is not the House bill. For those that are so sensitive about legal immigrants not being covered, you had an opportunity when the bill was in the House to vote for the House bill. And I hope for political reasons when you get back home, that vote was recorded the right way. But the reason it is not in this is because this is not the House bill. 
   And I want to tell Mr. Barton that I was invited to go into the back room, but the back room was on the Senate side and it wasn't controlled by the Democratic leadership but by those Republicans who demanded that it be their way or the highway. 
   So you can debate all you want how you want to help or hurt the children, but don't be critical of the Democratic leadership in the House. Be critical of this bipartisan agreement on what? The Senate bill. And I have been assured by the majority whip of the majority leader in the Senate that he wanted to go to conference, and it would take 60 votes in order to beat a filibuster even for us to have a conference on the bill or perhaps we could have heard from the ranking member and others that would be appointed to the conference. 
   So the issue today is not how badly really the Republicans in the Senate handled this. They're in charge. They hold us hostage. You need 60 votes. You got a filibuster. So they have now capitulated to this bill that's now before us. And what is your decision? It is either you're going to help the kids or you're not. Either you're going to expand the coverage or you're not. And the President is not going to be in your district if you're lucky, but he doesn't have to explain anything if he vetoes.

   Mr. RANGEL. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you not as a Democrat speaking to Republicans, but as an American who recognizes that if I had to think of one of the most important assets that our country has had, after we talked about our flag, our military, our democracy, I think that we all would agree it's our middle class. They're different from most people. They're not recognized worldwide. They're not the rich. They're not the poor. They're people who struggle every day. But it's their dreams, I think, that make us different from any other country and any other democracy knowing that in this country there is no glass ceiling. 
   And no matter what we accomplish, that we could dream for our kids and for our grandkids, today, through no fault of their own, this dream is being shattered. It's being shattered by the deficits. It's being shattered by war. It's being shattered by losing our kids, losing our jobs, losing our hope, increased price of oil; and people are concerned about where do we go from here. I suggest to you that no one can challenge the fact that this country cannot go any further than our middle class. 
   So it's up to us to find out how do we handle this and how to explain, at a time when they're at most need, not just in terms of dollars and cents but in hopes that this country is going to pull out of this as we have in the past. 
   So what did Mr. McDermott and Congressman English do? They said no matter what happens in this country, whether we win or lose, you can depend on one thing: We will not give up on the American middle class. Now, you could talk about deficits and trust funds, you could talk about PAYGO, you could talk about anything; but you're not going to let this country drown because of technicalities. 
   The middle class is there when we need them. They're there to consume and to buy if they have to. They're there to fight and die in our wars. And now comes an opportunity where we come here together and we say it's not much, we've got to struggle to repair the economic damage, but in the meantime, those of you who have worked every day, those of you who we've not said ``thank you'' to, we're saying that we're going to be there because through no fault of your own, our country has let you down. 
   I yield back for the technical things, but I do hope when we get back home that all of us can say, We didn't do everything that we wanted to, but at the time this bill came up for suspension, we were there for you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Thank you again, Dr. McDermott, Mr. English, and all of those that I know everybody in this House is sensitive to the plight that these unfortunate, hardworking people find themselves. All I can suggest, from a very political point of view, is that at some point when we get home, somebody is going to ask us how did we vote? And as they put together their budgets and try to figure out the rent, the mortgages, the tuition, the gas prices, I just hope that you perfect the arguments of those of you that oppose this bill in such a way that you expect they would understand what the heck you are talking about.

   Mr. RANGEL. The tear that you hear in the voice of the gentleman from Michigan is felt by everybody that knew Guy Vander Jagt. I was with him on Tuesday morning with his beautiful wife Carol, and I would want everybody who knew this man to know that there was a big smile on his face, that wonderful voice of his was resonant, and even though he did not stay lucid for long periods of time, the only thing, the only thing that he talked about was his House of Representatives. 
   I really sincerely hope that those Members, Republican and Democrats, that had an opportunity to see a true Republican with the compassion and sensitivity and understanding that it takes all of us to make this Congress and this country work, that maybe those of us who knew Guy would make some kind of special effort to be tolerant with each other, which is what he was talking about, in hopes that new Members that never had the opportunity to enjoy that type of camaraderie will move in that direction. 
   We will miss him, but those who knew him, we have a constant reminder that when things get rough for us on this floor, there was a guy like Guy Vander Jagt, and as strong as a Republican as he was, that he cared enough about this House to care for all us.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I didn't come down here, my colleagues, to talk about General MacArthur, but I guess I knew of him better than anyone in this room. 
   General MacArthur was called out of Korea. He was the commander of the entire Armed Forces there, and left us in the Second Infantry Division completely surrounded by the Chinese in November of 1950. The last I remember, he was called back by the Commander in Chief, Harry Truman, for defying his direction. So with all due respect to the great late general, this is hardly a time to talk about what soldiers have to do when they defy authority. 
   I want to thank those who have given us an opportunity today to express ourselves under question of life and death. Very few people have this responsibility, yet those here in this House, you didn't get elected to do this, but today you have to decide whether or not you want this war to continue and how many people have to die before it is stopped. 
   You here talk about me supporting a draft, but I challenge anyone to tell me that their feelings about this war in Iraq would not be different if they thought that their loved ones, their family, their community, would be placed in harm's way. 
   Whether you are for or against the war, or no matter how you voted, when you see the casualties mounting up, when you visit the hospitals and see young dedicated people without their skulls, their faces, their legs, their arms, you don't have to know any of these kids to start crying. But if you have children and grandchildren, and your imagination allows you to believe that they would be included in the 21,000, and no matter how many times they go, there has to be a feeling that maybe this is the last chance I have, you have to have a different feeling if you are not dealing with someone else's children. 
   Now, people would say these kids want to fight. I mean, they are different from most kids. They volunteered. They want to do it. 
   It is strange how most of them sought the $40,000, $30,000, $20,000 bonus or sought educational benefits, or don't come from families that are affluent in this country. It is strange that you never heard the President of the United States or the Secretary of Defense ever make a plea to the patriotism of America to say, Give me your young, your able body, give me your patriots, we have a war to fight. You have never heard that. 
   Oh, no, we applaud those who enlisted, but there has never been a plea out there for America to make sacrifices. A country at war, and the President doesn't ask people to sacrifice anything. 
   Well, my son in the Marines got out of the Persian Gulf. He is out, and he too enjoyed the GI Bill. But recently I attended a funeral in my district of a young man who died in Iraq, and I have gone to others, and the family was outside, and they pled with me, please, Congressman, tell them our son was a hero. Please, Congressman Rangel, we thank you that you are here, salute my son, please. 
   I have gone to these funerals before. Most of these young men and women were marines. So I was so used to seeing this blue uniform with the red stripe. The family actually walked me to the coffin, and my knees buckled. Why? Because as sensitive and as passionate I am about the loss of life, instead of seeing a brown-skinned Dominican in a marine outfit, I saw a soldier about 20 years old. I saw a soldier of about 20 years old in an Army uniform, not a Marine uniform. Guess what, he looked just like me. 
   I ask my colleagues to try to figure, if you were involved as an individual, as a kid, or your family was involved, that this great country and this great Constitution has given you the right, right in your hand, to determine who lives and who dies. You cannot make a mistake in supporting this resolution, it is not going to hurt our beloved warriors, it is going to help our country, it is going to help them, and it is going to make us proud one day to be able to say, when asked, What did you do when this was going on in the world, and your Congress was asked? 
   You would be able to say, There was a resolution. It may not have been a profile in courage, but I supported it, and I am proud that I did

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this historic, indeed, piece of legislation, and soon I would ask unanimous consent that you allow me to yield the balance of this time to Mr. Levin, who may not be able to be here the remainder of the night, and then I will come back to manage the rest of the time. 
   But I really want to thank Speaker Pelosi for having the broad understanding that this great Nation of ours cannot afford the luxury of having a Republican or Democratic trade policy. 
   What makes this Nation great is that people perceive us as being a country that will speak when we have any trade agreement, and that when the Democrats took the majority, we certainly did not want a Democratic trade bill. It was so embarrassing to have foreign trade ministers talk to Republicans and talk with the Democrats and saw we're a divided Nation. 
   She authorized those of us to work with the administration to see whether or not we can bring something that sounded as though it was the United States Congress speaking and being directed to allow them to be the delegations and negotiators. 
   I can tell you that JIM MCCRERY played such an important role, along with WALLY HERGER, and of course, I can't say enough about SANDY LEVIN being able to work with me and the staffs for the first time in over a decade. And on this issue, as so many other issues, you could not find a difference as we found the Republican staff and the Democratic staff in working not just during the day but working at night, working with the Peruvians and even going over there with some of us, with Mr. Levin and Ms. Schwartz, went to talk with President Garcia and to see the respect and admiration they had with this great country, that they wanted to show their friendship and to have exchanges and to have us a stronger country.     
   I know that, politically speaking, there are some people that find it very difficult to talk about supporting trade. They made commitments to a lot of people. Therefore, they have to do what they think is best. 
   It's absolutely ridiculous to believe that we can create jobs without trade. If we just are able to consume everything we manufacture, all the food that we grow, and not be able to have markets abroad, then this is not the great Nation that she is or hopes ever to be. So what we are talking about now is what's good for the country. We have to admit that we have done a terrible job in not recognizing the needs of people who have lost their jobs, lost their families, lost their industry, lost their community, lost their pride. 
   Mr. McCrery and I, we think that we have been able to convince the administration, as we go before the Business  Roundtable and say our multinationals can't do just what's good for their shareholders, they have to do what's good for America. And if globalization and technology have hurt some of these communities and destroyed their will to want to be able to say that in this great country they have opportunities for themselves or their children, well, treat us just as good as you treat the developing countries. Bring your ideas, bring the technology and the Ways and Means Committee will provide the incentives to make certain that we can get back, and these communities may not be doing the same thing, but God knows they would be able to do something. 
   Here we have a bill that you don't have to be a trade specialist to know that if people are manufacturing and growing in the United States, and we are dealing with a developing country, and they are not only our friends, but they want to work with us, then we have an opportunity to tear down the trade barriers and to be able to get into their markets as they are able to get into our markets so easily. 
   And so there are those people that cannot vote for it, but I think that because our great Speaker and the Republican leadership allowed Mr. McCrery and I and SANDY and WALLY HERGER to negotiate something, it doesn't mean that every trade agreement is going to be one that everyone can agree to. What it does mean is that in every trade agreement, America's trade policy is going to be a part of it. How do you treat human beings? How do you treat child labor? How do you treat American investors? And how do you treat the environment? That's a great step forward. 
   I would hope, as the Speaker said, that as people are listening to who is calling in, remember the world is calling in. The world is watching how we treat friends, and people all over this country would not want us to believe that we are anti-fair trade and trade that creates jobs. 
   Some people thought I was being personal when I said don't say this trade agreement loses jobs, this is the only place that people are doing anything, growing anything, can work with people who want to do business with us. It's a great, historic opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do hope that people would want to be a part of this changing thing, where once again people would know that when you do business with the people of the United States, you're not doing business with Democrats because we control the House and Senate, and you're not doing business with Republicans, you're doing business with Americans who want to do the best for them, the best for this great country, to improve our quality of life. We can't do it by party, but we can do it by principle. 
   I thank you for this opportunity and I would ask consent to yield the balance of this time to Mr. Levin to be able to control until such time as he has to leave.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Let me thank my friend Mr. Herger for the great work that he has done. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we wrap up this debate, I think that we have had tremendous success in what we have done because, regardless of which way the votes have come, isn't it wonderful, Mr. Herger, that we do have a bill on the floor, that Republicans and Democrats are discussing it, and we broke this barrier that because of party label, people could decide how we felt about something? 
   And I have decided that we have a bigger job to do really than just talk about trade. I really think if the multinationals and the trade ambassadors and the Congress spent more time in feeling the pain of those people who were not the beneficiaries of trade, where people who worked hard for generations and life was always better for their kids and their grandkids, and how depressing it is to see all of that lost and the multinationals not bringing that technology and that innovation to our communities and our towns so that people could get their dignity restored. We have got to do a better job. And whether it's related to trade or whether it's not, when you're out of work and you've lost your dignity, what difference does it make? 
   And when you hear people say that they campaigned against trade, they campaigned against the indifference of our government to care about working people. They were campaigning against the spear because how could you possibly campaign against trade? You can't campaign against trade. You can't say everything we grow and everything that we manufacture, that we don't want someone to buy it. And you can't say that America can be as stable as it is. Somebody's working. Someone's doing well. But the people who campaign against trade are communities of people who are not doing well, and this country has not done well by them. 
   So we have got to make an appeal to the multinationals and to our government that they have to not sell trade where it's working; they have to sell trade where it is not working. Because, realistically, no one could have campaigned against the Peruvian agreement. It hadn't been decided. And if you campaign against trade, it's not realistic. But if you campaigned against making America strong and making certain that when you stamp an agreement, you see dignity in that agreement, you see a care for the environment, a care for workers, and you see a concern for those people who are going to be disadvantaged by that agreement. And if they are disadvantaged by anything even other than the agreement, which, as Mr. McCrery said, when we were told by the United States Trade Representative and she said, Mr. Chairman, you know, a lot of people are complaining about loss of jobs. It has nothing to do with trade. And Mr. McCrery said, What difference does it make? As long as they think it is, it's going to be very difficult to sell the question of trade. 
   So we've got a big job to do. This is only the beginning. And after you have said no, no, no to trade, we have to make certain that those towns come back. And I am not that good at projecting what's going on, but I was telling my dear friend JOE CROWLEY, I bet you that those who feel the strongest against the Peruvian agreement come from communities who have had a lot of economic pain, and those people who even think it was a bad trade agreement if they were doing good, they would allow a Member to make up their mind what they want to do. And so it means that we have got a long way to go but this is truly a beginning. We now have people expressing themselves and asking more from their government to help Americans that deserve better treatment than they have been getting. 
   The only thing that bothered me in the debate is the whole idea that the Speaker of this House and the members, Republican and Democrats, on this committee would bring forth a bill that they thought that Americans would suffer. It's one thing to differ with the contents of the bill; it's another thing to think that we are trying to sell CAFTA or NAFTA or bills that the Speaker has constantly been against. And speaker after speaker after speaker said that realistically if you take a look at Peru, how can it do anything except help us? How can it do anything that we're going to sell to them now, notwithstanding the tariff? Imagine how much more we can sell without the tariff? And when they sell, doesn't it mean that we're making it? If they're buying food, doesn't it mean we're growing it? And doesn't it mean in the communities that have it, we'll be doing well?  
   So let me thank the minority and let me thank the majority. It's been a great debate. Let's get on and say that this Peruvian bill is just the beginning of the cooperation we should expect. 
   Thank you, Mr. Herger. And thank you, the majority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to be extremely brief because I expect to be speaking at a later time on the bill. But I could not resist coming to the floor to protect the integrity of the Speaker and the members of the Ways and Means Committee, both Republican and Democrat. 
   There may be, as a matter of conscience, that people feel that they have to oppose this bill or oppose trade or commitments they have made to other people. But to suggest that the leader of this House and those Republicans and Democrats who worked on the Ways and Means Committee and passed this out with a recorded vote without a vote against it were trying to have Americans lose their jobs here is not only unfounded, but it's unfair. 
   And if anyone really just wants to count the numbers, then ask our farmers, ask our machine people, ask our television or electronic people how much they are going to export to Peru because of the removal of tariffs and how much is coming into this country. 
   So you can be against trade. You can be against the agreement. It may not go far enough. It may not be everything you want. But I think it is wrong and unfair to suggest that we are deliberately trying to have people here, hardworking people, many who have suffered because of loss of jobs, and perhaps it has been because of trade or the indifference of people to invest in these families or in these communities, but this bill does not cause Americans to lose jobs. It's abundantly clear that the balance is on America's side in terms of removal of the tariffs. And for those of you who come from agricultural communities, ask your farmers. For those of you who come from machines that remove communities and mining materials, ask those manufacturers. And ask the people that would create the jobs whether or not it's good for them and good for the community. 
   So you can be against trade. You can be against South America. You can be against anything. But to suggest that those that do support this bill will cause Americans to lose their jobs is untrue and unfair.

   Mr. RANGEL. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this might be anti-climatic. The House, for weeks, and indeed days, in the past hours, have attempted to save the free world from a fiscal disaster. We have bailed out the banks and those who held mortgages. At the same time, we provided for energy extensions, we provided tax breaks for those people that tax provisions have expired. We provided for hurricane relief, for mental health. So over $1 trillion is out there for this House to ease the pain of millions of Americans. 
   While we were dealing with these gigantic powers, we overlooked the fact that over the last 12 months the number of unemployed workers has jumped by over 2 million, leaving 10 million Americans struggling for work. These are not ordinary Americans. These are hardworking people that raise their family with some degree of dignity that have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 
   So the falling sky as relates to the fiscal situation we find today, so many forget that these people do not have the resources to put food on the table; to pay their rent and mortgages; to keep their kids in school; to meet their medical expenses, or even to pay for the increased price of gasoline. 
   One member of the committee and of this Congress, Dr. McDermott, has never let us forget, no matter how big the problem we are trying to do, in terms of looking for alternatives to fossil fuels, he has dedicated his life to make certain that these faceless people who have lost their jobs, that America and this Congress attempt to provide some compensation. 
   We can't return their dignity. In many cases, we can't return their homes. But we can help. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to yield the remainder of my time to Dr. Congressman McDermott to see fit how he yields the remainder of time assigned to us for this purpose.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, today is a historic day in the United States Congress as the President has called on us to meet the challenge of the failure of the mortgage market, and our failure to do that would not only cause a crisis in the United States but throughout the world.     
   Seven hundred billion dollars we've asked to expose the taxpayers to from an administration that all I've heard in the last 8 years is that we have to keep government out of the free market, that government and regulations would strangle our economy. 
   And the fact is that in such a short period of time, had it not been for Barney Frank and people on the other side of the aisle in trying to do the best we can, we leave here with a heavy conscience that if we do nothing then the sacrifice will be felt by employees, their thrift accounts, their savings accounts, and small businesses. 
   So, in a sense, we have a political gun at our heads that we can't afford to say that we know better, and so most of us have agreed that Secretary Paulson and economists have given us fair warning. 
   Now, that's enough and it's complicated enough, but then we have had the threat of tax bills that expire at the end of the year. Companies that have relied on tax credits, individuals who relied on it, expire. And four times we sent energy bills to the other body, and four times they've ignored it. 
   Included in these bills, of course, has always been disaster relief, and all of us believe these people should get it; mental health parity, which God knows all of us that have any sensitivity recognize that this inequity has to be taken care of; and of course, the alternative minimum tax, that no Member in this House or the other body can ever explain to taxpayers why this over $60 billion burden should fall on their shoulders because the Congress didn't think far enough ahead in order to adjust this tax for inflation. 
   And so in a sense, Madam Speaker, we're being told that the burden would fall on 25 million people by the Senate, by our constituents and the country and entire world, by the administration if we don't have this $700 billion rescue bill. And I just hope and pray that sometime historically we might be able to regain the power that we used to have in the House, introduce bills, have hearings, and fully understand what we're doing rather than having to yield to the threat of disaster, whether it's fiscal or whether it's tax liability. 
   I see John Tanner walking on the floor, and I do want to say that he's an outstanding member of our committee. He's been talking about the deficit for a long time, and his contribution to this package, I'd like to point out, has made him a proud member of our committee and the Congress. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. I had no idea that we would be coming back here and I would have this opportunity, but for some of us being Members of Congress, and especially members of the Ways and Means Committee, it has been a special privilege. 
   This historic committee, however, has had its ups and downs with partisanship, the likes of which we had not seen on the committee or in the House of Representatives. 
   I hardly knew Jim McCrery during the years he was on the committee because the other side was dominated by one personality, but as soon as things changed and I had the opportunity to meet and talk with him as the ranking member, I not only found a scholar and a gentleman, but I found someone who loved his country and Congress more than he loved the partisanship. 
   It wasn't as though we have been able to resolve many of the crises that exist in our committee, but the one thing that he did do, and it will continue after he leaves us, is to create a climate where we had a degree of respect for each other and especially when we needed that respect, when we disagree and our parties disagree. 
   His legacy, even though he leaves, will continue to know that in this House no matter how frank we are politically, we still can be civil. We still can get things done, and even when we're not successful, we can work in such a manner that other people following us would know that we can disagree without being disagreeable. 
   So, Jim, I speak for all of the Democrats on the committee, for the tone, for your congeniality, for your humor, for the wisdom that you contributed, and I know that it's been awkward for your party and mine at times to do the things that we wanted to do. We started off dealing with the Secretary Treasurer and we promised him we'd do the world. Unfortunately, we didn't check with our leadership on a lot of things that we thought we could do. 
   But we will continue to do that, and I do hope that the lessons that you taught so many of us will continue long after you're gone.  
   Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee, who's worked hard on the overall bill before us today, Chairman Pete Stark from California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to support the naming of this post office on 125th Street after Percy Ellis Sutton. 
   Madam Speaker, 125th Street is the economic corridor of the village of Harlem. It is the exciting comeback of a community that is enjoying the creation of jobs through the Empowerment Zone. But it is also where our former President, Bill Clinton, has his offices and also one of the institutions that is driving it, the Apollo Theater. It is there because Percy Sutton brought it back from the ashes. So when tourists come and they see this wonderful new community that has come back, they will be able to look at our post office and maybe ask the question, but who was Percy Sutton? 
   Not too long ago, the President of the United States, George Bush, right here in the Capitol, gave the President's Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen. My brothers and sisters, every day that we are fortunate enough to live in this great country, we fail to realize that we are making history, especially those of us who are honored to be elected. 
   As the House and Senate head toward getting the bill approved, with the help of Senator Levin on the other side, the President spoke to these people that sometime in 1941, black and as African American as they were, were denied the opportunity to join the United States Army Air Force in order to fight the enemies of the United States of America. 
   Under great protest, they were allowed to try a pilot project in Tuskegee in order to see whether the outrageous charges that they were cowardly, that they couldn't learn, and they never would be able to manipulate these fighter pilots were true. And while they shattered all of the myths and turned out to be one of the most decorated outfits that survived World War II, the President, as he looked at them right here in Statuary Hall, reminded them that he knew that even though they became officers, that many of the enlisted men refused to return the salutes to them because of prejudice, racism and discrimination. 
   But the President said that, on behalf of the people of the United States of America, allow him to salute them. It was so moving. There wasn't a dry eye in the whole group as these warriors, these courageous fighter pilots that have done so much for this country, were able to hear the present Commander in Chief and President of the United States thank them. 
   So, in a way we are privileged by naming this post office not to be able to thank each and every one of the Tuskegee Airmen, but to thank at least one of them that comes from the village of Harlem, that you would say that our ``thank you'' may not be a salute from the Commander in Chief, but we are saying thank you for having confidence in this country and having confidence in this democracy and giving us a chance to honor Percy Sutton. 
   He came back home, got involved in the NAACP, got involved in politics, became an assemblyman, became a borough president and became a well-known business person. But no matter what part of the United States you come from, we have to take time out to thank those of us who made the sacrifice, and Percy Sutton is one of them. 
   So I am glad that this committee has come together to pay tribute to him, because by doing this, we pay tribute to ourselves and for those people who we don't know their names but have made sacrifices, so that we could have the honor to serve this great country.

I express sincere thanks to Chairman HENRY WAXMAN and Ranking Member and Member TOM DAVIS of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as well as Chairman DANNY DAVIS and Ranking Member KENNY MERCHANT of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce Postal Service, and District of Columbia for their support of this bill. It is appropriate to designate the post office in Mr. Sutton's honor because he worked at a New York post office as a clerk while attending law school. 
   Percy Sutton, my very dear friend, was born the youngest of fifteen children on November 24, 1920 in San Antonio, Texas. His family owned land, a farm, and a funeral home. His entrepreneurial spirit was developed while working for the family businesses as a youngster. He was educated at Prairie View A & M University, Tuskegee Institute, Hampton University, and Brooklyn College Law School.  
   His career as a public servant began in 1941, when he was selected to work in Army Intelligence during World War II as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. Just prior to that selection, he was not allowed to fly fighter planes for the Army Air Corps because of racial discrimination. Despite being subjected to racial discrimination, he was committed to serve his country. 
   After an honorable discharge from the Army, he decided to study law. To support himself while attending law school, he worked for the United States Post Office in New York as a clerk during the evening shift and later as a conductor in the New York City subway system. He maintained this schedule for 3 years. His dedication to finish law school still inspires me today. 
   Motivated to fight racial discrimination, he represented the controversial revolutionary Malcolm X and other activists during the civil rights era. He also served as president of the New York chapter of the NAACP. His commitment to fight for justice and equality for African Americans was bold and admirable. 
   A strong interest in politics led him to campaign for the New York State Assembly several times. Finally, in 1964, he was elected and served for two years. Immediately thereafter he became the president for the Borough of Manhattan and remained in that role until 1977. 
   As an entrepreneur, his love of business and his Harlem community led him to purchase and totally revitalize the legendary Apollo Theatre in 1980. As the Harlem business district has flourished, the Apollo Theatre remains a community landmark and symbol. Another successful business venture he created is the Inner City Broadcasting Company, which housed the first African American owned radio station in New York. Today, there are nineteen radio stations in the Inner City network. 
   On March 29, 2007, I had the honor and privilege to see Percy Sutton honored with the Congressional Gold Medal along with over 300 other Tuskegee Airmen. It was a great day to see him and other African American veterans finally get the recognition that was so long overdue. 
   Percy Sutton is a great American and living legend. I'm certain America is a better place because of his contributions. Designating the post office building in Harlem is a great way to keep his legend alive for years to come. Since he is 86 years old and his health is fragile, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank my New York delegation colleagues for cosponsoring this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us has been passed before, and they call it the HEART bill, Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008. I would prefer to call it the ``Thank You'' bill. Thank you for the tens of thousands of American men and women who have come to America's call to fight this war and to place themselves at risk because our Commander in Chief and our Nation have called them. 
   It is very difficult for me to think of any people that we should be saying ``thank you'' more to than this group, who are not Democrats and Republicans, are not politicians, but people whom America has depended on since its very beginning, and, that is, people who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice because their country asked them to do it. 
   We have recently passed a bill which is the equivalent, if not expanded, the GI Bill, so that those that do get back, many of them without limbs, many of them without jobs, would be able to get a decent education. This kind of enhances the ability for them to get their pensions, to get homes, and to remove the impediments that these brave people deserve. And one of the things that we're proudest of is that we have removed some type of impediment that will allow our fighting soldiers to be able to get the benefits of some of our tax laws even though they have married immigrants. So it is something that I am certain that everyone in this House and most all Americans would be supporting. 
   What a great honor it is for me to yield the balance of my time in support of this bill to Admiral Joe Sestak from the Seventh District of Pennsylvania. It's so easy for all of us to talk about sacrifices and so seldom that we find someone who has dedicated 31 years of his very young life for the defense of this great Nation of ours. 
   He has been the commander of an aircraft carrier of 30 U.S. and allied ships, over 15,000 sailors, 100 aircrafts; and this is only part of what the three-star Admiral in the United States Navy has done. How lucky we are in this Nation and, more specifically, in this Congress to have this distinguished Member speak in support of this bill, one who probably knows more about the needs of our service people than most of us ever hope to find out. 
   So with the Speaker's permission and unanimous consent of this body, I ask you to allow me to yield the balance of my time for purposes of picking other speakers to Congressman/Representative/Admiral Joe Sestak of the Seventh District of Pennsylvania.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, today, we may each have our own convictions about this war, and no matter what those may be, I think I can safely say that we stand united in our support for our troops and their families. 
   No one here today can challenge the commitment, the dedication, or the bravery of our men and women who have responded to this national call. 
   They have made sacrifices that very few Americans have ever been called on to make--many have paid with their lives, and many others with the loss of limbs and mental injuries we will never be able to comprehend. 
   We all know the great value of education benefits for our military. I wil1. continue to fight for an increase that exceeds what our President has requested in GI education benefits and in military pay for our sons and daughters who serve in the military. Our men and women need it and they have earned every bit of it, and more. 
   The bill being considered today cannot make up for the debt we owe to these men and women and their families. We cannot make up for the loss of life and limb and the mental anguish they will endure. 
   But today, we will play a small positive role that I know is supported by every Member of this body. Today, we will vote to pass a small token of our gratitude--a small step in the right direction. 
   This bill is expected to be taken up by the Senate after we pass it here today and sent to the President this week. This is very fitting as we leave to celebrate Memorial Day--a day of remembrance for all who sacrificed in war for our country. 
   There is a provision in this bill that has been added since we passed the bill last year. The  provision would ensure that a member of the military, who is married to an immigrant spouse would qualify for the stimulus rebate payment even if such spouse does not yet have a Social Security number. 
   This fix was necessary because in the zeal to impose anti-immigrant philosophy, language was added to the legislation for the stimulus rebate payments which now has a negative effect on some of our military and their families, even as they are off fighting a war. 
   This should serve as a great lesson in caution and being circumspect before we allow our deep-seated feelings to get the best of us. 
   We must learn from these lessons even as we fight to improve the lives of those who fight for our country through improved GI education benefits, pay increase, better health care services, and increased disability benefits. 
   This bill has been a labor of love. We passed a very similar bill (H.R. 3997) 410-0 on December 18, 2009, and had hoped to get it signed into law before the end of last year. Yet, despite the total bipartisan nature of this bill, we were unable to get it to the President's desk before the end of December, 2007. So, here we are again. Persistent to the end. 
   This bill is small but means a lot to many people. The Committee has received more calls on this bill than we could have imagined. People are calling to find out when the bill will become law. 
   Today gives us fresh hope--it looks like we will actually do it this time. I am proud to be a part of this small but important effort for our military men and women and their families who continue to give so much to our country.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Before I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to our distinguished subcommittee chairman for Trade, Mr. Levin, I first want to thank Mr. McCrery for helping to set the stage for at least the Ways and Means Committee to vote unanimously for the free trade agreement with Peru. This was a record vote, this was a historic vote, and we had every vote on the committee. 
   I raise that at this time not to curry favor with the Republicans to support this historic piece of legislation before us, but because I know from Mr. McCrery's input and contribution, he recognizes that trade no longer has to be seen as something that is negative to American workers. 
   Good trade agreements that create jobs should be allowed a vote and not be hurried so that Members are not impeded from the policy and really have an opportunity to study the substance. Without his cooperation and that of the United States Trade Representative and Secretary Treasurer, we would not even have the opportunity to look forward to the bipartisan victory we had in the committee and look forward to on the floor. 
   A part of that agreement, however, was he and I sharing that when people are without work, without jobs, without hope, when communities are adversely affected because of trade, that our government and our multinationals have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but to do all that they can to ease the pain, to encourage investment, and to have a climate, whether it is globalization or technology, to know that trade is not always the villain. 
   And to the extent we are able to improve on many of the things that we have in this bill before us, we do hope that the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act will be just the beginning. That whether it is trade or not, we have a responsibility to the dignity of American workers and their children so that in this great country they can aspire to be working and to have the respect that all Americans would want in terms of being producers. 
   So to the extent that we had the cooperation of Mr. McCrery in creating the climate, and fully appreciating that we had input from Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee, even though we didn't ask for their votes and accept their amendments, it is this climate that makes our country so great, that makes this Congress so great, and makes me proud to be the Chair and a member of the Ways and Means Committee.  
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   We come here today at a crossroads of sorts. 
   In recent years, trade policy has been a dividing force, used as a political tool to advance ideologies, rather than a shared sense of purpose that our trade agreements and programs could reflect the broader goals of the American worker. 
   The legislation before us today offers an opportunity to change that. 
   In the early months of this Congress, I joined with the Speaker and the House leadership to remind the Administration that the Constitution specifically designates Congress as the branch of government responsible for international commerce. 
   We agreed that we took that responsibility seriously and we would use our majority to improve American trade policy to better reflect the needs and concerns of our workers, not just our large, multi-national corporations. 
   The legislation before us today is the next step in developing a new trade policy that more adequately addresses the growing perception that trade is not working for American workers. 
   The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007 would expand training and benefits for workers while also helping to encourage investment in communities that have lost jobs to increased trade--particularly in our manufacturing sector. 
   The growing perception that prior American trade policy ignored the needs of workers here and abroad is a large contributing factor to the declining public support for trade. 
   For years we have had a program in place--trade adjustment assistance, or TAA--that was supposed to tackle some of the issues and problems workers face as it relates to trade. 
   Despite the best of intentions, this program did not meet expectations or promises and has failed to keep pace with globalization. 
   We are here to change that today with the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   The bill before us today is a comprehensive policy expanding opportunities for American  workers, industries, and communities to prepare for and overcome the challenges created by expanded trade. 
   First, the bill significantly expands existing TAA for Workers by: 1) covering service workers and additional manufacturing workers; 2) increasing TAA benefits; 3) making the TAA wage insurance program permanent; 4) improving the TAA health care benefit; and 5) increasing TAA program funding. 
   Second, the bill includes a package of tax incentives to encourage investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs. 
   Third, recognizing that unemployment insurance (UI) is the gateway to TAA, the bill reforms the unemployment insurance system by creating incentives for States to cover part-time, low-wage, and other workers under State UI laws. 
   America's ability to compete and win in a global economy is too critical for our trade policy to continue being a partisan issue. 
   I noticed with great displeasure yesterday's veto threat from the Administration on this bill. To that statement, I would say that the bill before us today passed the Ways and Means Committee with Democratic and Republican support--and I expect it will receive the same from the full House. 
   The issues contained in this bill are central to the ongoing debate over the Administration's trade policy and if this Administration wishes to address the growing public concern over the direction of its trade policy, it will reconsider this veto threat. 
   Globalization is here to stay--and we must band together as Democrats and Republicans to shape its benefits for all Americans. 
   I look forward to today's discussion and I urge you to support H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.  
   At this time I would like unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, who has played such an important role in creating that climate and working with the staff and the members on the other side.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, this is a serious issue for those of us in government. I don't know where the advocates of reduced government really are today.     
   The marketplace should work as well, and now we're asking the government to come in with close to $1 trillion in order to bail out the private sector. 
   The administration has come up with a proposal that, to me, reminds me of roulette, and they're challenging us to just take the bullets. As Chairman Frank has said so often, this is a no-win proposition because, in support of this--and I will be supporting it--no one is going to thank us for what they don't know and how serious it is, but I do know one thing, that those who have caused the problem somehow have managed to get away without any blame, without any penalty, and the crisis now falls on the American people. 
   Well, for some people, it will be just an inconvenience. They'll sell a couple of houses; they'll get rid of some of their stocks, and they'll continue to game the system, but for the poor, they won't have these options since we live in a country and, indeed, in a world that is dependent on credit. So the poor will not be inconvenienced, but irreparable harm could be done to the dreams that it took so long for the middle income to achieve to be able to own a home, to be able to send their kids to college, to be able to put food on the table, to clothe them, and to have the respect that the middle class in America has stood for for so long. 
   We have seen in recent months that this class of people has had their dreams dampened by the increase in gasoline prices, in health costs, in education to such an extent that the government just gave them a handout with $1,000 here and there to try to restore their dignity. Obviously, that didn't work. How is it that we couldn't find money to give them jobs? to create a fair and equitable tax system? to increase education? to increase health? to make certain that our infrastructure was conducive of America's being competitive? No, it costs too much money. 
   Somehow, the conservatives in the other party can find an exposure to American taxpayers for close to $1 trillion, and not too long ago it was just another $300 billion. For war and for these types of things, we can always find the money, but to make certain that the underclass--the poor folks--and the middle class are able to get an investment in America and into their lives so that they can become more prosperous and can enjoy the dreams of America, we can't seem to find it. 
   So now we have the Secretary of the Treasury. We don't know where he goes after December, and we will forever have to staple him to whatever excuses we give for being frightened to death that he just might be right. It is wrong to do this to a country. It is wrong to do this to the Congress, but it just seems to me that I can't afford to take the risk. 
   I support the work of Barney Frank and of all those who work diligently to try to make certain that we don't allow the sky to fall on American's middle class and poor folks.

   Mr. RANGEL. I don't think there is anything that you have said in support of rural schools that I do not believe in and that I am not willing to support. 
   I just want to make it abundantly clear that the issue that has caused this logjam with the Senate has nothing to do with the causes that you advocate and I support. There is only one issue that has not brought us here, and that is the issue of whether or not we pay for the extenders or don't pay for the extenders. 
   It seems like an issue, when we are asked to come up with $700 billion, that should not really concern us that much. But the truth of the matter is, they have sent the bill over here.

   Mr. RANGEL. The only real big issue is that they have sent over a 2-year extension, but it's paid for only 1 year. The position that has been taken by the majority in the House is that instead of 2 years, we are prepared to accept the extender package, as is, except that we will reduce it to 1 year so there would be no years unpaid for, or, in the alternative, and I spoke just yesterday with Senator Grassley, we are prepared to pay for the 2 years. 
   There is a difference, they claim over there, and I have no reason to disagree with them, that if we do anything on the House side, exercise any prerogative in the payment of this, they cannot hold on to their 60 votes. 
   I want the gentleman to know that I only wish that rural schools would be the only issue, because it could be resolved. It is not the issue. It is only the issue that I stated with you, and I have shared this with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and have shared it with our Speaker. 
   That is the issue that is holding up the passage. So we will send another bill back over there.

   Mr. RANGEL. I am telling you that the issues that we have and concerns with the credibility of funding tax decreases is one that exists, but probably between our parties, and we have division in the House. But we would like to believe that in the House of Representatives that we initiate taxes and just sometimes, just sometimes the other body has to yield to our requests. 
   Four times we sent it over, four times we tried to negotiate. Even yesterday I was talking and trying to see whether we could work out something. 
   There are times when the integrity of the House is important in order to recognize that we have to get things done, but we have to also maintain some principles. We are at that point now. 
   I don't know how long it's going to take, but I just came to the floor, when I heard your eloquent argument, which hardly anyone can dispute, to make it clear that if you are a Republican or a Democrat, and you want to help, if you are in business, and you are concerned about the extension of benefits that workers and companies need, if you are concerned about the energy crisis, and you want to do something, that we are going to keep sending packages. If we had someone as eloquent as you on the other side saying let's get something done this year, we wouldn't have this problem. 
   So when it gets down to it, who is going to yield? Well, we have, again and again and again and again. 
   As proud as I am of being a Member of Congress and chairman of this committee, it has to stop somewhere where the other body knows that they are just one body of the Congress. They just can't say that they can't get anything done. 
   But once they do come together, then it means that we don't have anything to say about anything as to what gets in their package.

   Mr. RANGEL. Thank you so much, a distinguished member of our committee, and I've heard your eloquent plea on behalf of education for our rural children. And whether they're in inner cities or rural areas, in order for this country to be productive, in order for this country to make certain that we can compete, we've got to improve the quality of education. 
   Now, people are talking about the other body's bill as though we have it. They're holding up that bill at the desk. They won't bring that bill over here. All we're trying to do is to say, don't hold back the incentives that we have for businesses to continue what they're doing in order to get energy. 
   Now, I can give some assurances too. We have to think, not as Democrats and Republicans, but we have to think about having the House of Representatives respected, and to believe that in the House of Representatives, the people govern. 
   And I can assure you, if we can break down that gridlock as relates to who's going to be responsible and pay for these incentives, I have no problems, even though that bill does not have jurisdiction in my committee, as the chairman in accepting that, because I know how important it is. 
   But if you weaken us, they come over here, and you believe that they're right because they have 90 votes? Well, God knows that we can work out something with Republicans and have our way on everything as long as we say you're going to get what you want. That's not the way we think that we should legislate. 
   You have a good issue. We accept the issue. We can work with the issue. And we can do it in the other body's bill. That other body's bill has not been sent over here, for political purposes, in order to believe that at the last minute there's going to be a cave-in.

Just because it has no germaneness in the Senate does not prevent me, in conference, from accepting it. But I can't help to make your amendment germane on a bill that has nothing to do with rural education, no matter how deep the commitment. 
   All I can promise you, if we showed the solidarity in sending our bill over there as they clearly have in sending their bill over here, I can assure you in conference, if it's in their bill I will be able to support it.

   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, before I get into the substance of this important legislation, let me make it abundantly clear that in my opinion, there is nobody in this House that is not concerned with the direction in which this country has gone in the past in relying on fossil fuels. 
   In addition to that, we, all being patriots, do recognize that probably everyone in this Chamber agrees that many of the important tax provisions should not expire because business can lose confidence in the system and certainly in the Congress. People should be allowed to rely on what we say will be tax incentives, and probably most of us believe that these incentives should even be permanent, rather than 1 or 2 years, but at least they should not be allowed to expire. 
   Unfortunately, there is a cloud of politics that remains over our shoulders and the other body. 
   I just heard that the arrogance of the other body has said that notwithstanding what we do here today, that they would not even receive the legislation because they put a time on us. I don't care whether you are Republican or Democrat. It is shameful that the other House can hold us in such complete disregard that they can dictate what they are not going to look at. 
   On the other side, instead of referring to them as the majority and minority, or Republicans and Democrats, I am inclined to believe that they are the gang of 60 that determine what the law is going to be, notwithstanding the intent of the House where the people are supposed to govern. I do hope that somewhere along the line, no matter what our major policy differences might be, that our leadership can get together to let the other body know that it is a two-body Congress, and that this eagle has to work with two wings instead of one. 
   Another political issue is this: I was shocked and amazed yesterday that when the rule came up, most all of the debate from the minority was the protection and support of our rural schools. We should not have been arguing or debating each other, because education of our young people, whether they come from urban, inner cities or rural areas, is not just important to that community, but really is important to the United States of America, who must compete with the rest of the world. 
   If we don't have the ability to give access to a decent education for our young people, no matter what great part of our country they come from, then we lose our competitive edge. None of our competitors care whether or not our workforce is black or white, Jew or gentile, rural or in the city. We have to come together as a Nation and recognize that our failure to produce educated people is not a local and State issue, but our support for it is to protect our national security. There is a way that we could do that and not have it divert attention from the important issues that are in this bill. 
   Where is this rural support bill? Is it in our bill? Did we initiate it in the House? Has anyone in the minority ever asked that it be included in an energy bill or tax extension? No. Why? Because we've got rules over there. 
   But they don't have rules on the other side, so they put it in the bill. I have told my colleagues on the Ways  and Means Committee, I got their support, the Democratic Caucus, and even made an appeal yesterday. If you are really serious about it, we can't put it in our bill here today, but it's in their bill, and we are willing to accept it. What is it about accepting the rural area bill that you guys and gals don't understand? 
   But how can we accept it? The only way we can is that if they take the Senate-passed bill and send it over here. So you can talk all you want about your dedication to education, albeit rural or urban. But if you really are sincere about it, the only vehicle that you have for it is to get that bill over here, and my leaders and my committee have given assurance, bring the bill over, and we will accept it. 
   Why won't they send it over? Because of lack of respect of the House of Representatives. They are holding it at the desk thinking, in the middle of the night, when we have to go home, it's their way or the highway. I do hope we have some pride in our legislative initiatives that we find out our differences. But at the end of the day when the House speaks, they don't have to accept it, but they shouldn't have the arrogance of saying that they are not even going to look at it. 
   Having said that, here we go again, with the whole Nation looking at us, wondering do we have any concern about the energy crisis that we find ourselves in. The gasoline price at the pump causes everyone to consider what is it going to be for rent, what is it going to be for mortgages, what is it going to be for food, what is it going to be to put clothes on the kids, because we find ourselves in this energy crunch, and God knows how long it's going to take. 
   The only thing that we can do, as representatives of the American people, is to say how long, how long, and we're doing something about it. It even affects our national security to believe that we are so dependent on countries that we don't even believe in their form of government, but yet we send them money each and every day, each and every year, to consume the oil that they have. 
   We have put together the bill that just makes a lot of common sense. No one has challenged our bill on the merits. Sure you can talk about drill, drill, drill. Do what you have to do politically. But let's get back to what we can do realistically. 
   It may take some time. It's not going to bring changes tomorrow, but we will be able to tell our kids and our grandkids that we looked for alternatives, wind, solar, water, anything that's possible. We provide these incentives. We can create a whole new industry in search of some answers to the crisis. We are talking about creating jobs, creating ideas, creating thoughts. 
   We can't do it as Democrats or Republicans. We have to do it as a Congress. They have accepted all of these things on the other side. We can get together and save the future of our country if we ever got together as one Congress instead of two bodies. 
   We also have in our bill a commitment that we have made to provide incentives for research and development; for States that don't have income taxes, but we can have them to be able to deduct their local and State taxes for Federal tax purposes; for teachers who dedicate themselves each and every day to help the kids to give them a little help in doing it. 
   The business sector, the social sector, are depending on us that when we have a law, that we just don't leave it saying it expired because we have differences of politics on the other side. We have done everything that we could to take anything controversial out of this bill, whether it's helping the people that have suffered as a result of a terrorist attack against New York, whether it's providing some protection for people that may work in energy to make certain that they get a decent wage, whether we give lawyers an opportunity to operate their accounting system the same way other professionals do. If it was controversial, we said, We'll drop it. Let's see how we can meet across the aisle. 
   But if the whole debate is going to be about rural schools, we can take care of that in the Speaker's corridor and not waste the people's time in debate. If the whole thing is going to be whether or not we are going to be fiscally responsible and pay for 2 years of the extension of these things, we will let the people and the business people decide which side is right, whether we are going to increase the indebtedness to our children or grandchildren, or whether at a time when the Federal Government is asking us to provide $700 billion of tax exposure, can we say that where we could control, we did try to control. 
   That's the major difference between the other side and us. Do we pay for 1 year of the extensions, or do we really just lock horns and not do anything? This is the option. This is the last time this year. I hope we can jump over the hurdles of politics and get something done. 
   For more specifics to the bill, our distinguished chairman of the committee that has studied this, the one that has done the taxes, the one that has done the taxes for energy, is going to take over. 
   But you know as well as I do, people on the committee and people not, that what we are saying and advocating makes sense. The only difference between passing a bill and getting the President to sign it is politics. I truly believe, or at least I want to believe, that we can get over that too. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to Richard Neal, a distinguished Member from Massachusetts, an outstanding member of the Ways and Means Committee, a great American and a great Member of Congress.

   Mr. RANGEL. We don't have a lot of speakers. That's why I asked the gentleman to yield. 
   Madam Speaker, assuming that the majority was persuaded by the eloquence of the gentleman from Michigan and we wanted to embrace the bill that 60 Members in the other House had, and assuming further that we wanted to help the rural schools which is in that bill, the gentleman knows that we can't react on bills that they have passed over there until they send it over here. 
   So we shouldn't allow the other House to interfere with the process that we have. We don't need a whole lot of harmony. We have different constituents and different policies. It is okay to say their way or the highway, and the minority may say that is the  way they want to go. But even if we yield to that, if we said that 60 votes over there are far more important than 435 votes over here, how could we possibly do anything until they send it over here?

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, an increase in the minimum wage. It has now been a decade (i.e., 1996) since the minimum wage was last adjusted for inflation. The issue absorbed a considerable amount of attention during the 109th Congress--but no new legislation was adopted. Over 25 states (including the District of Columbia) have adopted a minimum wage in excess of the federal rate. 
   The current Federal minimum wage rate leaves full-time workers in poverty. Thirty-seven million Americans live in poverty today--an increase of 5.4 million since 2001. Many of these individuals are full-time, full-year hard working Americans who are unable to lift themselves out of poverty because of the declining value of the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage earners working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year make $10,712--nearly $6,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
   Today, the value of minimum wage as a percentage of poverty has fallen to its lowest level on record--going way back to 1959. Earnings for full-year, full-time minimum wage work now equal less than 70 percent of the poverty level for a family of three. 
   Increasing the federal minimum wage would also raise the wages of low-income working families in general, not just those who fall below the official poverty line. Many families move in and out of poverty, and near-poor families are also important beneficiaries of minimum wage increases. In addition, raising the minimum wage will have a positive effect on lives of women and other minorities in this country. 
   Over one-half of workers paid less than $7.25 an hour lived in families with incomes of $40,000 or less. According to CRS estimates of low-wage workers in families with incomes of $40,000 or less were spouses in married-couple families (with or without children). Some 13.4 percent were single parents. Another 11.9 percent were teenagers. Hourly workers who earned less than $7.25 an hour in 2005 were more likely to live in poor families compared to workers paid at least $7.25 an hour (18.1 percent versus 6.0 percent). 
   Women were overrepresented among low-wage workers in 2005: almost 7 million of the more than 11 million hourly workers who  earned under $7.25 an hour were women (60.1 percent); in contrast, women accounted for a smaller share of all hourly workers (50.2%). Further, Hispanic women were two times as likely as Hispanic men to earn $5.15 per hour or less. 
   It also appears that relatively more working women than men might gain from a higher federal minimum wage. An increase in the minimum wage would greatly benefit about 33 percent of African-American or Hispanic women. 
   Over the last five years, the number of African Americans living in poverty has grown by 1.5 million, and the real median household income of African American families is down $2,676. Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would affect more than 2.1 million hardworking African Americans in the minimum wage. 
   Over the last five years, the number of Hispanic Americans living in poverty has grown by more than 1.6 million and the real median household income of Hispanic American families is down $1,631. Over 2.3 million out of 12.5 million Hispanics employed on an hourly basis--or almost one in five earned less than $7.25 an hour in 2005. Hispanics comprised the largest share of workers paid below $7.25 an hour than they did of all hourly workers in 2005. Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would have a positive effect on the lives of more than 2.3 million hardworking Hispanic Americans. 
   Over the last five years, the number of Asian American/Pacific Islanders living in poverty has grown by 243,000 and the real median household income of Asian American/Pacific Islander families is down $2,157. Lifting the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would have a positive effect on the lives of an estimated 280,000 hardworking Asian American workers. 
   Over one-half of hourly workers paid below the proposed federal minimum wage were between 16 and 24 years old. A substantial percentage of young workers might be affected directly if the minimum wage increases. Nearly three out of five teenagers paid an hourly wage might see their earnings increase if the federal standard goes to $7.25 per hour. 
   We must do more to support families living in poverty and those who are vulnerable to falling into poverty. Increasing the wages is an important step toward reducing the high levels of poverty in this nation.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of 2776, the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Tax Act. 
   Our committee has provided long-term incentives for electricity for renewable sources, production from wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, river currents, ocean tides, landfill gas and tracks combustion resources. And at the same time, we were able to provide incentives for States to provide bonds and grants in order to make certain that working families would be able to purchase energy-efficient heat pumps, home improvement appliances, solar, and a variety of other things. 
   And in order to pay for this, at the recommendation of the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to raise the funds to close the loopholes to make certain that at the end of the day the bill is revenue-neutral. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent at this time that the remainder of my time I be able to yield to Mr. McDermott on the committee, who has provided a lot of work on this subject and which we're so proud to present to this House and ultimately to the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, some time ago, in an effort to make certain that 159 taxpayers who are very wealthy had some tax liability, the Congress at that time passed the alternative minimum tax. What they neglected to do was to index the tax structure for inflation, and as a result we find people making 30, 40, $50,000 caught up as though they were wealthy taxpayers trying to avoid or evade their tax liability. 
   Now, the President should know, as other Presidents, that this is a very, very unfair tax. The truth of the matter is it should not even be in this structure. But in the close to 7 years that the President has been in office, he has not seen fit to give us a tax reform bill so that we can do what everyone in this House would want done, and that is to eliminate this fiscal threat from now some 25 million taxpayers. 
   So what do we have to do? Every year we have to come down and so-called ``patch it'' because, politically speaking, no one is going to go home and say that they did nothing about it. 
   So what is the difference between what we want to do in the majority and the other side? Well, if you listen carefully, you would see that the President has put this AMT in every budget except the one we have this year, which means that in the budget he never intends to remove it or have it removed. What does putting it in the budget mean? It means that you expect the money that would be coming from the alternative minimum tax to be there to spend. I can understand that, except that Congress says that we're not going to collect that money. So what we would believe is that if we're taking $61 billion out of the economy that we shouldn't go to China and Japan and ask them once again to bail us out but we should take a look at the Tax Code and to find out just what things in the Tax Code, what preferential treatment, what loopholes are there so that when we repair the AMT, at least for this year, we will be able to say we didn't borrow the money and we didn't put this burden on our children and our grandchildren. 
   So the four areas that we concentrated on to raise the money to get this bill passed is the carried interest. What is that? All it says is that if two groups of people, one a corporation and the other a partnership, are managing someone else's money and if, indeed, they don't put their own money in it, that the tax rate should be 35 percent. Somehow a group has manipulated the system, made themselves a partnership, said they didn't put in their own money, but they still consider it a capital investment, and they are now taxed at the rate of 15 percent. We think it's unequal, it's wrong, and we correct it. 
   The other area that we have a concern about is people who use tax havens for money earned in the United States to avoid taxes. They put it overseas. In the area of credit cards, we have the major credit card holders that reimburse vendors, and all we ask the vendors to do is to report the money they've had for reimbursement. And then, of course, we have our oil industry that received tax credits that they were not entitled to, and certainly at the obscene profits they're making, I hate to believe that someone believes that the government should further subsidize the moneys that they're making. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it's going to be interesting to see how the other side explains as to why they don't have to pay for this. Certainly, if indeed we do nothing, $61 billion of tax burden is going to fall on 25 million good American taxpayers, and we want to fill that  gap of the $61 billion. The other side says it doesn't exist, and so I can't wait to sit down so I can listen to their very interesting argument. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. Certainly, the gentleman from Louisiana knows that we would be willing to work on the charitable deduction as it relates to the changes that were made by the administration, but basically, what he is saying is that, as to the $61 billion in tax  loopholes that we have raised, they would rather borrow the money than fill the gap that relieving the people of this tax burden would have. 
   So we both agree that 25 million people shouldn't suffer with this $61 billion tax increase, but he would have you believe that, if you take this out, you wouldn't have to put anything in. Well, what you're putting in is the future of our children and of our grandchildren. 
   I ask that this motion to recommit be rejected. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, these words that I speak today do not come easily. They flow forth from a deep reservoir of sorrowful emotions that compel me to take this podium. 
   What we witnessed on the campus of Virginia Tech was too much. Too much for anyone to bear. Too much for a nation to bear. America weeps, Mr. Speaker. 
   In my life, I've seen the horrors of war. It is something I wish upon no one. To have battlefield casualties on an American college campus, is something I never thought I would see. 
   33 lives ..... 33 young, bright lives on the cusp of experiencing the greatness that life has to offer. 
   We must be mindful of everything we do. We must ask ourselves what we are doing that has created a world where this could happen. As much as it hurts we must reexamine what kind of society we want to be. 
   I cannot even begin to comprehend how such a terrible tragedy like this came to pass. It would be too easy to say that this horrific incident calls for some type of action by this body.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Not to worry, my friend and colleagues. I have no intentions of keeping you for 1 hour, especially at this time of the day. But a couple of weeks ago the leadership of the minority had asked that I be thrown out of the House and censured based on a newspaper story, and I just want to thank those people who were thoughtful enough to think that even Members of Congress at some times should not rely on newspaper stories, but rather the Ethics Committee, which is bipartisan. More recently, however, my dear friend John Boehner has asked the Speaker to ask me to step aside as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Now I say ``my dear friend John Boehner,'' not as this word is tossed around in the House and Senate casually. I say it because JOHN BOEHNER has, for many, many years, been my friend. We have worked so closely together in bipartisan areas that just a couple of weeks ago he allowed me to strengthen my relationship with Jim McCrery on the Ways and Means Committee to get unemployment compensation passed, and lauded our efforts, as I lauded his. 
   I look around and I see GEORGE MILLER, who more than once said what a straight shooter he has been on Education. Steny Hoyer has reminded me  that, you know, he may disagree with John Boehner, but one thing is clear, that when you speak to him, that he says what he means and he means what he says. 
   Well, I don't really think he means that I am incompetent and should step down. I don't think he really means or thinks that the Speaker is going to remove me from the House of Representatives. I don't think that he thinks I am a threat to this honorable House, which I am so proud to be a Member of. And for those people who say hey, let the Ethics Committee make the decision, I thank you for myself, for my name, for my friends and for my supporters. 
   But believe it or not, I want to do this for the House of Representatives. I don't want any Member, Republican or Democrat, that is less politically secure than me to go through what I have had to go through for the last several weeks, because for them they never could survive. They would lose the election. And it won't be of anything that the voters knew. It would be what this Congress has done to each other. 
   You know, the Ways and Means Committee, we made a special effort to be civil, even when we disagreed. We are so proud, with the support of Speaker Pelosi, of Steny Hoyer, and, yes, John Boehner, working with us and trying to see what we can get done. 
   At the end of this election, this Congress is going to have serious things to take care of. And we won't have Democratic solutions to taxes and health and Social Security and the variety of things with peace and war. We are going to have to resolve these issues as a United States Congress in a bipartisan way. There is not going to be any Democratic way to do it. 
   And we are going to have to work together, not because we like each other, but we have a special responsibility to the people of the United States to make certain that our reputations may be low in terms of production, but if someone doesn't get health care, doesn't get that Social Security check, or for any reason finds himself without a house, they are not going to say the Democrats did it or the Republicans did it. They are going to say that this Congress let them down. It is going to be difficult, no matter who is the President or who is in the leadership. 
   But it does not help to polarize this body and take wild shots at each other, whether they are chairmen or whether they are freshmen, knowing that at the end of the day you are not going to accomplish anything substantive, but you are going to make it more difficult for us to get a law. 
   Do I say that John Boehner knows this? I tell you this: To show you the depth of my friendship, I am embarrassed that he feels he has to do this. There is no way in the world, based on his knowledge of my love for this House, that he would believe that I would do anything to dishonor it. And there is no question in my mind that at the end of the day, when the dust settles, that this issue is going to be moot. But I just don't know what the relationship between people is going to be. So I don't know the next move, but I would suggest that this is not the way to go. 
   John Boehner, John Boehner, John Boehner. On the Tim Russert show, what they did to my friend there in saying that he was passing out illegal checks on the floor. A mistake? We all make them, and we all have to say we are sorry. But we all don't have to attack each other, because at the end of the day, that is all we may have to do to each other and get nothing done. 
   I am suggesting to you this: Mistakes may have been made by me, and I briefly want to let you know the issues that are before the Ethics Committee as relates to three subjects. And I will be brief. 
   Some 20 years ago, I was in the Dominican Republic. 
   I got a call from a long and dear friend of mine to visit this place called Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where he had some dream of making this a resort. I didn't want to go. My wife said friendship dictated it. 
   I got there and he was telling me about the dream. And I was impressed with his dream, but I said, what the heck has that got to do with me? 
   Well, he says, they want to start, they want to build some beach houses here, and there is the sand and there is the beach, and I think it's a good deal. 
   I said, it may be a good deal for you, but I really don't need a beach house and I can't afford it. And, besides, there is no house here. 
   He says, no, we haven't built them yet. 
   So I said, look, Ted, I don't have the time. 
   By the time they showed me the renderings, and they told me that it would cost $82,000, I said I wish I had the $82,000. Good-bye. 
   He says, no, if you have got $28,000, then all they have to do is take the rentals from it and reduce the mortgages, and you can only use it for 9 months, but ultimately it would be yours. 
   I said, we can talk. 
   I refinanced my house. We had no savings, no nothing, and, quite frankly, I relied on the reputation, as I did then and will now, of a guy whose reputation is untouched. 
   Gradually the mortgage was coming down. I had received no financial statement. I could not break the culture in terms of Dominican and Spanish. I received no money, no check. Never did. But let's face it, I should have known. And after this hit the fan, I had my lawyer to go. He broke the balance and found out the fact that they didn't give out statements. Some years there was no statement. There was a half a dozen statements that we have accumulated. And then we took the balance, added to the mortgage of about $50,000, another $20,000 for another room. 
   All of the reports would indicate that Rangel had a cash cow. Rangel got some money. No. What happened was anybody who had a villa, whatever money they got, the hotel first would take their cut. Then they would take out taxes, they would take out renovations, they would take out hurricane expenses, they would take out interest, they would take out everything. At the end of the thing, whether your place was used or not used, they would equally distribute the money. Some years it was $5,000. Some years it was nothing. 
   How many times did I use it in the nine weeks? I wish I had used it for nine weeks. I never spent nine days down there. I have never spent more than four days in any one year, and in several years I never was able to get there at all. 
   What has this got to do with the charges and the allegations? The charges and the allegation is how did he get rid of the mortgage? And the mortgage is that if I had done what I was supposed to have done, I would have found some way to find our how the allocation was there. Because legally and theoretically, the reduction of the mortgage meant income was coming somewhere, even if I didn't receive it.     
   And I should have found that out because, at the end of the day, my accountant tells me after 20 years of research there would be no tax liability because of the deduction of the foreign tax, which was higher, because I was an American and because of depreciation. They changed it and said that because I sold the house that I was raised in that it did not allow me to take full credit that I could have done for that year. It means, at the end of the day, my accountant believes that I would be liable for $5,000. Do I take that lightly? No. 
   As a Member of Congress, as a public servant, I should have a higher standard than most people. Whether I owed $5,000 or $5 million, it was wrong, but it certainly doesn't mean that I should be kicked out of the House and say that I caused disservice to this august body. I just hope none of you have ever made mistakes on your income taxes, because what I have done is I've gone back 20 years and I've waived all statutes, and I'm prepared to pay whatever price there is, and I hope that at the end of the day that will take care of that. That's the roughest one. 
   The second thing is that one would have you to believe that I received some type of a gift in housing, because the headline is that RANGEL had four subsidized apartments in New York. The fact that there is no law in having four subsidized apartments in New York, of course, is no account to anybody. I don't have four apartments. 
   Briefly, what happened is that, 20 years ago, the kids were grown. We got tired of paying the bills on our house and getting into oil and doing all those  things. My wife said let's move to an apartment. I'd spent all of my life on 32nd Street and Lenox Avenue. She finds a place on 35th and Lenox Avenue. I refused to leave Harlem then as I do now, and there was a place called Lenox Terrace, where we now live, that had so many vacancies. 
   At that time 20 years ago, there weren't a whole lot of people who could afford not to live in Harlem, who were rushing to get into Harlem. Crime was really high. There were a lot of vacancies there, but they did have a doorman, and I felt since I was away from home so much that it might provide some security to my wife. In that house, people knowing that Alma would want to leave, there was a popular reverend, a pastor, and he, too, was leaving Harlem and was leaving an apartment that he had. I did not know and did not care that the apartment that he managed to get for us actually had been two apartments. He had it as one apartment. I got a lease for one apartment. I paid rent for one apartment. There's no way in the world I can imagine what it looked like when it was two apartments, and I don't care what the architect says. Under the law, that is one apartment. 
   Ten years after I was in the apartment, my wife was notified by the landlord--incidentally, he was the one who was supposed to give me the gift. I wouldn't know what he looks like. I've never met him in my life or his agent, but he was saying that there was a studio apartment next to mine, and did I have any interest in it. They were really pushing apartments then. My wife says she didn't see any need for it. 
   I said, ``Well, let's talk about this, Alma. You don't want my political friends to come here and talk in the living room. You get so tired of me doing my work, you know, while you're doing something else. You don't want any smoke in here. I can't have a card game here. Let's take a look at this one room apartment.'' 
   I took it, and I can tell you that it saved my marriage. There's not a day when I'm home that I don't spend some time just sitting there. Sometimes it's reading. Sometimes it's studying. Sometimes the gang comes. Sometimes we raise a lot of devil. I pay the maximum rent for what cannot be described physically as any more than two apartments, but we can get two--the so-called fourth and third apartments. 
   It's hard for me to admit to those of you who have a lot of political problems that, for most all of my political life in Congress, I've never picked up the phone to ask anybody to give me any money because I'd never really had any problems. I did have a guy in Washington that would give a fund-raiser--one in Washington and one in New York--but it's kind of hard, when you're not challenged, to ask for money, but I guess it was my personality or my seniority on the Ways and Means Committee, one or the other. Somehow funds were coming in, so I hired somebody. We worked down at the political club. The money was coming in. He said he needed a little help. He thought that I should open up a headquarters. Well, I don't agree in spending a lot of money, but he said he'd heard that the Lenox Terrace, where I lived, had people living in apartments that were converted but that were not commercial for running McDonald's and other business. 
   I said, ``Do what you want. We can afford to do it.'' 
   They got this apartment. A staff of two became a staff of three, four and five, and I guess the Republican campaign committee can tell you how successful I've been. 
   It reached the point where they said, ``Look, Congressman. We've got too many people. There's no air conditioning here. We need more space. Things are going well. You're sending out a lot of checks. We will not renew the lease.'' This is before what happened in the paper. 
   I said, ``Do what you have to do.'' 
   They spoke with the landlord and negotiated: an apartment with him for a larger staff, office accommodations in a place that was double the rent, much larger, right there in the Lenox Terrace, which means that everyone knew what they were doing and what other people were doing. We decided it would be best just to leave the Lenox Terrace in lieu of what happened because it was just too awkward. 
   That ends, once and for all, the whole idea of a gift. I paid the maximum rent. If I'd decided that because I wanted to please somebody that I should look for a marketplace rent, I would not know where to go, but I sure am not going to give the landlord what I think is a higher rent because I want to please somebody as to what is market rent, but if I'd left the apartment because of some foolish, stupid reason, the landlord would've come in, slapped some paint on it and doubled the rent. So, therefore, it would not be of any assistance to somebody of a lesser income. 
   Whatever doubts you may have, which I don't see how--I told somebody show me the gift, and I'll walk away. Leave it to the bipartisan Ethics Committee to decide. It's not only the right and fair thing do. It's the only thing to do. 
   The last point gives me a little more difficulty. They are saying that I may have used my stationery to solicit funds for the City College of New York for an institution that the board of trustees has named the Charles Rangel Public School for Public Service. 
   I have to let you know that, on November 30, 1950, I was shot and left for dead in Korea, and I came home in '52. I had more medals, more self-esteem than any guy 22 years old should have. The only time it was shattered is when I went for a job and found out that nobody wanted heroes, that nobody wanted infantry men and that nobody wanted the expertise that I enjoyed in directing fire on the enemy to 18 155-millimeter Howitzers at 75 shell bombs on the enemy. So, it was clear that I not only was unemployed but that I was unemployable. It was clear in 
   one day when I had my truck full of stuff on the street in the Garment Center that I joined the Army to avoid. The rain came; the boxes were scattered all over, and the policeman was cursing me out for blocking traffic. Sergeant Rangel was being cursed out on a public street. 
   I dropped everything. I went to the VA, and I said, ``I need some help.'' They told me that because I had to go back to high school that I couldn't go to college. I raised so much hell. Finally, because of the GI Bill--I was a high school dropout--I got the training to become a Member of Congress, a member of the Ways and Means Committee and become its chairman. 
   Am I overzealous about education? You bet your life. Do I go everywhere and tell businesspeople that you owe it to this country to assist us in making certain that Americans can produce, that we shouldn't be embarrassed of having to import people here who have knowledge in science and all of that? I want America to be as strong as it can be, and I'm going to do everything legally, morally and ethically possible to make certain that we support our young people and expose them to education. 
   This CCNY, this City College of New York, has excelled. Colin Powell and so many people had dreams and have succeeded. All I was saying is that we have thousands of Barack Obamas in the Black community. We have so few who are willing to get involved in public service. They go to Wall Street. They make their money and they're bright. What I want to do is to encourage minorities and be able to say, ``Hey, you don't have to run for public office, but please understand the importance of public service.'' They said, ``There should be a school for you to do that.'' I said, ``Well, let's get a school. Let's do it.'' They said, ``Let's do it.'' 
   Two, three days ago, I heard Secretary Rice talking to some group, and she was saying that she goes to so many countries and that she doesn't see people in the Foreign Service who look like her. Those who look like the gorgeous mosaic of America is not abroad. But she said, ``Thanks to Congressman Rangel, we have worked out a program where we go to the historically Black colleges where we train these people there. When they graduate, they not only have degrees, but they are members of the Foreign Service, and they learn to understand the great contribution they can make to this country.'' That was what I wanted to do. 
   I made certain that, in this letter, I did not ask for any public funds or for any kind of funds at all, but they said, because they knew that the reason I wanted these not-for-profit people,  these private people, to take a look and see whether they could support this not-for-profit public college, there may have been some stretch in the line because it was on stationery. Had I not had the seal that had the Capitol, it would have been all right. 
   I'm glad this happened because I'm going to find some way to do what I do, and I'm going to do it the way the Ethics Committee says to do it, but I hope I can get some of you to encourage the private sector to do what our government is not doing. Education is too important to leave to the local and State schools. Corporations have an obligations to help us to educate our people. Condoleezza Rice said it, and I truly know that you believe a failure to educate our young people is a threat to our national security. If for whatever reason the Federal Government is not doing it, everyone ought to do their bit. So, whatever the Ethics Committee says to do, we have to do. 
   Finally, I've changed my mind in bringing to your attention how they beat up on Mr. Boehner on the Tim Russert show: where he's been, how he got there and what he violated. At the end of the day, I think I'm trying to make certain that my presentation ends up on as positive a note as I can because of my longtime respect for my friend. Mr. Boehner said it was a big mistake and I regret it. I shouldn't have done it. It was an old practice in the House that had gone on for a long time. Well, I think he knows what I'm talking about. 
   If you made a mistake, I may have made a mistake. 
   I'll tell you one thing. The judgment of our mistakes should not be to attack each other. It should not be to defame us in front of our family and friends. Whatever difference that we had with each other, that's why we have the Ethics Committee. So, at the end of the day, that's how it's going to be resolved. We don't have that many issues that we've got to work with, perhaps, in a bipartisan way. Whatever we have to do because of the election we have to do, and I don't expect this short talk is going to change anything, but I do hope there is one thing that we keep in mind: that for those of us who are going to be here next year with a new administration, the last thing we have to do is to threaten each other politically and destroy the friendships and the camaraderie that we have worked so hard to try to restore. 
   I conclude by letting you know that some of you old-timers may know a guy named Guy Vander Jagt. Guy Vander Jagt was chairperson of the Republican Campaign Committee. Could he speak? Could he raise money? Was he partisan? Guy Vander Jagt was my friend. Guy Vander Jagt would come to my fund-raisers. I would stop over to his. His wife and my wife are the best of friends. Even though Guy Vander Jagt is gone, they asked me to speak in the Congress to say how he was loved by both sides. Was he a good Republican? Was he fierce? Was he eloquent? Was he liked? Yes. 
   I don't think I'll live long enough to see the days when we'll have that type of relationship. The little we do have let's not destroy. We have a big responsibility to our Nation and to this Congress. I know in my heart that my friend John Boehner does not mean truly what he has said, and whoever has put him in the position where he felt that he had to say it, hey, it's campaign time. I understand it. It has to stop somewhere before we leave here. I hope it can stop now. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. I want to compliment my colleague on his concern about earmarks; and I hate to see your record and credibility shattered merely because many Members, Republicans and Democrats, did not want certain hospitals to suffer the cuts, as has been recommended by this administration. And where we could and where there appeared to be some doubt, I gave my word to the members of the Ways and Means Committee, as did Mr. McCrery, that Pete Stark and I would be taking a look at each and every one of them. But it would be a tremendous stretch of anyone's imagination to call that an earmark.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Let me extend an olive leaf to my friends on the Republican  side, because it just wouldn't be fair for you to be going home thinking that people will be talking about politics and process when the bottom line is: Where were you when this government, as big as it is, wanted to protect 11 million kids in health insurance? That's going to really be the bottom line. 
   And if you think that government is really so big that $50 billion is just too much money to invest in these little kids, then kind of think about what you're willing to invest in Afghanistan, in Baghdad, in improving its schools and its hospitals. 
   And think of what we get back. Just think of what we get back in preventing these kids from getting diseases and illnesses that would not only cost us billions of dollars in health care, but the lost competition, the inability to learn and to be productive. What a heck of an investment this is, even for our United States Government, to be concerned with 11 million Americans becoming healthy, better educated and competitive. 
   This is not a question of Democrats being so dumb, so stupid, so apolitical that we want to hurt our own folks. Unlike children, they vote. And every organization that has dedicated themselves to older Americans for health services have endorsed this: the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jews, the gentiles. People who are concerned about human lives are concerned that we do these things. 
   What do you think we are? We were born yesterday? No. I don't know what the President intends to do, but you can't hurt this President anymore. You don't have to do this to yourselves. Just think about your explanations: The bill wasn't ready; it didn't come out of committee. I don't know. How are you going to pay for it in 2012? Or maybe some of you youngsters have to think about it. But just think about how many people are going to get health care between now and 2012 before we look at the President's tax cuts. Somehow they kind of broke it off at 2010. So it's not the first time people had these creative ideas. 
   But let me suggest this to you: This bill expires on September 30. Now, I don't know whether they have town hall meetings on the other side or not, Steny, but I would hate to be at one of them when they explain why there is not going to be insurance for these six million, and additional five. I hate for them to say how they were reading the bill because they didn't participate. 
   These are things that we can improve upon. And Mr. McCrery and I work every day to see whether we can do a better job on communication. But don't you let our lack of communication interfere with having coverage for 11 million kids who deserve better than what we've given them in terms of the debates and the discussion on this historical piece of legislation. 
   So we have the opportunity to join with hundreds of Americans that are concerned about our young people, our old people, a better America. Our educators, our teachers want to do this. I cannot think of anything that's more important for our national security and our national defense than investing in these young people who carry the torch of freedom for the generations that follow us. 
   But if you don't do this, if they find themselves without health care, if their parents cannot be productive on the job because they're worried about their kids and not being able to get to a clinic, if they can't enjoy the preventive care that you enjoy and I enjoy and our children and grandchildren enjoy, you explain it, that we weren't talking to each other, we didn't cooperate, and the program just expired. 
   No. I don't want you to go that way. I don't even think the President wants to go that way. I want you to think about the bottom line: 11 million kids, an improved Medicare system, $15 billion helping citizens or older that don't have the funds to get insurance, 5 billion for those in the rural areas that don't have access to health care. This is what we're doing. 
   You may not have liked the roadmap, but you can't walk away from what we've done. You can never say anything that's wrong about helping children. So let us try to think about how we end this up, because come this November people will be asking the questions. I don't think it's going to be on process. I don't think it's going to be how long you kept us up at night. I don't think it's going to be how many parliamentary maneuvers we had. I don't think it's whether we missed our Easter recess. Did you let this program expire and were you there when the children called on you? 
   I hope we can count on your vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this great piece of legislation that this august body has the privilege of supporting. 
   There may be some concerns in the House, some with merit, about procedure, but we on the Ways and Means Committee are so proud of the work that has been done by the subcommittee, led by Mr. Stark, working with Mr. Camp, that we had 15 hearings on what was involved in this bill and a half a dozen sessions where we just talked with the professionals to make certain that not only did we support the great work that had been done by the Dean of our House in terms of education, in terms of Energy and Commerce and the SCHIP bill, but so at the same time we could preserve the benefits that are provided to our senior citizens through medical programs. 
   Mr. Stark did one great job at making certain that we worked with the administration, tried to find out where the abuses were and, where we could, we were able to raise $15 billion so that the poorest of our seniors would have the ability to receive health care enhanced.     
   Of course, those who live in rural areas and who for years have not be able to receive the type of access to health care, we found $5 billion to do it. 
   I am not thoroughly convinced as to what PAYGO is going to mean in the future, but it is the rules of our party. It seems now that it makes some sense. But when you say that you have to enlarge this program so that an additional 6 million people, kids, that are already on the program, adding 5 million people to it, nobody, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, does not believe that these children should be entitled to health care. 
   It is not just the right and moral thing to do. But in terms of being fiscally responsible, everyone would tell you that having a kid in the family exposed to preventive care actually costs less money than just ignoring the care of our children. I could go even further in saying that, even kids that go to school, if they are not well, they can't learn. And God knows we have millions of people in the street that had health impediments, that they thought they were educational impediments, and they are out there. I personally believe that a stronger country is a healthier country and a well-educated country. 
   Now, it is true when you have these PAYGO rules and you don't want to raise taxes that you have to find the money. And so it is a great deal of empathy that I have for our poor cigarette smokers, because I used to be one; and, two, I just don't like the idea of regressive taxes where the poor are penalized. But I am learning to live with it in such a sense that these cigarette smokers, these addicts, they hate themselves for smoking. And I have stretched it to the point that when I talk with them and tell them what we are about to do, after they finish coughing and spitting, they said, ``I have got to stop this smoking.'' Then, when you look at the little kids, this is the one thing that an increase in prices sharply reduces, it is kids going to smoke. 
   So, I am trying to get myself to think that maybe I am doing it for the tobacco companies, because they advertise they don't want kids to smoke, and we are going to help them by increasing the price of cigarettes, which one thing is abundantly clear, it will stop a lot of children from smoking. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield the rest of my time to the gentleman from California, PETE STARK, who has done such a fantastic job in finding out where the problems were and bringing to this floor not only a great child insurance bill, but also improving Medicare, increasing the benefits of our seniors who are poor and help into rural areas. 
   While we may have a lot of procedural differences, and I understand that, I just hope that whether you are Republican or Democrat that you feel comfortable being able to say that there may be some pain for cigarette smokers who really are costing us a lot of money with these lung transplants and whatnot. But that is painful enough. 
   So you may have some problem with your smokers. But just think about 11 million children and their families that love them so much and a country that wants them healthy, and I am certain that at the end of the day that the kids  are going to win, we will have a better health care delivery system, and you will feel very, very comfortable in talking about the procedural differences that you differed with. But, in your heart, you would know that every major advocate for children and health and hospitals and doctors have signed up saying, ``do the right thing.'' I personally believe that that is what you are going to do today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California, PETE STARK, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, and I thank him publicly, and the staff, for the fantastic job that they have done in having hearings and letting all Members have a better understanding of the problem, but, better than that, in being able to bring a solution to this floor today.

But I am saying that under normal conditions, you would think that your leadership would have discussed this issue with ours so that at some times the Members would know exactly what to expect. 
   Now, I don't see any reason why this should not be agreed upon, but I just don't think Members can come to the floor by unanimous consent and ask for an hour or 2 hours or 3 hours. We don't even know whether or not the minority intends to follow any other procedures that could kind of take away floor time in terms of debates and exchanges. Just based on some of the things that I've seen from your committee, it appears to me that we have to find out what you want to do with that hour.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Thank you so much, Chairwoman Kaptur, for giving me this courtesy and this opportunity. 
   I was a very long and dear friend of Louis Stokes. I loved him, I worked with him, and when he decided that he was going to retire, I did everything that I could to share with him how much he would be missed by his country and by this Congress. But when he had me to meet in Cleveland with Stephanie, I was convinced that--some of you may have met people that you know that it really wouldn't make any difference what they decided to do. Their intellect, their drive, their personality would make them successful, and especially for a woman and an African American woman in Ohio or any other part of the United States, to be a prosecutor, to be a judge and then to come to the Congress, it had to be extraordinary, the same way Harriet Beecher Stowe, Fannie Lou Hamer, people of extreme resilience. 
   And so from then, she said that she wanted to get on the Ways and Means Committee, and boy, the Ways and Means Committee has never been the same since she's joined with us. She would come to the meeting where we would be fighting and arguing and, with a smile, light it up. But that didn't prevent her from getting involved in the argument and many times on a different side of the Chair. But at the end of the day, I knew that once she was convinced that was the way the committee was going, you couldn't stop Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   I say in conclusion, one of the reasons that so many of you must like her, love her is because I don't remember that many complaints that she had about the Chair not responding to the needs of her constituents, especially when the housing market fell in Cleveland. 
   But so many of you that she brought to the chairman of this committee, that was not on the committee, because you had convinced her that it was important to your community, and she, as a person on that committee, thought we should look into it, and there was never but never a frivolous request. Every time she came she had done so much homework that I just know that the gap that she leaves in my heart and our committee will never be filled by anyone else. 
   I thank you for this opportunity of sharing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007, H.R. 180. 
   The passage of this bill will require the identification of companies that conduct business operations in Sudan and prohibit the United States Government to contract with such companies. The atrocities in Sudan have only continued to escalate. The U.S. Government must cut ties with a government that fails to address the genocide within its own boundaries. The Government of Sudan has not put any action to disarm the Janjaweed militia and is therefore equally responsible for the human rights violations against Darfurians. 
   An estimated 450,000 people have been killed, and 2 million people have been displaced--234,000 of which have been forced into neighboring Chad. Janjaweed soldiers continue to ride into villages stealing whatever goods they can find, slaughtering men, women, and children along the way. These soldiers systematically rape women and children, holding some as sex slaves for weeks at a time before releasing them. 
   Colleagues, we are in a position to help stop the carnage in Darfur. We must continue to pressure the Government of Sudan to stop the massacre in Darfur. Enforcing economic  sanctions is a way to achieve this goal. I urge you all, for the sake of humanity, to support the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. We are not blind to the truth and we have a responsibility to do our part to alleviate this awful tragedy.

   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to share with this body the life of a great American named Ron Brown, and I'm asking your support to have a Federal building, a U.N. missions building if you will, to be named after him. 
   Even though Ron Brown was an African American from Harlem, his story is more of an American story than one of color, because on the streets of Harlem you don't find too many people exposed to dreams of ever becoming a Secretary of Commerce, indeed an ambassador for this great country. 
   But Ron never forgot Harlem, and it was the Urban League that drove him to do things in the civil rights movement. It was his dedication to his country that drove him to spend 4 years in the military, but everywhere that Ron Brown would go as Secretary of Commerce, he was there not just to sell businesses to the country. He was there to sell the American flag, the principles of that flag and the thing that we stand for. 
   I went with him to South Africa to see him negotiating with leaders, political leaders there, but all the time that he was talking to them, it wasn't which party was right or which party was wrong or how to bring about solidarity. He was asking how could America help the people to get clean water, to get medicine, to get food and to let them know that our multinationals were there, not just for the shareholders of their firm but the shareholders of the world. 
   And so when you come to New York, where you always see diversity, people of different color, different languages, different cultures, and you see the Federal mission to the United Nations, there could not be a sight that would be more reminiscent of Ron Brown than the contributions that he made to my community, my country, but indeed, the entire world. 
   And so thank you for shepherding this wonderful bill so that his family and his friends and his supporters and kids to follow would know that out of Harlem we planted the seed, and he died for this country on a mission for President Clinton. His memory will never, never be forgotten; and I was proud to be a desk clerk at the time that he was living in a hotel that his father managed in New York. And he will forever be in my mind and I hope in yours as you think about great Americans who lost their lives for this great country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2707, Mr. KUCINICH's resolution to reauthorize the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program. I praise the initiative contained in this resolution to point out the historical, cultural, and educational legacy behind the Underground Railroad. It is through that network of tunnels and secret hiding places that many African Americans escaped slavery. As a symbol of freedom, the Underground Railroad deserves greater recognition and appreciation, regrettably of its artifacts and secrets remain hidden and lost. 
   I have long believed in and fought for more and better education of African American history. Well, an important part of that history is contained in the struggle for freedom that characterized the slave experience. Some would have us believe that slaves passively accepted their captivity in the plantations in the South. The truth is there was an active resistance to slavery; which included periodic uprisings and constant efforts to escape. The full role and extent of the Underground Railroad has yet to be discovered and remains unknown. The legislation authorizes the Secretary of Education to sponsor studies and make grants for programs that promote knowledge of the Underground Railroad. 
   With the resources and technology available today, we owe it to the history of African Americans and the history of the United States to study, preserve, and make available to all the hidden secrets of the Underground Railroad. Secret routes and safe houses still remain unknown. Secrets that may remain buried in our backyards. 
   The establishment of this facility would allow significant missing pieces in African American history to be properly studied and commemorated. 
   Through the passage of this legislation, the work of the National Park Service and its study of the phenomenon known as the Underground Railroad will be continued. Established by Congress in 1990, the National Park Service has made major progress in learning more about the secret routes and the processes used in escorting these fugitive slaves to freedom. The story is far from well enough known, and the study far from complete. Let us as members of the 110th Congress exhibit the same respect and appreciation of the Underground Railroad as was shown in 1990. 
   Please join me in support of H.R. 2707, as we move further in understanding the whole story and celebrating the legacy of the Underground Railroad.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the tax provisions of H.R. 5351. The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. This explanation, document JCX-19-08, is currently available on the Joint Committee's Web site. 
   H.R. 5351 presents a step in the right direction as Congress moves to address the issue of climate change and energy security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today to once again visit this important international and certainly national crisis that our country is facing today. RICHARD NEAL, an outstanding member of the Oversight Committee, working with my dear friend, PHIL ENGLISH, was able to explore how the Congress might be more aggressive in dealing with this serious problem. 
   It is clear that one day our children and grandchildren will be asking us, during this period of time, what were we doing as relates to climate control. What role did we play to avoid our dependency on fossil fuel? How many lives have been lost as a result of our Nation feeling insecure about oil reserves throughout the world? Did we attempt to conserve? Did we protect the Earth? Did we create the jobs? Did we fulfill our moral obligation? 
   I hate to see that the record is going to say that here we go again, that we have done this before, that the Senate hasn't acted, or that other Members would take the time to talk about  other pieces of legislation instead of devoting all of their attention as to how we can make this issue one that the President can come to the table and join with us and attempt to resolve. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to find renewable sources of energy, to conserve what we have, to test the winds, the waters, solar, to do all that we can to make certain that we meet the challenges that arise on our watch. 
   And so I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker, but I do hope that the discussion we have today, that Members realize that the whole world is watching, history is being made, and it is our choice as to whether we have made a positive contribution or whether some Members have preferred to be a political impediment to that progress. But no matter how many times we are rejected by the Senate, our Speaker and leadership are committed to be able to say that on our watch, while we were here, we have done all we could do in order to face and resolve this serious problem. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, referring to the threat of the national security of the oil producers in Venezuela is a clear example of a failed energy policy in this country, whether it is South America or whether it is the Middle East. But it should be pointed out for the record, as compiled by the Center for American Progress, profits during the Bush administration for oil companies have risen from $30 billion to $103 billion. We don't think it is asking too much for them to assist in partnership to find out whether there is a better way to fuel our energy needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), an outstanding Member of the Congress and distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.

Mr. Speaker, when history is reviewed and we see where our Nation is and what bright light we have in not just identifying the problem but providing the solutions, the Speaker has given us all an opportunity to be a part of that great compromise in terms of working with the private sector and working with Republicans and Democrats. And it doesn't make any difference how many setbacks we have, the commitment she made continues. And until we can get a bipartisan ear in the White House, or until the Senate understands that our time has come to face up to the problems in terms of global warming and national security and in terms of the ever-increasing costs of fuel, and to be able to say on our watch we met the challenge and we moved forward, no one voice, no one leader has provided more of an opportunity for us to resolve this serious problem than the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

He has supported it in his budget, and the Joint Committee advisory opinion has been superseded by the chairman of the committee, which is me, has been authorized in support of requests by a Republican mayor and a Republican Governor. 
   Now, the answer to what you want is in the Department of Treasury report, 2008. If you don't want the details, then I yield back to you and I cannot answer any further.

   Mr. RANGEL. Let me make this abundantly clear. Earmark or no earmark, our country was hit, it was New York City, came to the rescue. Because of the way the bond issue was created, it expired, and the President of the United States believed, in fairness to the community that was hit, on behalf of the people of the United States of America, that there should be an extension of this. So we're not talking about any new earmark. We're talking about an extension of the compassion that this Congress has given my city and my community.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, first let me once again thank Mr. English for the diligent way that he addresses the problems that are before our committee. His working with RICHARD NEAL makes me proud to be a member and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. I do hope that at some point that we will be able to get past the barrier of partisanship to deal with a national security issue, a global climate issue, an issue that should challenge all partisanship as we move forward. 
   It defies common sense to believe that the oil industry that is receiving billions of dollars in profit would even consider the $14 billion that we are talking about. It is almost like grains of sand on the beach. We are asking them to be partners with us, not just for their shareholders, which they know how to take care of, but for their country, to be able to say that our foreign policy should not be directed by where oil is, to be able to say at the end of the day we can tell our kids and grandkids that we tried to protect the atmosphere of this great country, to be able to say that there are alternatives, that we don't have to rely on fossil fuels. We have the genius. We have the creativity. And this bill provides the incentives to see whether we can use the wind, the water, waste, solar, whatever it takes. We have the know-how given the opportunity which this bill will give to deal with it. We can create products that conserve energy. We can increase our surplus in terms of trade by being able to produce products that are far more competitive than what we are doing today. What a great opportunity for us. 
   And when we talk about potential recession or whatever the President wants to call it, we have to recognize the big role that the increase in the price of oil has played with families who used to consider themselves middle income and now are faced with ever-increasing home fuel costs, automobile costs and all of these things, and to find that we have to give them $159 billion because they don't have the ability to put food on the table or shoes on their kids' feet or to pay their rent or to pay their mortgage. All of this, we can handle these problems if we work together in a bipartisan way. We even go as far as to say in the bill that we don't have all of the answers. We provide tax-exempt bonds for mayors and Governors and people with exciting ideas of how to make greenhouses and increase the efficiency of our commercial buildings as well as our residents. 
   Why don't we give hope a chance and give the challenge to America a chance, force the Senate to come to meet with us and in a bipartisan way  in the House to be able to say that we are prepared to do these things. 
   And so I do hope that people would reconsider that did not support H.R. 5351. I do hope and congratulate the leadership and Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, for never giving up and not giving in just because we face political obstacles. The record is going to indicate which side we were on, and it is abundantly clear, were you on the side of Big Oil or were you on the side of change and wanting to make certain that we met the challenges that we are forced to do.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion, and I am a little embarrassed about an issue that came up during the debate on this bill as related to the unity and the support for my great city, New York. I oppose the motion for many reasons, but the prime one is that this actually kills the bill and prevents us from taking a vote, but I don't think that they seriously would want us to consider the provisions here that they have in the motion. 
   But having said that, I am embarrassed that one of the issues that is in the motion to recommit is that they not allow the City of New York, with the support of the President of the United States, and have it included in the President's budget, the opportunity to utilize tax-exempt bonds, bonds that were given for the specific purpose of assisting us in recovering from that tragic terrorist attack on September 11. 
   After study by the administration and conversations which they had with the Republican and Democrat mayor and Governor of our great State, they reached the conclusion that the fair and equitable thing, because of the impediment under which the original tax-exempt bond issue was written, that it was inaccurately written and it would expire if this provision wasn't there. Someone on the other side called it an earmark. Well, if it is an earmark, it is a compassionate earmark that is supported by the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury. 
   I just ask you, in case somebody of good conscience would ask, Why would you do a thing like that in a motion to recommit? to give you the opportunity to say, I just didn't know that it was in there. 
   So for all of those reasons, I ask that we defeat the motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. The bill has seven provisions and is revenue neutral. 
   First, the bill will repeal this excursion into private companies collecting the debt for the Internal Revenue Service. We've had many hearings, and the Internal Revenue Service, on more than one occasion, had indicated that, given the resources, they could do a more effective job than having to subcontract out to private firms. 
   There's nothing magic about privatization. Just saying that it's privatized doesn't mean that it's more effective or that you're doing the right thing. And I think, in this great country of ours, there is a special relationship between the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer. 
   No one would ever like the tax collector, but you do feel a little more secure when you know that a public servant is doing his or her job, rather than this job being sold out or given out to somebody that's income is going to be based on how much taxes they collect today. 
   No, if you've got to call the office and ask the taxpayer to pay, or call his home, let it not be a ride-by-night firm that is just getting involved in tax collection of Federal indebtedness. Let it be someone that you can trust, let it be a civil servant, and let it be the people that, over the years, have done the job, and no good reason has been given by anybody as to why they should not continue to do this. 
   The only sad thing that you can say about the collection of taxes by the IRS is that, admittedly, we never gave them the money; we never gave them the resources. But no one can challenge that there's no one better trained to do the job than the Internal Revenue Service.  
   And then, of course, I want to thank Representative Meek and Representative Herger for providing leadership in repealing this provision that would address the 3 percent withholding rate on certain government payments for goods and service. It didn't look good then; it doesn't look good now. 
   The bill also provides some equity to our citizens in the Virgin Islands to ensure fairness in tax collection there, and eliminates the restrictions on the statute of limitations, which means that their statute of limitations is our statute of limitations, that we're all citizens in this together, and they're not second class in this. 
   In addition, of course, we want to say that this bill is revenue neutral. 
   I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy) and give him the opportunity to control that time.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to hear the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) who's an outstanding member of the Ways and Means Committee and I appreciate his contribution to the committee. I was moved by his story of the hardship that he felt as a result of the estate tax. 
   What the heck that has got to do with collecting debts that is owed to the Internal Revenue, I have no idea. If you're suggesting that we kill the bill that eliminates bounty hunters from working on commission and unfairly leaning and putting pressure on people who owe the Federal Government, that's one thing. If you want us to just substitute that and take back to the committee your idea about what we should do with the estate tax, well, you know as well as I do that we have to find out how much money do we lose, where do we raise the money, and do it in a Republican-Democratic fiscal fashion to say, hey, I want to reduce taxes here and raise it someplace else, maybe on the kids, maybe on a little tobacco, maybe whatever makes you feel good, but don't kill something with a parliamentary motion. It's not the right thing to do. 
   I think the subject matter that you discuss does warrant some discussion, someplace, at some time, but to imply that we should report back promptly, how promptly should we deal with the question of estate tax or estate tax repeal? Where do we get the half a billion dollars? These are things that I think should be in another day and another time. 
   Right now, we're talking about a great bill that if you kill this bill through a parliamentary procedure, which is all we're talking about, then the small business people that have been collecting government taxes, they're going to get hit. The citizens that we have in the Virgin Islands that are treated unfairly with the statute of limitations, they're going to get hit. 
   And the people who really believe that if you have to deal with your government, if you have to deal with the Treasury Department, if you have to deal with the Internal Revenue, for God's sake, deal with a civil servant whose mortgage payment is not dependent on how much money he can get out of you. Deal with someone that's been trained by the United States Government to collect money that's owed to the United States Government and not some company that has been created to fill the need because some people believe that the private sector can always but always do it best. 
   I do hope that when the committee has something to discuss as important as estate tax, why not discuss estate tax when it's time to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Fellow Members, I want to thank Chairman Costello and Chairman Oberstar for their cooperation and working together as a team with our Republican colleagues to get this job done. 
   Quite frankly, I thought it was almost going to be pro forma when I knew that the Ways and Means Committee was going to receive this bill for the purposes of providing revenue. So I was a little surprised that when the issue actually came before the full committee, rather than dealing with the question of revenue, I had to deal with the question of outrage. There was not a liberal, conservative, Republican or Democrat that didn't believe that this was our time to tell these aviation people that we passengers have been suffering in such a way that we were going to express it through the tax system.     
   People on the tarmac for 3, 4, 5 hours; flights being cancelled; weather conditions we never heard of; overcrowding. And we were of the belief that when they came to raising the revenue, that General Aviation, these small planes were congesting the airs and we were going to make them pay dearly for it, and Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello was asking us to take a deep breath. I told them it wasn't me. But the committee said that this bill is not going to leave our committee unless we have some fingerprints on this thing to let them know that we feel the outrage for our constituents and we want them to know it. And so we made the political mistake of having Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello come to a caucus and to share with us what the problem was. It was one of those times that you really felt better if you didn't know the extent of the problem and just did what you were supposed to do. 
   He had the people explain that, yes, we have problems with General Aviation, but these commercial airlines are having these routes being filled with smaller planes and so they are filling the air. And then FAA was saying that we have a plan that will go in effect for 2020, but we don't have enough money to implement it. And then the air traffic controller said, and we need 2 or 3 years to train our people and they won't pay us for it. And then they said that they could handle twice the congestion in the air if only they had more landing fields, but geographically there was no space for additional landing fields. And so then we said: What is it you really want, Chairman Oberstar? 
   And we have really walked away thanking them for incorporating some of the ideas of our committee, as MIKE THOMPSON and LLOYD DOGGETT, and having the Passengers Bill of Rights. 
   But we want the FAA to know that these long-ranged plans of modernization, for those of us that are in advanced years, we don't really believe that we are going to have to wait in order for us to be treated as human beings. Not as congresspeople, not as big shots, not as VIPs, but we know that changes can be made. And we will be depending on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to continue to work with us to make certain that we fulfill our commitment to the American people to make it easier for us to use the airways. 
   I want to thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to working with you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I promise you, this will not take anywhere near 1 hour. 
   I was advised last night and assured this morning that the minority intended to bring up a resolution recommending that I be censured or that my conduct as reported in The New York Times would be declared that I was a discredit to this House. 
   There is no one in this House that is more thick-skinned than I am in terms of playing politics, but playing with someone's reputation, especially someone that has felt so honored to serve in this House, I really think goes a step beyond that. 
   In reading the allegations as to where my campaign headquarters was located or what the rent should have been, I have never felt more secure that I violated no law and no spirit of the law. But in order to make certain, to make certain that there is no cloud over my conduct in New York, I asked the Ethics Committee to look into it, to investigate, to do whatever is necessary to bring this to the House and to bring it to my family and friends. 
   In addition to that, the same newspaper reported that I was overly aggressive in trying to raise funds in order to encourage moneys to go to a local college that encouraged minorities and others to get involved in public service. And even though there was no request for money, the mere fact that there was a cloud involved in the accusation by the newspapers, even though there have been more newspaper articles correcting it than anything else, I referred that to the Ethics Committee. 
   Showing that I do want this to be sincerely investigated, I am asking the minority to allow me to join in with them in this resolution to say this matter should be cleared up. But there is no need, even for mean-spirited people in the minority, to say that I am a discredit to the United States Congress, based on a newspaper story, and, worse than that, there is no reason why Republicans or Democrats should do this to each other based on any newspaper story. 
   So, I don't know the parliamentary inquiry, and, as most of you suspected, most of my friends say, Rangel, the less you say the better, get out of the headlines, and do all of these things. And this is normally what I recommend to newer Members: just leave it alone, it will go away. But my reputation won't, and I could not really appreciate if this body was to resolve that I bring dishonor to this wonderful House and this wonderful country, or that I be censured. 
   So I make an appeal to the minority; let me join in with you with the request. Let me say if there is any doubt about anything, I would feel better if it went to the Ethics Committee. I have requested that it go to the Ethics Committee. Let us join in. But with not one scintilla of any evidence, other than a newspaper story, I think fairness would say, for God's sake, don't make politics out of a person's reputation. Strike out ``discredit,'' strike out ``censure,'' and put in there whatever the heck the Ethics Committee recommends. I join with them. I ask you to consider that. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am so proud to have the opportunity to say once again that fulfilling our constitutional responsibility, the Ways and Means Committee has reported out a bill to provide relief to upward of some 25 million people from being hit by a $50 billion tax increase, which it was never thought could happen to these people.     
   By the same token, almost separate and apart from this, we have an opportunity to close a very unfair provision that we find in our Tax Code, that certainly no one has come to me to defend, which prevents a handful of people from having unlimited funds being shipped overseas under deferred compensation and escaping liability. It is just plain wrong if we were talking about this by itself. But we are not doing that. We are talking about bringing something together that I don't see how anyone can be opposed. 
   So let's talk about the things that we all agree on. Nobody, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, believes that these taxpayers should be hit by a tax that we didn't intend. 
   Two, no one has the guts to defend the offshore deferred compensation. You may have some feelings about it because of a couple of friends, but we know it's indecent and immoral. 
   So what is the problem? We raise the money and we hope that, through this and others, we will be able to pay for the loss of revenue that is enacted by the patch. That is the $50 billion. I wish that I could yield all of our time to the Republicans to explain once again, as eloquent as my dear friend Mr. McCrery is, as to why this is not borrowing. 
   Mr. Dreier yesterday in the Rules Committee says it's not borrowing because we never intended for this to happen. Well, if it works for you guys, I'm going to try it when I get home with my creditors and say, hey, it wasn't meant for me to be broke and so it's not borrowing; just ignore it. 
   But it doesn't work that way on pencil and paper. Either you have got to cut programs by $50 billion, raise the revenue by $50 billion, or mumble for $50 billion. Enough of the mumbling. Can't we unite on this, and at least let them know in the Senate that the House of Representatives is the House of the People, that we believe in what we're doing? And let's remember this; that we know the President, when he is closing things that he wants to be closed on to raise revenue, it's not a tax increase. He and Secretary Paulson call it, what, a loophole closing. That's all we're trying to do in paying for this. 
   And so, remember, the President won't be with you in November, but I will be, trying to help all of us to understand that we did the best we could for the Congress and for the country. So we are giving the other body another opportunity. Hopefully this time they will not be irresponsible but they will join with us in doing two things: Reform the system for a provision that only benefits a handful of people at the expense of the United States Treasurer; and, two, prevent this burden from falling on 25 million innocent, hardworking American people.  
   At this time I would like to yield the balance of my time to Chairman RICHARD NEAL.

   You know, Mr. Clyburn, I knew the world famous owner of Sylvia's when she was a waitress at a restaurant just one block away where she anchored her success, and she and her husband came together and went to South Carolina, two friends, in order to get the money necessary for her to start her own future. Mr. Woods, and we just lost him a few years back, would be up at 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning with that truck, going to the produce markets, picking the best vegetables, and then she would have her children and now her grandchildren, all a part of this wonderful family, and now that she's reached a point that her products are sold in supermarkets and throughout the world and that she has acclaimed a great deal of attention from tourists all over the world as these tourist buses are lined up, it doesn't surprise anybody to see Sylvia there asking these customers that she probably will never see again in life, How did you enjoy the meal and what can we do to help? 
   So let me thank you on behalf of all of Harlemites, even Congressman GREGORY MEEKS from the borough of Queens, who has to admit that coming from Harlem means a special thing to us, because he was one of us before he lost his way. And so when I heard that you were doing this on behalf of Harlem, who cherishes the rise of Sylvia's late husband, her children and her wonderful grandchildren, who still bring people from all over the world into the village of Harlem, let me thank you, JIM CLYBURN, for reminding us that we have so many heroes and ``sheroes'' in our country, and they deserve what you're doing for them in South Carolina.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues know, we passed overwhelmingly the minimum wage bill. But it got into trouble in the Senate as they attempted to attach an $8.2 billion tax cut. 
   I shared the problem that we faced with Mr. McCrery, and we thought that small business certainly did deserve some assistance, with or without the minimum wage bill. And we talked, and Mr. McCrery said, well, if we are going to have a bill, are we going to pay for it? And let's select what we thought would be the best interests of small businesses in view of this dialogue that we had with the Senate. 
   Our staffs got together, gave us several options, and we agreed that we would increase and extend the small business expense, increase the work opportunity tax credit to include veterans and disabled veterans, protect the current benefit of the FICA tip credit, allow small businesses to use the work opportunity tax credit, and to enjoy the alternative, to exclude alternative minimum tax, and to simplify the tax filing system for businesses that are owned jointly by husband and wife. 
   We then tried to figure a way to pay for it. And what we agreed to is to make certain that the capital gains tax cut that was dramatically made lower for people in low income, that we would prevent people from transferring the capital stock to their kids who have little or no income and enjoy a benefit that was designed to assist low-income people. 
   Letters commending our efforts were received, it was supported by the Chamber of Commerce which says that it is going to have a key vote; but since I don't follow them that closely, I don't know what it means; the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Restaurant Association, Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, American Bankers Association, the American Farm Bureau, Federation to Secure the Industry and Financial Markets Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit Coalition.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I extend my strong support ``The Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007'' as included in the Conference Report to H.R. 1591. I am glad that both chambers of Congress, in passing this Conference Report, have spoken to the fact that an increase in the Federal minimum wage enjoys broad bipartisan, bicameral support, as does the approximately $5 billion in small business tax relief also included in the agreement. 
   Passage of the Conference Report is an important step in achieving an important goal--ensuring an increase in the Federal minimum wage for hardworking American taxpayers. The minimum wage has not increased in more than nine years--the longest period in the history of the law. During that time, Members of Congress have received a $31,600 pay raise. More astounding is the fact that an average CEO earns more before lunchtime in one day than a minimum wage earner earns all year. 
   Raising the minimum wage to from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over two years would benefit 13 million Americans including 7.7 million women, 3.4 million parents, and 4.7 million people of color, and provide an additional $4,400/year for a family of three, equaling 15 months of groceries, or over two years of health care. It is wrong to have millions of Americans working full-time and still living in poverty, and at $5.15 an hour, a full-time minimum wage worker makes $6,000 less than the poverty level for a family of three. 
   Americans overwhelmingly support increasing the Federal minimum wage. An Associated Press poll conducted in January showed almost 80% of those polled supported the $2.10 increase. In fact, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly supports increasing the minimum wage, and passed H.R. 2 with 315 votes in favor. The President has also been supportive of the increase. I hope that combining the tax provisions of this bill with a Federal minimum wage increase will encourage the President's quick action on signing these provisions into law without further delay. 
   The ``Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007'' as included in the Conference Report to H.R. 1591 expands and extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which serves as an incentive to encourage employers to hire individuals from targeted groups which typically experience barriers to work. The WOTC provision in the Conference Report offers additional incentives to hire disabled veterans. The Conference Report also extends and expands the increased expensing amounts for small businesses, allowing them to invest in new technology and equipment. And as a complement to the minimum wage increase, the tax provisions of the Conference Report allow restaurants to continue claiming the full tip credit despite any increase in the Federal minimum wage. Finally, the Conference Report provides a permanent waiver of the individual and corporate AMT limitations to ensure that small businesses are fully able to claim the WOTC and the credit for Social Security taxes paid with respect to cash tips. 
   The Conference Report contains provisions that continue the Federal government's commitment to the still-recovering areas hit by Hurricane Katrina. It would extend the placed-in-service date as applies to special credits designed to encourage development of low-income housing. The extension of this deadline helps accelerate the use of the credits by eliminating the reallocation process that otherwise would be used. The Conference Report also modifies a tax-exempt bond financing program to allow funds to be used to refinance existing mortgages on homes that were damaged by the hurricanes in the area. 
   Finally, the tax provisions of the ``Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act'' as included in the Conference Report to H.R. 1591 are fiscally responsible and fully offset in a revenue-neutral package. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and I have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the bill. The technical explanation expresses the Committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee's website at www.house.gov/jct.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer, the Speaker, certainly Chairman Obey, Mr. Lewis and my good friend, John Boehner, for inviting me to participate in just one part of this very complex problem that we have faced. 
   I just want to make it abundantly clear that what we were fighting for when we were talking about providing resources for those people that have lost their jobs was not a Democratic position or a Republican position, but it was a position that I'm glad that the minority leader understood, that affected not only the ability of Americans to put food on the table or to clothe their children or to pay their bills, but it really involved the dignity of the middle class. 
   And I will speak briefly to that, because Jim McDermott has the passion and truly understanding that we're not talking about being liberal or being conservative. That Statue of Liberty is up there for people all over the world, for centuries, for people to dream the American dream. 
   And what is it? It certainly isn't to be some type of tycoon that gets preferential tax treatment, and we know that it's not those people who are jobless and homeless. But it's those people that really think that they can have some dignity and pride in providing for their family, sending their kids to school, and maybe buying that first house. 
   When I heard that they were excluded from the stimulus package, because if you give these people money they might be inclined not to seek jobs, that struck me to the heart just as much as if someone snatched the flag and threw it in the street because it's these people that are the consumers. It's these people that dream for a better America. It's these people that everyone does and should aspire to be. 
   And for them to be ignored at a time when, through no fault of their own--and I stress that, through no fault of their own--find themselves without disposable income, find themselves losing the dignity in their communities and in their families, it would have just seemed to me that it would not have been a partisan issue, that we all should just come there and not to give a handout, since there's $35 billion that they paid into, but to be able to say, ``there but for the grace of God goes me.'' 
   And so I want to thank John Boehner, because he never pushed that point in terms of we can't afford to do it. It was just a question of how much can and should we do.

   Mr. RANGEL. I hope when we start looking at some other issues, and we're looking to see how we're going to jump-start this economy, that we recognize that it won't be the homeless and the hopeless that we'll be going to. They're not even in the system. It won't be the wealthy, that the President insists that we extend their tax cuts, because they wouldn't even know what the check came in for. 
   But it would be what makes this country so great, what fights our wars, what runs our jobs, what produces for  trade, and what makes it the greatest country in the whole world, and that is the middle class. And when they get into trouble, as they are now, I think this Congress should not have a political debate. We should be there to help them because they're what makes our country great. 
   So thank you for giving me the opportunity and thank you, John Boehner, for understanding what we were trying to do.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   My friends and colleagues, we now have an opportunity to reverse the trend that this great Nation has bound itself to, and that is, the addiction to oil as well as the lack of will to do something about it. 
   This great country has faced up to many crises, and the oil shortage just happens to be one. The question is do we have the will to look and to research and to find alternative means in which to meet the needs of this great Nation. 
   Under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, I think today is the day that all of us are going to be proud of the initiatives that we have taken, the opportunities that are going to be given, the jobs that are going to be created, and the excitement in being able to say that the United States need not look to any Nation because of their vast resources in oil because we have the ingenuity and the ability to find alternatives. 
   It is endless the possibilities that this will pursue in encouraging the production of electricity from renewable sources, using the wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, landfill gas and solid waste.     
   We even go as far as to have coal electricity plants. 
   It is a great opportunity for us and the world to explore these new areas that we just were too lazy or found no need to do, encouraging energy efficient products such as plug-in hybrid cars and incentives for conservation of energy in our buildings, whether they're residential or whether they're commercial. And I find it very exciting that we allow local government, that knows their communities better than we ever could, to issue tax credit bonds to further explore how we can conserve energy. 
   I think this is merely a beginning, but it is an historic beginning that defies party lines. I do hope that we thank the Speaker and the chairman of the committee, the staffs who came together after working years on this project, to come together with a bill that's the beginning of the one that could be a new day for America, a new day for the world as we release our addiction and dependency on fossil fuel. 
   There is another part of this bill that I come to you with mixed feelings and yet ask your support. It's called the extenders. What are the extenders, for the new Members? It's when people want bills passed, but they put expiration dates on them in order to hide the real cost of the bill. 
   I think that the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means and I agree that we have so much garbage in this bill that soon I hope someone would have the courage to take a look at the tax bill that we have and strip it of the preferential treatment and get down to making the bills that we want permanent, and those that should not be permanent, just to kick them out.  
   I think it's a disgrace that we have a stimulus package and we have to target the middle class in order to be given handouts because they don't have enough money under our tax system to put food on the table, to provide tuition for their kids and put clothes on their back. We target them as being people who cannot afford to save and plan for the future. I think it is a disgrace for the Congress to have a tax system that way. 
   But because we make commitments and because some of these laws are good and efficient and because we don't have the money at this point in time to make it permanent, we come to you and ask you to support the extenders. These extenders include research and development, standard deduction for property taxes for non-itemizers. We have provisions in here to help Katrina. Expanded child credits. We make it more equitable how attorneys can write off their investments before the end of a case. We also make it equitable for the moving picture industry to get the same benefits that other industries get as relates to job credit. 
   This is one heck of an opportunity, I think, for us to move this forward in a short way. It's only a 1-year extension, which means that the next administration hopefully will be more progressive in terms of cleaning up the code and making permanent what should be made permanent. It is not paid in controversial taxes. We remove preferences for income that is made overseas and avoid tax liability, as well as tax benefits yet to be received. So there is no pain there. 
   I ask unanimous consent at this time to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Washington, Dr. McDermott, for purposes of managing the bill, and to thank him and so many others on the Ways and Means Committee for their leadership, their patience, and being able to bring this bill to the floor. I'm fairly confident that we will have very little problem in the Senate and have this passed into law. 
   So remember the date. It's historic in nature. And remember the role that you played in supporting this revolutionary approach to avoid the dependency on fossil fuel for our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. One, the outrage concerns my love for the Congress and the Constitution. And to think that this great House and the committee which I'm proud to chair would even have to consider what they're thinking, if they're thinking at all on the other side, to decide what we're going to legislate outrages me.     
   Two, whatever the President says he's going to do or may do--we understand that he's addicted to veto, but that shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing. 
   And why do I think basically it's the right thing? Well, it has to be if you want to extend it for 5 years. So your vote on this, after the motion to recommit dies on this floor, is going to be very interesting as to if you want it for 5, why wouldn't you want to extend it at least for 1? 
   Lastly, I wish that I had some time to share with my friend, whom I've enjoyed working with as the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, to ask him how much money do you think they have in Japan and China to loan us? There must be some limit to their capacity. 
   Our bill costs about $125 billion altogether, I think. $54 billion for the energy provisions as well as for this. So I assume that you want to add another $200 billion to that. And I don't remember you using the creative language that you used when you and the Senate--that you and the other body, whatever they call themselves--decided that you don't have to pay for the alternative minimum tax. 
   First of all, if I understood that, I'll take it home to my wife and explain that there are ways that you can lose revenue and not renew it and still not change your lifestyle. And if it works at home, I will come here, and at least for the next Congress, ask Mr. McCrery, if he can't stay over there, come on our side and explain how, if the President puts in the budget that we should be expecting money from these 25 million hostages that shouldn't have to pay the tax, that we don't have to make up for the money. 
   So I assume that you have now extended this to cover the extenders. And I hope really that you would stick around a little while so that you will be able to work with me and the next President, not to explain why in the last 8 years we haven't reformed this doggone tax system. Most of this stuff shouldn't be in the Tax Code. You know it and I know it. And the things that should be in the Tax Code should be made permanent. The stuff that shouldn't be in there should be taken out. 
   So in 8 years, the President is now talking about vetoing. Why didn't he take enough time to say, Let's straighten out the code, let's attempt to balance the budget, let's do the right thing for energy and whatever has to be in an extender that expires, help us to get rid of it without being charged with raising taxes. Any extender that expires, we would say that it raises taxes. 
   I know and Secretary Paulson knows, and we'll be hearing more from him probably after he leaves the administration, that this House has the responsibility of having a Tax Code that is simple, that is economically inspiring, and is something that can be confident and things shouldn't expire. If they expire, they shouldn't be in there in the first place. If it is good, it should stay in the Tax Code so there's reliability. 
   And if you're going to say that we're not going to get revenues as a result of extending this, we say for 1 year, we will raise the money, we will do it the right way, we will be proud of it, and in a small way attempt to stop this deficit. 
   But be kind to the people in Japan. Be kind to the people in China. They can't forever support everything that the Republicans want. 
   We're going to have to make sacrifices if we want to make changes. So this war is one against ignorance and not having the research and development. It's one in trying to have research and development for our corporations, but, more importantly, to find alternatives to this addiction that we have. 
   So you have been there for 8 years. Please don't try to change the things in 10 minutes here. Join with us. Let's work together in a bipartisan way, and let's mark down this day that is a day that House Democrats and Republicans said, stop the addiction, move to the alternatives, and dedicate ourselves to having a reformed Tax Code, if not this year then certainly next year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the veto, of the President demonstrating once again a reckless, mean-spirited disregard of the health of our children, our poor folks, and now the aging. And yet I stand on the floor proud of the fact that we're on the brink of a new day, where people like Chairman Stark, working with Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone, will be able to create a system where, whether you're old or young or live in rural or urban areas, that health care is going to be a priority, and we don't have to come to this floor and fight each other as to who can be the meanest in denying people health care. 
   And so I just want the people to know that this really isn't a question of Republican and Democrats because, to some extent, we're united in sending a message to the President: Think about what you're doing to the American people and try to help us to move forward. I hope I'm not violating the rules by saying that. 
   When Ted Kennedy got out of his sick bed and walked over to the Senate  floor, it wasn't a Democratic Senator speaking to a bipartisan Senate. It was the voice of someone who has demonstrated compassion for all of the things that all of us believe in. As a result of that, he has brought us together. Let us stay together; and let's send a message to the President, his days of doing us harm are very, very limited. 
   I yield the balance of my time to Chairman Stark.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, once again I find myself thanking Mr. McCrery, the ranking member, and members of the minority on the Ways and Means Committee for moving forward to a piece of legislation, agreeing that it go to the suspension calendar and, more importantly, working with us in bringing about changes in order to make certain that we have a pay-for that is appreciated by the House. 
   This is important legislation. The Nation suffered a tremendous natural setback with Katrina. Thousands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana felt the pain. And somehow we are sluggishly moving towards some type of solution of this real problem. 
   One of the major problems, of course, is housing, people not being able to come back. We on the Ways and Means Committee can play some small part in putting together tax incentives to move forward, to make certain that these people have a place to stay and go back to their home. 
   More important, I am so pleased that JOHN LEWIS will be managing this bill, a man of compassion, a man of understanding, a man that understands the real pain that people have felt and continue to feel. I don't think there is any Member in the House that I would rather see associated with a bill that brings some type of relief to people who have felt so much pain. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I would like to ask Mr. Lewis from the sovereign State of Georgia, an outstanding Member of Congress, to  manage the remainder of this time and to distribute it as he sees fit.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I stand in support of overriding the President's veto, not for the reasons given by Chairman Dingell, because it's the right and moral position, because that has existed all of the time, and yet we've been unsuccessful. 
   But I would say to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) that since the last time this has come up, the President has admitted that we are going toward a recession and that the economy may be jeopardized unless the Congress supported a stimulus package. 
   It would just seem to me that if it's recognized that our States are going to go into deficit, our Governors are going to have serious problems, and that it is very possible, if not likely, that services for our kids would be further cut under Medicaid. It would seem to me that a legitimate argument could be made that, by providing care for these 11 million children, it allows their parents to know that they'll be able to be more productive knowing that their kids are covered by health insurance. 
   It's sad that the poor now have to be used merely as a vehicle to stimulate our economy. But had we taken care of these people during the robust great economic times, perhaps we would not be going through this struggle. 
   So it appears to me that this is another opportunity that the minority would have, not just to do the moral thing, but to do the economic thing, and to be of some assistance to the Governors who are screaming out for the continuation of this program, indeed, the expansion of it. 
   And we're not talking about just adults being restricted, but we talk about adults being in a better chance to be productive knowing that their kids are being taken care of. So we do have this new opportunity for the minority to rethink their position and to do it, again, because it's the economic thing to do and to know that being able to detect serious illnesses, sight problems, hearing problems for our children at an early age, that we really are strengthening the economy so we don't have to pay for these health setbacks and sometimes detection of chronic diseases at a later stage.     
   So instead of talking compassion, which obviously is not a compelling argument on the other side, let's talk economically and ask the question of economists, whether or not expanding preventative care for our children in health care is really strengthening the economy and saving money in the future with all the restrictions, you know, kicking illegal aliens out and making certain that adults don't participate, all of those things that make you feel good, we would go along with as we have in the past. 
   But let's make certain that every child that can be treated would be treated, and so I support the override.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, this is a very exciting, historic day for me. It was an opportunity to break a deadlock of lack of civility on the Ways and Means Committee, which I really, deeply appreciate being a member, as well as being Chair; to get to know Jim McCrery, not as a Republican, but as someone that we can have serious philosophical and political differences, at the same time want to do what's best for our constituents and our country; for Sandy Levin who is more than a Member of Congress, but in the marrow of his bones he understands what it is for working people to have opportunity  to have self-esteem and to want to do for themselves, their community and their children; and to have a Speaker like Nancy Pelosi, who's prepared to think as to what's not best for Democrats or even the Congress, but what's best for the country and to encourage people who have different views to come together, so that nobody from any country could say that we have a trade policy that's Republican or Democrat, but we have in the United States of America a United States trade policy. 
   This is a very historic vote. It breaks the ice and opens an opportunity. But also it brings about a lot of candid discussion. And I would suggest, for any Member that has campaigned against trade, that said it over and over that trade is bad, or any person who's campaigned against NAFTA or CAFTA, or all of those things which this is not, then you owe it to yourself and you owe it to your constituents to vote against this bill, because if, in your conscience, you believe that things are so bad in your district, people have lost jobs, lost homes, lost hope, and this country has let them down and the multinationals have let them down and trade agreements have let them down, then your conscience demands that you vote ``no'' because this is what you believe in and this is what you should do. 
   But for those people who truly believe that they come from communities that God has blessed them with the opportunity to grow more food than this Nation needs, to make more equipment than this Nation needs, and to know that in their towns and villages and congressional districts, they cannot eat and they cannot use, for those people who understand that exporting things means not that we're trying to help other countries, but we need the talents, we need the productivity, we need the competition, we need the workers for the Nation to survive, for those people like the State of New York, there are patches there that people have no hope for the future, and they would want to vote against it. 
   But they'd better not talk with my mayor, because services are going to be a boon directly for all the people in our city.

   But this is a heck of a time to make certain that we're not known to be against trade. We're for trade. We're for trade that makes sense in terms of honesty, job creation, and what's good for each and every American. 
   Do we have a long way to go? Yes.

   Anytime we're taking down trade barriers and countries are open to buy what we make in the U.S.A., it's almost unpatriotic not to let them do what we do best.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is an extraordinary time for those of us in the Congress, because a constitutional change is taking place that never was expected, and that is where the minority in the Senate can actually dictate to the House of Representatives exactly what they will and what they won't do. And so the whole question of whether or not the fiscal responsibility of supporting revenues for this bill is even going to be considered is something that we cannot expect the Senate ever to respond to because they need 60 votes in order to fulfill their Senate responsibility. 
   So what do we have on the floor today? We have the principle that most Republicans as well as Democrats have agreed to in the past, and that is that the time has come for us to be fiscally responsible. 
   Now, when the Congressional Budget Office has an item in this budget and it is called the alternative minimum tax and they put in that budget a receipt of $50 billion, it means to me and should mean to others that if you are going to delete that provision, you are deleting the $50 billion. And in order for the books to be balanced, as any family, any corporation, and I hope most intelligent and motivated countries, you raise the revenue to pay for it. 
   So this is not happening. The President says you don't have to pay for it. Go to the Japanese, go to the Chinese, borrow. And why should you pay? Let your children and your grandchildren pay for this tax relief that was never but never expected that it would hit these middle-class people. 
   Now, what are our options? We could stick to our fiscal guns. We could say the right thing to do is not to pass a bill that is not paid for. We could say that the taxpayers are not really entitled to the benefits of waiving the PAYGO rules. Or, we could say, why hold 23 million taxpayers hostage because of the irresponsibility of the minority in not being willing to pay for this, no matter how many alternatives we give them? 
   Well, we choose to say, protect the taxpayer. Forget the loopholes, forget the revenue losses, forget the indebtedness, at least for now, because we don't want those hardworking people, most of them hardworking couples with children and with deductions, to wake up in the morning and find there is a feud between the House and the Senate and the Republicans and the Democrats that would cause them to carry this burden. And the President says, remove it and don't pay for it. 
   Well, we come out on the side of the taxpayers, and we just hope that we can pass this suspension, get on with the protection, and then, in a responsible way, maybe the Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate can deal with this in a more permanent way next year. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that those that are listening come to the floor on this historic occasion as we hope that we can reverse the thinking in the House and the Senate in pay-fors. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

That's why for 7 years the President never did anything to remove it. He never expected it to hit the people. That's why every year except this year he put it in the budget and expected the $50 billion. No one ever expected this to exist. That's why the Congressional Budget Office says we should be getting $50 billion. This argument is so persuasive, I can't wait to get home to explain it to my creditors.

   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I have two requests. One, that Dr. McDermott, one of our most expert legislators, who is trained as a psychiatrist, be given the opportunity to try to bring some reasonableness to the last speaker's remarks for 1 minute. 
   And also, that I be allowed to yield the balance of my time to the chairman, Richard Neal, of the Select Committee on Revenues, who had the responsibility of guiding us through the alternative minimum tax.

   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, at the end of this day, notwithstanding the philosophical arguments that we have exchanged on this floor and whatever they do in the other body, the American people and taxpayers are going to ask the question, Did this Congress deliberately allow a $50 billion tax burden to fall on their shoulders? And we have to be in the position to say we have a long way to go in getting our tax reform straight. But it would be just so totally unfair for people to say that because of our differences of opinion that on this close to Christmas Day, we have blessed them with billions of dollars of a tax burden that they should not have. 
   It was the Congress that allowed this to go forward in 1969 without fixing it for indexing. And I hope it will be this Congress that would say that we remove this burden. 
   I do really hope that even though this President has only 1 year left in his term of office that somewhere, maybe the Treasury Secretary, maybe the Republican leadership, that they might come forward with any plan or some plan to remove the alternative minimum tax. And even though we know it's going to cost over $800 billion or maybe $1 trillion, I just hope that maybe next year that it's not smoke and mirrors and we didn't intend to tax in the first place, but we either cut programs or raise the revenue but, for God's sake, not only do the right thing for our taxpayers that are out there today wondering what we are going to do, but for those taxpayers that decades from now after many of us have gone, they'll ask the question, Why did you burden us with this load? Why did you have us to have to pay this indebtedness to Japan, to China? And why didn't you do the right thing?

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the minority ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee and our staffs for working to bring some relief to those people that are feeling the problems of the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   I want to make a special thanks to Congressman ROB ANDREWS, whose creativity in working with the committee, along with ZACH SPACE, gave us the direction to remove some of the inequities that may relieve some of the pain that people are feeling. 
   It's a commonsense piece of legislation that when the banks and those that hold the mortgage decide to give forgiveness on some parts of that loan, that these parts of the loan not be considered as income and does not create a taxable event. So we do that. We passed it out by voice vote because it just made a lot of sense. 
   In addition to that, we make it easier for people to extend their mortgage insurance, as well as those people who own condos, to be able to get relief from debts that they may have by getting long-term extension of private mortgage insurance on all of them. 
   Finally, the bill makes it easier for taxpayers to form housing cooperation co-ops. 
   We give a general relief and at the same time make it more difficult for people to move into their rentals or vacation homes and enjoy the same tax relief as they move from their original homes. In other words, they can only get the tax relief for that part of the time they actually lived in the rental or the vacation home, rather than having the luxury of moving from one vacation home to the other and enjoying the tax benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to one of the hardest-working members of the committee that spent a lot of time on this subject matter, Mr. Blumenauer, and allow him to delegate the time as requested by other Members of the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as most of us know, some time ago in 1991, President Bush, with bipartisan support, reached out to the Andean countries and extended favorable treatment as related to their exports to the United States. 
   This has proven successful in making it possible for these countries to get substitute crops for coca, and, therefore, it has been tremendously successful in building up a market for the people in this area, as well as people in the United States of America. 
   Right now, however, there are four free trade agreements that are pending that haven't passed the House as yet, which includes, of course, Peru. So as we speak, there are two countries for which free trade agreements have not been negotiated, Colombia and Peru. If we were to allow this provision to expire, we would find ourselves in the situation where these countries and their tariffs would be in disarray. 
   Because of the shortness of notice, and because we have to avoid the expiration, I have been able to work with Mr. McCrery in our committee to get, not a 2-year extension that we would really want, but at least an 8-month extension to avoid irreparable damage from being caused during this period, at which time we will again able to review the situation in the free trade agreements and also the substance of the continuation of the Andean Trade Preference Act, trade promotion agreements.     
   I also would like to say, in working with Mr. McCrery of the committee, the Members of this House should know that the cooperative spirit in which we got this extension extended to the point that we had to really go to the other Chamber in order to work out what we're able to do today. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. Let me thank my dear friend from Washington and indicate that I share your concern. At the end of the day, America must have a trade policy that helps workers here at home and provides opportunities for workers overseas. As the Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, I can assure you that I will work with you and others to be sure that we can improve our trade policy as it relates to developing countries. 
   In the case of GSP and the benefits the administration may propose to eliminate, let me make it abundantly clear that on our watch we're going to expand opportunities to the developing world and not curtail them. 
   I'm pleased to know that you're working on some innovative ways to improve our trading ties with Africa and Least Developed Nations. Let it be clear to you, the Congress and everyone else that if the administration proposes to impose tariffs on products coming from poor countries, and that such tariffs serve no development purpose, I will be working with you to move toward legislation to prevent that from happening. 
   And let me add this, that your constant concern about making America look like it's a country for freedom and opportunity and providing trade with these nations has been indicated by your leadership in the African growth and opportunity bill, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and I hope to continue to work with you to bring opportunities for people in developing countries and make our country all that she can be.

   Mr. RANGEL. I know that some of you may wonder why an old man like me from Harlem would have an interest in the ag bill, but when I hear my distinguished colleague from New York talk about muck farming, it's very important to us as a farm State that we be involved in those type of things. But the truth of the matter is that, while I recognize there are times to be quiet and to listen and look intelligent, I had Earl Pomeroy right there at my side asking, what are they talking about? 
   I've learned a lot about trust funds that I didn't even know existed--and some of you didn't know. But the truth of the matter is that, while I recognize that Mr. Kind was looking for a bill that, as a person that concerned themselves in agriculture, that at the end of the day we have to play the cards that have been given to us. And so I do know the good that has come out of this bill and the pride that I got as a Member of this Congress and seeing the work that Mr. Peterson has been able to do, working with the Republicans on the other side, in all parts of the bill, in all parts of the leadership on the House and on the Senate side and with them. And I'm telling you, if all of us could have the optimism that he has displayed in the last few years about the salvation of our country, we would have no problems. 
   It was like a big jigsaw puzzle, and each time he told me we got the last piece there, and when he plugged it in, something even bigger dropped out. We buried this bill so many times, but I'm glad to see that, through the bipartisanship, the friendship, and the cooperation, we will be able to give this country and the world a product that we're proud of, a product that our farmers have worked on to be able to be the food basket not only of the world, with special provisions, but of the many people in our great country that are so in need of food. I'm proud to be a Member and proud to be a part of this.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Father Robert F. Drinan, his enduring faith, and lifelong commitment to human rights. Father Drinan passed on January 28, 2007, at his residence in the Georgetown University Jesuit community in Washington, DC. He was 86 years old and had recently been ill with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. 
   Father Drinan was an unwavering defender of the civil and human rights of all Americans. His commitment to these principles was anchored by his religious conviction and a fundamental belief in the rights of all people to be respected and protected by their governments and elected leaders. It was this conviction that led Father Drinan to politics in 1970 when he sought a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. During his tenure in Congress, Father Drinan was an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War and was the first person to call for the impeachment of President Nixon. Father Drinan was re-elected four times, serving from 1971 until 1981. He stepped down in accordance with a directive from Pope John Paul II, barring priests from holding public office. 
   Father Drinan was the first Roman Catholic priest to serve as a voting member of the U.S. Congress. I had the honor of serving with him on the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate proceedings. He was a man of deep convictions, a passionate leader and a good friend. Long after he left Congress, Father Drinan continued to be a vocal supporter of human rights. Through his words and his actions he demanded morality in our political leadership. Ever committed to his work, Father Drinan spent the past 21 years as a professor  at the Georgetown Law Center where he focused on legal ethics and international human rights. 
   We all mourn the loss of Father Robert F. Drinan, a man who committed his life to standing up for what he believed. He will be greatly missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wish we weren't legislating this way, as the gentleman has pointed out, on the suspension calendar, but as you know, it's difficult working with the other House. They have our CHAMP bill over there, and there is no telling what we might do if we don't come right now and deal with this emergency before these provisions expire. 
   This would allow the Secretary to add preventative benefits without waiting for the Congress. It would help us out in Medicare. And we have been able to gather the support of the doctors, the hospitals, the pharmacists, those that are concerned with durable medical expenses, the dialysis people, wheelchair. And so we made an attempt, even though it is patchwork and it's not a piece of legislation we're proud of. But if we don't move in this House, the effects of not doing anything would be more detrimental than trying to get a perfect bill. 
   We have been working desperately hard to try to get something that all of the people could agree to, but, unfortunately, we haven't had an opportunity to do that. And we also are concerned with the teaching hospitals with suggestions that we have heard that they would pay for the whole thing when we know that a physician's fee for service is an area that should equally bear the costs of trying to get this legislation through. 
   So I really don't think we have much of a choice. Our votes are being recorded. People are watching what we do. And I do hope that we can do a better job next year. But the whole idea is to make certain that the House is responsible, and while we don't have any indication of what's going to happen in the other body, it seems to me that we should move on this bill. 
   I want to thank Congressman Stark for the great work he and his staff have done. It's always a moving target as to what we can get in, what we can't get in. But I don't think there is anyplace we can go for now except to support the suspension, and then whatever corrections we have to do, we should do it next year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Chairman, it's an honor for me to be here. I wish that we didn't have to mark up the SCHIP bill so that I could be here for the rest of the theater. 
   I have been overly impressed with the remarkable bipartisan work that Mr. Goodlatte and Chairman Peterson have been doing on a very complicated piece of legislation. And I was very surprised that, with their ability to, so-call, offset the expenditures of the bill, that they came to the conclusion that when it came to food stamps they ran out of money.     
   Ran out of money to such an extent that I was really completely taken off guard when they told me that the Ways and Means Committee should provide $4 billion to pay for the food stamps. And I admit I don't follow the Agriculture Committee's work as closely as I should have. But knowing that Republicans as well as Democrats wanted to make certain that 26 million people will continue to have food stamps, I said, where would you expect the tax-writing committee to get the money that is necessary to keep this bipartisan agreement to? I assume if you went to the Energy and Commerce Committee, you would be going there for energy. If you went to the Transportation Committee, you would go there for transportation. And I assume that we talk the same language, and the Ways and Means Committee is the tax-writing committee. 
   And when you said it was important to maintain this bipartisan agreement, I looked over the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. It wasn't $4 billion in Social Security. It wasn't $4 billion in Medicare. It wasn't $4 billion in training, though we were working hard to make certain to break down the barriers so that our farmers could go overseas. 
   So there is not one living person on the Agriculture Committee that didn't ask me to get it out of what? Taxes. Sorry to use that word, and I don't know who is offended. But we felt that we weren't going to raise individual taxes. We weren't going to increase corporate taxes. So I thought that common sense and political sense would mean that we would find out who is not paying taxes and bring that revenue in so that we can have a bipartisan agreement in the House and the Senate in order to do this. 
   Now, strange things can happen, and it appears as though it has. But I just want you to know that you can call it offset. You can call it revenue enhancement. And we call it fraud and evasion and equity and fair play. And it is coming out of the tax-writing committee. 
   I just hope you never come to the tax-writing committee and ask for relief and, when you get it, say you don't want tax increases.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition because I'm supporting the spirit and the rule. 
   Let me make some things abundantly clear that this would not only not violate the spirit in which we are doing this, but 60 years ago Charles Rangel was a high school dropout on the streets of Lenox Avenue, and the only thing that brings him to this Congress is the G.I. Bill. And in my community, where only four out of 10 kids manage to finish high school, I've devoted my entire life in working with the public and private sector in trying to keep our kids in school, and giving them the opportunity to get an education. 
   The days that we think that education is a local issue are over. As we move toward globalization, it is going to be far more important for every  young person, every person in this country to be exposed, to get the education, and to compete. 
   This is not a question of Federal funds being used to start anything. The City University came and asked would I start a drive to raise the money, which they already raised $25 million, in order to do this. And all the office things that you're talking about, when you talk about archives, it means after I leave here. And I do hope that there would be an office there, as we bring people in to encourage people to get an education, to go into public service. I cannot think of anything that I am more proud of. I wish we had more of this type of thing. 
   And so it just seems to me, as you have seen fit to apply for an earmark here, that you understand what it is. I've been in office for 38 years, I don't need any accolades. My community has given me that. My predecessor served for 26 years before me. So I do hope that when you start talking about we understand that you can do this, but we're anxious to make certain that people don't want this, anybody that has given 38 of their years to the Congress, anybody that was able to go back to high school under the G.I. Bill when they were 23, anybody that spends his time inspiring kids to go to school, to stay in school, to get an education, to get married, make contributions in anybody's community, and the city college that stood on a hill, where I had no idea that it was a college when I was a kid since nobody in my family had gone to college, anybody that can get this Congress to support something like that, I would laud not only the success in getting it done, but the spirit in which it's being done.

   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Campbell, I would like to answer you. I would have a problem if you did it because I don't think that you've been around long enough that having your name on something to inspire a building like this in a school--it might be that it would be in order for you to get publicity and to get reelected. But since I've been here 38 years and have not really had any opposition from the other side, it doesn't serve any function for me, except to try to encourage people to participate with government, local government, teachers, in order to keep our kids in school. 
   So, I am proud of the fact that they're using my name in order to create this. And it's going to be created. As I said, if you had gone to the Web site, you would have gotten a number, you could have gotten in touch with President Williams, he would have told you we've collected $25 million, and that would be it. 
   So, not only do I not see anything wrong, but I wish more public servants that have the ability to do this would get involved in this type of thing. I think it's very important.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I hope that this could be considered the National Lobbyist Day for the middle class, because, certainly, this is what we are trying to do. 
   Let's talk about the issues that we agree on. The alternative minimum tax was a bad idea when it got started in 1969; it's a worse idea now. If the House and Senate and President fail these taxpayers that are being held hostage for a tax that everyone knows is unfair and inequitable and should never have existed, then it would not be a Republican or Democratic issue; it would be that this country let them down. In doing so, we would have violated the trust that we hope that people would have in the tax system. At the end of the day we are committed to eliminate this tax. 
   My good friend Mr. McCrery and I had agreed early on that the only way you can tackle such a big fiscal problem is through tax reform. So it's clear that we can't do that this year; and so if we do nothing, 23 million hardworking people would be hit with this unfair tax, and we are committed that it's not going to happen. We can talk about that, but I don't think it's necessary. 
   As far as the extenders are concerned, I really think they speak for themselves. Mr. McCrery and I wish we had enough time to really study each and every one of them as well as other parts of the Code to see whether or not it serves any economic function, but time is not our friend, and so we agreed that we would extend these expiring provisions and review them when we have more time next year. So that's not an issue. 
   The issue has to be how do you pay for it. This is where we are going to have some major fiscal and political problems. Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office would say that if we did nothing and this unfair tax was not changed, that we would raise $50 billion. That means that even though they may think and hope that we don't do this, they haven't scored that we have to recognize that $50 billion is not going to be there and we, abiding by what we think is fiscally sound provisions in PAYGO, have to recognize that if we do the right thing, we'll be $50 billion short. 
   What are our options? One, to cut spending by $50 billion. Well, theoretically it may be an option, but politically it's not. 
   The second thing we could do is raise the revenue. Very interesting, because the major part of the debate if we had time would be if you saw the most outrageous abuse of the tax system where someone was getting preferential treatment and that the only reaction would be how could that happen, and you wanted to close it, take my word for it, to the person that you are closing, what they call an incentive will be considered by them as a tax increase. 
   Even Secretary Paulson, who wants us to dramatically reduce the corporate rate of taxes, I can't wait to hear how he intends to pay for it, because I know he is going to be talking about unfair advantages that's in the Code, and some Democrat is going to call it a tax increase if he closes the loopholes. 
   It's really a semantic thing; it's a political thing. But I suggest to you that even if we were not looking at this as a revenue raiser, and you take a look at what we are using, how could you possibly call it a tax increase when we are trying to bring some degree of equity to the system? 
   It's simple: when people are doing their job, and, I might add, a very good job, in managing other people's money, in creating jobs, in making the economy more prosperous, and making hundreds of millions and billions of dollars  because they have earned it the hard way, creative fiscal management.     
   And they pay 35 percent in taxes because it's their income, the same way you sell a house, it's your income. You have a law case and they give it to you, it's your income and you pay 35 percent income. 
   Now, we would like to believe that capital gains taxes means that you're special people, you actually are investing capital. My God, you're taking risks, and so we're going to give you a lower tax rate of 15 percent. But if you find someone who would say that, well, I'm not taking risk but I'm a partnership, and I really think that the way they're paying me, even though it's the same as the competitors are being paid, I have decided that this has been a return on a capital investment. Why shouldn't all of the debate today be on the turning point? When two people are doing the same thing equally as well, and really, being rewarded in a very generous way, why should one group be treated differently than the other group? And if you want to call it a tax increase and bringing equity and fairness to the system and making the field even as it relates to the Tax Code, let's talk about this, because I'll bring some arguments and statements for the people doing the same job and paying 35 percent interest, and they're just as creative, just as good, and they ain't thinking about leaving the business. And so that ends the argument, except for the ones that I'm anxious to hear from my dear friends on the other side of the aisle, because they're not just saying that they're going to stick with their buddies with carried interest. They're saying that we really don't have to deal with this at all. And once I'm convinced that they're right, I'm going to try to do this at home, and that is, we expected $50 billion. You're going to have to live without the $50 billion, but you don't have to cut your expenses by $50 billion, nor do you have to raise the revenue for $50 billion. As a matter of fact, you don't have to do anything. Act like it never happened. 
   This is not a tax cut. This is preventing a tax increase, so therefore, the money that you expected, the $50 billion, you shouldn't have. 
   Now, on our side of the aisle, we spell that B-O-R-R-O-W-I-N-G, ``borrowing.'' I know that word is so distasteful to you, but where I got it from was Chairman Greenspan. He said, I supported the Bush tax cuts, but I wanted them to really cut spending. And what did they do? B-O-R-R-O-W-I-N-G. 
   Well, you may not like the word, but at the end of the day, every Congressman's going to tell you, if you expected $50 billion, you thought it was unfair to tax people that, you removed the burden, you've got to do one of three things: pay for it, cut spending, or borrow the money. You've decided to find words to make it more comfortable to borrow the money. And I'm anxious to hear that, because if it works for you, I'm going to try to convince my leadership to have it work for us, because pay-as-you-go may be fiscally sound, but I have so many problems with infrastructure, so many problems with health, so many problems with education, that if I can find a way as great as you have, it may work for all of us. But I really don't think that that is going to fly. The American people deserve help. 
   I reserve the balance of the time as I anxiously await to hear the minority explain why this is not borrowing.

   And I always get the impression, since the FTA with Korea that's been left out of the discussion with me, that when the administration believes it has completed its negotiation on the executive level, then they too would be coming back to the Congress. 
   And of course Colombia has its own special problems, which we can talk about at a different time. So I just wanted to say, as it relates to Panama and Korea, it was my impression that the administration has to make some major decisions before we can respond.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3996, TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of the Rules Committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity, and thank you for allowing me to follow my friend, Mr. Dreier. I just hope that I don't drink the water on that side of the aisle because it's very difficult for me to follow in the logic. 
   Let's talk about where we are in complete accord. Whoever thought of this cockamamie idea in 1969 was wrong. And as far as the voters are concerned, you can call yourself Republican or Democrat, who now holds them hostage, but if we don't give them relief, you can bet your life it's going to be the Congress of the United States and this President. 
   The President realizes we should eliminate this. He hasn't given us a plan, an idea, a thought, just get rid of it. And the Congressional Budget Office says that if we don't get rid of it, that $50 billion will be coming into our budget, we will have $50 billion. Common logic would dictate that if we do get rid of the AMT, which is the right thing to do, that we will lose $50 billion from the budget. What happens at home? What happens with a corporation? What happens with this congressional board of directors if we find with the budget that $50 billion that's missing? One of the things we can do is cut spending, by what? $50 billion. Another thing we could do is say forget about it. We did it before with the tax cut, just borrow the money. Just borrow $50 billion. I guess you can call that repealing. Or we could say the responsible thing to do is raise the additional revenue. 
   Standing by itself, forgetting the fact that it's a pay-for, who in the world would believe that it's fair for corporations and partnerships to be doing the same work, managing other people's money, being successful, making this great contribution to society, except one group pays 15 percent because they've created the imagination that their work is really capital, when they take no risk, and the others give 35 percent. Fairness dictates this is not a tax increase. This is a closing of a loophole, and you should be proud to participate in that.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, now that the dust has settled and the parliamentary games have been played and some of the facts that have been distorted have been corrected, we reach the point that at the end of the line the question is going to be: Did you vote for health care for 10 million children and did you vote to support the $35 billion that is necessary to do it? 
   I don't think that any of the families of the children or the Governors or the agencies that are just waiting to see what is going to happen are very interested in the distortions continuing. It is going to be very, very simple. Which way do you vote, and if you did not vote for the bill, why didn't you? 
   Now there may be some particular loyalty to the President, but you have to remember that when these voters and people come to you, the President's veto message will not be stapled to you and you will have to, on your own, be able to explain why you thought what he said was true. That's why we rely heavily on some of the President's strongest supporters, Senator ORRIN HATCH and Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, because as a Democrat, I am kind of used to Republicans beating up on me, but I am not used to them beating up on the Republican leaders in the Senate such as ORRIN HATCH and CHUCK GRASSLEY. This is particularly so since the Senate has assumed so much responsibility in putting together this bill which neither you nor I like, but what the heck, we have to play the hand that is dealt. 
   So remember that just by attacking personalities, it may be like getting into a firing squad that is in a circle and we find everybody shooting at each other. But really, the winners and losers are going to be those children without health coverage and their families who are struggling hard. And ultimately, these kids are really America. It takes so much to take care of some of the illnesses that could be detected. 
   And as sensitive as the President is to the poor that are smoking and having the tobacco tax increase, tobacco smoking is dangerous for America and for our health system. It is very expensive, and it is a deterrent to children smoking. 
   So when all of this is done, I don't know how many people are going to ask you why did you vote no. But please remember that many of the reasons that are stated today, the truth will be caught up to the allegations and you will have to have a better answer. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, let me stand in a sense of bipartisanship, especially to my Republican friends, and remind you that come the next election, President Bush is going to be there at his ranch in Texas, and he will not be with you at the polls. 
   I say that because by that time the truth will have caught up with the message that the President is giving and most of you are using to sustain the President's veto. 
   Let me get to the one that I'm most familiar with, this $83,000 ability of people to enjoy SCHIP. No one is more familiar with this than I am. It was the great State of New York that exercised its request for a waiver to ask the President of the United States whether or not a family of four would be allowed to buy in, even though they were making $83,000. And guess what, under existing law, not new law, the President of the United States says, hell, no, you can't do it. 
   So we've got to emphasize over and over again, you could ask for it for $1 million because it's not an entitlement, it's a block grant, and the Governors can ask for anything they want over 200 percent over poverty, and the President, Republican or Democrat or whoever she might be, will be able to say, no, you're not going to be able to do it. So knock that out. 
   And for all of the people that are upset with immigrants, legal or illegal,  we're just going to put in big letters so that by the time November gets here that in the bill that the President has vetoed it says no illegal alien can receive the benefits of the bill. 
   And since you're so against adults receiving benefits, the bill is eliminating adults. 
   So if you can't be with us today, try to think of yourself in November, and maybe we can work out something.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I wish that we had had more time to have gone into the details of this proposal, but I want to point out that we have an opportunity to allow the administration to decide how we can best reduce the price of drugs for all people and to give him the discretion to use every tool that we have in the Congress. Now, some people on the other side have indicated that this is price control and the free marketplace should work its will. It appears to me that common sense and judgment would say that the Secretary should have every available tool that he or she thinks is necessary in order to reach this common goal that we want to reach. 
   Just saying that the power to negotiate prices, which you have to admit sounds like it makes good sense, would be restricted and prohibited by the person responsible for reaching the goal of lower prices makes no sense at all. If indeed some of the objections that have been raised by those who don't have the responsibility that the Secretary has, if they truly believe this is an impediment to reach that goal, then I think that all of us in the Congress have the responsibility to change the law and to do whatever is necessary in order to reach that goal. 
   To say that someone is prohibited from participating in the reduction of that price, the price of the drugs when they can buy in quantity defies common sense and reason. This is especially so since we would like to assume that the pharmaceutical industry would be partners with us in getting the maximum amount of medicine necessary to those who need it. And even if we had no knowledge of the facts at all as to what works and doesn't work, the protest that is coming from the pharmaceutical industry should indicate that there is something wrong with the system if they do not trust the Federal Government to negotiate fairly. 
   So for all of those reasons, I hope that those who have a problem with the bill would recognize that this is just the beginning of a process to improve upon what we already have and that if there are any problems, that we will be coming back to the committee to try to make those adjustments that would be necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time for purposes of controlling the time on this bill to Mr. Stark, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and who spent a tremendous amount of time on this. 
   And, believe me, there is no politics involved in it. We all want to achieve a common goal, and I think this just removes the restriction on the Secretary so that together we can be of assistance.

   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may utilize. 
   Madam Speaker, I have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the tax divisions of H.R. 5140. The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and the legislative intent behind this important legislation. This explanation document, JCX-16-08, is currently available on the joint committee's Web site. 
   Madam Speaker, first and foremost, I want to extend my deep appreciation for Speaker Pelosi, for her leadership and commitment to a bipartisan spirit, and to the minority leader, Mr. Boehner, for his hard work and the cooperation as we move toward this truly critical legislation. 
   In addition, I want to thank my friend, Hank Paulson, for working to broker a compromise between the Congress and an administration that not before had indicated the depth of cooperation that the Secretary of the Treasury invoked. 
   Finally, I would like to thank the Senate leadership for recognizing the urgency of this relief and finally getting to work to ensure its quick passage today, enabling the House to pass the Senate amendment and delivering it to the President's desk. 
   I also would like to thank Mr. McCrery, who made it easy for us to work with our leadership in the House to cooperate with the administration to make certain that our mission to speedily pass the stimulus bill was done and sent over to the Senate. 
   I also want to point out that they should give us all, in our country, and indeed in this House, an opportunity to see that we are not sending these hundreds of billions of dollars in rebate dollars to the people that need it out of compassion. We are not sending it to them because we think it's right that they should put a roof over their heads or clothing on their backs or provide food on the table. We are doing it because, once again, we want to stimulate the economy, and therefore, it means that we want goods and services to be purchased. 
   We do this and we support this effort because the economists say it's the right thing to do and we do it because these are the people, middle-class people, lower income people, hardworking people, disabled veterans, we do it because it's the right thing to do. But, Madam Speaker, my colleagues in the House, I hope when this recession is over, and it will be over, that we'll take a good look at the people that we are talking about today, and we should be able to say that there is something wrong with this picture and there is something wrong when we can find millions of people unable to provide the basic goods and services they need and, at the same time, find that those who are most affluent are not even disturbed by the recession that we find ourselves in today. 
   And so we should be pleased that the Congress is doing the right thing. But we also should also remember that it is not with a lot of dignity and pride that people receive this assistance. They receive it because, as the economists and elitists said, they're going to spend this money because they have to spend this money. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Chairman, let me once again thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for the bipartisan work that they have put into allowing this great bill to reach the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think this amendment is going to be a real win for America and a win for American farmers and a win for democracy. What it allows is that the people in Cuba can purchase hundreds of millions of dollars of goods from our farmers and be able to pay directly to U.S. banks without going through the red tape with the restrictions that we have on their visas and having to go to third countries. 
   Close to 50 years ago, someone came up with the great idea that in order to get rid of Castro and the communist government, that we should put an embargo on that country, which, of course, included food products that our great farmers are producing. Well, what has happened is that Castro is still there and we have gone through 10 presidents, and we are the only country that it appears as though has this embargo, which is truly ineffective. 
   Having said that, it would just seem to me that if we really want to win the hearts and minds of the people in Cuba, that we should make it abundantly clear that our greatest salesmen are our farmers, to be able to give food and nutrition to these people, and the money comes here and the food goes there. Hugo Chavez may be there trying to give them oil, but the poor people in Cuba can't eat oil. So this would open up the markets by hundreds of millions of dollars for wheat, pork, chicken, rice and beans, instead of having the Cubans go to Thailand and Europe, and indeed to go to Communist China. 
   Now, I know there is a lot of fear about communists, but if you take a look at our deficit with the People's Republic of China, if you see our exploding exchange with the communist government of Vietnam, give me a break. This has nothing to do with communism, very little to do with Cuba, and a heck of a lot to do as to how people are going to vote in Miami and in Florida as relates to Republicans and Democrats. 
   So we have a great opportunity to do what America does best: compete on the open market of competition. Let's try to take local and domestic politics out of it. 
   I know it is difficult, because those who oppose this, they don't like Castro. Well, I am 77 years old. Forty years of that has been fighting Castro with an embargo. Young people, that is not going to work.     
   If you want to get rid of Castro, let American enterprise, capitalism, farmers, food, liberty, justice, get that into Cuba, and that will bring the old man down. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RANGEL. So, ``the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said that this was a tax increase.'' What is this, Taxes 101? When you and other people come to me and say that we need to get this great bipartisan agriculture bill out, you didn't go to the chairman of the Transportation Committee. You didn't go to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. You went to the tax-writing committee. 
   Now, when you say you want revenue enhances, when you say you want to raise the money to pay for food stamps, it means you have to get it from somewhere. If you're lucky enough, if you work hard enough, you will find that certain people are not paying their fair share of taxes. And you would find that they go out of their way to go to foreign countries in order to avoid paying the United States obligation. 
   I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that as far as those people who don't pay any or little taxes, oh, yes, they will consider this a tax increase. Give me some language that I can call it something else. But I'm saying that equity and fair play means if you're not paying what you should pay and we catch up with you, you can run to your accountant and say, ``We gotcha.'' 
   Now, I can understand how philosophically you don't like to talk about taxes. But just, Mr. Ranking Member, when your time expired yesterday, you said on the floor that none of us ever came to you and asked for the money. Now, I don't know where you thought,  when you asked me where do you go to get the money, when I say ``you,'' I mean you by name.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF KATHERINE DUNHAM -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 655 Honoring the life of Katherine Dunham. Katherine Dunham was a woman of astounding grace and character who has altered for the better both our country and our world. 
    Born Katherine Mary Dunham in Chicago, Illinois on June 22, 1909, and raised in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, Dr. Dunham was among the first black artists to form a ballet troupe and achieve renown as a modern dancer and choreographer on Broadway and in Hollywood. Dr. Dunham passed away in May of 2006 and leaves behind a tremendous legacy of art, education and activism. 
    She has received countless honors and awards, including more than 10 honorary doctorates, the Presidential Medal of Arts, the French Legion of Honor, and the NAACP's Lifetime Achievement Award. 
    Dr. Dunham was responsible for exposing to mass audiences a side of black artistic expression that was rarely seen. At a time when minstrel shows with black face were still considered an acceptable form of entertainment, her work was a catalyst that made people see and understand black dance as true art that was to be respected and acclaimed. 
    In 1931 Dr. Dunham founded Les Ballet Negre, the first black dance company in the United States. Les Ballet Negre later became known as the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, which successfully toured over 60 countries in the 1940s. 
    In the years that followed, she revolutionized American dance by incorporating the roots of black dance and ritual, and by transforming these elements into choreography accessible to all through the Katherine Dunham Technique. 
    Dr. Dunham has truly left her mark on society as her technique is still taught today at the world renowned Alvin Ailey Dance Theater in New York. Her influence in the theaters' choreography can be seen in ``Revelations'', Alvin Ailey's most famous and internationally acclaimed performance. 
    As a human rights activist, she spoke out publicly about the United States' position on deporting Haitian refugees. Dunham was so passionate about the matter that in 1992 she went on a 47 day hunger strike to prove her point. Harry Belafonte stressed the notion that, ``She didn't perform miracles; she performed acts of human kindness''. 
    In 1967 Dr. Dunham established the Performing Arts Training Center in East St. Louis, Missouri, which functioned as an educational center, children's auxiliary company, and a semi-professional dance group that would go on to tour many parts of the United States. Dr. Dunham set out to transform lives, and did so. 
    We must keep her memory alive in our hearts and minds so that generations after us will know who she was and what she did. One cannot speak of dance and innovation without mentioning Katherine Dunham, for she truly is a woman who moved the world. I urge you to support H. Res. 655 Honoring Katherine Dunham, civil rights activist, performance artist, and humanitarian.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Thank you so much, Madam Chairlady, for giving me this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could not disagree with my friend from California more, and there is no one in this House that I believe that the administration has not spoken to more in concern for pieces of trade legislation, and I doubt whether there is anyone that has the compassion and the concern more than I about the people of Colombia who I have learned to admire, respect and work with over the years, not only with their political problems, but certainly their fight, their narcotics and trying to preserve democracy in that country. 
   The President has violated protocol in terms of not fulfilling the outlines that we have been using historically. What I have to say applies whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. 
   If, in the rules that the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee has outlined to us, there is an area of consultation before the President actually sends a complex piece of legislation to the House, which is more conducive to bringing us together, saying to the House that you have 90 days, and if you don't do anything in 90 days that it's the House of Representatives that killed the bill designed to help our friends in this area? Or one may say, Mr. President, you forgot to consult with us? You forgot to consult with the Ways and Means Committee. You did not deal with some of the issues that we have. 
   As you just changed the rule and just sending it over saying it's your responsibility in the House, what we are saying is that let's give the House more time and not a timetable to see what can we do to facilitate an atmosphere that would allow the Members at least to know what's in the bill. 
   It is really strange that the ranking member of the Rules Committee has presented us a speech this morning that is so similar that I don't remember the last time anyone in the administration has talked about the bill. 
   Oh, Hugo Chavez, I go to sleep every night wondering what he is going to do. Castro, my God, we should vote for the people of Colombia and against him and make him a big threat in the community. 
   I am not saying these things shouldn't be considered, but how many people, Republican or Democrat have the slightest idea what's in the trade bill? Why not give them an opportunity to make this decision, not based on 40 days, 50 days or 90 days, but for us to bring up these things. 
   When has anyone ever heard that they didn't have a crisis in terms of peace and tranquility against terrorism and assassination in Colombia? The question we may ask is Uribe doing, a man that I respect, as much as he should? Should he be doing more?

Why don't you allow us to share with you some of the techniques we have, some of the technology, work with your law enforcement so at the end of the day those who claim that it is murder that stops us from voting on a trade bill, that we will be able to say that we are working with them. 
   I hope you would rethink the vote. This vote is going to apply to every President, every Speaker of the House that deals with us. Do you believe they can change the rules and then they say that we dictate the legislative calendar of the House of Representatives? I think not. 
   You change the procedure. We defend the rules of the House. 
   What are we giving up? We are giving us an opportunity, one, to find out what's in the trade bill, and, two, which is most important, what can we do to resolve the issues that force Members to be against it.

<DOCNO>Mr. RANGEL. (DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, the provisions of H.R. 7006, the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008, provide tax relief for victims of disasters. I, along with Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member James McCrery, have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the bill, JCX-73-08. The technical explanation expresses the committee understanding and the legislative intent  behind this important piece of legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee's Web site www.jct.gov. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States as a Nation has experienced a terrible number of natural disasters. We started early this year with tornadoes in Georgia and Tennessee. We saw wildfires consume parts of these great United States, millions of acres in California. We saw the mighty rivers of the Midwest overflow their banks and damage the homes and businesses of so many Americans. And most recently, we saw the tremendous power of hurricanes Ike and Gustav devastate parts of Texas and the gulf coast. 
   I don't think anyone in this Chamber would disagree with me when I say unfortunately, we probably haven't seen the end of these horrible events this year. The hurricane season does not end until November 30. 
   The individuals hit by these natural disasters all shared one thing in common: they are victims of Mother Nature's strength, and they are looking for assistance from their Federal Government. 
   The bill before us today, H.R. 7006, the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008, provides a framework for the Congress to be able to provide all Americans that they be able to count on us in the unfortunate event that they get hit by a natural disaster. The Congress for years has been forced to negotiate between individual Representatives and Senators to decide which victims deserve Federal relief and which ones do not. It is a process that not one single one of us enjoys being a part of. 
   My bill today makes certain that every victim of a natural disaster gets the relief they need when they are trying to rebuild their homes and businesses, and trying to rebuild their lives. It does not pick winners and losers. It does not leave the recovery of these victims to a handful involved in political control. 
   My bill offers a variety of relief to victims of natural disasters, and the bill would first waive the income limitations on personal loss deductions. It would allow businesses to write off certain qualified disaster cleanup expenses. It would permit a 5-year carryback for certain losses. It waives certain mortgage revenue bond requirements to allow bond proceeds to be used for this rebuilding. It provides for additional low-income housing tax credits for communities with housing losses to build $2 billion in affordable housing. It adds a new set of disaster private activity bonds for business reconstruction, and it waives certain limitations on charitable contributions for disaster relief. 
   The bill would also increase the standard mileage rate for the charitable use of a vehicle whether they are involved in the disaster or not. And most importantly, the relief will be in place for disasters that may occur for years to come. The provisions are in place through 2011. 
   That means that when hurricanes like Ike and Gustav come back next year, albeit with different names, the Federal Government will have relief in place for the victims of these terrible storms. 
   I urge my colleagues to work to protect their constituents and hope and pray that they are never hit. But if they are suffering, that we will be able to swiftly pass this legislation so that we can provide some security for these victims. 
   I hope that you will listen to two of my fellow Democrats, Representative Lampson and Representative Cazayoux, who know all too well the pain which these disasters have done to their constituents. And I hope you appreciate, those who have yet to be hit, that this Congress has provided the need and support for their constituents. 
   At this time I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to an outstanding member of the Ways and Means Committee, Ron Kind, who has drafted the outlines of this not for his district, not for his region, but so that this great country of ours would have the type of relief that all of us wish we had done before, but we are now doing it today.
