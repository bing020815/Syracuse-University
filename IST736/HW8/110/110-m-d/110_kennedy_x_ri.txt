<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, today, the House of Representatives took a long awaited step toward improving the lives of America's working-class and middle-class families. For far too long, the playing field has been tilted against workers and the unions that represent them. Today's House passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, which I strongly supported, will help balance the inequity in the relationship between management and workers; an inequity that management has far too often used to stifle the will of workers. 
   An objective review of the recent history of labor relations in this country shows that in the majority of cases employer coercion, intimidation, and harassment have been used as tools to manipulate and successfully thwart union organizing drives. 
   Workers are often fired or otherwise discriminated against because of their efforts to organize. One out of every four employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity during an organizing campaign; 78 percent of employers force their employees to attend one-on-one meetings with their supervisors to hear anti-union messages; and 92 percent force employees to attend mandatory, captive audience anti-union meetings. 
   Clearly, even when a solid majority of employees have requested employer recognition of union representation, the more likely reaction of management has been to launch repressive anti-union campaigns rife with illegal tactics. 
   During the minority party's 12 years of power in Congress, and now 6 years in the White House, case after case of illegal employer intimidation leveled against union organizing efforts would arise. That little was often done in response only encouraged impunity among the forces opposed to negotiating with workers in good faith. 
   Now, is the Democratic Party's turn to hold the reins of power in this institution, and with this legislation, the Democratic majority demonstrates its unyielding commitment to workers' rights and a decent life for all working Americans and their families.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I wanted to mention the point about whether it didn't matter whether the big oil companies were really making a profit or not making a profit, whether they were using their profits right for good or not, or reinvestment or not. 
   I just want to make it really clear what they actually are doing, just to correct any misperceptions and to clarify what has already been said by my good friend, Mr. Ruppersberger, from Maryland. 
   Last year oil companies made 286 percent profit. Domestically, in this country, they cut capital reinvestment by 11 percent. So if you make money, usually, as a business, you reinvest in your capital and infrastructure so that you can go on and make more money. 
   This is a unique business. Not only do they take their profits, but they don't reinvest it in the business, even though they know they are coming to a point where they are going to be in a limited supply mode, or they should be thinking that somewhere down the line they might be. But of course, they don't care because they have an incentive to keep oil prices high right now. 
   So this notion that there is some incentive for them to go out there and take their profits and go explore, and that we shouldn't be harping on them for going out there and doing what they already are doing, they aren't doing it. That is why we are trying to make them do it, because they are not doing it. 
   This notion that they are already out there exploring all these things is nonsense. They cut their domestic exploration by 11 percent last year. That is nonsense that they have actually been out there exploring these leases. 
   How can you take home 286 percent profit and say that you made an honest attempt at finding oil in this country? You haven't made an honest attempt.  
   So the fact of the matter is, they are to blame when you take home that kind of money and you leave Americans out in the cold and you leave Americans high and dry because of these high gas prices. And that is where the blame should be is on big oil. 
   And the blame should be the administration. Where was Dick Cheney when he had his energy meeting at the beginning of the administration?

   Mr. KENNEDY. For all we know, Dick Cheney had a bunch of oilmen, along with the President, who is also an oilman, in a meeting and they said, let's think about how we are going to drive up the price of oil over the course of President Bush's presidency so that we all make millions and million of dollars, because certainly that is the way it has worked out. And Dick Cheney and President Bush, two oilmen, and all of their rich oilmen friends from Texas have certainly made millions and millions of dollars while they have been in office.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The President has an opportunity now to release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have billions and billions of barrels of oil buried in this country that we have been burying for over 3 decades since the energy crisis in the 1970s in case of an emergency. 
   The President says this isn't an emergency. I don't know where he is living, but it is an emergency in my district. He should release 10 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, burst the speculative bubble on oil, bring the prices down, bring relief to our consumers, and use the profits of that to help generate the proceeds to fuel the costs that are going to be incurred by investing in this renewable energy technology that the gentleman is speaking about, which, by the way, the Republicans completely cut the funding for every year that they ran this House. They cut this technology by 23 percent on average. And I am on the Appropriations Committee and I know that for a fact.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, our troops are returning from all over the world having suffered from many wounds, but many of the wounds that they're suffering from are not visible to the naked eye. Those wounds are psychological wounds. And tragically, our veterans system is not equipped, as we've seen this last week from a series by the Washington Post, to address many of those concerns. 
   Our Nation needs to be better prepared to address the psychological and emotional wounds that our veterans are facing. And tragically, this country has not come to grips with the mental health crisis that even our own citizens face. 
   This Congress needs to address this problem. It needs to address it within the Veterans Administration, and it needs to address it for this country by passing mental health parity and by making sure that we address PTSD for our veterans, making sure we have oversight of the VA, and making sure that they address the needs of our veterans, both visible and invisible wounds of our Nation's veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, remembering a true pioneer in the Muslim world. As the first woman to lead an Islamic nation, Prime Minister Bhutto represented a great hope for Pakistan and world peace. 
   I had a chance to meet with Benazir Bhutto when she came to the United States to visit the John F. Kennedy Library back in the 1990s; and I was hopeful that I would have the chance to meet her again on the evening of her assassination when I was visiting Islamabad. Tragically, I heard the news as I was on my way to go visit her that evening while I was visiting Islamabad, and it was an evening obviously that I will never forget. It was one of those moments that many people tell me about when they recall my uncle's assassination. They say to me, ``I'll never forget where I was when I heard the news.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I often heard from people when I was over there when they tell me about my uncle and how they had heard the news all the way over in Pakistan over 40 years ago where they were when they heard the news; and I can tell you, when I went and visited the headquarters of her party after her assassination and visited the supporters of hers, their heartbroken feelings were such that she was considered by them to be part of their family. And it was something that I will never forget, because she was much more than just a political leader in their view; she was someone who was somewhat of an icon, a person who inspired a nation much more than just as any ordinary political leader would. As such, this assassination represents much more than just the killing of a political leader; it represents the dashing of hopes and aspirations of millions of Pakistanis. 
   So, I join my colleagues in this resolution to say that we in the United States stand with our friends in Pakistan in joining in solidarity with them, and ensuring that her death is not a death that is going to be in vain, but, rather, that we are going to ensure that this election is going to be an election that she would have hoped would have been one that is transparent, fair, and would have lived up to the hopes that she had for a free and fair Pakistan. That is what we will all work for here in the United States and that I hope this resolution will help to bring about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Etheridge-Reichert amendment. The Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales, was up here on the Hill this week. The Attorney General was trying to appeal to the United States Congress of the United States, trying to appeal to the American people to restore the American people's confidence in the Justice Department. I think one of the first steps he can take to restore confidence in the American people and the Department of Justice is to ensure that the people who are on the front lines of the war against terror here in our own country, the men and women in blue, the people who are protecting our men and women across this country from crime, in our neighborhoods and our cities and our towns, that those people who make the ultimate sacrifice and lay down their lives for the protection of our citizens in our own communities, that those people, when they make that ultimate sacrifice, that this country is not going to let them down. It's not going to let their families down. 
   The notion that we're going to make them wait for an insurance policy, make their families wait, make their widows wait, make their orphans wait, is an insult. The fact that the Department of Justice is not willing to simply step up and pay $250,000 tax-free dollars to the widow and children of fallen officers who have fallen in the line of duty protecting people in this country from the criminal element of this society is unforgivable.  
   The fact that this Attorney General is up here on the Hill and has no understanding of this, has no sensitivity to this, is one more example of how out of touch this Attorney General is. 
   This amendment, this Etheridge amendment, is another example of how this Congress has to remind the executive branch who needs to be in charge when it comes to running the pursestrings around here, where the priorities of the American people are. The priorities of the American people are let's spend money where our law enforcement is. That is where their families are. 
   This, my friends, is where our hometown heroes are. In my State we have people like Deputy Assistant Day, who died trying to fight a fire, and his family's widow is still waiting for that benefit. In the 1970s, President Nixon put the public safety officers' benefit in at $100,000. We never even increased it. We tried to increase it; wasn't even increased for rate of inflation, cost-of-living adjustment. I worked to try to increase it, as did Mr. Etheridge. 
   It took 9/11, unfortunately, it took a crisis like 9/11, before we were able to attach this bill to the PATRIOT Act and get it included as part of the PATRIOT Act and get it pushed through this Congress so that we could increase it up to over $250,000. Now that it's up there, and it's tied to the rate of inflation, it's there. 
   But it's not going to do a lot of good unless it's going out the door, and it's going into the pockets and into the households and the families that need it. That's why we need to pass this amendment to give the administration and the Department of Justice the resources it needs in order to give them no more excuses in order to process these claims and get those families the resources they need in order to take care of the widows and the orphans of our fallen heroes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I understand, Mr. Chairman, the President of the United States today issued a press release saying that he was not going to ask that these officers be allowed out on bail or bond even after it was requested that they do be permitted to be released on bail and bond. I find it regrettable that the President did not give some explanation for why he didn't give these officers an opportunity to be given release on bail or bond as other people who would be on trial or given that kind of opportunity would otherwise be given. 
   At the very least, I think the President, given the nature of these officers being in law enforcement, has an obligation to ensure their security when they are in prison because they are, I understand, at greater threat to their own lives being law enforcement officers if they are incarcerated. And I would hope that the Department of Justice in its incarceration procedures does take into account the very increased threat level to these officers because of the nature of them being law enforcement officers. 
   That being said, however, we do have to keep in mind that it is a Bush-appointed U.S. Attorney that prosecuted these Border Patrol officers and it was a jury of a U.S. citizens who rendered a verdict based upon the U.S. law and based upon the evidence of U.S. law, not the Members of Congress here standing based upon newspapers and based upon Fox news stories and everything else, but based upon the evidence in a case presented to a jury through an evidentiary hearing. And that is what we need to abide by is a legal process. We can't abide by a political process. 
   If we were to abide by political process every time a legal case came along and were to suspend the process every time we thought one case was more popular than the other, it would just upend the idea of justice as we know it in this country, because I think all of us could come here to the floor and tell of a unique story where someone was wronged by the system of justice in this country. 
   And I think that it is kind of ironic that my friends are so outraged by mandatory minimums with guns, because they are so outraged by mandatory minimums with everything, and yet they are the first ones to pass these mandatory minimums and then wonder, now finding their own friends in the behind and saying, no, we can't have it touch our friends, and then all of a sudden they don't want it that way. 
   Well, you know what? There are lots of people in this country who have been  caught behind these mandatory minimums who have just been caught in the wrong place at the wrong time that are now serving life sentences. Kids that have been caught in ghettos just because they have been friends of friends who have been part of gangs. Now that they have been associated with gangs, they have gotten the gang-related crime tagged onto them, which has added another 10 years to their sentence, and that has been a mandatory minimum just because of some law that we have passed saying that you get another 10 years because you are related to a gang member. Now it is very interesting that all of a sudden people are so outraged by these minimums that have been tacked on to these officers carrying firearms in the commission of a crime. 
   So I just think that we should all pause for a moment when we think about being tough on crime. Here is a perfect example of where it comes back to bite us in the you-know-where when we think that we are trying to be tough on crime and then find out that sometimes when we are passing these mandatory minimums it doesn't always work out the way we expected it to be.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, let me just commend both the chairman and the ranking member for producing a bill which certainly goes a long ways to meeting the needs of our country in a number of areas.  
   But let me particularly point out an area that concerns me a great deal, and that's the area where I think there's a large indictment on our country; that's the area of the fact that this country has more people incarcerated in its jail system per capita than any other industrialized Nation on the Earth. More people in jail in our country than any other free Nation on the Earth. 
   My friends, that is an indictment on us as a Nation, that we can't do better. This bill invests more in preventing people getting in jail. 
   We add over $80 million to the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Act, section 5, title 5, which is prevention dollars. We have decreased that money over $280 million over the last 5 years, under the previous Congress. This year, under this bill, we increase it by $50 million, add another $30 million to the JBAG program, which is the gang prevention section of the Juvenile Justice act. We add $10 million to the Mentally Ill Offender Program, which helps us to put more money into identifying mentally ill offenders at the time of their offense, helping them to divert them from having to go into jail, and properly treating them, rather than accepting them into prison. And we quadruple the amount of dollars that are going into drug courts, the best-known source of reducing recidivism that we have in this country. 
   If you want to have a war on drugs, the best war on drugs is to treat people for their addictions rather than to put them in jail, and this bill goes a long ways in doing just that. 
   I want to commend the chairman for his work on this matter.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that if we are serious about looking at this issue of compliance, $6 million, frankly, for a country as big as China that is exporting to Wal-Mart toothpaste, pet food, auto parts and the like, $6 million ain't going to cut it; $6 million out of a budget that we are looking at here is really infinitesimal to think about in terms of really being serious about inspection. 
   If we are serious about looking at protecting consumer product safety, we ought to look at making sure that industry themselves are employing the proper safeguards in their own inspection safety, that they are obviously having to comply with our own U.S. inspection codes if they are selling within our own market. They are not having to comply with China's inspection. They have to comply with ours if they are selling in our marketplace. 
   So this is a broader issue in addition to just trade, and I think there are a lot of other significant aspects to this issue that we need to consider. I think we need to bring the trade groups that are involved with these issues to the table, and I would suggest that maybe the chairman and others maybe down the road we can begin to convene some of these trade groups. 
   I know from my State some of these interested groups are already working within their industries to deal with this because they know they have great liability. If they import products that they have manufactured in China here to this country that are faulty, they are on the hook and they are liable if those products are faulty, as they should be liable; that is, provided that they are not indemnified by the other side through product liability indemnification.     
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As cochair of the Judiciary Appropriation Subcommittee, someone who has attended these hearings all the way through, I am disappointed by this because I think it calls into question every single member of this committee and the integrity of every single member of this committee in saying that you're calling into question the integrity of this committee and what we have done as a work product as a committee. This is not the product of one individual; this is a product of a committee. So I take great exception to this Member's amendment and the questions that he has raised here. 
   I stand behind this work product, as do the colleagues that I serve with on this committee, both Republicans and Democrats. I serve proudly with this chairman. And we've worked as a bipartisan committee, worked together on a bipartisan basis in order to produce a work product that meets the needs of the public, to meet the needs of the law enforcement community in this country, and, I might add, way over and above the President of the United States' request for law enforcement, way over and above the request for law enforcement that this administration has put forward. 
   So I might say that it is ironic that this amendment comes up, that under this chairman, this law enforcement has gone further and farther than it has, indeed, under many, many previous chairs of this committee.     
   For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I support today's mark and I ask my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my support for this supplemental, not because I agree with everything in it, but because I agree with the most important thing in it: a binding deadline to redeploy our troops from Iraq. 
   We need to redeploy our troops from Iraq, first and foremost, because it is in our national security interest. 
   As someone who voted for the original resolution, I am particularly pained by the suffering of the thousands of our servicemembers killed and tens of thousands wounded. I'm glad this bill begins to put the appropriate resources into caring for those coming home with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, and beginning to fix the problems at Walter Reed Medical Center and other facilities. It is outrageous that this Administration has allowed our uniformed men and women to be treated so shabbily. 
   I also have enormous sympathy for the families of servicemembers killed and injured in Iraq. I agonize about those on the home front who worry every day about getting that horrible visit, and who struggle to raise children, pay bills, and lead some semblance of normal life with family members in a combat zone. I want our troops to come home. 
   Yet the hardships they and their families endure are not the reason to bring our troops home. I know that the men and women in uniform, and the families behind them, are willing to make the sacrifices they do if that is what it takes to make America more secure. 
   But the truth is, this war is not making us more secure. 
   By manipulating the intelligence and rushing to war, ignoring our allies, grossly mismanaging the occupation, and basing this entire war on ideology and hope rather than expertise and pragmatism, the Administration has torn our national security fabric. 
   Staying in Iraq, policing their civil war, does not bring us closer to defeating the global network of extremists who wish to harm us. To the contrary, in order to improve national security and best address our other strategic interests around the world and here at home, we must dramatically change our current direction in Iraq. 
   Redeployment from Iraq will enhance our security by allowing us to properly address other potential challenges around the world, from Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iran to the Western Pacific, the Horn of Africa, and the greater Middle East. In particular, it will allow us to put our attention back on Afghanistan and Pakistan and the fight against a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban, the enemies who actually engineered 9/11. 
   Bringing troops home also allows us to resolve the concerns about the readiness of our Armed Forces, which have been strained to the breaking point because of this Administration's careless management of the war in Iraq.  
   Perhaps most importantly, only by extricating ourselves from the mess of Iraq can we begin moving our country back to a common-sense policy of strength through leadership. Every day our military is in Iraq our standing in the international community erodes further. 
   Already we've seen respect for the United States plunge from record highs after 9/11 to record lows now. This loss of moral authority compromises our ability to lead multinational efforts to fight national security threats from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to global wanning and drug trafficking. 
   We cannot begin rebuilding our international credibility and leadership until we have redeployed from Iraq. We cannot restore the flexibility to meet the real, potentially existential threats of nuclear terrorism that were used to justify the invasion of Iraq until we exit Iraq. 
   We hear dire warnings about the awful results if we leave Iraq. It is true that bad things may happen when our Armed Forces leave if the Iraqis cannot or will not choose reconciliation over conflict. But that will be true if we leave at the end of this year, the end of next year, or in 2015. Delaying redeployment only delays the Iraqis' moment of responsibility. 
   The sooner we begin redeployment, the sooner we begin unraveling the tremendous damage that this war and its mismanagement have wrought on our national security. Given the Administration's history of manipulation and deceit, the interim deadlines of December 2007 and March 2008 may not prove binding, since the President can make certifications that waive those deadlines. I will support this supplemental, however, because it does set a binding deadline on withdrawal no later than August of next year. I would like the deadline to be sooner, but most important is that we bring finality to this war. 
   Our men and women in uniform have served our country courageously and performed brilliantly--just as they always do. But asking them to stand between warring factions is not only unfair, it's counterproductive. 
   I believe in a strong U.S. engagement around the world, including using military force when necessary. I also believe, as did Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, that America's greatest strength comes from its values and its ability to lead. We need to restore America's leadership. We need to strengthen America's security. We need to pass this supplemental and begin the redeployment from Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand with my colleagues to honor a truly remarkable Member of Congress, my friend, JULIA CARSON. 
   There are a lot of people in Washington, D.C., that sometimes forget their roots or why they want to be  here; not JULIA CARSON. JULIA never forgot why she was here or who she represented. She was here to expand the opportunities for others, to end inequalities in our society, and to seek justice for every American. 
   One of her most significant and meaningful accomplishments in the House was her effort to honor Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold Medal. In the remarks that JULIA delivered when she introduced this bill, she said, ``the quiet courage of Rosa Parks changed the course of American history.'' 
   For those of us who knew and worked with JULIA, we knew that she was not always quiet, but that the course of American history has always been changed by her courage. One of JULIA's greatest attributes was that it didn't matter who you were or where you came from or the color of your skin or the money in your pocket. She was happy to work with anyone who shared her commitment to treating everyone with respect and dignity. 
   Her relationship with a good friend of hers, Alan Hogan, comes to mind. Somehow, at age 17, a suburban boy from southeastern Indiana found a mentor in Ms. JULIA. Their mutual affection for each other and their work to promote justice and equality resonated with Alan and turned into a lifelong friendship. Her actions inspired Alan to fight to end social injustices, including working to ensure that young African American athletes were not exploited for their talents and that they received quality education when recruited to top-notch colleges and universities for their athletic scholarships. 
   Ms. JULIA affected Alan's life in a profound way, and I know she has uplifted countless others that I cannot begin to list here tonight. While she may have had many pieces of legislation that she could acknowledge as great accomplishments, I see an army of volunteers, like Alan, who will continue to carry her work as the greatest of her legacies. 
   JULIA's humanity always pierced through people's preconceived notions of what kind of stereotype she should fit into. You could never pigeonhole JULIA CARSON or predict what she could do or what she would say next. And it often left all of us at the edge of our seat, trying to predict what she would say next. 
   JULIA has said that it was Rosa Parks who paved the way for her to come to Congress. I believe that JULIA's work as a representative has paved the way and opened the doors for countless young Americans who I hope will follow in her footsteps and achieve great things. 
   Thank you, Ms. JULIA CARSON, for your friendship and for your legacy of justice and equality for all. We love you, and we will always miss you.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his great work and for his very kind words. And I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Stark for their work to pass a 1-year extension to the current mental health parity law. I would also like to thank them for their tireless work and dedication to passing H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   While I am pleased that the current law is being extended in this bill which will ensure that annual and lifetime limits for mental health benefits cannot be more restrictive than physical health benefits, I must express my disappointment that a stronger mental health parity law which includes equitable treatment limits, financial limits, and out-of-network parity has not been passed yet and signed by the President this year. After three hearings, five markups in the House, and with 273 bipartisan cosponsors, this bill has been closely scrutinized by both political parties. 
   I hope we will return early next year and pass this bill, not as a political victory for some, but for people like Katie Kevlock, a 16-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who lost her battle to addiction. She showed up one day to her mother and said she was addicted, confessed to her mother she was addicted. Her mother took her to the hospital. The hospital said she needed insurance coverage. She went to her insurance system. Her insurer said they couldn't cover her unless she had OD'ed. They couldn't give her residential treatment unless she OD'ed. So she had to wait until she OD'ed. But what happened? As Katie's mom said, not everyone survives that first OD. And it was in the case of Katie, her first OD killed her. Katie died without the treatment that she needed to overcome her addiction. That should not happen in this country. We need to pass parity, and that is why we need to pass 1424.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I'd like to thank the chairman for yielding and thank him for his leadership on this subject. 
   In urban States such as mine in Rhode Island, we have more and more of our consumers getting caught in traffic jams. The air quality is increasingly poor, and still, people are having trouble affording to fill their gas tanks with gas. And this is a tsunami of problems, both with their paying for their gas, trying to get to work, and the traffic jams, and breathing in the poor air quality.     
   It seems to me adding this $1.5 billion for mass transit solves all three of these problems: One, it gets cars off the road; two, it allows us to get our air cleaned up; and three, it helps these consumers be able to save money that they would otherwise put into their gas tank. And in doing so, it reduces our demand on foreign oil. 
   So, really, to reference what some of my colleagues have said, this is part of the approach to this problem, and I think it's well worth our taking into account. That is why I support this legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, recognizing the end of insurance discrimination towards the mentally ill and praising my colleague Jim Ramstad and Dave Wellstone, whose father is looking down on us today in praise of his son for all the hard work he did to see this day come to pass, I urge passage of this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. 
   While I do support the rescue package and commend Chairman Barney Frank for his work producing this legislation, I rise today to speak about the mental health parity bill which is included in this package. 
   For those of us in Congress who have been fighting to bring greater fairness and equity to our insurance laws, today is the culmination of a long struggle. 
   When we send this package to the President, we will be providing 113 million Americans the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your health insurance will be there when you need it--regardless of your diagnosis. 
   For far too long, health insurance companies have used the stigma of mental illness and substance abuse as an excuse to deny coverage for those biological disorders. 
   That ends today. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 will finally outlaw the discrimination that is embedded in our laws and our policies. 
   The passage of this legislation is one more step in the long civil rights struggle to ensure that all Americans have the chance to reach their full potential. 
   There are too many people to thank individually, so I would like to focus on two. 
   For as long as I have been in Congress, Jim Ramstad has been a champion for those with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. His advocacy on this issue has been inspiring to millions of Americans, and to me personally. 
   He is a role model for me, both personally and professionally. This Congress could use far more members like Jim Ramstad, on both sides of the aisle. This body will miss him terribly when he retires at the end of this Congress. 
   The other person I would like to recognize is Dave Wellstone. As most everyone here knows, Senator Paul Wellstone was the original champion of mental health parity in the Senate. 
   When he passed away, many of us thought that the momentum he had created for this bill would go with him. But his son Dave picked up the torch and has carried it tirelessly to get us to this point. 
   Dave, I know your father is watching us today, and I cannot imagine the pride he must feel. Congratulations. 
   In closing, this legislation strikes a blow against the stigma and discrimination faced by those with mental illness. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I want to thank him for all of his hard work and that of the other chairmen, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rangel, Chairman Miller, Chairman Stark, and obviously you, Chairman Pallone, for hosting that committee hearing in your district, as well as Chairman Andrews for all the work he did on this issue to bring H.R. 1424 to the floor today. 
   Without all of your markups, this bill would not have made it as far as it did today to come to this floor as one of the most important public health bills that we have seen on this floor in decades. Of course, that would not have happened had it not been for the great support of our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Leader Hoyer who without their support this would not have happened as well. I am indebted to them for their support. 
   Today, this House of Representatives takes up a truly landmark piece of civil rights legislation. Why civil rights? Because just as it would account for the color of your skin, or any other immutable fact about you, you don't choose if you're born with a congenital defect or if you're born with  one characteristic or another, just as you don't choose to have a predisposition to cancer, a predisposition to having asthma, a predisposition to dying early of one disease or another. And that applies true with those with mental illness. Yet when you have health insurance in this country, you expect to buy health insurance and it should cover your whole body.     
   But unfortunately, unbelievably, the brain is still relegated to that part of the world where people think of it as something that should be in your control, something that you should take charge of and so forth; that even though you might have a biochemical imbalance in your brain, that it is your fault if you have that biochemical imbalance in your brain. 
   So if you had diabetes and you don't produce enough insulin and you eat the wrong food and have sugar imbalances, no one holds it against you if you have complications to diabetes. But God forbid you have a dopamine imbalance in your brain that causes you to use alcohol or drugs, or you have a dopamine imbalance that has you in a depression or an imbalance in your brain that has you have a mental illness like schizophrenia. Then you are held to account because someone says that is your fault. And if you wander around the streets or if you are homeless, that must be your fault. 
   Those are the physical symptoms of a mental illness. Yet an insurance company will hospitalize you for the symptoms of a chemical imbalance called diabetes, but they won't hospitalize you for the physical and chemical imbalances of a brain illness as a result of dopamine imbalances or glutamate imbalances. What sense does that make? It doesn't make any sense. But it is stereotyped in an old dark ages mindset that has people hanging in the shadows because they are afraid someone is going to point someone out and say you should be ashamed of yourself because you have a mental illness. 
   My friends, I have a mental illness. I am fortunately getting the best care this country has to offer because I am a Member of Congress. If it is good enough for Members of Congress to have full parity, then it ought to be good enough for every American in this country who buys health insurance not to be discriminated against. 
   If we care about health care in this country, why are we not taking care of health care, rather than sick care? We ought to be taking care of people before they end up sick. We are spending in our emergency rooms too much money taking care of all of the acute cases as a result of mental illnesses, the car accidents, stabbings and intubations. Why not take care of people before they end up ending up in the emergency rooms? Why not take care of the people before they end up in our jails? 
   Let's pass mental parity, make this country stronger, make our people stronger, and let's make this day a great day for civil rights for all Americans. 
   I want to say this couldn't have been done without my good friend and colleague JIM RAMSTAD. Let's put this bill on the floor and do it this year and make it a tribute to Congressman JIM RAMSTAD, who has fought for this bill so long and hard.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to take issue with the point that this is giving some kind of preferential treatment to mental health benefits. If the gentleman would yield for a second on the point, we're having to state that mental health benefits need to be in the bill because no one questions when you get a broken arm, that it's automatically covered. But if it's a mental illness, it's discriminated against. Why we have to put this in the bill is because if we don't, it gets discriminated against. It's as simple as that. That's why we're on the floor today because we have to put it into civil rights law so it's not discriminated against. That's why we're on the floor today. That's not preferential treatment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I don't want anyone to mistake, after hearing the previous debate or any one of these amendments, what the big picture is here today. The success story today, the take-away message today is that this bill is the biggest increase in veterans health care in the history of the veterans health care system, the biggest increase in the 77-year history of the veterans health care system; and it has happened under the chairmanship of Chet Edwards. 
   Every amendment here is talking about nickels and dimes compared to the overwhelming increase in billions of dollars, billions of dollars that are going into this veterans health care system that has never seen such an infusion of dollars. We're not talking about a little bit of money here, a little bit of money there, and that's often what ends up happening. We're talking about money for this program or that program. We are talking about billions of dollars that have never been even seen in this kind of fashion in any kind of veterans health care program before. 
   And so what we are doing here is raising the bar for generations to come because what we're doing now is layering the bar up. So from now on, the floor is 20 stories higher than it was the day before. And from now on, whenever another veterans budget comes up, it is going to start from the top floor and move even higher. 
   I want everyone to know that this is a monumental day. This budget exceeds even the proposed budget of all the veteran service organizations, even the VFW, the American Legion, the Paralyzed Veterans of America; this is even more than they have asked for. 
   And I want to say on behalf of the mental health needs of our veterans, we are doing all that we need to do and more to try to make sure that their needs are met. And we should do so, because the suffering that these veterans have had to undergo as a result of this war has been unbearable. And we, as a Nation, owe it to make sure that not only do their outward physical wounds get met and treated, but their inward psychological wounds get tended to as well. And this bill does that. 
   I want to thank the chairman for his work to make sure that not only their outward wounds, but their inward wounds get addressed as well. And I commend him for his leadership. He ought to feel very proud to be chairman on such an historic bill such as this, and I thank him for his leadership.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, setting new records in the United States is generally associated with achievements and innovation. 
   Unfortunately, this week our Nation hit a new record that most consumers are not celebrating. Gasoline prices were reported to reach nationwide averages of $3.20 or higher. 
   It is not hard to understand these prices if you look at the Republican-controlled Congress' Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided billions of dollars to the oil and gas companies while spending only pennies on renewable efforts for fuel that would allow us to get ourselves off the dependency on foreign oil. 
   As Americans, we do not have a history of shying away from a challenge, and there is no reason to step down from the challenge that is ahead of us because of these Republicans. I think we can do better, and our history as Americans show that we will do better if we have the right leadership. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Price Gouging Protection Act because it fulfills America's promise to do what Americans can do if they put their mind to it, and that is to do better and get off this dependency on foreign oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget resolution. 
   I rise in support of this budget because I believe that it truly addresses the needs of all Americans, while restoring fiscal responsibility and accountability. Last year, Democrats pledged to move the country in a new direction and this budget is one more step in fulfilling that commitment. Republicans' irresponsible economic policies of the past six years have left a debt burden of $29,099 for a typical middle-income family of four in Rhode Island. This budget begins to reverse harmful cuts, restores critical domestic programs, and better reflects the priorities of all Americans by strengthening our national defense and investing in future generations. 
   This budget provides for the largest veterans' budget increase in American history, which will directly bolster healthcare services for 91,160 veterans in Rhode Island. It is also critical for the 4,082 brave Rhode Islanders, who have served their country in Afghanistan and Iraq since September 2001, many of whom will need VA health care services. 
   In 2004, 13,000 Rhode Island families were subject to the alternative minimum tax--and if nothing is done to fix the system, an estimated 98,000 families here in Rhode Island will be subject to the AMT in 2007. This budget supports middle-class tax cuts and protects middle-income families from a tax increase by setting up a reserve fund for a long-term fix for the alternative minimum tax. 
   In Rhode Island, there are 100,000 small businesses that serve as the engine of the economy. This budget rejects the President's proposal to cut the Small Business Administration by 26 percent from last year's request and 56 percent from 2001. It also rejects the President's cuts that eliminate $11,429,000 in funding for job training and employment services in Rhode Island. These investments to a growing economy for America's families are needed as family income in Rhode Island has only increased $574 since 2000 and health care and energy prices continue to climb. 
   In Rhode Island, 20,260 of our children do not have health insurance. This budget helps these children by increasing funding for State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--reducing the number of uninsured kids across America by millions. This budget also rejects the Administration's proposal to cut Medicare funding by $170,154,922 for Rhode Island hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health care providers--because those proposals would make health care less accessible and less affordable for many Rhode Islanders. 
   The House budget provides substantially more funding for Rhode Island's 159,600 children enrolled in public elementary, middle and high schools--providing nearly $8 billion more in 2008 and 11 percent more over the next five years for education and training programs than requested by the President. This will increase resources for No Child Left Behind, special education and Head Start--rejecting harsh cuts and under funding for these critical education programs included in the President's budget. 
   Gas prices have increased by $1.11 in Rhode Island since January 2001, an increase of approximately 73 percent. The Democratic House budget invests in renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce global warming, and promote new technologies that can create American jobs. It will also restore funding for Rhode Island environmental programs cut by the President's budget--including $2,654,000 in Clean Water revolving loan funds that help Rhode Island improve wastewater treatment. Mr. Chairman, this budget is a critical step in a new direction. Today, for the first time in many years, this House will pass a budget that truly represents the priorities of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I too want to join in support of this resolution and commend my colleagues from Washington State, particularly my colleague BRIAN BAIRD. 
   I have always thought, and I have talked to the Bank of America about this and have an appointment with former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin to discuss a Veterans Visa. We all have credit cards and we all have the affinity cards. They sell us cards where they have the affinity, where you get your bonus miles with American Airlines, you get your bonus miles if you use your card with a particular institution and so forth. 
   I figure Americans, when they use their credit card, could send their bonus miles or the equivalent of those to veterans, and they would be happy to lay down their credit cards, whether it be American Express or Visa or whatever, with a big red, white and blue credit card. And someone say, what kind of credit card is that, that it's that color? And they say, That's the Veterans Visa. That means all those bonus miles that would have gone to me being able to get a little extra bonus vacation or whatever is going to go to help our Nation's veterans. And I will tell you, I think there would be a lot of Americans out there who would be more than happy to be able to show their patriotic sense of duty when they are going around, especially those who are very comfortable and sitting in the business board rooms of this country doing business transactions all across this country and are sitting comfortably home while our young men and women are overseas fighting for this country, to be able to lay down that Veterans Visa card and have those affinity dollars go to those veterans groups. I think we could send that directly to the very great organization in New York, the Fisher Foundation which has a grade A transparent ruling for all the dollars that it sends to the Intrepid Organization and to the poly-trauma centers and all the vet centers across the country. 
   I think this is a terrific notion of the certificate of deposits, having a percentage of those interest payments going to veterans, and I think this is one that I am hoping to get started as well. And it follows on the same concept that you are working on here in Washington State. I hope to take your concept that you are doing in Washington State and bring it to my State of Rhode Island. I commend you on it, and I just want to salute you for the work that you are doing out in Washington State.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, while Wall street teeters on the edge of collapse families have been in free-fall for months. As a nation, our economy is in trouble. 
   For the people of Rhode Island, who currently face 8.5 percent unemployment, this crisis demands immediate action. Over the past year, unemployment in the state has risen by three and a half percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, the economic recovery package before us today will help stem the slide of our economy into a deep recession while simultaneously making important investments in our future. My constituents in Rhode Island cannot afford another day without this critical legislation. 
   This bill will help get more Americans back to work right away by investing in our crumbling bridges and highways.  
   This bill will help local transit agencies, like those in my state, which currently face cost overruns and drastic reductions in service because of aging fleets and escalating gas prices. 
   This bill will make essential investments in our schools by providing funding to repair dilapidated buildings and make energy-saving renovations up front, so that less of our future education budget literally goes up in smoke. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a number of other important investments, but I would like to call my colleagues attention to the help it offers to the most vulnerable among us. For Rhode Islanders and those across this country who are out of work, this bill extends unemployment benefits to keep families in their houses and to keep food on their tables. 
   Certainly, these are trying economic times for our country which require fundamental change. This legislation represents an important step toward policies which couple sound investment with true compassion. 
   For all American families struggling in these trying times, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I want to rise and congratulate the gentleman from Wisconsin, Chairman Obey, as well as Ranking Member Walsh for their good work on this bill. 
   This bill, Madam Chairman, does a great deal in rejecting the President's cuts that would have provided $7.6 billion below last year's level in programs vital to protecting our Nation's health and education system. 
   This bill today, instead, provides a 3 percent increase over last year in areas such as family intervention, early learning, education and health care access. Let me tell you what that means. That means that we can help make a difference in averting the kinds of problems that will come later on, because now we will invest in prevention. Programs such as the SAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration program, and Starting Early Starting Smart, which invests in family intervention, are so crucial. We know from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study that the Kaiser Foundation did that families that are in crisis produce children that are at higher risk for not only delinquency but for drug abuse, for HIV, and for greater health care problems. 
   In this bill, we provide funds to go towards those families so that we can reach those parents. If we reach those parents, we reach those children. That, my friends, is what real family values are all about; it is reaching out to the families in this country in order to reach the children of this country. If we reach these children, they will be able to grow and prosper, and we as a Nation will be even stronger for it. 
   Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for the work that he has done in helping to build a stronger safety net for the children of this country. It will make our country an even stronger place for all of us to live.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I find it very ironic from the other side that they are so outraged about these cuts. This is an account within the Department of Labor that has seen a 33 percent increase over the last several Congresses, a 33 percent increase within this specific account of the Department of Labor. 
   Now let's put that in perspective to what the Republicans put into other accounts within the Department of Labor. I seem to recall the International Child Labor Inspection in the last several Congresses was cut repeatedly over the last several Congresses, up to 87 percent. 
   This is the International Labor Organization's duty to oversee child labor standards to ensure that our competitors are not using children in the conduct of labor when competing with us and our manufacturing process. Yet it was good enough for us to cut 87 percent of the inspection for child labor, but good enough for us to increase the 33 percent. 
   Now we hear a complaint that somehow it's not good enough for us to just, since the account has done very well, to just keep it as it's going. Now there is a big outrage about this. 
   I might add, where was the outrage when the 12 percent cut was for the wage and hour department? Where was that? I didn't hear any outrage. Where was the outrage for the compliance for the contractors? I didn't hear any outrage for that. 
   It's just interesting, when we hear these complaints about where the cuts are, let's find out where the priorities really are. I think we are hearing them. They are not with the children and child labor. They are not with the workers and the wage and hour inspections, and they are not with the contractors and making sure that they are protected on the job. 
   They are here going after, once again, people who are trying to earn a living. I think that's a very clear set of priorities in this Department of Labor account.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just say to the gentleman from Florida, I find it curious that he says he is standing up for workers, because he must not recall his party gutting workers' overtime pay. I don't know whether he recalls that his party was for flex time. 
   Make sure every worker out there understands the Republican Party passed flex time. That means that your overtime pay, America, is gone. They passed it. They are not for working people. They said, if you work overtime, that it wasn't counting as overtime pay, and that that overtime pay towards your pension didn't get calculated to your overtime pension. So don't say you are on the side of workers. 
   I suppose that when you were for OSHA reform, that you are for workers, right? Reform in your view meant inspection was voluntary. That's really standing up for workers, making it so that the employer, all they had to do is, you know, check their own book to say whether they were protecting workers' heads or not from scaffolding or for those chemical plants that you mentioned, whether they were safe or not. 
   They didn't have to worry about covering their tracks. They didn't have any tracks to cover any more under  your bill for OSHA reform. As far as other bills, NLRB, forget it. You guys threw that out the window with the TEAM Act. There is no negotiating for unions. 
   So don't stand up here and talk about how you guys like to protect workers under this phony premise that you want to see more transparency and compliance. That's just a lot of hogwash.

   If he can't understand and grasp that it's in our interest to make sure that our competitors don't use children that are being paid pennies on the dollar while our moms and pops are having to compete against them with minimum wage standards, I can't explain it to him.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, Mr. Barton's amendment would increase NIH funding by $650 million by prohibiting NIH from contributing funding through the authorized program evaluation tap to support other Public Health Service agencies. 
   The Committee has already provided generous increases for NIH--$620 million in the joint funding resolution and $750 million in this bill. That has provided an increase of over 1500 new research grants. The bill's $750 million increase is over $1 billion higher than the President's FY08 request. 
   This amendment is dangerous because it would eliminate the only agency that is doing research to evaluate and identify what healthcare treatments work, what is safe for patients, and how to control the costs for the medical interventions produced by NIH research--the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, AHRQ. 
   Twenty percent of our economy is tied to health care. 42 million seniors are dependent on Medicare for health care, and 50 million Americans are on Medicaid. We desperately need the research that AHRQ provides to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health care services provided through this enormous share of our economy. 
   Comparative effectiveness research allows us to expand coverage by only paying for what works and using the savings to expand health coverage. 
   The country is concerned about being consumed by out of control health care costs. This amendment would devastate funding for AHRQ, the one agency doing the research necessary to determine the best ways to deliver medical care in order to avoid bankrupting Medicare and our private health care system. 
   The amendment will devastate the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, by cutting 20 percent of the funding provided for NIOSH--the only agency in government that supports occupational safety and health research and brings that research from the laboratory into the workplace. 
   In 2005 there were 5,734 workplace injury deaths, 50,000 deaths from occupational diseases and more than 4.2 million workplace injuries in the U.S. In 2006 we saw more than a doubling of coal mine fatalities in the nation's mines. Now is not the time to cut our investments in important health and safety research programs that are critical to our efforts to protect workers from job deaths, injuries and disease. 
   The amendment would devastate the CDC's ability to track the health status of Americans. Knowledge of, and the ability to understand issues such as infant mortality, obesity risk factors, and childhood diseases will be seriously curtailed if this amendment passes. 
   While this amendment on its face would appear to provide short-term benefits to university researchers, it would have dramatic and serious long-term consequences for the patients with conditions that NIH research addresses.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, education as a whole is something I don't think we can ever go wrong in investing in, especially at a time when education is more important than ever before in keeping our country competitive in a global economy. What's going to make our workers more competitive is their ability to compete on an international level. 
   Now, part of that edge is going to be able to be determined whether they are going to be bilingual, whether they are going to be fluent in not just one language, but maybe two languages. It's interesting in our country, especially over the debate the last several weeks, denigrating immigration as if it's something of a drain on our society, that we have lost sight. 
   The greatest strength of our Nation are our immigrants, especially now. The United States is unique around the world in that we are a country of nations, nations that make up every part of the world. We are uniquely positioned as a Nation to take full advantage of the multiethnic backgrounds of all the people that make up this great country of ours. We have a ready-made market in every part of the world because of all of ethnicities that we have in our country. 
   Now, in my neighborhood, in Rhode Island, we have a large Portuguese community. The fact of the matter is, we have, in Rhode Island, a large Portuguese community that could be very beneficial to this country's ability to compete internationally. 
   By 2010, Brazil will be the third largest consumer of American-made products. Now, don't you think it would be a smart move for our country to invest more in Portuguese literacy and fluency? I think so. That's why I am for investing in the language development for the third leading consumer market of American goods that's going to lead to more American jobs right in our hometowns all across America. 
   This is about building up American jobs here at home. Frankly, I don't understand what the objection is. This is all about investing in our people. We are not running any deficits when we are investing in people. We are making investments, investments that are going to pay huge dividends in the future. 
   Where is your balance sheet? 
   You know, the cost of everything but the value of nothing. When you look at your balance sheet, you would assume that you can do everything on the sheet. You can just automatically have someone grow up, not get an education, expect to get more out of them than you put into them. 
   I don't know any business deal where a business person expects to get something more out of a deal than they put into it, except maybe Enron. Is that your kind of politics over there? You expect to get rich quick without even investing? 
   I don't know, as Democrats we believe that you have to invest in people before you can get a return on your investment. That's what we are doing in this investment in education. We are investing in our workers. We are investing in our people, because we know in order for us to get a return on our investment that is what's going to be the key. 
   I can give you specific examples in my State where we have bilingual workers who now are able to take what they have learned, thanks to these Portuguese studies, and also take that and be able to teach other people Portuguese and be able to add fluency to their vocabulary and also be able to expand their economic opportunities as well. 
   I think that's a good thing for this country. It expands the American Dream in this country, and that's why I oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I just want to commend the chairman for the work that this committee has done to achieve the very purpose that this amendment that the gentleman from New Jersey has proposed.     
   Frankly, we have this year on July 26 the anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and we have taken many steps backward as a Nation in guaranteeing the civil rights of all Americans with disabilities. Clearly that means we need to guarantee nothing special for people with disabilities, just the same rights. Guaranteeing equal access regardless of ability is what we need to do in this country. 
   This amendment seeks to do that; but I might add, so does the underlying bill. I hope that Members listening to this debate do not come away with the understanding that it is because of amendments like this that we are accomplishing it. The underlying bill, if people were to see it and really look at it, does so much to offer independence and hope to people who previous to this bill were denied many opportunities because of previous budgetary priorities that shut people out in this country. 
   So I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for producing a good bill that goes along the same lines as this amendment by opening up the doors of opportunity to all Americans.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I tell the gentleman, in my State, I will give you a perfect example of where this would make a difference. 
   In a rural part of my State we had a contamination of our well water, and it was a contamination because of the MTBE, the chemical that goes into gasoline. I might add under the Republican majority, you all indemnified the oil and gas industry from lawsuits so that my community can't get the justice it deserves so it can clean up its wastewater and make due reparation to my constituents. What they had to do is they had to go down to the local high school to take showers. They had to attach a pump through the fire department to the next-door community. 
   Now under this section of the bill, this is a public health hazard. You know why, because even at home when they turn on the water, they were getting lesions on their skin because the shower water was giving them lesions. Even when they turned on the steam, the children were breathing in the steam and were getting asthma attacks. Now if you are wondering what the nexus is, this is what the nexus is between your amendment and health and why infrastructure makes an enormous difference in providing clean, safe drinking water to rural communities. 
   Now I don't come from a very rural State so you might think that it is kind of interesting that I would come up and speak on behalf of this. I would think that your State would probably benefit a lot more from this. Your constituents must be wondering about you offering an amendment against a section that would benefit your State more than it does mine. Frankly, this is an important program. 
   If anything in this country, we haven't invested enough in infrastructure. Mr. Jackson, I'm sure, has talked to his mayors and local community leaders, and they have told him that their infrastructure is falling apart. I would just commend all of us to say that if we have to do anything, we have to do more in the way of infrastructure, not less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I think this is a perfect, perfect example of a gentleman offering an amendment where he knows the cost of something but the value of nothing. 
   If he were to visit any congregate meal site in his district or were to visit any of the Meals-on-Wheels programs in this country and was able to see what a difference those programs make in people's lives, he would understand that it was these kinds of programs that saved the taxpayer money. 
   I guess, by this amendment, he is saying what a waste it is for us to pay for someone's illness. Let's put off paying for their illness until they get really sick. Then they have got to get hospitalized. Then let's pay for it through Medicare. 
   Frankly, the former Speaker Newt Gingrich, every modern health care magazine, Republican Presidential contender Tommy Thompson, former HHS director, every leader and study in health care knows we ought to be going in the opposite direction. It's all about health. In case anybody has not been looking, our health care system is an acute care system. It's a sick care system. We need to be going preventive care. We need to be going health care. We need to be going chronic care management. 
   What in the world are we thinking by considering that we are going to actually go back to the dark days where we are going to actually spend more money on the back door to wait until people get sick as opposed to trying to prevent people from coming in and getting sick in the first place. I find this amendment absolutely mind boggling that it would even be offered as an excuse for saving money. 
   Quite frankly, it will end up costing the taxpayer money. Tragically, more than costing us money, it will cost us lives. It will cost us lives, and it will cost us misery amongst those senior citizens who are going to have to suffer the consequences of the cutbacks that this amendment will propose. I think that's a very unfortunate thing. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.

Because we, as Democrats, believe we need to not rearrange the deck chairs on this Titanic of our health care system. 
   We need to reinvent our health care system and invest in health care, which is broken in this country, and start investing in prevention and not go down this road that has gotten us in so much trouble to begin with, and that is try to take care of the problem after it's already broken. Let's take care of people first and keep them out of the hospital.

And, frankly, this is a scourge on our schools, and we can't just wish it away by saying, just say no. Just say no won't work. We need to employ resources, and that's what this bill, this amendment, seeks to do. 
   And, frankly, when you have 20 million people in this country addicted, and you have nearly 10 percent of those people, children, you have a serious problem in this country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the chairman of the committee.  
   I'd like to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership in bringing to the floor the largest single investment in college financial aid since the GI Bill. 
   The bill we are considering here increases the maximum Pell Grant by $500. It will cut the interest rate on student loans in half. 
   It provides loan forgiveness for college graduates that agree to teach in high-need areas and who agree to go into public service professions. It accomplishes all of that, and yet here is the best part: this bill saves the American taxpayers $750 million. 
   By reducing the excessive subsidies that Congress has lavished on private lenders, lenders that we have seen in the news this year have acted unscrupulously time and again, Chairman Miller has more than paid for the investments he is making in our students. 
   I know that my constituents in Rhode Island who take out Federal students loans will appreciate the $4,420 in savings this bill provides to them. And I also know that the rest of my constituents will appreciate the fact that this increase in student aid does not cost them one extra dime. 
   When Democrats took control in Congress, we promised to cut student loan interest rates in half, while at the same time proceeding in a fiscally responsible fashion. Today, we are fulfilling that promise. I will be proud to vote in favor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6983, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. 
   I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Chairmen Dingell, Rangel and Miller, as well as subcommittee Chairmen Stark, Pallone and Andrews, without whose unflagging commitment to this bill we would not be so close to sending it to the President's desk. 
   I would also like to thank Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and our majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and the whole Democratic leadership for their consistent support in making this bill a top priority. 
   I most would like to thank my good friend, Jim Ramstad. Jim is leaving this year, and there will be no greater testament to his devotion to those with mental illness and substance abuse disorders than to see this bill signed into law by President Bush this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a letter in support of this bill from former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who has been such a champion for this issue, and I will insert it into the Record. 
   Statement for the Record in Support of the Passage of The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 by Mrs. Rosalynn Carter, Former First Lady of the United States, Chairwoman, Carter Center's Mental Health Task Force, Atlanta, Georgia 
   I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my strong support for the passage of a critical health issue facing millions of Americans: parity for the treatment of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. 
   I have been working on mental health issues for more than 35 years. When I began no one understood the brain or how to treat mental illnesses. Today everything has changed--except stigma, of course, which holds back progress in the field. 
   Because of research and our new knowledge of the brain, mental illnesses now can be diagnosed and treated effectively, and the overwhelming majority of those affected can lead normal lives--being contributing citizens in our communities. 
   I join many individuals and hundreds of national organizations calling for an end to the fundamental, stigmatizing inequity of providing far more limited insurance coverage for mental health care than for treatment of any other illnesses. Again, I join  forces with my friend Betty Ford in urging action on this important issue. 
   Jimmy and I founded The Carter Center 25 years ago, and I have a very good mental health program there. Annually we bring together leaders to take action on major mental health issues of concern to the nation. We have focused many times on stigma and discrimination and the importance of insuring adequate, equitable coverage for people with mental illnesses. 
   To me, it is unconscionable in our country and morally unacceptable to treat 20 percent of our population (1 in every 5 people in our country will experience a mental illness this year) as though they were not worthy of care. We preach human rights and civil rights and yet we let people suffer because of an illness they didn't ask for and for which there is sound treatment. Then we pay the price for this folly in homelessness, lives lost, families torn apart, loss of productivity, and the costs of treatment in our prisons and jails. 
   I have always believed that if insurance covered mental illnesses, it would be all right to have them. This may be why the stigma has remained so pervasive--because these illnesses are treated differently from other health conditions. 
   All mental illnesses are potentially devastating. But today living a life in recovery from a mental illness is not only possible, but expected. We had an intern at The Carter Center this spring, for example, who has obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. While she was in high school, she once spent two solid weeks in her house, unable to leave or be with her friends. I am happy to say that she received treatment, is a college graduate with Phi Beta Kappa honors, and just got a job in Washington, DC. Without resources and support, she could still be sick and shut in her home, which is what happens to so many who do not get the help they need because of lack of the ability to pay for services. We as a country lose all the many contributions of these wonderful people. 
   I have the pleasure of being friends with Tom Johnson, the former publisher of the Los Angeles Times and former CEO of CNN and a person who has struggled with depression. He has been interested in the mental health benefits offered by employers in Atlanta. He and two other prominent CEOs in the Atlanta community--all of whom have suffered from severe depression and are now great leaders--have had an enormous impact on businesses in the area. 
   Through the research of people like Howard Goldman and Richard Frank, we know that parity in insurance benefits for behavioral health care has no significant increase in total costs when coupled with management of care. We also know that a number of enlightened companies such as AT&T, Delta Air Lines, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, and IBM have provided comprehensive coverage for their employees. (Report to the Office of Personnel Management, by Washington Business Group on Health) 
   Since the mental health commission we held during Jimmy's presidency, there have been several major reports released including the first Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, President Bush's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, and the Institute of Medicine included mental and substance use conditions in its series of reports on the quality of American health care. All of the reports reinforce the statement that effective treatments are available, but most people who need them do not get them. 
   The whole nation has learned a lot about the importance of mental health issues through the events of Hurricane Katrina and the needs of our returning soldiers and National Guard troops. We support our troops in the field, and it is critical that we continue to support them when they come home. 
   Finally, I would like to comment on the number of states that have moved ahead with parity. These have been long-fought battles with some states managing wonderful successes. It is so important that stronger state parity laws continue to improve the lives of people with mental illness and addiction. It is also critically important that plans not override the intent of this legislation by discriminating against those with certain diagnoses of mental illness and addiction in their coverage. I am glad to see that this legislation includes efforts to keep a close watch on this issue. The intent of this law is fairness, not discrimination. 
   After waiting for 15 years, we finally have mental health and addiction parity legislation in sight. If this legislation is passed, many of our citizens will be healthier, and our nation will be stronger, more resilient, and more productive. 
   On behalf of the millions of people affected by mental illnesses, I applaud your efforts to pass the mental health and addiction parity legislation. I know the work has been hard, but the benefits to our nation will be enormous.  
   We are bringing to the floor today a bill that is fully paid for, bipartisan, bicameral and a compromise, a mental health parity bill that has long been coming to this floor. It is the result of extensive negotiations between the House, the Senate, and is supported by the chairmen of the relevant House committees and subcommittees, as well as Senators Kennedy, Enzi and Domenici. 
   We cannot afford one more day without parity, because each day five United States soldiers take their lives because of suicide. We cannot afford one more day without parity because each year $1.3 billion is lost because of those workdays due to mental disorders, more than arthritis, stroke, heart attack and cancer combined. 
   The World Health Organization in this chart shows you. It's hard for anyone to really understand until you see it in this chart.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If you look at the comparison in illnesses by lost days, burden of illness, mental illness is amongst the worst; sure, cancer; sure, arthritis; sure, heart disease, but these are illnesses that capture people usually at the end of life. Mental illnesses, addictive disorders, really paralyze people from their beginning of life throughout their life. That's why it's such a burden of illness in our society. 
   It catches us in the Justice Department. Drug-related crime in our country costs us $107 billion a year. We cannot afford not to have parity because 80 percent of our trauma admissions in our emergency rooms are alcohol and drug related. We cannot afford not to have parity, because by denying an individual's treatment to their diseases, we are denying them the opportunity to live out their full potential and live a full and fulfilling life. 
   Treatment works, as my good friend from Minnesota has said. It has worked for those who have had the opportunity to seek it. 
   If you are a Member of Congress, you have treatment opportunities. Like my friend from Minnesota said, he has had it; I have had it. Recovery is possible. 
   We need to end the stigma against those with mental illness, but it isn't going to happen until we first outlaw, outlaw, the embedded discrimination in our laws. That is what we are about to do today by passing this legislation. We simply cannot afford to wait one more day.  
   In fact, just today the Administration released a Statement of Administration Policy concerning an identical policy provision in the Senate tax extenders bill which reads, ``the Administration supports passage of mental health parity legislation included in the Senate amendments to H.R. 6049 that eliminates disparities between mental health benefits and medical and surgical benefits without significantly increasing health coverage costs.'' The mental health parity legislation that statement refers to is identical to the bill we are considering on the floor today. 
   In March, we passed H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. At that time, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle expressed a preference for the Senate mental health parity bill. I would urge those members to join with us now to pass this compromise bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is past time that we enact mental health parity into law. 
   Enacting mental health parity will affect nearly every individual in this country who has watched a friend or family member struggle with mental illness or addiction, or who has battled the disease themselves. 
   The bill we are passing today is one more step in the long struggle to ensure that all Americans have a chance to realize their dreams. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in putting an end to the discrimination against mental illness. I urge a yes vote for H.R. 6983.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my support for the supplemental, not because I agree with everything that is in it, but because I agree with one thing that is in it, and that is a binding deadline to end the war in Iraq and redeploy our troops to where they are truly needed, and that is to fight the real war on terror where the terrorists started to bomb our country and planned to bomb us on 9/11 and that is in the mountains of Afghanistan. 
   Why are we fighting a civil war in Iraq? Why are we fighting a civil war in Iraq when it is in Afghanistan where the war should be fought? Why are our Republican friends talking about protecting our national security in Iraq when in fact it is al Qaeda in Afghanistan that is posing the greatest threat to our national security? 
   It is this supplemental that talks about fighting the real national security threat to our Nation, and that is  why I support this important supplemental, because it truly supports our troops and it supports our veterans as well.  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my support for this supplemental, not because I agree with everything in it, but because I agree with the most important thing in it: a binding deadline to end the war in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to redeploy our troops from Iraq first and foremost because it is in our national security interest. 
   As someone who voted for the original resolution, I am particularly pained by the hardships and suffering our troops and their families endure. I want them to come home. 
   But I also know that the men and women in uniform, and the families behind them, are willing to make the sacrifices they do if that is what it takes to make America more secure. 
   The truth is policing a civil war in Iraq does not bring us closer to defeating the global network of extremists who wish to harm us. 
   But redeployment from Iraq will enhance our security by allowing us to properly address other challenges around the world, most importantly the fight in Afghanistan and Pakistan against a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban, the enemies who actually did engineer 9/11. 
   The moral authority we've lost in the eyes of the world compromises our ability to lead multinational efforts against national security threats ranging from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to global warming and drug trafficking. 
   The sooner we begin redeployment, the sooner we begin unraveling the tremendous damage that this war and its mismanagement have wrought on our national security. 
   We need to restore America's leadership. We need to strengthen America's security. We need to pass this supplemental and begin the redeployment from Iraq. 
   I believe in a strong U.S. engagement around the world, including using military force when necessary. I also believe, as did Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, that America's greatest strength comes from its values and its ability to lead.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his work in this area and just say, having just returned from another part of the world that has been turned upside down by election disturbances in Pakistan, with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, it's clear to me that the United States' interest in monitoring elections is paramount because of the national security implications in all of these parts of the world, that we have election monitors stationed in all of these places of the world where there are elections. 
   I know that the NDI and the NRI, the National Democratic Institute, National Republican Institute and these organizations that we promote as a country, we need to, as a Congress, continue to support those organizations because they are absolutely indispensable towards our national security in helping to secure better faith and confidence in these elections that are taking place around the world. If there is confidence in these elections, and, clearly, these elections have been called into dispute, especially here in Kenya, then there is going to be an unraveling of confidence, and, as we have seen, an occurrence of violence. That occurrence of violence is going to be destabilizing, not only to the region but also to our own national security interests. 
   That is why I support this resolution and certainly want to salute my colleagues in saying that in the future, we need to do more to support these efforts of monitoring these elections and giving the support that they need on the ground to make sure that they really are transparent elections in every sense of the word.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank Chairman Pallone for his work in bringing the extension of this mental health parity law to the floor. I want to acknowledge his help on H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Act, and say I join him in saying today is a great start in us extending this law on lifetime and annual limits. But, as he mentioned, we want to get full parity, which means we want to get the real bill that extends full coverage of mental illnesses to all health insurance plans. Just as we would expect health insurance plans to cover the rest of our body, cancer, diabetes, everything else, we shouldn't expect any less for mental illnesses. 
   And yet, unlike many other physical illnesses, mental illnesses are excluded from most health insurance plans. In fact, 98 percent of our health insurance plans in America charge higher copays and deductibles for mental illnesses simply because of stigma, simply because of discrimination.     
   Because of the shame and because Americans are too afraid to say that they are willing to say enough is enough, and they're not willing to say that's wrong, and they're not going to sit idly by while insurance companies say that they can get away with it, we in the Congress ought to stand up and say, enough is enough. We are going to pass the law that says civil rights matter in this country, and if you are born with a mental illness, just as if you were born with any kind of physical disability, you should not be discriminated against. And that is what we mean when we say we want to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. We can't afford any more days without this law. 
   As my good friend said over here, each year 1.3 billion workdays are lost due to mental disorders, more than any other, arthritis, stroke, heart attack, or cancer combined. 
   We cannot afford one more day without parity because the Department of Justice estimates that drug-related crime costs our Nation $107 billion a year. We cannot afford one more day without parity because 80 percent of the trauma-related admissions in our emergency rooms in this country are drug- and alcohol-related, implicated in car accidents, shootings, stabbings, and domestic and violent incidences, as well as overdoses. 
   We cannot afford one more day without parity because workers' untreated depression cost their employers $31 billion a year in lost productivity and cost their employers $135 billion in lost productivity just due to alcoholism alone. 
   I will tell you this: We are paying for this in so many other ways, we cannot afford not to spend the money on treatment up front. 
   But the fact of the matter is, insurance companies continue to deny treatment. Just take one case of Katie  Kevlock, a 16-year-old from Pennsylvania. The insurance company said to her, It is not enough that you came in here hooked on heroin. We need to see you overdose before we are going to give you treatment coverage. 
   Guess what her mother said? Well, I'm not sure my daughter's got an overdose in her before I can bring her back for her treatment. 
   Well, guess what? She, of course, overdosed, and she didn't survive that overdose. But that's what that insurance company demanded. They demanded that she have an overdose before she qualified for treatment, but she didn't survive that overdose. She died like millions of other Americans, and that is the cost of us not providing treatment. 
   Treatment works. Recovery works. We need to end the stigma of mental illness and addiction in our society. That's why we need to pass H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act; and that's why we need to extend the bill today to provide one more year of annual lifetime limits for the current parity law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlelady from Colorado and the gentleman from Delaware for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor for a vote today. I must also extend my thanks to our distinguished Speaker for her commitment to returning the House to the hands of the American people during the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress. 
   I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Each year, dozens of health advocacy groups flood my Washington, D.C., office to discuss the importance of medical research. While all experiences are memorable, the difficulties faced by the children with Type I, or juvenile diabetes, really stay with me. 
   Last year, a brother and sister, ages four and five, visited my office and shared with me their hatred of needles, and how much they would like to enjoy birthday cake and other foods with their friends. They didn't understand why they were chosen to be sick. They didn't understand why there are people in D.C. blocking bills that would help them get better. These children had one simple request, to pass a law to increase the most promising research tool available that may lead to a cure for their disease. 
   Advancements in science and technology have put our Nation in the position to make breakthroughs for these children. How did the President respond to their request? He made this bill the first veto of his Presidency. Everyone in this Nation knows someone, or has a friend or family member, who could benefit from stem cell research. 
   It is time for a new direction for America and it is time for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to become law.

<TEXT>
    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H. Res. 259, a resolution honoring and recognizing the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America and their annual March for Meals campaign. I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, Representative LoBiondo, for asking me to join him as a lead sponsor of this important legislation. 
    We all know the statistics related to senior nutrition programs and Meals on Wheels. In my home State of Rhode Island alone, there are an estimated 2,200 meals delivered each day to homebound and elderly clients and over 600,000 meals delivered each year by over 1,000 volunteers. The cost to provide one meal each day for one month is less than $100, by far less expensive than the cost of a nursing home, which averages nearly $5,000 per month. 
    I often cite these statistics because I am proud of the work of my local Meals on Wheels program, but these numbers fail to illustrate one of the more important results from the program. Because these clients are homebound, they are too often isolated from their communities and spend their days alone. Even a brief visit from a friendly Meals on Wheels volunteer provides much needed social interaction and a connection to the community. 
    I have participated in March for Meals in my community, and I encourage other Members of Congress and elected officials to take the time to visit their homebound constituents who receive meals. Unfortunately, one in ten seniors lives in poverty in our Nation and the need for home-delivered meals continues to increase. It is critical that Members of Congress know firsthand the powerful effects of these delivered meals on our seniors, not only to feed their bodies, but to feed their souls. 
    Thank you, again, to my colleague, Representative LoBiondo, for introducing this important resolution and to Meals on Wheels and their volunteers for their tremendous work in taking care of our most vulnerable Americans. I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 259, and to participate in March for Meals in their home districts.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I'd first like to thank my colleague, John Hall, for his work on this amendment. He was president of his local board of education and knows this issue inside and out from the local perspective. And his work on this has been absolutely instrumental in its preparation. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Miller and Chairman Kildee, without whom the work of those for whom this amendment is designed to help, the disability community, those children with disabilities, this amendment is designed to supplement. 
   Frankly, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is really an attempt to just support what is already in this bill in the way of support of inclusive education. What this amendment seeks to do is use those dollars in this bill for teacher education and research, to support the notion that we ought to include children in the classrooms with disabilities  so that we can both better educate those teachers teaching those children with disabilities in how to teach both children with disabilities in integrated classrooms, in inclusive classrooms, as well as learn from their experiences in doing so, both to the benefit of both children in those inclusive classrooms; and use evidence-based research that we know is constantly coming towards us in terms of how to identify children with autism, how to identify children with learning disabilities and use those new findings and be able to employ them to the benefit of these children's growth and their development. 
   Mr. Chairman, that is why we've introduced this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-31) -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, the President is making a terrible and costly mistake by vetoing the war funding bill and rejecting the clear desire of Congress and the country for a swift redeployment of U.S. ground forces from Iraq. 
   The veto and the insistence on staying the course is not a mistake simply because it ignores public opinion; we wouldn't want a Commander-in-Chief to be simply a weather vane. 
   And it is not a mistake just because our courageous troops and military families are exhausted from bearing the full weight of sacrifice themselves. We know they are prepared to pay any price for American security, which is why we owe them such a debt of gratitude. 
   No, the President's veto is a grave mistake because refusing to change course in Iraq is compromising U.S. security. 
   Administration rhetoric notwithstanding, policing the civil war in Iraq does not bring us closer to defeating the global network of extremists who wish to harm us. To the contrary, in order to improve national security and best address our other strategic interests around the world and here at home, we must dramatically change our current direction in Iraq. 
   Our men and women in uniform have always served our country courageously and performed brilliantly. But asking them to stand between warring factions is not only unfair, it is counterproductive. 
   Redeployment from Iraq will enhance our security by allowing us to properly address other potential challenges around the world from Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iran to Latin America, the Horn of Africa, and the greater Middle East. In particular, it will allow us to put our attention back on Afghanistan and the fight against a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban, the enemies who actually did engineer 9/11. 
   Bringing troops home also allows us to resolve the concerns about the readiness of our Armed Forces, which have been strained to the breaking point because of this Administration's careless management of the war in Iraq. 
   Only by extricating ourselves from the mess of Iraq can we begin moving our country back to a common-sense policy of strength through leadership. Every day our military is in Iraq our standing in the international community erodes further. 
   Already we've seen respect for the United States plunge from record highs after 9/11 to record lows now. This loss of moral authority compromises our ability to lead multinational efforts to fight national security threats from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to global warming and drug trafficking. 
   Our continuing military involvement in Iraq carries these steep costs with little prospect of benefit. Only the Iraqis can bring about the needed reconciliation in their country. Their political leaders must take the difficult political steps needed to cease the violence in their country, by building coalitions among competing sects, ensuring minority rights, balancing power between provincial and central governments, and sharing oil revenues among all regions in Iraq. We simply cannot do this work for them. 
   By setting a deliberate timetable for redeployment, we force the Iraqi political leaders to acknowledge and accept that they are the ones who must take steps to bring about an end of the sectarian violence. 
   Bad things may happen when our Armed Forces leave Iraq if the Iraqis cannot or will not choose reconciliation over conflict. But that will be true if we leave at the end of this year, the end of next year, or in 2015. Delaying redeployment simply delays the Iraqis' moment of responsibility. 
   Our strong leaders of the last century, like Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, recognized that while American military might was important, American values were our greatest strength. 
   Just as we rallied the world in the Second World War and defeated the Soviets in the Cold War on the strength of our Nation's democratic ideals, ultimate victory against this generation of enemies will similarly be won in the minds of millions around the world, not on the battlefield in Iraq or anywhere else. Indeed, that long-term victory is impossible while we are in the middle of Iraq's civil war. 
   There is no easy solution to the problems in Iraq, but it would be irresponsible to push a difficult decision off to another day, another Congress, or another President. We must stand firm and hold the Iraqi leaders responsible for their country. It is time for the United States to turn its attention to its broader global security and redeploy from Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, my uncle said a generation ago: If we examine the history of the conflict, we find the dismal story repeated time after time. Every time, at every crisis, we have denied that anything was wrong; sent more troops; and issued more confident communiques. Every time, we have been assured that this one last step would bring victory. And every time, the predictions and promises have failed and been forgotten, and the demand has been made once again for just one more step up the ladder. And once again the President tells us that we are going to win; victory is coming.'' 
   My Uncle Robert Kennedy made this statement in March of 1968. It took another 5 years and 37,455 American lives before a United States President was withdrawing Americans out of Vietnam and stopping that war. 
   I am here tonight to say that the American people and this Congress are going to say ``no'' to this President when it comes to repeating that mistake. 
   There are those who will disparage this amendment and who say that this is a nonbinding resolution. But this resolution says that we are going to reject this President's doubling down on the gambling of American lives, and this foolish policy which has sent over 3,125 soldiers to their deaths, over 23,417 wounded soldiers back home, and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis to their graves and countless more also injured. 
   We are saying in this resolution that we either have to start digging ourselves out of this hole, or we are going to start rueing the day when we have failed to act tonight to start changing course.  
   This administration's bullheaded insistence, bullheaded insistence on ideology over strategy is what has gotten us into this mess, and now that same stubbornness is counseling us to send still more soldiers and more Marines into an Iraqi civil war. 
   Our service men and women have been heroic. They have been confronted with repeated civilian failures of leadership, ill equipped and under equipped, and yet in increasingly untenable positions they have been unflinching and have been uncomplaining in their shouldering of every burden we have asked of them, and they have done it with dignity and professionalism. But it is not right. It is not right to ask them, to ask the military to bear the burden of the responsibility of solving someone else's civil war. It is not right, and it won't work. 
   Instead of closing our eyes and crossing our fingers and giving this President a rubber stamp for an endless civil war in Iraq, we should be beginning to move our country back to a common-sense policy of strength through leadership. 
   Our choice tonight is clear: Keep digging, or climb our way out of this hole. I think this Congress will decide to start climbing our way out. 
   And there will be many who will say, what will we do then? I will say, well, maybe we will propose to fence off the funds as many have suggested. That will be a debate for another day. That will be a debate for another day whether we will fence off the funds. But tonight will be the debate, and tomorrow will be the decision as to whether we will vote to go in that direction. 
   So you can say it is a meaningless, nonbinding resolution all you want, but it is the first conversation as to which direction we are going to go, and that is the direction we have to decide, and I vote that we go in the direction of starting to move our way and our troops out of Iraq.  
   Mr. Speaker, ``if we examine the history of the conflict, we find the dismal story repeated time after time. Every time--at every crisis--we have denied that anything was wrong; sent more troops; and issued more confident communiques. Every time, we have been assured that this one last step would bring victory. And every time, the predictions and promises have failed and been forgotten, and the demand has been made again for just one more step up the ladder. . . . And once again the President tells us that `we are going to win'; `victory' is coming.'' 
   My uncle, Robert Kennedy, spoke these words in March 1968, It took another 5 years and another 37,455 American lives before a U.S. President finally withdrew American troops from Vietnam. 
   I will not stand by, the American people will not stand by, and allow the President to repeat that mistake. 
   Some disparage this resolution because it's nonbinding. But with due respect, I couldn't disagree more. This resolution represents a fundamental policy choice by this Congress. 
   It's about whether you agree with doubling down the President's high stakes gamble with American lives. 
   This resolution poses a simple choice. After 4 years, after 3,125 deaths, after more than 23,417 wounded, are we digging our hole in Iraq even deeper, or are we strong enough to start climbing out? 
   We need a stronger America, a more secure America and that begins with a rejection of the failed strategy in Iraq. 
   It has now been nearly 4 years since the President declared that in Iraq, our mission was accomplished. 
   Four years of disintegration. Four years of unfounded insistence that the turning point is right around the corner. 
   Are we digging deeper, or climbing out? 
   We have watched a child hug their parents tight on the tarmac--only to have to let go as Morn or Dad is deployed for the second, third, or even fourth time. 
   We have stood at the graveside with a grieving family as a Gold Star mother accepts a folded American flag. 
   We have visited our Nation's newest veterans in the hospital, their bodies and minds scarred by the horrors of war. 
   Are we digging deeper, or climbing out? 
   Each day we all see, with our own eyes, the carnage and the chaos that has become the norm in Iraq. 
   The administration's bull-headed insistence on ideology over strategy has led us to where we are today. And now, that same stubbornness is counseling some to send still more of our soldiers and marines into an Iraqi civil war. 
   Our current course is failing in Iraq. It's failing the bigger struggle against our terrorist enemies. It's failing our troops and their families. And it's failing our core values as Americans. 
   I won't settle for that failure. We must change course. We must begin to climb out of the hole in Iraq. 
   Democrats, Republicans, generals, and most importantly, the American people now see that it is time for a new plan; it is time to embrace a new approach. 
   Our service men and women have been heroic. Confronted with repeated civilian failures of leadership, underequipped, and in an increasingly untenable position, our troops have not flinched, they have not complained, they have shouldered every burden we ask of them with dignity and professionalism. 
   But it is not right to place upon our military the responsibility of solving someone else's civil war. It's not right, and it won't work. 
   Instead of closing our eyes, crossing our fingers, and giving the President a rubber stamp for endless war in Iraq, we should begin moving our country back to a commonsense policy of strength through leadership. 
   Our strong leaders of the last century, like Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Reagan, recognized that while American military might was important, American values were our greatest strength. 
   We rallied the world in the Second World War and defeated the Soviets in the cold war on the strength of our Nation's democratic ideals. For the entire 20th century, we led by our example, and by the force of our principles. 
   While military action will continue to be a necessary component of our current struggle, ultimate victory against this generation of enemies will similarly be won not on the battlefield, but in the minds of millions around the world. That victory is impossible while we are in the middle of Iraq's civil war. 
   Our choice today is clear. Keep digging or climb out? If we decide to begin climbing out, as I think we will, there are debates yet to come about the best way to do that--whether we should fence off funds to prevent an escalation, for example. I look forward to those conversations. But today is a more fundamental question about the direction of our country. 
   We can withdraw from Iraq without withdrawing from the fight. We can be strong enough to climb out of that hole. For our troops, for their families, and for our Nation's strength and security, I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the gentlewoman from California, and I want to commend her for her support. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to lead a bipartisan coalition of Members from both sides of the aisle that support the cause of Liberia, and I want to thank and extend my gratitude to them and to all parties for bringing this bill to the floor today. 
   Minority Leader and Whip Blunt, Congressman Mike Pence, Congressman Tim Walberg, and my good friend from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, have come together because we all believe in the Liberian-American community. 
   I would also like to recognize Congressman Keith Ellison, a true champion of the Liberian-Americans, for his steadfast support and dedication to this cause, as well as to Chairman Conyers and again to Chairwoman Lofgren on the Judiciary Committee for her strong leadership on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, as you can hear from this debate, this is an issue where we have had a country that has had a unique history with our Nation. It is a country that was founded by former American slaves. It was a country that was established by this country for those liberated American slaves; and it was a country whose refugees came back here because of a war that was in part fueled by American guns, where we supported former General Taylor and General Doe. 
   So it is a tragedy that was exacerbated because America supported a civil war that cost the descendents of those American slaves their lives. There was torture and killing that forced those former American slaves' descendents to have to come back to the United States. 
   Now they are here. They have made their own lives here. And the thought that we would have to force them to go back instead of them making their own decision as to when to go back. I represent a large community of over 17,000 Liberian-Americans. They want to go back to Liberia, but they want to make the decision as to when they go back. They don't want to have to be forced to go back on October 1 because we are forcing them. They have made their lives here. They contribute heavily to our community. 
   In fact, I have spoken this afternoon to several of my constituents. One woman, Ms. Harris, has never missed a day of work in the 20 years she has been here in this country; another family, the Dennises, who have been here; Mr. and Mrs. Akowala. He has two degrees in engineering and Mrs. Akowala is a registered nurse.     
   Both degrees are very important in this country. Both of whom contribute heavily to our economy. Their children were born here. But if they were forced back and their children are Americans, what happens? They go back to a country where 85 percent of the country is unemployed, where there's little running water, little electricity. Can you imagine what we'd do to that country? It's barely on its feet right now. What do we do? We do not stabilize the country that's getting on its feet. I think we further destabilize it. 
   Further, I think the best policy for us to help stand up to Liberia is to help and give them the remittances that Americans here in this country, the Liberian Americans here send back every year to Liberia. And that, I think, is a good policy for this country. 
   For all of these reasons, not the least of which is Ciehanna Stevens. She is married to an Iraqi war veteran hero who's on his fourth tour of duty. He's a citizen of this country. He's a Liberian American, fourth tour of duty serving his country. She will be deported. Imagine, the wife of an Iraqi war hero on his fourth tour of duty to be deported. That, to me, is an outrage. We need to pass this bill for all the Liberian Americans who contributed to our country.

   I think it is interesting to hear all these protestations from my colleagues on the Republican side about this issue of civil rights and how they are so concerned about equal rights for women. They are so concerned about equal pay for equal work, that if it were up to them, they would do something about it, that they care just as much as Democrats. 
   Yet it was the Republican President who nominated the Supreme Court, who stacked the Supreme Court of the United States with conservative, right-wing Republican ideological judges that handed down not only the Ledbetter decision, but has handed down decision after decision that has gone against working people and civil rights every step of the way. This is no mistake. This is just the agenda that the Republicans wanted. 
   You voted for President Bush, so don't come on down here and say but we didn't mean to. And by the way, you also cut the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when you were in charge of this place, so don't come over here and now say you protest women not getting paid equally.

   For my sake, I don't want to go home and tell my mother that she is only worth 76 cents for a dollar a man is worth.

I also want to commend the members of this committee for all the work that they have done on mental health. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have had an opportunity, as a member of the Veterans Appropriations Committee, to sit in on some of the committee hearings on the Veterans Authorizing Committee and seeing the work that they have done to try to increase the outreach to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. I am pleased to see that this committee is starting to do as much as they can to reach out to these veterans as they return from Iraqi Freedom. But, clearly, more needs to be done. We have witnessed that in these recent hearings. 
   I think that, clearly, the Appropriations Committee has recognized this this year. I am pleased to announce that this Congress has voted the largest increase in veterans health care spending in the 77-year history of the Veterans Department. 
   Within that, there is an over $100 million increase in veterans specialty mental health care. This is just one acknowledgment of many that our veterans, when they come home, we need to make sure they come home not only in body, but that they come home in spirit, and that it's not enough just to take care of the outer wounds of our Nation's veterans, but we also need to make sure that we mend the inner wounds, the psychological and emotional wounds that they have sustained during war defending our country's freedom.

I would like to thank my good friends and colleagues, Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER and Representative JUDY BIGGERT, for their tireless advocacy to bring this bill to the House floor today and then on to the White House for President Bush's signature. 
   There is nothing more personal and more deserving of protection than the genetic make-up of each and every individual in our Nation. Advances in science and technology during the past decade have allowed us to map the human genome and opened the doors to treatment and diagnostic capabilities that we are only now beginning to realize. With this power comes great responsibility to protect individuals who learn that they may be more susceptible to diseases such as breast cancer or mental illness. 
   Just as our Nation does not allow discrimination based on race or disability, we must not allow discrimination based on our own genetic identity. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will prevent health insurers and employers from improperly using our genetic information to make coverage or employment decisions. I urge my colleagues to support this protection of our most basic human right by voting for H.R. 493.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, for his tireless efforts on behalf of affordable housing and say I am astounded to hear my colleagues on the other side bemoan the fact that there is too much effort being made to provide affordable housing in this country. I don't know where they are living. I don't know who they represent. They are certainly not living anywhere that I have been. 
   In my district, my business community is saying that they can't get workers because there aren't enough affordable housing spots for those workers to be able to live so they can actually work in the businesses that they are needed. 
   I don't know how my Republican friends think that they are somehow on the side of the free market, when the free market isn't going to even work if the workers they need can't even afford the housing they need in order to live where they work. 
   This housing trust fund is a basic concept. I think it's a fantastic idea. It's one that I support wholeheartedly. 
   I just would say that this notion that government is bad, bad, bad, it's funny, because it reminds me of the story of the elderly woman jumping up at a senior town hall meeting saying, get your government hands off my Medicare. Medicare, by the way, is a government program, in case everyone hasn't forgotten, and one of the most successful programs that there has ever been, but you wouldn't know that by the way Republicans talk, 3 percent overhead on their Medicare. You never hear that when they talk about socialization and government programs. 
   Finally, I would just say there is a story about the Englishman and the German and the Russian. All have a genie that says ``Give us your wish.'' The Englishman says, ``Oh, I will have Wyoming, a big ranch out in Wyoming.'' The German says, ``I will have a Swiss chalet.'' The Russian says, ``Well, you know what? My neighbor has a barn; destroy it.'' 
   Sounds like the Republicans kind of have the Russian point of view. It doesn't make any sense. Their neighbors can't have it. That's their attitude.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank Chairman Chet Edwards and Ranking Member Zach Wamp for their incredible leadership on this legislation. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. Chairman, to particularly say what an honor it is to serve under Chairman Edwards. And his particular leadership is due a great deal of appreciation, especially for what he does to champion the cause of veterans in this country. And I want to say what an honor it is to serve under his leadership in this committee. 
   I want to say, as Mr. Wamp did, that it is an honor, for those of us who never served in uniform, to be here and serving in a different uniform, in coat and tie, to be there to serve those who did go out there and put their lives on the line to serve our country, in a sense that we owe it to them and can have an opportunity to serve those veterans who have served our country so proudly. I take great pride in that. 
   I feel that this is an historic place in the Congress of the United States. I mean, this floor of the House is where Franklin Roosevelt announced that we would be declaring war, World War II. And we all read about the history of this country, when the country came together to fight wars on two sides of the world. And we read about those times in American history when all of America was joined together and sacrificing. 
   And the only difference between those times and now is that there seems to be a battle that's being fought by our men and women in uniform, but the sacrifice seems to be borne principally by those who are wearing the uniform, but not by the rest of America. It seems as though there is a bubble going on here where the rest of America is supposed to go on with their lives and the military is supposed to do the job, and yet the two should never meet. And I don't think that's the way America is supposed to work. I think, as a country, we're supposed to be there every step of the way with our troops. 
   And what I think this bill does is it begins to acknowledge that the rest of America needs to step up to the plate and make sure when our troops come home, that we know that they aren't forgotten, and that we're going to remember them long after they've come home and make sure that they get the homecoming that they deserve.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriation Bill. It has been my great privileged to serve under the leadership of Chairman Chet Edwards and Ranking Member Zack Wamp as we have worked in a bipartisan way to support our military and honor America's commitment to our veterans. 
   I would like to take a moment, Mr. Chairman to honor the great service of the Chairman of the Military Construction Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Chet Edwards. There is no better champion for the veterans of our country and no better advocate for the needs of our service members than Chet Edwards. I applaud the Chairman for his earnest stewardship of our subcommittee. 
   Mr. Chairman, over the past year, I had the opportunity to travel the country to see with my own eyes the capabilities of our VA Hospitals, Medical Centers, Polytrauma Centers and Inpatient facilities and get a better perspective of the needs of patients, doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators. I met with many of our brave veterans who have made those enormous sacrifices for our nation. Needless to say, I was inspired by the courage of our wounded warriors. 
   The high degree of professionalism with which the Hospital staff conducted patient care was quite impressive and I have great confidence in the doctors and nurses who are doing their part in taking care of America's veterans. 
   Unfortunately, many of these great public servants are performing their jobs in antiquated facilities with substandard staffing requirements that make life difficult for doctors, but more importantly, diminish care for patients! 
   It was crystal clear to me that our VA Facilities need to do more to adapt to a new generation of American veterans who have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan. Specifically, the needs of our female veterans need immediate attention. 
   During my visit, I observed that our Veterans' Hospitals, many of which were built in the 1950s and 60s, were not built to accommodate the large number of female vets expected to enter the system. They lack the most rudimentary amenities like adequate female restrooms and hospital rooms to meet privacy needs. 
   Sadly, the VA is always playing a big game of ``catchup'' with respect to female vets. Instead of implementing a long term strategy designed to meet the needs of these service members, the VA would rather wait for another Walter Reed before changing the status-quo. 
   In mental health services, I was alarmed by the lack of full-time mental health professional at VA Hospitals. 
   For example, my visit to the Hines VA in Chicago last fall revealed that all of its psychiatrists were part-time employees. Frankly, I find that unacceptable.  
   In this subcommittee, we have taken steps to bolster funding for mental health services in the VA and built upon our great success in last year's MILCON/VA appropriations bill which saw the greatest increase in veterans health funding in the 77-year history of the VA. 
   We have also dedicated $24.8 billion for Military Construction to fully fund BRAC and increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps. 
   In Military Construction, this bill also includes: 
   --$336 million, which was not in the President's request, will go towards quality of life initiatives. 
   --$200 million for the Army and Marine Corps to improve their barracks so that our service members have decent places to call home. 
   The Veterans Health Administration estimates that in 2009 more than 5.8 million patients, including 333,275 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This is why we have funded the VHA at $40.8 billion, $1.6 billion over the request of President Bush and a 9 percent increase over 2008 levels. 
   According to a study by the Rand Corporation, more than 1 in 5 service men and women coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from a stress related mental illness. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the signature wound of this war and I applaud my colleagues on this subcommittee for recognizing the seriousness of this issue and for their willingness to devote significant funding towards mental health care and research. 
   $3.8 billion in this bill is dedicated to specialty mental health services and $584 million to substance abuse programs in this bill. 
   In a time of great need for our veterans, this subcommittee came together to write a bipartisan bill. We solicited views from the other side of the aisle to put together a responsible, non-partisan bill that has only one objective: to most effectively meet the needs of our veterans and military families. 
   This is why I was appalled yesterday when I heard that President Bush announced that he would veto this legislation. The administration says we must spare no expense for our soldiers and Marines in the field, but when those servicemembers come home, this same President tells them that $3 billion for health care, family housing and medical research is too much. 
   To shortchange our veterans and military families, in a time of war, is morally wrong. We have no right to put fiscal responsibility on the backs of our Nation's veterans. 
   I would hope that we can quickly pass the Military Construction Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill so that the veterans I met across America can rest assured knowing the help is on the way.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (S. 2484 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, tonight I am proud to stand here to speak on behalf of S. 2484, a bill to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, after my aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. 
   In 1962, Mrs. Shriver persuaded her brother, my uncle, President Kennedy, to establish the NICHD to ensure that all children are born healthy, and that they have an equal chance to achieve their full potential. 
   Since that time, NICHD has been a global leader in producing developments that improve the lives of this world's children. Specifically, research through the NICHD has helped produce results in reducing the rates of sudden infant death syndrome, reducing infant mortality and maternal HIV transmissions. 
   My aunt Eunice Shriver has spent her life fighting to deliver the promise of the American dream to each and every child, not only in this country, but around the world. She has never backed down from a challenge. In fact, when she heard from a mother who could not find a camp that would accept their disabled child, Eunice started a camp of her own in her own backyard, a camp for other parents who, like her, were trying to deal with a family member who was mentally retarded. My Aunt Rosemary had mental retardation, and my Aunt Eunice was inspired because of her experience with my Aunt Rosemary to start the Special Olympics. And I don't think there is anything that has probably had a more profound effect on millions of people's lives in this world than the impact that Special Olympics has had, not only on the millions of families whose lives that it has touched with those with intellectual disabilities, but also for the millions and millions of volunteers who have come in contact with Special Olympics and who found their lives moved and transformed because of their experience with Special Olympics. 
   The Special Olympics organization has given athletes and their families the courage to participate in competition while always remembering that success is not measured by how often you win but by how brave you are in the attempt. 
   Beyond providing athletes and their families with new and unique opportunities in competitive sports, the Special Olympics also established the Healthy Athletes Initiative, which increases health care to athletes at events all around the world. During 2006, 600 screening events took place, and 135,000 athletes received a screening. These screenings provided not only critical care to athletes; they also provided appropriate treatment, and also an opportunity for those athletes to get the rewards of getting the best in treatment that are too often taken for granted by the rest of us. 
   In addition to that, the data from these screenings are collected and used  to promote health policies that inform those of us here in Congress on how we can better develop programs here in Congress for those individuals with intellectual disabilities. 
   The incalculable benefits resulting from this program are just a small example of how my Aunt Eunice has altered the future of millions of children in our own country and around the world. 
   I just want to say once more, in a personal sense, that she has done so much to destigmatize the stigma of those with mental retardation. And, as someone who is fighting for parity for mental health coverage, she has also worked so hard to destigmatize mental illness, something that often accompanies those families who are depressed when they find that one of their family members has been struck with mental retardation. She has been someone who has fought for the human spirit and the dignity of the human person in every sense of the word. And, due to her tireless advocacy, our country has been better off for all of her devotion and work. 
   So, it is with my great honor and pleasure that today I was able to join my colleagues in seeing that the National Institutes of Health saw the naming of the National Institutes for Childhood and Development named after Eunice Kennedy Shriver for all of the great work that she has done on behalf of every child born in this country and around the world. Congratulations, Aunt Eunice. It is so well deserved.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, I want to acknowledge Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their good work on this bill. 
   This authorization has very strong provisions on mental health, a number of them addressing the stigma issues regarding mental health, identifying the reintegration needs of our Reservists. Our Reservists make up nearly half of those fighting on behalf of the war on terror. 
   Mental health nurse practitioners: It establishes a nurse practitioner graduate education program in the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences program that includes psychiatric mental health practices. 
   It has mental health counselors who can now be reimbursed by TRICARE for services provided to our troops and their families. These counselors are cost-effective and ready to serve the families of our servicemembers as well as our servicemembers themselves. 
   Also, we have the Mental Health Initiative that will coordinate the Department of Defense's research and development programs and provide opportunities for researchers to better improve identification and diagnosis of mental health problems. 
   Finally, we have the Psychological Kevlar, which will help us begin to prevent the post-traumatic stress disorder problems that we are seeing many of our soldiers come back from Iraq suffering from. It is important that we include in our basic training, before our soldiers go abroad, not only physical resiliency and training but mental resiliency and training, so that they are as prepared to defend themselves mentally as they are physically before it is too late, before they suffer the terrible psychological wounds that yield them so disabled in many respects after the war, when it is too late. 
   Finally, Madam Chairman, this bill includes provisions that will take account of measuring the quality and satisfaction of our military men and women in our military hospitals. We cannot wait for more of the kinds of Walter Reed anecdotal stories to rise to the surface before we begin to measure the quality and satisfaction in our military hospitals, and I am pleased to see this amendment adopted in the bill.  
   The authorization has very strong mental health provisions that will help address the stigma our troops confront in seeking mental health care, increase the number of mental health professionals to serve the mental health needs of our troops and their families, and advance research developed from the nation's academic and medical base to better improve DoD's mental health research and treatment programs. 
   Addressing stigma issues among reservists: The Secretary of Defense will establish a working group to identify the reintegration needs of our reservists. The working group will examine different programs operated by different services, States, and commands to help reservists. From there, it can identify best practices and develop plans to incorporate these practices across the military. 
   Mental health nurse practitioners: The establishment of a nurse practitioner graduate education program at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. The program's specialties would include psychiatric mental health practice. 
   Mental health counselors: Mental health counselors can now be reimbursed by TRICARE for services provided to our troops and their families. The counselors are a cost-effective force ready to serve and help our service-members and their families. 
   Military mental health initiative: This initiative would coordinate the Department of Defense's mental health research and development programs and provide an opportunity for researchers to better improve the identification diagnosis, and treatment of mental health issues. 
   This plan will help incorporate evidence-based preventive and early intervention strategies into pre-deployment training, combat theater operations, and post-deployment service to strengthen our warfighters' psychological resiliency. 
   Introducing our soldiers to mental health care only after they have been exposed to combat is far too late. We need to familiarize our soldiers and their families with how to recognize and deal with the symptoms of combat stress and trauma--and the benefits of mental health care--from early on in their military career. 
   Our soldiers are trained from the moment they enter basic training or boot camp on how to physically protect themselves from harm. 
   We need to ensure that they are just as well trained in protecting themselves psychologically as well.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, when speaking about mental health, we should be speaking about it in terms of a positive. That is what makes us stronger. I think when the gentleman says that when we speak about mental health, we want to be careful so as not to make people feel like they are victims, looks at it in a negative way. 
   Frankly, I am proud that at John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg the Green Berets have insisted that they have psychiatrists on call 24 hours, 7 days a week, not because they are the weakest branch of the military, but because they are the strongest and they want to remain the strongest. And they know that if they are to remain the strongest, they don't want to be thinking about anything else in their mind when they use their sharpshooter and they are called to duty for this country, where they are going to parachute in and use their technical expertise they have been trained to do. They know that they want to be able to do that job sufficiently, and that is why they have had this important mental health allowed for them, and that is why I think it is so important to have these facilities available for them.

   My amendment simply requires the Department of Defense to examine a process by which they would further add for the collection of data by which our servicemembers could rely on an apples-to-apples comparison of our military health care system, so that they could get a proper evaluation of the status of our health care system, so that we could avoid the kinds of anecdotal stories that we found out through the Walter Reed scandal. 
   We shouldn't be finding this out through stories. We ought to be able to find this out through the garnering of data. And this is one of the ways that we seek to do so. By garnering this information just like we would through our regular health care system, we should do so through our military health care system, and that is what this amendment would do.

   We have a war that has been proclaimed based upon lies. We have had a war that has been proclaimed based upon faulty intelligence. And we have had a war that has been proclaimed upon intelligence that has been manufactured. Now we have a public that has repeatedly felt that it has been lied to, and that they want to be heard by their Congress. All we are asking in this amendment is that their Congress have a chance to voice their own through the Representative's opinion before a Commander in Chief throws this country back into another war headlong without the American people having a voice in it.

But this President has so undermined the confidence of the institution of the Presidency, it has brought this amendment to the floor; because I think this President has so jeopardized the confidence in the Presidency of the United States that the people, after the experience of this President, have become so distrustful that this President is going to drag them into another war under unwarranted circumstances that they would support an amendment like the one of the gentleman from New Jersey. And that is why I would call it the ``George W. Bush Amendment,'' for no other reason than it is because of George W. Bush that this amendment seems to be necessary.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, this evening I have an opportunity to address an issue that our country has long seen unaddressed in the many years that we have tackled many issues but failed to address the underlying issue that we seek to talk about this evening. We have just heard many people talk about the issue of gun violence. We have had many people talk about drug smuggling. Well, these are just two examples of the issue that we are going to talk about tonight, in the examples that point to the fact that we are failing to address the underlying problem. 
   The issue of gun violence, we fail to address the underlying problems of violence in our society when we fail to address the underpinnings of violence. What is it that created the mind of that young man in Omaha that led him to act out in such a way that led to the death so tragically of those innocent people in the mall in Omaha, Nebraska? Why was it that he could not get the help that he needed such that he had to act out in such a way? Why was it that he had to resort to violence? 
   Why is it in this country that homicide amongst young people is the second leading cause of death for young people? Why is it that suicide is the third leading cause of death for young people 15 to 24? 
   It is important to ask these questions because if we do, we start to dig below the surface of these questions about whether the issue is really about simply the question of whether we are talking about locking people up or addressing a more fundamental problem and that is addressing people's needs in this country which aren't going to be addressed simply by locking them up, but rather by, as was just addressed by Mr. Payne from New Jersey, addressing these problems before they become problems. 
   What we are here tonight to talk about is addressing people's emotional and mental health needs in this country so that as a Nation we don't have our criminal justice system become the mental health system that it has become in our society. 
   We as a country incarcerate more people in this country of ours than any other free country on the face of the Earth. We imprison more people in this country than any other free country on the Earth. It begs the question, why is it that America, which calls itself the land of the free, why do we jail so many people? We jail so many people because we fail to get ourselves prepared to come to grips with the violence in our society. We jail so many people in this country because we fail to come to grips with the drug epidemic in our society. 
   You just heard Mr. Poe from Texas talk about Border Patrol and the fact that these border agents are being held in jail because of drug smuggling charges and the problems that they have in interdicting drug smugglers. We heard from Ms. Jackson-Lee about the problem of charging criminals, the disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine and how disparate the charges are. 
   We are talking around the issue. We are talking around the issue. The issue is: What are we doing as a Nation to address this as a health problem that it is? Why in the world would people choose to keep using drugs if they know it is going to end up putting them in jail? Why would people continue to use drugs when they know it is going to cause them to either die or lose their families or lose their lives? But that is what it does to millions of Americans every year, and yet people continue to go on using. 
   Why do they go on using? Because this is an addiction. Because this is a physical disease, because this is a compulsion of the mind, of the body of the soul. And unless our country comes to grips with treating this disease for what it is, and that is a physical illness, like every other physical illness, then we as a society will not begin to address all of the other problems that we hear our colleagues come to the floor this evening to talk about. 
   We will fail to address the criminal justice problems. We will fail to find a way to deal with the incarceration problems. We will fail to find a way to deal with the drug smuggling problems. We will fail to find a way to deal with the violence problems if we don't first find a way to address the fundamental problem of treating people's physical illness which drives them to use drugs and alcohol which forces them into these situations which create the underpinnings of violence that create these problems in the first place. 
   Now many people say, Well, when people use drugs, that is their choice. It is a moral failing on the person's part if they get addicted. We know better now. We have done scans of the brain and we have done research and we have shown that a brain is an organ of the body, like every other organ of the body. And in fact just like somebody may have diabetes and if they get low sugar and they eat candy bars in order to get that sugar up, for many people who have depression, they use drugs to get their serotonin levels up, to get their neuroepinephrine up, to get their chemicals up in their brain  that are unusually low because of the way their brain is constructed. So they use drugs because they are looking for a way to get themselves back up, and that is the way that they try to compensate for their depression. 
   Many people have bipolar disorder, like myself. Initially, I used drugs in order to make myself whole again. I got addicted. I am fortunate because I got treatment. Now I am able to get medication and I am able to live a life that is free from addiction because of that treatment. As a result, today I am able to live a free life. But for many people in this country, they don't have that freedom because they don't have that opportunity to get treatment. Why? Because their insurance plans in this country, unlike Members of Congress, do not cover addiction treatment. Their insurance plans do not treat the brain like an organ in the body. As a result, they are denied treatment for their addiction; and as a result, many of them do not survive. 
   My friends, that is why my friend Congressman Ramstad and myself have been working so hard to see that we pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act in the United States Congress that would do away with the discrimination against this disease called addiction because we feel so strongly that people with addictions, illnesses that are mental illnesses, are no different than illnesses like any other illness of the body. They are just physical illnesses in the brain as opposed to physical illnesses in some other part of the body. And they are no different than any other part of the body. It is just that they are above the shoulders. But insurance companies don't treat these illnesses the same for insurance purposes, and that is what we want to see end. We want to see the discrimination against mental illnesses end, and this is about ending that discrimination. 
   We have stories this evening that we want to share telling about what we have learned in our tour around the country about how this issue is affecting millions of Americans. 
   At this time, I yield to JIM RAMSTAD who has been a champion of this issue during his many years in Congress and whose leadership on this issue has been second to none and whom I am proud to have worked with in this Congress on this issue. JIM, it has been a pleasure to work with you.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota. I ask him and say to everybody a rhetorical question. If you could imagine in this country insurance companies saying to you, ``Cancer is going to cost you a higher deductible or copay. We're going to charge you more for that because we choose to,'' I can only imagine the outcry in this country. They wouldn't allow it for a second if they charged more for treatment for one disease than another in any other part of the body, but they allow it for mental illness because there's a stigma in society. 
   Let's just face it. People are afraid of mental illness because they think it reflects something about them, their moral character, their ability to be strong and so forth. The fact of the matter is mental health is about being strong. 
   One of the great opportunities that I had as an early Member of Congress was to go down to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and rededicate the Special Warfare School named in honor of my late uncle, President John Kennedy. President Kennedy was the first to award the wearing of the green beret in Special Forces. And I was surprised to learn that the Special Forces have for them psychiatrists on staff 24 hours, 7 days a week for each of the units of our Special Forces. 
   And you'd think to yourself, why in the world would the strongest, most elite, most resilient of all of our military men and women, why would they ever need to see a psychiatrist? And the commanders told me it's not because of any weakness that we want them to have a mental health professional; it's, rather, we want them to be the best that they can be. And we know, we've sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into the training of these elite Special Forces. We've trained them to jump out of the sky. We've trained them to dive under the water and carry all kinds of things. We've trained them to do the most extraordinary tasks, and we've trained them to shoot at incredible ranges and to do incredible tasks. And we know that for them to be able to do those tasks at the maximum proficiency, they have to have a clear mind. They have to be unburdened by any stress in their life for them to have the maximum use of all their faculties and doing the job that this government asks them to do when they're tasked to go and defend the United States of America. 
   And I was astounded. I said to myself, Well, if we want the best for all of our Special Forces and are tasking mental health professionals so that we get the best from our Special Forces, why aren't we tasking this for the rest of our military? And, in fact, as we're finding out now, the military is slowly learning that, in fact, we should be doing that for the rest of our military. It actually makes sense, in order to save lives amongst our own military members, to train them in advance to them going to war, in advance of them going to defend our country, to prepare themselves not only physically, but to prepare them mentally for the challenges that lay ahead. Why? Why? Because, when they get back from that combat theater, we've all read about posttraumatic stress disorder. I prefer to call that combat stress illness because I don't see it as a disorder. Frankly, I see it as a normal reaction to abnormal situations. That's what war is. Soldiers are responding to stress that is absolutely abnormal. People killing people in the streets, bombs going off is abnormal. Soldiers responding to that is normal. So the stress that is known as posttraumatic stress is absolutely a normal response to war. It should be called combat stress illness. That means they can get over it with the proper treatment, and, frankly, we ought to be doing more to treat our soldiers and their families. But, frankly, we, as a country, have seen such a stigma towards mental health that we're losing our soldiers now to suicide at a record rate.     
   We have got 120 soldiers killing themselves every week back here in the United States after they've survived going over to Iraq. I only wish we added all those soldiers' names to the list of casualties in this the Iraq war, because if we added them to the names of those killed in action, this President's body count for the war in Iraq would be a lot higher than it is right now. 
   And the fact of the matter is we are missing the opportunity right now to intervene and take care of many of those soldiers because of our stubborn attitude towards mental health; and if we don't get it right with our soldiers and our veterans, we're not going to get it right for the rest of the American public. 
   Our American public is sympathetic to our soldiers because they've stood the line and defended our country, and if we can't understand why they don't need it, then how are we going to understand why a child in the inner city who is going to school in southwest Washington, who's seeing guns and bullets fly through their neighborhood and seeing police cars at night all around their neighborhood, because of gunshots echoing in the night, how are we  going to understand where that child isn't going to have post-traumatic stress? If a soldier's going to suffer from post-traumatic stress because of guns, bullets and bombs, how are we not going to expect a child growing up in our inner cities around our country not to have stress and not have the impact of that? 
   We need mental health for our soldiers. We need it for our children in this country who are growing up in traumatic situations.

   Mr. KENNEDY. And in fact, within 3 years in the State prisons, those prisoners have a recidivism rate of 70 percent. So those State prisoners will be back in the criminal justice system. Seventy percent of them will be revolving back within the criminal justice within 3 years, the reason being we don't have alternatives. We don't deal with the basic problem. 
   We need to have drug courts and drug treatment; and if we do that, we establish a way for these prisoners who are spending 35 grand, 40 grand a year to keep these people housed in prison and, yet, we're not. We're releasing them to what? They don't have the skills. They don't have the treatment. Whether they do, when they get out, they're going to go out and use again. If they have to use, they have to break in and enter. They're committing more crimes. 
   It doesn't solve the problem. It may make lawmakers feel good to beat their chest and say, oh, I sent that criminal to jail, but it is not making our constituents any safer, and it's not solving the problem. And the war on drugs is a joke if it doesn't address the demand side of the war on drugs.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (MENTAL HEALTH PARITY NOW -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. And, frankly, what the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act says is that we need to offer insurance because really what private insurance companies are doing is putting this on the public taxpayer because, for example, we heard a story out in Los Angeles about a single mom who was trying to get treatment for her son 
   with a methamphetamine addiction, and the insurance company told her that the in-patient treatment that her doctor told her her son needed was not medically necessary so she couldn't get it for her son. What happened to her son? Her son broke into a house to burglarize it to get the money for the drugs. He got caught up in the criminal justice system. Wouldn't you know, 2 years in jail, at the taxpayers' expense. Imagine what that could have bought in terms of treatment, all of which should have been covered by her insurance policy, which she paid for. 
   Now, the fact is, when you buy insurance, you should think health insurance, your body. I mean, where does it say health care only starts from your neck down? I don't know. I just can't understand where, when they say you're buying health insurance but your health only starts from your neck down. This is absolutely incredible in the year 2007 that we've got such patent discrimination in our country's laws, and we're still abiding by them, and that it is taking Congress this long to even consider legislation to end this patent discrimination. 
   So we need the people in this country to call their Representatives, to call their Senators and tell them that we need passage of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity bill, and let me just read another story about what happened about this medical necessity. 
   We had a woman whose daughter Katie was trying to get help for her heroin addiction. She had insurance. Her insurance company said that they couldn't treat her with in-patient treatment until she had OD'd, overdosed, at least once. So imagine this: they said, we can provide her with outpatient treatment, but of course, the outpatient treatment that they provided her was a great deal of distance from where she lived, so it made it very difficult for them to get to. I'm sure that was no coincidence by the insurance plan to make it difficult for them to get to. 
   What happened? Well, sure enough, Katie OD'd, but unfortunately, you can never tell whether you're going to survive an OD. Katie never survived her first OD to prove that she was an addict so that she could qualify for medical necessity by her insurance plan so that she could get health care insurance for her drug addiction. That is how crazy our health insurance system is when it comes to mental health. If  she had cancer and malignancy or a tumor in her, she would have been given that care, would have been given that care. But because this is a mental illness, she's been denied that care. 
   And we are looking to pass this legislation because we believe it's fundamentally wrong that this is not covered, and it should not be denied care. We know, once again, that the brain is part of the body. We can measure the metabolic changes in the brain now due to modern technology. If people and insurance companies are questioning the science based on determining any of this, all they need to do is go to the National Institutes of Health, National Institutes on Drug Addiction, National Institutes on Alcoholism, or National Institute of Mental Health. They can get all the information they want. 
   There is no sound basis for discrimination. It's patently wrong. It's based in fear and it's based in essential misinformation. And so we are constantly trying to pass this in spite of the efforts by insurance companies to fight us, and we need the American public to join us in this battle. Otherwise, we'll continue to see these tragedies reoccur over and over and over again in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you. 
   I wanted just to conclude with a couple of stories that I think are uplifting, and they show when people are successful in getting treatment that their lives really do turn around. 
   Marley Prunty-Lara spoke to us in one of our hearings. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was first diagnosed when she was 15 years old. And she and her mom were searching for a psychiatrist in her home State of South Dakota, and they were told that she would have to wait 4 to 5 months for an initial appointment. As Marley was stating in her testimony, she did not have that long to live. 
   Thankfully, she found care 350 miles away, in another State, and was hospitalized for 2 months. However, the residential treatment facility was not covered by her mother's insurance, forcing her parents to take out a second mortgage on their home in order for them to receive the care that their daughter needed for her to survive. 
   Marley stated that if she had suffered a spinal cord injury requiring long-term hospitalization, the insurance company would have paid for all of her care without any questions asked, but because her hospitalization involved a mental illness, it was deemed unworthy of insurance. Finally, Marley said, ``I understand the power of successful treatment because I am living it today. I have passionately lived with the prison of mental illness and I have also experienced the incalculable emancipation that accompanies wellness.'' 
   How can Congress continue to deny the opportunity to be well and live a full life to tens of millions of Americans every year? 
   We met with Amy Smith from Denver, Colorado, who also talked about her unmet mental health needs, how it cost her 40 years of her life, shuffling the roads in Denver, Colorado; muttering to herself; people dismissing her on the sidewalk, not talking to her; panhandling, using drugs; in and out of prison; in and out of detox; always being marginalized from society until one day she finally got the help she needed. 
   Her life is 180 degrees different today. She has a job. She has a house. She's paying taxes. But she said to us, Members of Congress, I lost those 40 years of my life. You can't give those years back to me. I wish I had gotten the treatment earlier in my life, but I didn't. I only hope that more Americans get the help they need earlier in their lives rather than waste their lives the way I did. But I didn't get that help. 
   We need to make sure that people live out their dreams. Amy Smith said that she had had the dream of getting married and having children. She said, I'm too old for that now. I can't have children now. I'm too old for that. She said, Maybe some day I might still get married, maybe I will adopt. But she said, I had all kinds of dreams of having a really successful career and really making the most of my life. She said, I feel like I've squandered so much of my abilities and talents. 
   And it was so clear to us that she had so much to offer, and those skills and talents were not realized because of her mental illness. And the fact is we have millions of Americans who have so much to offer in our society, and yet they and their potential is being squandered. Squandered why? Because we as a society failed to open up the door of opportunity to them simply because we reject their illness from being treated like every other illness. 
   And I think that's un-American. That's not what this country is all about. That's not what we as a nation are all about. And that's why we need to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 978, supporting ``School Social Work Week.'' 
   I introduced this resolution in order to recognize and support the critical, unsung work performed by social workers in schools across our country. 
   Each day across the country, school social workers can be found assisting educators to understand family, cultural, and community factors affecting students and meet the demands of providing quality educations for students of diverse backgrounds. 
   Each day they can be found working with administrators to design and implement effective prevention programs and policies that address school attendance, teen pregnancy, school violence and school safety, child abuse and neglect, special education, and more. 
   Each day school social workers can be found working with parents so that they may effectively participate in their child's education, improve their parenting skills, understand special education services, and access school and community services related to their child's needs. 
   Services provided by school social workers strengthen the ability of children to learn and to improve their futures. 
   It is a shame that fewer than 1 in 5 of the 17 million children in need of mental health services actually receive them. Improved and expanded school mental health programs would help to provide these services. The kinds of services that so many students desperately need are precisely the type of services that school social workers can provide. 
   That is why I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the House Education and Labor Committee for allowing this resolution to come to the floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (SUPPORTING THE OBSERVANCE OF COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his ambitious efforts on behalf of this issue. He has been tireless on behalf of spreading the word on the issue of prevention of colorectal cancer. I can recall for many years being invited to participate in events where he has been out there talking about prevention and prevention, prevention, prevention. I salute him for his efforts and thank him for his service to our country on behalf of this very important issue. 
   He said it as clear as anyone could say it, and that is that the most common reason people give for why they have not had a colorectal cancer screening is that it wasn't recommended to them. And the most common reason that people die of colorectal cancer is because they haven't been screened. So, what is the answer? The answer is we have to get people to recommend that they get a screening for colorectal cancer. If they get the recommendation that they get screened, then they have a 90 percent chance of survival. It's that simple. 
   Why are people dying of an illness that is so preventable? Because they're not being told, first, that the statistics are what they are, that this is preventable; and two, that the professions out there need to get about doing what they need to do to make those recommendations that people get the screening. If you're 50 and older, you need to get the screening. If you have it in your family, you need to get the screening. And these are the simple messages that we need to get out to the general public. And Al Wynn has been the leader in this Congress in making sure those messages get out to the public. And I want to thank Kay Granger for her efforts as well in sponsoring this bill. 
   But the fact of the matter is that we cannot sit idly by and think that this is something that simply is a matter of saving dollars. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Burgess, for pointing out that we save lots of money if we screen early. He pointed out accurately that the Lewin Group said that we spent nearly $8.5 billion just this last year treating colorectal cancer. Two-thirds of that will be paid by the Federal Government; two-thirds will be paid by our taxpayers. And imagine if we had screening, we could avoid that cost. If we had screening, the cost of a screening could avoid all the heavy expenses of that treatment. But imagine all the lives that it will save? Imagine all the fathers and mothers and sons and daughters and brothers and sisters who would be spared the awful trauma of having to be treated with cancer. 
   This is the right thing to do. It's not only the right thing to do, you know, financially, which should be a no-brainer for us in Congress, we're looking for ways to save money, this is a money saver, but this is the right thing to do for our people in terms of saving them the heartache. So, what do we need to do? We need to cover people. 
   In my State of Rhode Island, we already mandate, our insurance coverage already requires it. But unfortunately, as the American Cancer Society is trying to do nationally, we have 47 million Americans without health insurance. And until we get more people covered with health insurance, there are going to continue to be people who fall off. 
   That's why this legislation is so important. It sets up grants to States so that we can target those who don't have health insurance so that they can get the screening. If we know that they have colorectal cancer polyps prescreening, then we know we can get in there and make sure that they get the treatment early so that we're not stuck as a society having to pay down the road for the most costly and expensive kinds of treatment through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
   So, my friends, this is something that we need to do. I salute all of those in the cancer community who have been trying to preach this message. This is a message that needs to be preached. And I think that every month ought to be Cancer Awareness Month. I'm just happy that we now finally are getting about focusing on an illness that has been too quiet, too quiet. When you compare it to breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer screenings are the lowest of all of them, the lowest,  because it has been the most stigmatized of all cancers.     
   But colorectal cancer can no longer remain that way because too many people are dying as a result.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 2342, the National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act of 2008, was introduced by our colleague from Maine (Mr. Allen). This bill establishes a National Integrated Coastal Ocean Observation System to gather real-time data on the ocean environment, to refine and enhance predictive capabilities, and to provide other immediate societal benefits, such as improved fisheries management and safer navigation. 
   Capitalizing on newer and better integrated technologies would help address huge information gaps and significantly advance our understanding of ocean processes. I would say coming from a State called The Ocean State, this is a particularly important piece of legislation, and representing a university that is a recipient of Sea Grants, we are very interested in passing this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I have and will always support our troops. 
   I have grieved with their families when they have fallen in battle. I have visited them in the hospitals and watched as they recover from some of the most devastating injuries any human could endure. As a member of the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I joined my colleagues earlier this week in passing the largest increase in veterans' health care funding in 77 years. I want our soldiers and marines in Iraq and Afghanistan to never doubt that their country values their sacrifices and will always be there for them and their families, whether in battle or when they come home. 
   This bill, however, does not honor nor protect our troops. Without accountability and a clear change in policy, this bill simply becomes another blank check for President Bush to continue waging this war without regard to reality or the demands of the American people. The Congress has an obligation to provide our troops with the funding they need to succeed, but it is under no obligation to support a policy that leaves our troops trapped in the cross fire of a civil war. 
   This Administration's disregard for the reality in Iraq, for what a clear majority of Americans now demand, and what is in the best interest of our long-term national security has gone on for too long. This is a vote to make clear that the Congress will not sit idly by as more American soldiers and marines are sucked into the quagmire of Iraq. It is long since past time to begin bringing our troops home. American blood cannot be a substitute for Iraqi political will. 
   The Administration's mishandling of the war in Iraq has brought us to this point, and the Administration's determination to save face at all costs has again denied our troops a policy that takes full measure of the sacrifices they have made. 
   I cast this vote with a heavy heart. The White House has been playing a reckless game of ``chicken'' when it comes to our troops, but neither the Congress nor the White House will ever bear the true burden. Our troops and their families shoulder the true grief and pain of suffering. 
   The Administration has been served notice. It's my hope that this is only the beginning of Congressional efforts to force the Administration to face reality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Grijalva for offering me the time, and Chairman Frank for sponsoring this legislation, H.R. 415, the Taunton River Wild and Scenic Act, and let me just say as a Member of Congress from an adjoining district in Rhode Island, I want to repudiate the comments to the effect that these urban rivers are not wild and scenic just because they are in an urban area. 
   We have the Blackstone River Valley Heritage Corridor which is the Woonasquatucket River which runs right into Providence, Rhode Island, and you have a very urban river. Well, I will tell you, it is right in downtown Providence. And every weekend you have roughly 250,000 people from my State descend on downtown Providence during the weekend in order to watch the water fire because it is one of the great activities along the riverfront that takes place that draws people down to the riverfront every weekend during the summer months, and the spring months and fall months. 
   We also have children from Central Falls and Providence who wouldn't otherwise know that they live near a river because most of it is overgrown and yet they live merely 20 yards from the river. And now a lot of that is being opened up and they are gaining access to it, and because of the Clean Water Act that was passed in the late 1970s, we are seeing some of the indigenous fish come back and we are able to see these children go out and go fishing on the river and be able to catch fish and go canoeing and see that they can enjoy the environment as well. 
   The fact of the matter is I for one cannot understand why just because a river is running through a city-like environment, why children and the people who live in that urban environment cannot enjoy that river any differently than someone who lives in a real suburban and rural area, and that is something I want to disabuse everyone from. 
   I certainly think that the people who live in our inner cities of America deserve just as much of an opportunity to go out and enjoy the water. Frankly, it is the only open space that many of them ever gain access to. When you look at Heritage Harbor that you have seen these pictures of where the battleship Massachusetts is, we have Boys & Girls Clubs and we have the Boy Scouts and so forth use that battleship Massachusetts every single weekend over the course of the summertime. They are down there in that battleship cove, and they come from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
   This is a very active park. I think this designation fits very handsomely into what the activities of that area are. We need to preserve that area, and I think it would be disastrous to have further development that would spoil what is going on there. 
   The urban centers of New England are coming back alive. We lost the  manufacturing. We've lost so many of the areas that were keeping the industrial revolution alive. What is bringing these areas back is the tourism and the creative arts. People want to come back to these areas for those reasons, and that's why we want to preserve them. 
   The last thing we want to do is destroy what we have here which is unique to New England and that is the aesthetic value of these communities by bringing in more new construction, and that's why we want to set back the clock and keep these communities the way they were when they were originally built. 
   So you're right, we want to keep them historically accurate, and that's why we want them preserved time immemorial and for our children and down the line. 
   So that's why I think the Coast Guard was right, the National Park Service was right, and I hope my colleagues join me and all of my colleagues in the surrounding area and every single community who has voted in favor of this designation from the surrounding area in supporting H.R. 415 and making this historic Taunton Wild and Scenic Rivers Act a reality.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this amendment with my colleague Mr. Sestak. 
   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would amend the definition of medical care under the legislation to include mental health care. Under this definition, we measure the quality of health care in our military hospitals in order to determine that we ensure that our military personnel receive the best possible quality health care in the military that they ought to be entitled to. In doing so we ought to make sure that mental health care is part of that quality review process. And as we know full well, in the wake of this war, too many of our veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan have been suffering tremendously from wounds that may not be visible from the outside but are wounds nonetheless that are equally harmful. They are psychological wounds, Mr. Chairman. They are mental health wounds, and they are wounds, nonetheless, that need to be treated.     
   That is why we need to have the best quality mental health care that our military can offer, and that is why we want to make sure that when it comes to measuring quality health care in this legislation that mental health care is also measured as a quality indicator to ensure that our military personnel receive the best quality health care that they can receive. 
   On behalf of Mr. Sestak and myself, I move this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I only asked for the opportunity to speak in opposition just to claim the time in opposition. This is my amendment, so I won't be speaking in opposition to it. 
   Of course, I do want to speak in favor of this, because clearly this is the leading cause of disability, I believe, and will be the leading cause of disability for this war. As we have seen our soldiers come back, more and more of them are reporting mental health as the leading cause of disability; and, of course, this has been underreported in so many instances. 
   Why? It has been underreported because of the stigma, Mr. Chairman. Continued in this country is the fact that our society continues to stigmatize the treatment of mental illness. So even our soldiers who have every right to feel that they have been stressed by the experience of having suffered through the trauma of war, even those that have been through this experience and have every right to seek mental health treatment, even they feel stigmatized by having to need mental health treatment, and that is the reason why so many of them don't actually go and seek mental health treatment. 
   But in spite of the stigma, we still find that 35 percent of those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have sought treatment for mental health services. This is an enormous number, and I think it points very much to the fact that this is a very enormous challenge for our country. 
   Mr. Chairman, we need to deal with this problem before we even have these soldiers returning from Iraq, and that is why we are looking to have the psychological Kevlar act adopted in this legislation. 
   I want to identify Kristen Henderson, who is a spouse of a member of our military who came to my office and said, why is it that we are waiting until our soldiers get back from Iraq until we deal with their post-traumatic stress disorder? Why don't we start helping them become resilient, and how come we don't start preparing them for the trauma of war before they even get into the trauma of war? We do so much to put them into boot camps to train them physically for war. Why don't we do more to put them together and train them mentally for war? 
   This is what this amendment says. It puts the Department of Defense in the position where they have to put together a program where our military men and women are put into a curriculum where they are better prepared to deal with the conflicts and the stresses of war before they actually see the trauma of combat. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think that this is something that we need to do, because we need to make sure that when our soldiers come back that they don't have that sense of stigma attached to seeking mental health services. And if they understand that in order for them to be good soldiers that they need to be of sound mind and sound body and that is part of their being part of a esprit de corps, then they will be more forthcoming in seeking help when they need it. That will mean they will be better soldiers in the long run. 
   Mr. Chairman, just a few years ago, I had the opportunity to go down to Fort Bragg and see our Green Berets. Mr. Chairman, they have psychiatrists available 24 hours, 7 days a week. 
   You might ask, why do the best and brightest in the military have that? The reason they do is because the military has figured out that if they have anything else on their mind bothering them, they can't do their job the way they are best trained to do their job. I think, Mr. Chairman, if it is good enough for the Green Berets, then why isn't it good enough for the rest of our Armed Forces? 
   That is what this psychological Kevlar bill puts in place. It says we need to protect the mind as well as the body of our soldiers before battle, and we need to make sure that they are prepared for every eventuality when it comes to wartime. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote for this and destigmatize mental health and help the Department of Defense lift the veil of the stigma of mental illness and vote for the psychological Kevlar bill. For that reason, I will ask for a recorded vote on this amendment.     
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 4, legislation that will give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the power to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan and my good friend, the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for his good work on this legislation in bringing it to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important day, because this is a day where we take this Congress back from the special interests. We take it back from the drug companies and the HMOs, and we give it back to the people of this country and to the taxpayers. We take it from the drug companies who are charging excessive costs for profits for these prescription drugs to the detriment of our senior citizens who are paying exponentially high drug costs in the donut hole, and our taxpayers, who are paying 80 percent higher for these costs, and now we are going to be able to save those taxpayers and those consumers dollars by negotiating lower drug costs. 
   The taxpayers and the consumers are winners under H.R. 4. I urge its passage.  
   I am thrilled to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 4, legislation that will give the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) power to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan, and my good friend and Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for his work to bring this issue to the floor today. 
   I hear my friends on the other side of aisle singing praises for Medicare Part D, the new prescription drug plan. 
   But I wonder if the constituents I speak with receive the same benefit that these members are describing. 
   When I meet with seniors back home in Rhode Island, I hear about confusing formularies and crippling costs in the so-called ``donut hole.'' 
   I hear about nursing home patients who are no longer able to afford their new co-pays. 
   And then I hear a statistic stating that drug prices under Part D are more than 80 percent higher than prices negotiated by other agencies in the federal government. 
   When the Medicare Part D law was written, the drug companies had the loudest voice at the table. 
   Today, we are here to bring the voice of our seniors back to the bargaining table, and back to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 4 and to put the needs of the American people before those of special interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. KENNEDY. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation calling for the safe and responsible redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq. Make no mistake about it: The administration's incompetence in planning and executing the post-war occupation has brought us to this point. It is now Congress's responsibility to stand up for the majority of American voices who seek an end to this war. This bill provides for a redeployment of our troops not only so that they will be safe, but also so they will be focused on securing our Nation, not caught in the crossfire of a sectarian civil war in Iraq. We must provide for our men and women in uniform and their families. 
   Some assert with no basis that the war in Iraq has made us safer when, in fact, the opposite is true. I am deeply troubled by today's report from the National Counterterrorism Center which states that al-Qaeda is stronger now than at any point since 9/11. Terrorist cells capitalized on our preoccupations in Iraq to reestablish a presence in the Middle East and beyond. For years, the Administration has stubbornly insisted that Iraq is the central front of the War on Terrorism, but today's report clearly indicates just how damaging this war has been to our national security. 
   The President's progress report on Iraq issued today shows unsatisfactory improvement of security benchmarks. The report predicts a rise in insurgent violence in the coming months and an increased effort to disrupt life for Iraqis. In addition, there appears to be no improvement in eliminating the sectarian influences that have infiltrated Iraqi security forces. This is not acceptable. The administration has not delivered on its promises in Iraq and now we must move forward to establish a new direction. It simply is not fair to ask our soldiers and marines to continue to police someone else's civil war. It is especially irresponsible when considering the mountains of evidence from our own intelligence agencies pronouncing that this conflict cannot be solved by our military might alone. We must refocus our attention on the true threats to our Nation and our citizens. 
   Americans owe a debt of gratitude to our troops and their families for the sacrifices they have made during this difficult time. Servicemembers have had to endure difficult assignments and failed civilian leadership; but they have done so with honor and dignity. We must not forget the families who had to go without their loved ones for months at a time; the missed birthdays, baseball games, long nights away. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time for talking has ended; we must act, without delay, to redeploy our brave troops out of Iraq.
