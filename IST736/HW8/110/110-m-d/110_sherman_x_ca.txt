<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, IEEPA, has over the years enabled the United States on various occasions to impose significant economic sanctions and limitations on terrorists, terrorist groups and their supporters, on financiers and on some of the worst rogue regimes in the world. It has allowed three Presidents to keep the U.S. dual-use export control system in operation against the efforts of states like Iran and North Korea to require sensitive dual-use technology and equipment. 
   IEEPA has accomplished this goal, even though Congress has been unable to reauthorize the long-expired Export Administration Act, and I hope that later in this Congress we do reauthorize the Export Administration Act. That act was the original basis for the system of export control which is now handled through IEEPA. 
   Immediately after 9/11, IEEPA authority was used to freeze the assets of terrorist, terrorist organizations and their supporters and to hobble the international terrorist network that sought and still seeks to kill and maim innocent Americans. Yet the penalties for violating IEEPA's provisions are lighter than they should be. Send $1 million as a gift to Osama bin Laden and you get as a maximum penalty a $50,000 fine and 10 years in prison under the act. The same is true for unlawful exports of sensitive commercial technology, equipment and components that have military applications that are controlled for national security purposes.     
   If you send a milling machine for shaping nuclear warhead cores to either Iran or North Korea, the same maximum fine and prison terms under the act apply. 
   This bill increases the penalties to a level that I think is consistent with the importance of making sure that Americans do not, whether for ideological reasons or financial gain, deliberately violate our efforts to control terrorism and to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support of the bill. I thank Chairman Lantos and our ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their work in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   IEEPA is but one part of an overall effort to use the economic power of the United States to prevent terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons. I think we have adequately covered in today's debate the importance of this bill to strengthen IEEPA; but I now would like to put IEEPA into overall context and take a look at some of the other economic measures that we should also be employing in our effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   This House passed H.R. 1400 designed to improve the Iran Sanctions Act. We need to press our colleagues in the Senate to pass that bill as well. But even more important, we need to press the administration to enforce the Iran Sanctions Act. 
   Many of us know that as the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, or ILSA. What happened is both the last administration and this administration applied those sanctions to investments in the Libyan oil sector. That was effective. Gaddafi changed his policies, and so we had to rename the bill the Iran Sanctions Act, as we lifted sanctions from Libya. 
   Unfortunately, both the last administration and now this administration have been unwilling to enforce what is now the Iran Sanctions Act, which would be our best tool to put pressure on the regime in Tehran. 
   We need to close Iranian access to the U.S. financial system. I applaud the Treasury Department for blocking access to the New York Federal Reserve Board branch in New York to two major Iranian banks, which begs the question: Why not the others as well? 
   We need to stop World Bank loans to Iran. We need to urge upon our colleagues in the Senate that they pass H.R. 2337, known in their house as S. 1430, to allow American pension plans to divest from those companies doing business in Iran, and we need to urge the Senate to pass similar legislation already passed through this House doing the same thing with regard to investments in Sudan. 
   Finally, we need to make sure that our procurement laws and our laws for assisting businesses like the Ex-Im Bank and OPEC also require that corporations stop investing in the oil sector of Iran if they want the support of U.S. Government agencies. 
   It is time for us not to assume that the only possible response is either to acquiesce in a nuclear Iran or to use military action. It is time for us to get the message to Iranian elites and the Iranian people that they face true economic isolation if they continue down the current course. The way to do that is to muster all of the economic power of the United States towards achieving our national security objectives, and one small step in that direction is for us to pass S. 1612 today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our colleague from Texas, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for introducing this important and timely legislation, and I look forward to hearing her remarks as we proceed with this debate. 
   As we speak, millions of our Muslim friends and neighbors around the world are in the midst of Ramadan, a holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal. The observance of Ramadan requires devotion to faith, community and family, truly universal values we all share. During the month of Ramadan, observant members of the Islamic faith fast from sunrise to sunset and focus their attention on the teachings of their religion as well as purity of thought and action. 
   It is appropriate and necessary for the U.S. House of Representatives to mark the commencement of this important event which began this year on September 13 and continues for one lunar month. This legislation expresses the deep respect we all feel for Muslims in the United States and around the world. 
   Since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, unfortunately, peaceful patriotic members of the Islamic faith have been subject to hateful and demeaning threats, words, even acts of violence. This House must stand with these law-abiding citizens in this time of conflict. I strongly support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank our colleagues, Mr. Kirk from Illinois, Mr. Andrews from New Jersey, for introducing this important and timely legislation. 
   Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons in support of terrorism and its abuse of the human rights of its own people collectively form one of the most serious threats to peace and freedom faced by our country and faced by the world. It speaks volumes that Iran is a member of the International Labor Organization and formally subscribes to the core ILO principles like freedom of association, yet continues to jail those who attempt to form independent labor unions. 
   The mistreatment of two courageous labor leaders, Mr. Mahmoud Salehi and Mansour Osanloo, is yet another example of the unacceptable behavior of the regime in Iran. 
   Since 2004, Mahmoud Salehi, who comes from the Kurdish region of Iran, has been jailed on trumped-up charges for the crime of trying to organize a May Day rally in his own city. Unlike many well-known Iranian dissidents, Mr. Salehi is not a writer or a professor or even a politician. He is an ordinary man, a baker by trade, who has had the courage to stand up for the rights of working people. Since April 19 of this year, he has been imprisoned and denied access to the dialysis treatments he requires. 
   The same is true of Mansour Osanloo, who fell afoul of the regime for threatening in 2006 to lead his fellow bus drivers in Tehran out on strike. Mr. Osanloo was kidnapped from his bus by unknown parties and severely beaten. He too is now being held on vaguely worded charges. 
   It is appropriate and necessary for the United States House of Representatives to condemn the brutal mistreatment of these leaders and call for their immediate release. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and I encourage all my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (RECOGNIZING THAT VIOLENCE POSES AN INCREASINGLY SERIOUS THREAT TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank our colleagues, Congressman Eliot Engel and Dan Burton, the Chair and ranking member respectively of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, for introducing this important legislation. 
   The measure brings a long overdue spotlight to the serious and growing problem of violence in Central America. The February murder of three Salvadoran legislators and the subsequent shocking murder in prison of the Guatemalan policeman linked to the crime illustrate the very real daily threat posed by violence in this region. 
   While this high-profile incident brought violence into the spotlight, it is unfortunately nothing new. In recent  years, murder rates have been increasing throughout Central America. In 2005, the estimated murder rate per 100,000 people was roughly 56 in El Salvador, 41 in Honduras, and 38 in Guatemala. These rates are extraordinarily high by international standards. 
   Much of the violence in Central America is closely related to drug trafficking. A report released by the United Nations in May argues that Central American countries are particularly vulnerable to violent crimes, fueled by drug trafficking, because they are geographically located between South America and the United States; in other words, between the world's largest drug-producing and the world's largest drug-consuming countries or areas. In fact, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped from the Andean region to the United States flows through Central America. This clearly plays a major role in triggering violence in the region. 
   If drugs are the primary factor in the scourge of violence, youth gangs are a close second. There's estimated to be about 70,000 youth gang members in Central America. Many of these gangs have ties to the United States and pose threats to security in our own communities.     
   We are beginning to address this violence crisis. The United States and Central American officials have started to work together to combat violence in Central America, but more needs to be done. This July, high-level officials from the United States and all seven Central American countries met to discuss security in the region, particularly addressing gangs, drug trafficking and arms trafficking. This meeting marked the first time in almost a quarter century that high-level officials from the United States and all the countries of Central America met formally to discuss security issues. 
   At the meeting, the State Department announced the U.S. strategy to combat criminal gangs from Central America and Mexico and pledged $4 million to help Central America deal with the youth gang issue. I applaud this meeting and the State Department's initiative and encourage Central American countries to go beyond a police-based approach and address the social roots of violent crime. 
   With passage of the important measure today, the United States Congress will recognize that violence poses an increasingly serious threat to peace and stability in Central America. This resolution encourages Central American and U.S. officials to meet on a regular basis to enhance further cooperation in curbing violence in the region. 
   The measure also recognizes the U.S. has a commitment of $4 million to tackle this problem, and that is a welcome start. But, importantly, this resolution notes that greater resources should be considered in the future to fight the problem of violence in Central America. 
   Our friends in Central America are great and close allies, and we should do everything we can to bring stability to these societies and to end excessive violence. That is why I urge all Members to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (TAIWANESE SELF-DEFENSE CAPABILITY -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, for introducing this important resolution and Chairman Lantos, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for moving this to the floor. 
   When it comes to military sales to Taiwan, U.S. policy is clear: We must ensure that the thriving democracy of Taiwan has the capacity necessary to defend itself from outside threats. 
   We in the United States provide defensive military equipment to Taiwan, not just because it is right to aid our democratic friends, but because it is the law of the land under the Taiwan Relations Act. The Taiwan Relations Act, which has been the core of our policy toward Taiwan for almost 3 decades, also states clearly that the United States should base its decision on whether to supply defensive military equipment to Taiwan solely on the basis of the security needs of the Taiwanese military, not on the basis of political concerns. 
   In the context of these guiding principles, the administration currently has before it a decision on whether to sell F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan, fighters which Taiwan has expressed a clear interest in purchasing and for whose purchase they have budgeted $488 million in their 2007 defense budget and another $764 million in their budget for 2008. 
   The answer of the United States should be obvious. We should agree to sell the fighters without delay. Yet the administration has dragged its feet and failed even to respond to our Taiwanese friends; and this, in spite of the fact that under Taiwanese laws the funds for the fighters will no longer be available after October 31 of this year. If we do not offer to sell the planes by that date, the rules governing Taiwanese defense spending require that these funds be deleted from their budget. 
   Some have argued that this delay is justified because in a tense political season in Taiwan, the United States does not want to be seen as taking sides in the upcoming Taiwanese election. This assertion is wrongheaded and shortsighted in the extreme. This resolution in no way indicates support for one political party or another. 
   Furthermore, under the Taiwan Relations Act, we are supposed to make our decision based upon the needs of the Taiwanese military, not based on some argument that we would be falsely seen as supporting one political party or another, which, of course, is hardly the case if we decide to follow our own law and provide the Taiwanese military with the planes they need for military security. 
   I support this resolution and the sale of the F-16C/Ds to Taiwan so that the people of Taiwan can protect their democracy and to advance our security interests in East Asia. My support does not in any way indicate support for any candidate in Taiwan for any elected office, nor would selling these planes or agreeing to sell them indicate the support of the United States Government for any particular political party or candidate. 
   There are still others who claim that the F-16 sale, and this resolution, will upset the balance of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan already has F-16 aircraft, so these additional planes will hardly upset the balance between Taiwan and China. 
   Moreover, no one puts forward the idea that Taiwan is today going to invade the mainland. It is obvious that the weapons Taiwan acquires are for defense, not for offense, and so a country acquiring military weapons to defend itself is not upsetting the balance of power but, rather, preserving the military status quo, preserving stability and peace. 
   I would also point out that the Taiwan Relations Act and our arms sales under this act have been instrumental in maintaining peace and security across the Taiwan Straits and in East Asia for 30 years.     
   Under this peace, Taiwan developed from authoritarian rule into a robust and lively democracy. Taiwan has asked our assistance in defending itself, and it deserves from us the respect of a prompt response. 
   I strongly support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him for this outstanding piece of legislation. 
   Yesterday, at Columbia University, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made two points that were newsworthy. First, there are no gay people in Iran. Second, there is no nuclear weapons program in Iran. These two points are equally true. 
   To focus on Iran's nuclear program, we do not need military action. I want to emphasize that this bill does not authorize, it does not justify, it does not urge military action in any way. In fact, it gives us an alternative, and that is economic and diplomatic pressure. 
   Now, we owe a special debt of gratitude to the mullahs who are running Iran, because their mismanagement, corruption and oppression has made their government vulnerable, vulnerable even in an $80-a-barrel world. Today, Iran faces a slow decline in its oil fields. Without further investment, they won't be exporting oil in 10 years. Today, as I speak, they are rationing gasoline in Tehran. 
   We need to be able to use our considerable broadcasting resources to send a message into Iran for the people and elites of that country: that you face diplomatic and economic isolation if you don't abandon your nuclear program. The problem is that none of us can lie that well in Farsi. We have not imposed economic isolation on Iran. But with this bill, we can begin. 
   We have acquiesced in World Bank loans to the Government of Iran. With this bill, we stop putting money into the unit of the World Bank that is making loans to Iran. We ought to look at other things we can do to make sure that there are no further World Bank loans to Iran. 
   Currently, we import from Iran--not oil, but only the stuff we don't need, and they can't sell anywhere else. This bill ends imports from Iran. 
   With regard to oil companies, again, we owe a special debt of gratitude to those mullahs whose outrageous business practices and threats of expropriation have made oil companies reluctant to invest in Iran. But now we have got to make them more reluctant to invest in Iran. This bill turns to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. oil companies and bans their investment in Iran.  
   With regard to foreign-based oil companies, it sends a clear message: Don't do business with Iran if you expect to do business-as-usual in the United States. We have had that kind of sanction against foreign-based oil companies for quite some time under what was then called the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). We applied that act against Libya, and it worked. It is now time to apply that act with regard to oil companies investing in Iran. This bill moves us a long way in that direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (RECOUNTING REASONS FOR VOTING IN FAVOR OF 2002 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I remember well the debate on this floor in 2002 about whether to give the President the power he sought to take military action, if necessary, against Saddam Hussein. But before that resolution even came to this floor, we considered it in the International Relations Committee. There, we were told that the administration would invade Iraq only if the inspectors were not allowed to do their job. In fact, Secretary Powell told us that before the whole committee. Then he told me that privately. 
   Now, I did not completely trust the administration. So in committee I offered a resolution that would allow the use of force only if the inspectors were not allowed to do their job. A majority of Democrats in the committee voted for that resolution. The Republicans pretty much all voted against it; and it was defeated. 
   Then we all came to this floor, and Mr. Spratt of South Carolina put forward a resolution that would allow the President to use military force, but only under certain circumstances, such as force being authorized by the United Nations. I voted for Mr. Spratt's resolution. Unfortunately, it was defeated. 
   And, finally, the supporters of the President were able to say that there was only one last resolution before us: either we gave the power to the President that he sought, but that he promised to use only if the inspectors were expelled or prevented from doing their job, or we left ourselves in a position where Saddam was free to expel the inspectors and to go all out with his weapons of mass destruction program. 
   At that point, I voted for an overly broad resolution, a resolution that gave the President more power than he claimed he would use, or gave him power to act under circumstances all under when he said that he would act only under a limited number of circumstances. That of course is not what happened. 
   The President took that power, made little or no attempt to ensure the inspectors were allowed to do their job, dismissed them, in effect pulled them out of Iraq, and invaded at an early opportunity. Obviously, if I knew then how the President would use the power granted by this Congress, I never would have voted to give him that power. 
   Not only did he invade even though the inspectors were then able to do their job and, as it turned out, they were right, there were no weapons of mass destruction--but then, in secret briefings on this floor, we had been told (and this has been reported in press, I am not revealing anything), that the plan was to invade Iraq from the north and from the south, so as to take control of the country quickly. What happened was that Turkey at the last minute declared that our troops couldn't go through Turkey, and our best division was sitting there in the middle of the Mediterranean. 
   So we had a plan. The plan had been previewed to those of us in Congress. The plan involved our best division. (I will just say one of our best divisions; I don't want to cast anything but total glory on all our divisions.) But one of our best divisions was left sitting in the Mediterranean. Now, you would think if you had a plan and you couldn't execute the plan, you would go draft a new plan. Instead, they just took the northern half of the plan and threw it away and implemented the southern half of the plan. Needless to say, we did not take immediate control of Baghdad. Needless to say, there was chaos. And the rest is history. 
   But there are a host of other mistakes made by the Bush administration. They were detailed by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton). They included an inadequate number of troops at the beginning; disbanding the Iraqi Army when the Saudis, who have some understanding of the area, had advised us to do the exact opposite; not guarding the arms depots; and a host of other problems. 
   Now we are being asked to authorize a surge. An escalation is the real word. And we are told that this is critical because Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism. Well, is that really true? 
   We are told that Iraq could become a place where terrorists could meet and plot. Today they are meeting and plotting in North Waziristan, in much of Afghanistan, in much of Somalia, pretty much anywhere they want in Iran and in Syria and Sudan. They have plenty of places to meet and plot. How many Americans are supposed to die on the theory that denying the terrorists one place to meet will prevent them from meeting in all the places they are meeting today? 
   Then we are told that there will be a humanitarian debacle in Iraq. And, again, the prognosis for Iraq is not particularly good, but it is by no means clear that we have not done all we can be expected to do to help the people of Iraq avoid a civil war and achieve unity. And at some point it may be necessary to say that Iraq's decisions need to be made by the Iraqis. 
   Keep in mind that during Saddam's tenure, year in and year out, he killed far more people than have been killed in the time since we invaded. We have bestowed upon the Iraqi people not just the pain and suffering that they have now, but also freedom from a Saddam Hussein who in prior decades had killed not the thousands we see being killed now but hundreds of thousands and millions. Our moral responsibility to the Iraqi people was to do what was reasonable to help them reestablish order. I think we have met much of our moral responsibility. We can do more by providing economic and other aid. And we should keep in mind that Iraq is just one of many places in the world suffering great humanitarian crises. 
   Finally, we are told that we are going to empower and overjoy the terrorists if they see us leave Iraq or see us fail to surge into Iraq. Keep in mind, the smarter terrorists are thrilled to have us pinned down there, and to have us bled dry there. 
   But, finally, even if all these things being put forward by the administration are true, even if withdrawal from Iraq or failure to surge into Iraq gives terrorists a place to gather, sets the stage for humanitarian crisis, and overjoys the terrorists, there is no evidence that we are now doing anything but delaying the inevitable by surging over the next few months, or escalating over the next few months. So since we are by no means winning or prevailing, surging is just doing more of the same. 
   The President has asked us to compare the Global War on Radical Islam with the Cold War, and I think it is an apt comparison. Iraq has some real similarities to Vietnam. And the one thing we all remember about Vietnam is being told that if we didn't prevail in Vietnam, the communists would be on the beaches in Santa Monica. What did we finally do? We withdrew from Vietnam, and doing so was a critical step in winning the Cold War just 15 years later. 
   I would say that we should pick our own battlefields, we should learn from the Vietnam mistake, and we should recognize that the way to beat radical Islam may be to recognize that Iraq is not the central front and that we have to do a lot of things in a lot of places in the world, and cannot allow ourselves to be utterly fixated on Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (PREVENTING IRAN FROM OBTAINING NUCLEAR WEAPONS -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons ought to be the number one foreign policy objective of the United States. A nuclear Iran would spark region-wide nuclear proliferation. In fact, (Saudi Arabia and its allies have already announced that they are beginning a nuclear program to respond to what Iran is doing). Further, if the Iranian Government were close to being overthrown, and some of us look forward to that day, it could smuggle a nuclear weapon into the United States--either in an effort to reassert popularity with its own people, or with the idea that they would rather go out with a bang. 
   Now, we cannot stop Iran's nuclear program just by meeting with Iranian emissaries. Secretary Rice has offered to meet with representatives of the Iranian Government anywhere, at any time, to discuss any agenda--so long as during the talks Iran suspends uranium enrichment, just as Iran suspended uranium enrichment when they were talking with European leaders. The refusal of Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, even for a few days in order to speak with Secretary Rice, speaks loudly about their willingness and desire to speak with us. 
   Likewise, we cannot stop Iran's nuclear program by making unilateral concessions to Iran. We did that in the year 2000. We opened our markets to everything Iran would want to export to us, except oil--things like carpets and dried fruit. In fact, we opened our markets to everything we didn't need, and they couldn't sell anywhere else. The result in public was nasty comments from the Iranian foreign minister. In private what they did was redouble their efforts to obtain nuclear weapons, and provide assistance to the 9/11 hijackers, according to the 9/11 Commission, though they apparently didn't know the exact mission of those they were assisting. 
   But we can block Iran's nuclear program only if we can pass extreme Security Council sanctions. The mere adoption of strong sanctions at the United  Nations would be of enormous political impact on the people of Iran. A ban on selling Iran refined petroleum products would dislocate its economy and bring enormous popular pressure on the Government of Iran, because although Iran exports petroleum, it doesn't have the refining capacity--and therefore is dependent on imports for almost half of its gasoline. 
   So how do we get these very extreme U.N. Security Council sanctions? Only with a dramatic change in Russia's policy. 
   Now, our current approach to securing that critical Russian support has been very ineffective, and we have achieved only token sanctions that Tehran can laugh off. 
   The only way to get the kind of Russian support we need is by offering real changes on our policy toward issues in Russia's own geographic region--issues Russia cares a lot about, issues not of great significance to most of us in the United States. Our efforts to convince Russia to change its Iran policy only because, well, they ought to do it, have been remarkably unsuccessful. We need to address Russia's concerns to change their policy toward Iran's nuclear weapons. 
   In particular, we may need to offer to make modest changes in our policies towards such issues as the Russian-speaking peoples of Moldova, Latvia and Estonia, the route of Caspian Sea oil pipelines, and Chechnya and Abkhazia. 
   Now, the State Department bureaucracy is prejudiced towards this approach for three reasons: First, a bureaucracy has bureaus, and they have got an Abkhazia bureau that doesn't want its interests sacrificed for some more important national security priority. Second, there are those in the administration with such an almost faith-based excessive estimate of our national power. They think we can achieve all of our national objectives and that we don't have to sacrifice or delay any of them. Finally, many of America's foreign policy experts grew up in the Soviet era. They spent their time strategizing how to encircle and weaken Russia. And, Madam Speaker, old habits die hard. 
   Nothing is more important to America's national security than an all-out diplomatic effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have heard a lot of folks talk about the substance of this agreement. They started reading the agreement at the front. They saw the substance. They see the labor and the environmental standards. I think they are reading it in the wrong way. With an agreement like this, you need to start reading it from the back where the enforcement provisions are supposed to be. 
   So let us test the enforcement mechanisms in this agreement. Let me put forth an extreme possibility, an extreme example. Let's say there is a military coup in Peru. Let's say the junta is rounding up labor leaders. Let's say they start executing those labor leaders, God forbid. Let's say they televise those executions and they are being conducted by the head of the junta himself. What enforcement is there in this agreement? Only so much as George Bush decides to have. If he chooses to do nothing, then no action by any court of this country, no private action, no act by this Congress will be of any effect. 
   In contrast, importers will have an absolute right to enforce their rights to low tariffs on the Peruvian goods they bring into this country because if the tariff is lower, no customs agent of the United States could try to collect a higher amount. President Bush has never inconvenienced a multinational corporation. When in Guatemala, labor leaders like Marco Ramirez and Pedro Zamora were killed, President Bush did nothing. When dozens and more, scores of labor leaders in Colombia are killed, President Bush tells us we should have a free trade agreement. 
   The only provisions in this agreement that provide for enforcement can be nullified at the whim of a man who has no intention of enforcing this agreement. If you vote for this agreement, it's because you have faith in George Bush to enforce it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 1 minute. I can't possibly in that minute describe the problems with this bill. I hope people will pick up the blue paper that I'm distributing. 
   But what they have done to the bill is they have added special tax breaks for those who import bows and arrows, and those who import wool, thus displacing American products as part of the economic recovery package. That's why it's not the economic recovery package. It's the pork-laden, earmark-laden Wall Street bailout bill. It is a bill that will send hundreds of billions of dollars not for bad investment decisions made in America but to buy toxic assets currently in the safes in London and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Beijing. It is a bill that will allow million-dollar-a-month salaries, and $5 million-a-month salaries, to be paid to executives who have driven their firms into the ground and now need a taxpayer bailout. It is a bill that provides for an oversight board that critiques, but cannot stop anything. 
   Vote ``no'' now. We will stay in town and write a good bill.

   Mr. SHERMAN. Wall Street wants the $700 billion so bad they can taste it. To get it they need two things. First, you create panic; then you block alternatives, and then you herd the stampeding cattle toward passing a bad bill. 
   We are told that we must act in hours. The fact is, we have taken 2 weeks and we can take another week, not a week of trying to jam us with a bad bill, but a week of writing a good bill. As over hundreds of economists have told us, including three Nobel Laureates, we ask Congress not to rush, to hold appropriate hearings and to carefully consider the course of action.  
   What have they done to the bill? 
   They've added earmark pork to the bill that they think will finally get us to buy it. 
   Don't fall for it. If we're going to deal with this crisis, we need to deal with it with other alternatives. Defeating this bill today is not the last step, it's the first step in passing a good bill.

   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of TAA assistance and therefore oppose this weakening amendment. 
   But we should recognize that TAA is a Band-Aid on a self-inflicted wound. Our trade policies are gutting the American economy far beyond the ability of TAA to ameliorate the pain. 
   What is obvious is the loss of individual industrial plants. What is less visible is the increase in our interest rates and a decline in our national industrial base. 
   Today, let us adopt the Band-Aid, but let us not use the presence of those Band-Aids as an excuse for further self-inflicted wounds.     
   Today, we should pass TAA. Tomorrow, let us stop the bleeding. Let us not adopt trade agreements that increase our trade deficit. And let us begin to renegotiate existing trade agreements so that they are based on results rather than based on form. 
   Let us build an economy where demand for labor is so high that instead of hearing stories of pain from workers, we are hearing from employers fighting for every available employee. Let us hear of a dollar that is more valuable than the Euro and let us have a trade policy that for every dollar of imports, we match it with a dollar of exports. Until then, there are workers who are in pain, who are casualties of our ill-conceived trade policies. They need and deserve our help.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Just because your constituents hate this bill--and will hate it more when they learn the details--does not mean that voting for it is an act of courageous patriotism. Just because this bill is unpopular doesn't mean we have to pass it immediately. Some 400 eminent economists, including three Noble Laureates, are asking us to come back and do our job and write a good bill in the next week or so. 
   They state--and their chart is here so you might want to read along--``We ask Congress not to rush, to hold appropriate hearings and to carefully consider the right course of action.'' Four hundred economists, three Noble Laureates. 
   Now, we know that this bill will allow million-dollar-a-month salaries to executives at bailed out firms, and it allows hundreds of billions of dollars to be used to buy the toxic assets currently held by foreign investors. But we're told not to worry because this $700 billion bill isn't going to cost us anything. We're going to recoup all of the costs from some future revenue bill that we will enact. 
   Now, the bill does not automatically enact any revenue increase, nor does it protect a revenue bill from filibuster or veto. Congress is highly unlikely to pass a multi-hundred billion dollar tax increase in 2013 or any other year. Tax increase bills are anathema to many. Forty-one Senators can block the plan, and we're giving Wall Street enough money to hire 4,100 lobbyists. 
   In recent years, Wall Street has effectively defeated every attempt to close every loophole they currently exploit, no matter how pernicious, including those involving Cayman Island tax havens used by hedge fund managers to pay zero tax. 
   Section 134 of the bill says the tax will be on the entire ``financial services industry''--good banks who don't need a bail out; bad banks who used a bailout; community banks, maybe even credit unions. 
   It is absolutely impossible to draft a tax that will hit only those firms who receive bailout payments and even more impossible to draft one that taxes each bank in proportion to how much money we lose on the toxic assets we happen to buy from them. In fact, there are no provisions in this bill that even keep track of the losses on the assets we acquire from an individual bank as we manage them, combine them, put them together in pools with assets we acquire from other banks and then sell them off. 
   Now, these bailed-out firms, many of them won't exist in 2013. Some are going to go under. Some of the bailed-out firms are just shell companies anyway. For example, if the Bank of Shanghai currently owes $30 billion of toxic assets to its tiny subsidiary it has already incorporated in California, the subsidiary will sell those toxic assets to the Treasury; the bailout went to that tiny subsidiary in 2009; it's not even going to exist in 2013. 
   Many of the bailed-out firms are going to be unprofitable in 2013. And therefore you're not going to be able to put an income tax on them. Some of the bailed-out firms are going to move offshore before 2013. Wall Street gets their money now, and we get it back never.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Let me quickly respond to the comments of the gentleman from Ohio. He can attack this bill as he will, except he cannot say that it is related to George Bush. Bush stalled and weakened this legislation throughout the 110th Congress. It would be law today without the opposition of the Bush administration. 
   He also tells us, he quotes from the NIE, that Iran seems to have suspended its weaponization program. Weaponization is the small, easy and delayable part of developing a nuclear weapon. The tough part is getting enough highly enriched uranium, and Iran is working full bore and proudly unveiled 3,000 and more centrifuges to do that. They can wait a couple of years, and then work on the engineering of how to take that enriched uranium and turn it into an atomic weapon, without delaying for a day the day they have become a nuclear power state. 
   I also want to agree with the ranking member when she states that this bill does not waive or make waivable any sanction in existing law. The sole purpose of this law is to increase and apply new sanctions to Iran, not to waive or make waivable any sanction under existing law. 
   The goal of this bill is to drive home to the people and elites of Iran that they face economic isolation if they do not abandon their nuclear program. But let's not exaggerate its impact. It is long overdue, modest steps in that direction. 
   The bill includes concepts from two important Iran sanctions bills that passed the House overwhelmingly in 2007. Within 6 months of our taking office, with the strong support of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, under the leadership of Chairman Lantos and Chairman Frank, the House passed the two Iran sanctions bills that have become the centerpiece legislation of efforts on Iran in the 110th Congress: H.R. 1400, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act, authored by the late Tom Lantos; and H.R. 2347, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, authored by Chairman Frank and introduced in the Senate by Senator Obama. 
   We have worked over the opposition of the Bush administration to pass these bills through the House. Then they got bogged down in the Senate. Now the Senate, with Senators Dodd and Shelby, have reached consensus on an Iran package that encompasses the concepts in the House bills, though weakens them. This bill would already be in the Senate DOD authorization bill had a bipartisan consensus not broken down. 
   So now we have this imperfect bill which we need to enact, and hopefully the Senate will act on it in the next few days.

   Mr. SHERMAN. The bill takes important steps like reinforcing the embargo on Iranian goods. We don't import oil  from Iran. We only import the stuff that we don't need and they couldn't sell elsewhere. Unfortunately, this provision is waivable. 
   If it clarifies that a U.S. company, and I take some pride in authoring this provision, may not use its overseas subsidiaries to do business with Iran that it could not do on its own. Unfortunately, this provision is also waivable. 
   I would hope that people would understand, you get overwhelming rhetoric from the administration about how much they hate Ahmadinejad. The little secret is they have a love for the total independence of multinational oil corporations that exceeds their hatred of Ahmadinejad, and that is something the country does not understand. That is why the Bush administration has bottled up this legislation. We need to pass it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (LEGISLATION TO REPEAL SECTION 14(b) OF THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, in about a week, I will introduce legislation to repeal the infamous section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act and to rid this country once and for all of the so-called Right To Work statutes in 21 or 22 of our States. 
   Now, section 14(b) of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act allows States to pass the so-called Right To Work laws, which strip unions of the right to charge fees even when they negotiate the contract that the employee works under. 
   Section 14(b) has been controversial from its inception. It was vetoed by President Truman. It became law only overriding that veto. What we have now is a network of different labor laws in different States that pits the workers in one State against another, that pits businesses in one State against another, that creates an unlevel playing field for businesses in one State as opposed to businesses in another State. 
   So-called Right to Work is union busting. It is that simple. Right to Work strips unions of their ability to require payment for the contract negotiation that they do. It is designed to encourage free riders and to weaken and destroy unions. 
   Every worker benefits from the union contract, but under so-called Right to Work laws, some pay absolutely nothing to the union that negotiates that contract. That encourages others to choose to pay nothing, and eventually the union unravels. That is exactly what has happened in the 22 so-called right-to-work States. 
   Now, Right to Work States have significantly lower unionization rates than do other States. The unionization rate in my State of California is 18 percent; in New York, 26 percent; in Washington State, 21 percent; in Wisconsin, 16 percent; in New Jersey and Michigan, 21 percent. None of those States have so-called Right to Work statutes. In contrast, such right-to-work States such as Texas, Arkansas, Utah and Georgia, have only 6 percent unionization rates, and North Carolina, with its Right to Work laws, has an only 4 percent unionization rate. 
   Now, it can be alleged that those who are in right-to-work States don't need unions. They enjoy great pay and great working conditions. Well, let's look at the facts. The average worker in a so-called Right to Work State makes $5,333 less per year than a worker in a free bargaining State. That is a comparison of $35,500 on the one hand, with $30,167 on the other. Some 21 percent more people lack health insurance in Right to Work States as compared with free bargaining States. And as for workplace and safety, workplace deaths are 51 percent higher in States with so-called Right to Work laws. 
   It is time that we repeal section 14(b). It is time that we let unions organize and time that we allow workers who want to have a union, to enjoy that right. 
   I serve as the Chair of the subcommittee of Foreign Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over trade issues, including the International Labor Organization. The ILO is the official international organization affiliated with the United Nations that sets labor standards. It is clear that our Right to Work laws violate international labor standards. The National Organization of Manufacturers acknowledged this just a few days ago when they pointed out that while Right to Work laws probably violate the ILO core conventions, we as a country have not ratified those core conventions. So a country that should be in the forefront of the world, in the forefront of human rights, civil rights and labor rights, has in 22 of its States laws that violate the ILO core convention. 
   It is time for America to stand in the forefront of human rights, civil rights and labor rights. It is time to end so-called Right to Work. 
   I urge my colleagues to contact me if they are interested in being original cosponsors of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to commend our distinguished colleague Mr. Trent Franks of Arizona for introducing this resolution. Roughly 20 million people in India are subject to discrimination, and sometimes worse, simply because of their caste. Discrimination inflicted against people known as Dalits and Tribals in India is solely based on being born into a certain family. This is an unethical practice and is outlawed under the Indian Constitution. The whole concept of untouchability itself is banned by the Indian Constitution. However, enforcement of this law ought to be strengthened, and crimes against Dalits ought to be prevented, more vigorously investigated and prosecuted. 
   This resolution seeks to state clearly the sense of the United States Congress in this regard. We must continue to raise this issue in our bilateral meetings with our good friends in the Government of India, especially at a time when the United States-Indian relationship has entered into an unprecedented and unparalleled partnership. 
   Furthermore, we must ensure the antipoverty programs and other programs we support in India incorporate the needs of the Dalit community. Our government and our companies that do business in India ought to make a special effort to help these people, because right now they may often have little help in their own communities, although there are programs of the Indian Government also focused on meeting these needs. 
   It is our moral obligation to speak out against abuses of human rights, wherever we see them, even in countries that are our allies and excellent partners. That is why Congress must address the problem of the treatment of Dalits and Tribals in India. 
   We need to be consistent. It is easy to criticize our adversaries, but we have even more impact when we point out the failings, both past and present, and the need for improvement of our friends and allies. 
   The world's oldest democracy, the United States, and the world's largest democracy, India, should work together to end legacies of ethnic discrimination in both of our countries. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank the many colleagues who have been involved in crafting this legislation, including Chairman Lantos, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, Ranking Member Royce, Mr. Manzullo, Ambassador Watson and others. Their assistance was critical in the bipartisan effort of making the Overseas Private Investment Corporation even more effective. 
   As I proceed, I will point out that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation is saddled with the most unfortunate acronym in Washington, OPIC. Let us hope it is not confused with that other, nefarious organization, OPEC. 
   OPIC's mission is ``to mobilize and facilitate the participation of United States private capital and skills in the economic and social development of less developed countries and areas.'' 
   Since its creation in 1971, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation has generated $71 billion in U.S. exports, supported over 271,000 U.S. jobs, and supported projects in over 150 developing countries. 
   OPIC uses a nimble, private-sector model to accomplish its important public-sector goals, to further development in poor countries, including unstable countries, and to support the goals of American foreign policy. It supports targeted investments in some of the world's poorest countries, many of which would otherwise not benefit from American private-sector projects because the private sector would be otherwise unwilling to take the risks involved. 
   OPIC, being part of the Federal Government, is uniquely qualified to carry out this mission. There are private sector organizations which will sell on rare occasions expropriation insurance, but they often refuse to sell such insurance or refuse to finance projects in difficult and problematic countries because if expropriation did occur, they would only have their private-sector contacts to persuade the foreign government to relent. In the case of OPIC, it is able to rely on the United States State Department to convince foreign countries not to expropriate projects and assets funded by or guaranteed by the United States agency. 
   OPIC has a sophisticated system that reviews applications and funds projects in some of the places where companies are least likely to get the very kind of insurance they are most likely to need; namely, insurance for political risk. In fact, OPIC requires applicants for assistance to seek insurance in the private market and certify that it was unavailable before OPIC will offer its services. 
   OPIC operates at no net cost to the United States taxpayer. Amazingly, it has turned a profit in every single year of its operations and now has reserves of $5.3 billion on deposit in the U.S. Treasury. Despite working in some of the least developed countries of the world, it has amassed this $5.3 billion in reserves. If all of our government agencies ran this way, perhaps even those on the other side of the aisle would be more favorably disposed to Federal programs.     
   Today's bill not only reauthorizes OPIC but improves both its strategy and oversight to make it the most responsible investor it can be. 
   With this bill, the new and improved OPIC will work in countries and with companies, private sector companies, in a manner which provides greater protection for international worker rights. 
   The new and improved OPIC will take additional steps to guarantee that its projects do not damage the environment and, in fact, move toward a greener economy. 
   The new and improved OPIC will be as transparent as possible and more transparent than any Federal agency I am aware of. 
   I want to especially focus on section 10 of the bill because it contains a provision that is unique as to bills that have come to this floor, but which is being talked about in a wide variety of our other bills, designed to focus on using the economic power of the United States to deal with terrorist countries, particularly those who are committing genocide, such as Sudan, or developing nuclear weapons, such as Iran and North Korea. 
   If this bill is enacted, this provision would be the only statute requiring a screen for companies doing business with a U.S. government agency that requires the private sector companies to certify that neither they nor any entity, as part of their affiliated group of corporations, is engaging in an enterprise which is helping terrorist states as defined in the bill. 
   Now, one of the toughest issues for anyone trying to use the economic power of the United States to achieve our foreign policy objectives must ask is, what types of investments are we trying to discourage? The broader the definition of what we're trying to discourage, the less focused the pressure that we put on private sector entities. 
   In this bill, and this is a bill that I hope will form a template for the divestiture movement in the United States, for procurement laws that come before this Congress, et cetera, we focus rather narrowly the economic pressure of the United States. We tell these multinational corporations that we're not going to bar you from dealing with OPIC if you sell a candy bar to a private store in Tehran or you sell paper clips to a stationery store in Khartoum.  
   Rather, you must certify that your corporation and all its affiliates have abstained from two very important actions: first, that you have made no loan to the terrorist government; and, second, that you are not investing significant assets in the oil and energy sector of a terrorist State, particularly no more than $20 million. 
   This builds on what used to be called the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, now the Iran Sanctions Act, which draws the line and finds the pressure point for both Iran and Sudan, and probably Syria as well, in stating that our goal is to prevent investments of more than $20 million in the terrorist states' oil sector. 
   Also, OPIC would not be able to approve an application if the applicant company has an outstanding loan or extension of credit to one of the state sponsors of terrorist governments. Sales of goods other than food and medicine on anything other than a cash basis would constitute U.N. extension of credit for these purposes. 
   Now, section 10 of the bill would apply these prohibitions, as I've pointed out, to foreign subsidiaries of the applicant. In order to benefit from partnering with OPIC, the entire group of affiliated corporations would have to make the certification. 
   Section 10 of the bill would require the CEOs of any applicant and the CEO of the applicant's ultimate parent corporation to certify that none of the affiliated groups have engaged in the prohibited activities. 
   Section 10 is also narrowly targeted with regard to the geography of the Sudan in that it does not prohibit activities in those regions of Sudan not under the power of the Khartoum government. 
   For 35 years, OPIC has funded and ensured the type of infrastructure-building that no one else would do in some countries where no private corporation would otherwise go. OPIC has paved the way for roads and bridges, buildings and energy facilities in countries marked by conflict and war. 
   For these reasons, we should reauthorize OPIC. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Second, this bill is, I believe, the first to come before this House which defines what precisely it is that we want international corporations to stop doing, and that is, investing in the oil sector of terrorist states, and, second, making loans to terrorist states. That is why I think that this bill may be an important template for other legislation, and I hope it will become a guide for what we expect of companies in procurement legislation, Ex-Im Bank, et cetera.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first express my appreciation to our colleague from the great State of New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) for introducing this important and timely resolution. I know the gentlelady from New York would like to be here, and if I speak very slowly may yet get here before we conclude, but whether she is here in person, she is certainly here in spirit. 
   The little village of Lake Placid lived up to its name on two spectacular occasions in the last century. The 1932 Winter Olympics and the 1980 Winter Olympics were two of the most exciting events of our time, featuring the most beautiful backdrops in the history of the games. 
   The organizing committee of the 1932 Olympics faced an uphill battle, raising money for the games in the middle of the Great Depression. But symbolizing the American spirit of generosity, Dr. Godfrey Dewey donated land owned by his family to be used for the all-important bobsleigh run. In fact, the Winter Olympics that year became a real distraction from the Great Depression for all the residents of the State of New York, and, in fact, the entire world. 
   In those 1932 Games, Eddie Eagan became the only Olympic athlete ever to win a gold medal in both the Summer and Winter Games. A great, versatile athlete, Eagan had already earned gold as a lightweight boxer in the 1920 Summer Games. At Lake Placid in 1932, he was part of the four-man bobsleigh team that triumphed in first place. 
   This resolution takes the opportunity to congratulate and celebrate Lake Placid upon the 75th anniversary of the games it hosted in 1932. This town deserves full congressional credit for the efficiency and grace with which it represented the United States during the Games of 1932 and, again, in 1980. 
   But Lake Placid outdid itself in 1980, when it had new facilities and a renewed spirit to host thousands of people for those Winter Games. Those Games became famous for the unbelievable Miracle-on-Ice conquest, when the United States hockey team, a group of amateurs and college kids, captured the hearts of the Nation by upending the Soviet Union's intimidating hockey machine in a dramatic 4-3 semifinal victory. They went on to win the gold. 
   Lake Placid's involvement with the Olympics has grown larger than just those two games. Lake Placid maintains world-class Olympic facilities and  serves as one of the United States Olympic Committee's three national training centers. The small town in Upstate New York continues to host international sporting events, as well as some 2.2 million tourists every year. 
   I encourage Members to support the resolution recognizing Lake Placid's historic place in Olympic history and encouraging the USOC to select this idyllic town for future bids in the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games so long as they are not in competition with an applicant from the State of California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

For Mrs. Shriver, the founding of the Special Olympics was a capstone of her decades-long effort to improve the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. It is a testament to her dogged dedication that the Special Olympics thrives today. 
   Eunice's idea was simple: give people with intellectual disabilities the same opportunities other young people have to develop their physical fitness, to create friendships, and to enjoy the thrill of competition. 
   Today, the Special Olympics offers year-round training in 30 summer and winter sports for both children and adults with intellectual disabilities. The Special Olympics serves more than 2.25 million intellectually disabled people through 200 programs in 160 countries. 
   I want to salute my colleague Mr. Sali from Idaho for introducing this legislation. Mr. Sali rightfully takes pride that his State has landed the honor of hosting the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games. Being named host of the 2009 winter games is a tremendous achievement for the great State of Idaho. There could be no better backdrop than the stark beauty of the State of Idaho and the Sawtooth Mountains. 
   The Special Olympics has become an important global event. The 2009 games will include thousands of competitors from over 100 countries competing in seven different winter sports. It will be the largest multisport event in the history of the State of Idaho. Idaho will be a terrific host for an event that empowers these brave young men and women and builds their self-esteem. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (BAILOUT LEGISLATION: THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING TWO THINGS AND ONE OF THEM MUST BE FALSE -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the administration is saying two things, and one of them must be false. In public they say the sky is falling. If you don't pass this bill immediately, the entire economy will be destroyed. 
   In private they say we're going to veto this bill, Democrats, if you try to put anything in it that we find difficult. That is like a man who claims to be desperate in the desert for water, throwing water back at your face, and demanding Perrier. 
   They have threatened two vetoes. First, if the administration doesn't get all the power. They will accept review oversight, which means we can look at their transactions after they are done. But they reject the idea of an independent board that has control, and determines whether or not the contract can be entered into. 
   Second, they reject any serious limitation on executive compensation. They reject anything other than a few tweaks on those with golden parachutes who are leaving, which means they want total compensation, in the millions of dollars, for the bailout executives who are staying. 
   How can the administration tell us that the sky will fall if we don't pass a bill, and then block the passage of a good bill by saying they are going to veto anything that doesn't put all the unfettered power in the administration, and all the money in the pockets of the Wall Street executives? 
   They are not telling us the truth.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF LEO T. McCARTHY AND EXPRESSING PROFOUND SORROW ON HIS DEATH -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Eshoo for offering this important legislation that I am proud to have cosponsored, honoring the life and achievements of Leo McCarthy and expressing the sorrow of the House of Representatives on his death. 
   The resolution properly recounts and reflects Leo's many accomplishments, a lifetime dedicated to effective service on behalf of the people of California and of the United States. Yet Leo McCarthy's life was much more than the titles he earned and the awards he accumulated. He was a loving husband to Jacqueline, his wife of 51 years, and a father of four children and 11 grandchildren. When Leo McCarthy died on February 5, he also left a world of friends. 
   It is fitting that my colleagues have obtained the opportunity to speak of Leo's many outstanding personal accomplishments and his qualities, his loyalty, his friendliness, his wise counsel. Those of us who knew Leo knew these qualities well. 
   As Speaker of the California Assembly for 6 years, and then during his unprecedented three terms as Lieutenant Governor, Leo was responsible for path-breaking legislation such as the California Coastal Act and the Nursing Home Patients Protection Act. He led the way toward implementation of important initiatives to educate business on the value of employer-provided health care and programs to help welfare recipients move into the workplace. 
   Leo was a charitable man who encouraged public service through his contributions and his service at the University of San Francisco and as head of the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good. 
   I join in expressing the profound sorrow of this House and in offering my personal condolences to the McCarthy family on Leo's death. Our prayers are with all of you who mourn Leo McCarthy.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the facts are these: Homeowners have signed mortgages where they can't afford to make the payments, especially as they are adjusted upwards. We need to write-down the principal amount to something that these good homeowners can afford. But we are told ``don't bail out the lenders.'' 
   There are two ways to write-down the principal amount of a loan: an involuntary way through the bankruptcy court, and we had a bill before this House which authorized the bankruptcy court in very limited circumstances, very tailored, to write-down the balance of the loan. Don't bail out the lender, just tell the lender they have to take less. That bill is not going to pass. It is opposed by Republicans in the Senate. 
   The second way is a voluntary way. You make a fair offer to the lender that, if they will write-down the principal amount, then they will get a guarantee of that lesser amount from the government--so at least they will get paid something. Now we are told to vote against this bill because it bails out lenders. 
   Some are giving hypocrisy a bad name. 
   If you are going to help homeowners, you have to write-down the balance of the loan. And people come to this floor and they say well, we can't do it the voluntary way, and we can't do it the involuntary way; but just as soon as we find some other way, they will be happy to bail out homeowners. 
    The fact is they have voted against using the bankruptcy court to write- down the principal amount and not give the lenders anything. And now they are saying when we make a fair offer to the lenders to do the same thing, we are bailing out the lenders. 
   I have a lot of ``respect'' for anybody who can come to this floor and just say they don't want to help these homeowners at all. That's an honest position. But to say you are against the voluntary and involuntary, that's wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (U.S. FOREIGN POLICY -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the leadership for allocating 1 hour to me of floor time. 
   As a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and as Chair of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation, I will take the next hour to focus on our foreign policy and to see whether it is focused correctly on the threats that face us in the first quarter of the 21st century. Then, if time permits, I will discuss an issue--some would say a threat--that will face us in the second and third quarters of the 21st century. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that our foreign policy has been adrift since the end of the Cold War because we have  been unable and unwilling to prioritize. Our national case of ADD forces us to focus on whatever international objective flits across our consciousness. 
   We have an enormous national ego which causes us to believe that we can simultaneously and successfully pursue all our objectives, and that we can defeat evil everywhere we choose to notice it. As a Nation, we punish politicians and pundits who dare to deflate our enormous national ego. 
   Our bureaucracy opposes any effort to prioritize our objectives because that effort conflicts with the bureaucratic imperative to please every one of its bureaus. Imagine having to go to the Moldova desk in the State Department and say that Moldova's sovereignty over its Transdniestra region cannot be a major national priority. The State Department is pretty much on autopilot, with each of its bureaus focusing on the bureau's function, the bureau's priority, with no one setting overall national priorities. 
   As a Nation, we have sacrificed 4,000 of our finest, and untold treasure. We did so in Iraq because our leaders told us it was necessary in order to protect ourselves from weapons of mass destruction, weapons that did not exist. But just because we are able to sacrifice treasure and lives to protect ourselves from a nuclear program that did not exist does not mean that we can sacrifice our national ego and our bureaucratic imperatives to focus on real threats that do exist. 
   Now, in addition to these long-standing institutional and psychological barriers to prioritization, at present we face three practical barriers that also prevent us from focusing on the national threats that we should really focus on, that we should give our priority to. The first of these is our unhealthy fixation on Iraq. This fixation began with President Bush. It now afflicts us all. 
   Now, we are told that morally we must stay in Iraq because we ``broke it,'' but we are told this by the same people who rightfully point out that whatever shape Iraq is in today and whatever shape we leave it in is still superior to where it was under Saddam. Remember, Saddam killed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis through his policies. We're told we must stay in Iraq because we risk a humanitarian problem if we leave, while at the same time this Nation ignores actual humanitarian holocausts that are going on in places like Somalia, Chad and Congo. Those humanitarian holocausts don't count because CNN isn't there. And CNN isn't there because our troops aren't there. So our troops must stay in Iraq because CNN is in Iraq, and CNN is in Iraq because our troops are in Iraq. So we must stay there because we are there. This is no way to prioritize our foreign policy. 
   We are told that if we leave Iraq, terrorists could meet there and plot against us. Imagine how big a national ego we must have to think that we could possibly deprive our enemies of a conference room. The fact is that terrorists can and do plot against us in Somalia, in Yemen, in countless other places, but of course these don't count because CNN isn't there. Remember, however, that 9/11 was plotted in an apartment building in Hamburg, Germany, which makes you wonder why we are staying in Iraq to make sure that terrorists don't have a place to plot against us. So our fixation with Iraq prevents us from prioritizing our foreign policy, prioritizing the need to protect Americans from nuclear attack. But that is just one of the obstacles we face. 
   The second obstacle we face is an unhealthy fixation on our reflexive, unthinking and implacable anti-Russian attitude. Now, I don't mind being anti-Russian. I do mind being implacably, unthinkingly, and reflexively anti-Russian. Now, part of this stems from our great national hubris. Our foreign policy establishment doesn't like Mr. Putin or his so-called successor, and we don't think that we should have to accommodate anybody we don't like. The fact is that sometimes you do have to do business with people you don't like if you want to carry out a reasonable, prioritized foreign policy. Our politicians tell us that we are at war. Well, the last truly great wartime leader of the United States was President Roosevelt, and he did business with Putin's most venal predecessor. 
   Now, this reflexive, anti-Russian attitude grew up in large part because of the individuals who are making our foreign policy decisions today. These are people who spent their lives planning and studying and writing their theses on how to surround and defeat the Soviet Union. Old habits die hard, but yesterday's priorities should not dictate tomorrow's priorities. 
   Now, Putin has given us much to be angry about, but let us take a look at whether this new Cold War, at worst, or very cold peace, at best, started with Moscow or started in Washington. 
   Now, one issue that has faced us throughout foreign policy is the doctrinal battle between the doctrines of self-determination and territorial integrity. Self-determination, the right of a group of people within a country to split up, split off, and form their own country; territorial integrity, the right of a nation to continue to have and to possess and to control its territory. 
   In fact, the two great wars fought on American soil were on opposite sides of this doctrinal distinction. Our first great war on our own soil was our war for self-determination, our war for independence. The second great war was the war to protect our territorial integrity from those who sought southern independence. So we have been on both sides of this doctrinal divide. We face this same divide now, territorial integrity versus self-determination. 
   Let us examine eight places in the general neighborhood of Russia where this doctrinal conflict has come up. You see, we are for self-determination of Kosovo just as we were for the self-determination of the Slovenes and the Croats, which led to the split up of Yugoslavia, and we were for the self-determination of the various republics that made up the Soviet Union. Four times that we were for self-determination--Kosovo, Slovenia, Croatia, and the Soviet Union itself. 
   But we are against self-determination and instead for territorial integrity in at least four areas also close to Russia. We are against self-determination of the Transdniestra region of Moldova. We are against self-determination for the northern part of Kosovo that would like to self-determine itself out of Kosovo and rejoin Serbia. And we are against self-determination for two regions of the Republic of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Eight conflicts; four times we support self-determination, four times we support territorial integrity. 
   Some would say we are inconsistent. This is not the case. We are consistently anti-Russian; consistently, unthinkingly, and reflexively anti-Russian. In all eight of these conflicts, Russia had a strong interest. In most of these conflicts, we had virtually no interest. Who amongst our constituents talks to us about Abkhazia or South Ossetia? Yet every time, in all eight instances, we took a very strong and determined anti-Russian position. 
   We also have a conflict with Russia over the proposal to build a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and in Poland.     
   Russia believes that we are rushing to install these installations to create anti-Russian facts on the ground in Eastern Europe. Our position is that those missile defenses will protect Europe from a possible Iranian nuclear-tipped missile. But the Europeans don't particularly want our missile defense system. We have to bribe the Czechs and the Poles to let us put them there. The Germans and the French would just as soon we not build them. 
   Why are we taking this aggressively anti-Russian position? One would say that the goal is to protect Europe from Iranian nuclear weapons. But wait a minute. We have not even tried to bargain with Russia, to seek their help in preventing Iran from getting the nuclear weapons in the first place. Perhaps in return for not building a missile defense system, we could achieve greater cooperation from Moscow in stopping Iran's nuclear program. But we are unwilling to prioritize. We have as a priority creating anti-Russian facts on ground in the Czech Republic and Poland; and, accordingly, we cannot sacrifice the opportunity to build missile defense systems in those countries just to get Moscow's critical help in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
   I could give you a number of other examples. Let me just focus on one,  and that is the recent commercial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. In those disputes we have told these two groups of former Communists of these formerly Communist countries that it is wrong to sell goods, in this case, natural gas, for its fair market value. We have told former Communists that capitalism is wrong. Why? Because capitalism would allow Russia to get more for its natural gas, and our tendency to be reflexively anti-Russian exceeds our tendency to support capitalism. So we face a second practical block to prioritizing our foreign policy, and that is our instinctively anti-Russian attitude. 
   But we also face a third block to prioritization, which is our failure to recognize how important it is to get the support of world opinion, particularly opinion in Western Europe, in order to achieve what should be our number one national priority, which is protecting the American people from nuclear weapons. 
   Now, think back to 9/11. We had the sympathy of the whole world. People were ready to follow our leadership. People demonstrated in favor of America in places where they had not demonstrated in favor of America before or since. But then what did we do? We ignored Kyoto. We invaded Iraq. We disdained the International Court of Justice. We built Guantanamo. We angered our friends and our allies with unilateral approaches on the wrong set of issues. Today, who would say that the United States has the support or the sympathy of the world? We need to prioritize. The real threat is nuclear weapons in the wrong hands. 
   Now, I am going to avoid using the term ``weapons of mass destruction'' because that has been a phony and misleading term. It puts nuclear weapons in the same category as chemical or biological weapons. Only nuclear weapons could kill millions of Americans. 
   Now, I don't want this speech to be too depressing. We are vulnerable. We are institutionally and psychologically unable to focus on how to reduce our vulnerability. But we are still far safer than we have been at other times in our history. In the 1960s we faced a far greater threat. At that time we faced the risk of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons, 10 megatons or more each. Now we face less than one five-hundredth the arsenal of the Soviet Union in terms of number and less than one five-hundredth in terms of the strength of each nuclear device. So we are far safer now than we were when we, as baby boomers, as elementary school students, were ducking under our desks in air raid drills in order to learn how to protect ourselves from a massive Soviet nuclear attack. 
   Now, let us say that we could overcome our obstacles to a rational, prioritized foreign policy. What would be our response to the nuclear threat that we face? There are four possible responses to a nuclear threat: Prevention, deterrence, interception, and survival. I will deal briefly with the last three of these and then focus on the first, prevention. And by ``prevention'' I mean preventing the wrong people from getting the most powerful weapons. 
   Now, deterrence and interception are, I think, false hopes because they miss the mark on the delivery system that is most likely to be used by those who wish us harm. For 20 and 30 years, we have talked on this floor about Star Wars or national missile defense, how we're going to hit a bullet with a bullet in outer space. Maybe someday it will work. But missile defense can be rendered irrelevant. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to deliver a nuclear weapon to an American city. A nuclear weapon is a bit smaller than a person, in most cases. You could smuggle one inside a bale of marijuana. 
   Now, we have had a lot of talk on this floor about how to make our borders more secure and deal with the issue of illegal immigration. To date, our efforts have increased the fee charged by the so-called coyotes to smuggle an illegal immigrant into the United States up from $1,000 to $1,500. This may have a substantial impact on those people who aspire to work in the United States for minimum wage. But whether the cost of bringing in something the size of a person is $1,000 or $10,000 or $100,000 is not going to matter much to the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps. We are not going to have borders so secure that a truly sophisticated terrorist group or intelligence agency will not be able to bring a bomb across our borders. Keep in mind we have 300 million legal border crossings every year. We have zero patrol officers, zero on the entire border between Alaska and Canada. Between Canada and the lower 48, we have roughly one security official every 30 or 40 miles, and that person is only working 8 hours a day. So smuggling a nuclear weapon will not be difficult for any adversary sophisticated enough to get its hands on a nuclear weapon in the first place. 
   Not only is smuggling easier, it gives the perpetrator plausible deniability. If you send an intercontinental ballistic missile into the United States, we will know where it came from. On the other hand, if you smuggle one here, you can always deny that you did it or leave some plausible deniability, and deterrence will be undermined, and, as is obvious, interception is made irrelevant if weapons are smuggled into the United States. 
   Now, I know that the great dictators really want an intercontinental ballistic missile. It's the Viagra of tyrants. But as a practical matter, our enemies will determine that smuggling a nuclear weapon makes more sense for them. It provides them with plausible deniability to deter deterrence. It makes irrelevant all of our missile defenses. The other problem with deterrence is that Iran may not be deterrable, and I will get to that in just a few minutes. 
   So I have dealt with deterrence and interception. Let us turn to survival, civil defense. This is a subject you are not allowed to talk about on the House floor or anywhere else in polite society. The First Amendment protects many kinds of speech but not talking about civil defense because you have to turn to Americans and say your government may not be able to protect you from nuclear attack. We may be in a circumstance where we can reduce casualties from 200,000 down to 100,000. 
   Our problem is that the American electorate finds the death of even 100 Americans to be unthinkable. 
   Now, we could cut casualties in half or by more than half if we prepare civil defense. But if a nuclear weapon the size of the one tested by North Korea went off at the White House, about 2 miles away, the people in this room would survive, but none of us would know what to do or where to turn for information. Should we shelter in place? Should we flee, and if so, in what direction? We need a system to tell Americans what to do. And we have to take Americans into our confidence and tell them that this is a real threat, that we are working to reduce the threat, and that we are working to prepare for the threat. 
   Now, I know that survival is something that we dealt with in the 1960s when we did those bomb drills I was talking about. What might have been absurd when we did it is now laughed at when it would be useful because in the 1960s, had we been hit by our adversary, it might well have been a thousand 10-megaton weapons. No one could have received medical care. There would be no relief into the city from outside the city. The living would envy the dead. 
   In contrast, Iran might develop one or two 15-kiloton weapons, 1 to 2 percent the size of the weapons of the Soviet Union, less than 1 percent of the number. We would be able to bring in medical care from outside. We should talk about it. We should plan for it. But I know that no politician or pundit is allowed to do so; so I will stop and instead shift to a discussion of prevention, keeping nuclear weapons out of the worst hands. 
   Now, I know that we should prevent the worst regimes and organizations from obtaining nuclear weapons. How do we do that? Maximum carrots, maximum sticks, maximum focus. We need to prioritize. We need to maximize our options. And, finally, maximum linkage, by which I mean connecting our objective of deterring a nuclear Iran or a nuclear North Korea with objectives that are important to other countries, not only North Korea and Iran themselves but Russia and China. 
   Let's first look at North Korea. I think North Korea is less important than Iran because North Korea is not ambitious. It wishes only to survive and to oppress its people in its own territory. What we need in order to deal with North Korea is the carrot of offering a nonaggression pact, a treaty in  which we would agree not to invade North Korea. 
   That's what the North Koreans have asked for. If the North Koreans are going to get rid of their nuclear weapons, you would think at a minimum they would want a promise from the United States that we're never going to invade. Believe it or not, the American response has been no. Why? Because the neocons never want to give up their dream of invading North Korea. This has made progress at the six-party talks uncertain at best. We are unable to prioritize our need to eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program over the psychological need of neocons to dream of invading North Korea. Instead, we need maximum carrots for the North Korean regime if they will verifiably and permanently get rid of their entire nuclear program. 
   We also need maximum sticks. We don't have many sticks. China has the sticks. North Korea is utterly dependent on Chinese aid, and yet we have failed to use linkage. In all our discussions with China, we have told them that our attitudes toward trade and their currency manipulation will not be affected by their attitudes on nonproliferation. We are a nation that has lost 4,000 lives to protect us from Saddam's nuclear program that did not exist, but we are unwilling to link our policy on currency values to China's behavior with regard to weapons, not weapons of mass destruction, but the real important ones, the nuclear weapons. 
   Our State Department opposes linkage because they find it more convenient to just deal with one issue at a time in separate bureaus, in separate boxes. We need to link China's policies toward proliferation with our policies on issues important to China.     
   Now let's turn to Iran. Iran is more dangerous than North Korea because it is ambitious. It is already responsible for terrorist attacks as far away as Buenos Aires, which is as far as you can get from Tehran. It seeks to remake the Muslim world and then the entire world. An Iran with nuclear weapons is truly dangerous. 
   Let's go through all the different ways it imperils the United States. First, an Iran with nuclear weapons means that you can say goodbye to the nonproliferation regime which has restricted the number of nuclear states since 1945. The Gulf Cooperation Council or Saudi Arabia acting individually will certainly develop nuclear weapons if Iran does. Egypt will not be far behind. And once nuclear weapons become popular for medium-sized countries and countries that do not face existential threats to their existence, once nuclear weapons become something that every country the size of Egypt has, how do you say no to Nigeria or Brazil? 
   Not only would we lose the nonproliferation regime, but what affect would it have on Iran's policies? Imagine terrorism with impunity. Iran is already rated by our State Department as the number one state sponsor of terrorism. Imagine what happens if Iran has nuclear weapons. It puts us in a position where we cannot respond, even if we know that Iran is responsible for terrible terrorist acts. 
   Now not only do you provide impunity for Iran to engage in terrorism, but you put us for the first time since the end of the Cold War eyeball to eyeball with a hostile and aggressive nuclear power. You are going to end up with a Cuban missile crisis every week, or at least several a year. Whether it is IEDs smuggled from Iran into Iraq or whether it is Iranian gunboats challenging American ships in the Persian Gulf, Iran will provoke us and will test us. We will go eyeball to eyeball with a regime considerably less sane than the regime presided over by Khrushchev. 
   Now even if we survive dozens of confrontations with a hostile nuclear Iran, there may come a day, and we pray for this day, when the Iranian Government will see itself about to be overthrown. Do you think those mullahs are going to imitate the Soviet Communists, shrug their shoulders and walk off the world stage? Gorbachev wrote a book and went on a speaking tour. Do you think that is what is going to happen? No. If these extremists in Tehran feel that they are about to be overthrown, among their options will be to use their nuclear weapons against Israel in an effort to regain popularity on the streets of Tehran or to use their weapons on the United States figuring if they are going to go out, they might as well go out with a bang. 
   Now I know that there was that NIE, that National Intelligence Estimate, released late last year that was deliberately designed to be misread. It said that Iran had abandoned its nuclear weaponization program. But if you read that report carefully, and I am not talking about the classified version, which I wouldn't talk about here, but just the two-page unclassified version, if you read it carefully, if you read the footnote, you realize that the real bottom line in that report is that Iran is well on target to have a nuclear weapon by the middle of next decade. 
   You see, the key difficulty in producing a nuclear weapon is to get your hands on the fissile material. And the NIE says that Iran will likely have that fissile material by the middle of next decade. Now the easier part of building a nuclear weapon is to take that fissile material and do the engineering work to turn it into a weapon. This is called ``weaponization.'' The NIE, this big national intelligence report which got headlines around the world, says that for at least a while, Iran seems to have stopped its weaponization program. But what does that mean? The weaponization program could be completed in just a year, year and a half. There is no reason for Iran to build the cart if they are still breeding the horse. All they have to do is continue to create the fissile material and then restart their weaponization program even a year or two from now and they will be well on target to have a nuclear weapon by the middle of next decade. 
   So how do we know that they are developing the fissile material technology? Because this is the one thing the whole world agrees on. The centrifuges are turning at Natanz. Iran says so. And they brought in the IAEA to look at it, and the IAEA says so. And Bush says so. Iran's enemies and Iran's friends say so. And we have seen the pictures. Iran is creating the technology to enrich uranium and create that fissile material. 
   Of course, Iran says it is all about generating peaceful electricity. Wait a minute. Iran, as we know, creates an awful lot of petroleum. As a byproduct of pumping petroleum, you often get natural gas. Iran has no way to export that natural gas. That natural gas is a useless byproduct. Iran flares the natural gas. Iran flares enough natural gas to generate more electricity than you could generate at ten Bushehr-style reactors. Well, if you have free flared natural gas, that is by far the cheapest way to generate electricity. But Iran isn't interested so much in generating electricity. They are interested in pursuing their nuclear program to create the fissile material which is the most essential element of creating a nuclear weapon. So Iran is developing the fissile material needed for a bomb. 
   Now there are those who say that our response should be a military response. They point out that Saddam Hussein's real nuclear program was destroyed by Israel in 1981. Saddam put it all in one place, above ground, easy to see. Syria made a similar mistake. They put their whole program, or the essential elements of that program, all in one place, above ground. They tried to make it a little bit more difficult to see. And if news reports are to be credited, that program was destroyed late last year by an Israeli bombing effort. 
   The Iranians are not nearly so incompetent. Their program is dispersed. It is underground. And it is hidden from our intelligence assets. A military strike would not destroy their whole program. It would set them back a few years. It would also cause a number of problems. But even if you believe that a military strike is a good idea, we ought to first exhaust our nonlethal alternatives if for nothing else than out of a decent respect for the opinion of the world. 
   I will talk about those nonlethal alternatives in a second. But I want to respond to those who take the other approach and say, well, shouldn't we pass a law here in Congress to prohibit any bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities? That is, I think, a mistake. I call it Ambien for Ahmadinejad. It would help him sleep better. 
   There is no reason for us to tell the Iranians that we have taken any of our  options off the table. In fact, the more reasonable Iranian leaders will tell their colleagues that one of the reasons to give up the nuclear program is that in the end, it may be destroyed by an American bombing raid before it bears fruit. So you strengthen the hand of the realists in Tehran if you leave all options on the table. 
   But now let's focus on those nonlethal options. We have got to get a message through to the Iranian elites and the Iranian people. And that message is very simple. You face total economic and diplomatic isolation unless you verifiably and permanently give up your nuclear 
   weapons program. Well, we have the broadcasting resources to get this message through. Radio Farda is broadcasting into Iran right now. Why can't we get this message through? Because I can't lie that well in Farsi. The real facts are that Iran faces nothing close to economic or diplomatic isolation if it continues its nuclear program. They face only the tiniest sanctions, and they can do business as usual with the entire world. 
   So what do we do to create the reality so that we can truthfully tell the Iranian people and Iranian elites that they must give up their nuclear program or they face economic and diplomatic isolation? Well, before I go forward, when we talk about the Iranian economy, we must recognize that special debt of gratitude we owe to Iran's mullahs whose mismanagement, corruption and oppression have made Tehran vulnerable to economic pressure even in a $130-a-barrel world. So what do we do? 
   What have we done? First on the economic side, and then on the diplomatic side. Now there was great fanfare on October 21 of last year when we announced big sanctions on Iran until you realized there was virtually nothing there. The first part of that sanction was to ban four Iranian banks. We had banned some of them earlier, bringing to a total of four the number of Iranian banks that were not allowed to execute transactions with the New York branch of the United States Federal Reserve. That means large dollar transactions, including oil sales, will either have to be executed through other Iranian banks or through non-Iranian banks or priced in euros rather than dollars. The most this could possibly do is to cut maybe one-tenth of 1 percent of Iran's oil revenue at very worst. And that is if many of the European banks really hit them with huge fees. 
   The fact is that there are plenty of banking channels. Iran can easily shift, and has shifted, to selling its oil for dollars. Instead it sells for Euros. And there are many ways that they can do dollar transactions if they want to. We have not taken the step of even banning all Iranian banks from doing business with the Federal Reserve Board because we have been unwilling to inconvenience international corporations even in that slight way. 
   We also announced rather recently that we would put the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on the terrorist list. And for a few hours, people said what does that mean? Does that mean that if Mercedes chooses to sell trucks to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps that the United States might shut down Mercedes operations in the United States? Two hours later, the Treasury issued a press release saying they had no intention of pursuing secondary sanctions. What that means is that every European company is free to do business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps any way they want without facing any consequences in the United States. 
   So what should we be doing? The good news and the bad news is that we have a lot of tools in our economic toolbox. The good news is we have got tools in the toolbox. The bad news is we have known of this threat for a decade, and we have left our tools in the toolbox, except for, you know, a little screwdriver we have used to have the slightest possible effect.     
   The first thing we should do is follow the law. We should enforce the Iran Sanctions Act. Now, the Iran Sanctions Act was formerly known as the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. 
   We used the sanctions against Libya, we forced Qaddafi to change his behavior, he gave up his nuclear program, we dropped Libya from the act, we renamed the act, and we resumed our policy of never applying it against Iran. 
   Since 1998, despite overwhelming evidence, we haven't taken the first step we are supposed to take under the Iran Sanctions Act, but what are we supposed to do? The purpose of the act is to deter companies from investing $20 million or more in the Iran oil sector. 
   The first step in that is for us to take note of which companies have invested $20 million in the Iran oil sector, and that triggers the act. At that point, the President is supposed to impose sanctions on that firm or at least name them and shame them and then waive the sanctions. Minimum compliance with the law requires the President to at least name the companies that we know are investing $20 million or more in the Iran oil sector. 
   What has actually happened? The State Department, the Administration, refuses to open its copy of the Wall Street Journal on any day in which there is an announcement of an additional significant investment in the Iran oil sector. 
   I had to turn to CRS, the Congressional Research Service, to give me a chart of all of the large investments being made in the Iran oil sector. We have got not just one chart, we have got another chart. But if you ask the State Department to name even one company that is investing, they will say we refuse to speak. Why? Because they don't even want to acknowledge that the investment is being made. That would trigger the act. 
   This is like hiring a police officer who disagrees with the law, a narcotics officer who just walks around and everybody is using whatever drugs, and this officer does nothing--what good is to pass the law if the Executive Branch refuses to apply it? 
   Now, we have a bill that has passed this House, it's stymied by Republicans in the Senate, it is opposed by the Administration, it's called the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act. What does this legislation do? The legislation strengthens the Iran Sanctions Act, it imposes a total embargo on imports to the United States of Iran's goods. 
   Believe it or not, we import from Iran. We don't import oil, we only import the stuff they don't need and they would have trouble selling anywhere else, caviar and carpets, et cetera. 
   The bill we would pass through this House would at least turn to Iran and say well you can't sell those goods here in the United States, which would have a significant impact on some of the most powerful families and clans in Iran, particularly those that play a decisive role in their government. 
   The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act would also end the obscene practice of U.S. oil companies doing business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries. So far that bill remains bottled up, in large part because the Administration opposes it. The same Administration that refuses to enforce the existing law. 
   What about the World Bank? The World Bank has lent some $1.36 billion to Iran since Iran began its nuclear weapons program. Some $700 million of that hasn't been disbursed yet, but the United States has done nothing to prevent those loans from being authorized or the funds disbursed, except one thing. 
   The Administration cast a token vote at the World Bank knowing they would be outvoted, and they only did that because it was required by law. At least they followed the law. They are willing to follow the law when it's utterly inconsequential. 
   To date, the Secretary of the Treasury has refused to even call any of his counterparts in European capitals to urge them to withdraw their support for these World Bank loans. 
   Now, why are these World Bank loans so important? Because we know what it takes to stay in power. One of the things it takes is delivering projects to people, bringing home the bacon, if you will. Now, I know it's not kosher, it's not Halal, but it is what Iranian politicians around the world do. Imagine what it is for them to cut the ribbon on a water project and say we have given this to you. That's enough to help them stay in power just a little bit. But imagine how much more meaningful it is when they say the whole world, the World Bank, has sent us this money. This is proof that the United States can do nothing to hurt us. This  is proof that the whole world is on our side about developing nuclear weapons. 
   The World Bank loans to Iran are harmful not just from an economic perspective, they are harmful to us from a political perspective as well. We should change our laws dealing with Federal procurement, State procurement and Federal corporate assistance to achieve one thing. We should turn to any corporation seeking a big contract with the Federal Government or seeking the assistance of any of our programs designed to help business, whether it be the Export-Import Bank or a whole host of other programs. 
   We should ask the other question, does your corporation or any of its affiliates invest in the Iran oil sector, loan money to the Iranian government, sell munitions to the Iranian government? Imagine the effect this will have if we make it clear that if you are a Nebraska corporation owned by an Italian corporation, and the Italian corporation is investing in the oil sector of Iran, that means we are not going to give you the contract, we will give it to somebody else. 
   A number of States have tried to do this, and they have been threatened by the Federal Government. We have passed through this House, and it has made it through the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, a bill dealing with OPIC, the most unfortunately titled Federal agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and said that if you want the assistance of this agency, you have to certify that neither your corporation nor any of its affiliates are engaging in those wrongful transactions with the Iranian government. Clearly, we should not be giving assistance to those who are aiding Iran's nuclear program or aiding the Iranian government in one of the key pressure point areas, munitions, investment in the oil sector, loans to the government. 
   Now we have the issue of divestiture. We need to encourage private investors and government pension plans and private pension plans to sell their stock in corporations that are engaging in those transactions with the Iranian government, investments in the oil sector, loans to the government, sale of munitions. 
   A number of States, especially the State of Florida, my own State of California, have decided to divest from such companies. But when they do so, they face frivolous lawsuits, lawsuits from people saying, ``oh, you have to invest for the maximum possible return, and you can't think of national interest when you do so.'' 
   Now, get this, because my colleagues have seen how the Administration has been opposed to frivolous lawsuits and any lawsuit they claim is frivolous, they have been against lawsuits on everything except one thing, they are in favor of frivolous lawsuits against State governments who choose to divest, against private pension plans that choose to divest. Why? Because their hatred of trial lawyers is exceeded by their hatred of investors who would try to influence the very companies in which they have made an investment. 
   It is absolutely shameful for us to make it more difficult for good Americans to push the companies that they partially own into doing the right thing. We should go further. 
   Later this month, I will introduce legislation to change our tax code so that those who are divesting from companies doing business in those bad areas, as I have identified, or those areas we would like to discourage with regard to Iran, we will say, if you sell your stock in such a company, and reinvest the proceeds in a company that is clean, then you should get a carryover basis. We are not going to use that as a taxable event, because divestiture should be encouraged, not taxed. We need to turn to all the corporations in the world and say do not invest in the Iran oil sector, do not lend money to that government, do not sell the munitions, otherwise, we will encourage our companies, we will encourage our investors, we will encourage our pension plans, we will encourage our individual investors to stop investing in your company. We will not give aid to any of your subsidiaries, and we will not make them eligible for Federal contracts. This will provide real pressure on the Iranian government. 
   But that's just the economic toolbox. We also have the diplomatic toolbox as well. It is even more powerful, it is even less used. We have never offered Russia anything in return for real cooperation on the issue of Iran's nuclear program. We have not provided linkage between issues Russia cares about and what we care about, which ought to be preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
   We have made it clear to Russia that what we do with regard to Chechnya, Abkhazia, Moldova, Estonia or anything else is not linked to what Russia does with regard to Iran. 
   Likewise, we have made it clear to China that what we do with regard to Taiwan or currency manipulation or trade will have nothing to do with what China does in the U.N. or elsewhere with regard to Iran's nuclear program. 
   If we could get Russia and China to support us at the U.N., then instead of stupid little sanctions designed to fool people around the world, we could get real U.N. sanctions. What would that mean? Imagine a U.N. ban on sending refined oil products into Iran. Now, Iran has plenty of petroleum, but they don't have the refinery capacity. They import nearly half of the gasoline they burn. 
   If the United Nations would prohibit every country in the world from sending them that refined petroleum, you would have an immediate impact on the streets of Tehran. You would be able then to turn to the Iranian people, to turn to the Iranian elites and say that you, indeed, face economic and diplomatic isolation unless you abandon your nuclear weapons program. 
   We need to prioritize. We need to link what is important to us to what is important to others. We need to use all the tools in our toolbox, and we need to use them immediately. Otherwise, we will not achieve the level of security from nuclear attack that the American people deserve. 
   I am not saying that we can make America invulnerable, but I am saying that it is our duty here in the Federal Government and as foreign policymakers to do everything we can to achieve that objective. 
   I have concluded. I did mention that I would perhaps talk about threats that face us in the second and third quarters of the 21st century. I will leave that to another speech. I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (WALL STREET BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Let me join the bipartisan chorus of skeptical voices about this $700 billion bailout. 
   We live in an era of great concentration of power in the Executive Branch and great concentration of wealth on Wall Street. Today, we are asked to approve the greatest power grab any executive has ever asked for and the greatest transfer of wealth Wall Street could imagine. $700 billion is supposed to be given to the administration, and they will give it to Wall Street. 
   They are going to buy the worst of the worst assets in the back of any investment bank's closet. They can decide what to pay. They can buy from this one and not that one. They can have as much politics and as much cronyism as they are able to conceal, and there will be no oversight So, they can conceal a lot. No standards, no accountability. They can pay any price to any person for any toxic asset, and they can refuse to pay any price to any person for any toxic asset. 
   This $700 billion is on top of the Fannie and Freddie Mac bailouts, which were not bailouts so much of those entities. Those entities are really now part of the government. They were bailouts of the Wall Street investors in the bonds that had been guaranteed by Freddie and Fannie. 
   So we have already transferred hundreds of billions of dollars to Wall Street; we are now told to do $700 billion. And be sure, if we do the $700 billion now, they will be back for a few hundred billion in a while and a few hundred billion beyond that. 
   The truth is we don't know. The truth is they don't know. If we pass this bill, Wall Street could be sagging in a few weeks anyway. If we don't pass this bill, Wall Street could rebound by the end of the year. No one can make your 401(K) safe. No one can tell you whether your 401(K) will be safe regardless of whether we pass this bill or not. The only thing that is certain is that if we pass this bill, Wall Street executives will be happy. 
   This bill allows whatever money we give to a Wall Street firm, they can invest it overseas the next day. And if a  foreign entity has invested in these bonds, these toxic assets, they don't get bailed out by their own government; they can sell those bonds to a U.S. entity on Monday, and the taxpayer can be stuck with these toxic assets by Tuesday. 
   We are told we are going to get regulatory and corporate governance reform next year; but this bill does not include a fast track provision to assure that serious proposals are considered, particularly when they are subject to filibuster in the Senate. Why no fast track for every kind of regulatory and corporate governance reform? 
   The administration was gagged kicking and screaming into providing $3 billion of help to home owners who face troubled loans. They want over $1 trillion for Wall Street. That shows you the ratio of their compassion. 
   There is nothing in this proposal from the administration to limit executive compensation. So when we pay $1 billion to a Wall Street firm, the next day they can use that money to hand out huge and enormous bonuses to their executives. I would propose that we have a 50 percent surtax on the executive compensation paid to the executive of any bailed out entity, starting with Bear Stearns and Fannie and Freddie and AIG, and continuing through those who benefit from this bill. 
   We clearly need a stimulus, at least a well-crafted stimulus program. 
   And, finally, why should the Department of the Treasury have total carte blanche? We should require that every major contract entered into under this bill and every purchase of toxic assets be approved in advance by the GAO; otherwise, this is just a license to the Treasury to hand out money in return for trash, cash for trash, and they get to decide how to do it. 
   If you are skeptical about this bill, please meet with me and others at 2:30 today in Room 2220, that is 2220 at 2:30, and let's discuss how we can make a bill that reflects American values and not Wall Street values.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (A SKEPTICAL VIEW OF THE WALL STREET BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the Chair. I have got 30 minutes, and I will share some with the gentlewoman from Ohio in just a second to describe the flaws with this bill. Believe it or not, 30 minutes is not long enough. But first I want to mention about the calls that are coming into our office. 
   The calls used to be from people around the country. Now Wall Street firms have their employees unplugging those headsets to call investors and instead calling Members of Congress. So now the calls coming in to at least my office have shifted from 20-1 against this bailout package for Wall Street, down to about 3-1 or 4-1 against this bailout. 
   I ask my colleagues not to be confused. Edit out some of those calls that are coming to you from folks who are being paid to make the call, and you will realize the country remains absolutely overwhelmingly opposed to this Wall Street bailout bill. 
   I thank again the gentleman from Ohio, and I will make a few more points. 
   We had a meeting of the Skeptics Caucus, which is now a bipartisan Skeptics Caucus, where we heard from Bill Isaac. Mr. Isaac was Chair of the FDIC, having first been appointed to that board by President Carter and then appointed by Reagan. You don't find very many people who have support on both sides of the aisle like that. 
   Bill Isaac led the FDIC in solving the 1981 crisis, which was probably worse than the crisis that we have now. He used the emergency powers of the FDIC. He was able to solve that credit crisis without significant cost to the taxpayer. 
   We ought to hear from Bill Isaac. And I look forward to us defeating this bill tomorrow so we can have hearings and all my colleagues, not just those who came to the Skeptics Caucus, can hear from Mr. Isaac and so many others, because the starting point is this testimony that we didn't hear before any hearing, because there have been no hearings on this bill, but rather a letter sent to Members of Congress by hundreds of eminent economists, including three Nobel Laureates. And they said, we ask Congress not to rush, to hold appropriate hearings, and to carefully consider the right course of action. 
   So, Nobel Laureates, economists eminent in their field, say the sky will not fall if we take some time. The only way to pass this bill is to keep up the panic. The panic has to be calmed down. We have got a few days. We have got a week. We have got 10 days, and that is more than enough time to write a much better bill. 
   But let me summarize some of the other things that Bill Isaac told our Skeptics Caucus. A vote ``no'' on tomorrow's bill is not a vote to do nothing. It is a vote to defeat that bill and to start writing a much better bill. 
   Under the bill that comes before us tomorrow, in Mr. Isaac's belief, half of all the money is going to be used to bail out foreign investors who made dumb business decisions. Now, I am not real sure that I want to use taxpayers' money to bail out American investors who made bad business decisions. But why are we bailing out the Bank of China? Why are we bailing out the Saudi royal family? We are doing so because they demand it. They communicate those demands at the highest level to our administration. 
   After I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, I will describe how the bill clearly provides that we can send as much money as Treasury wants not to bail out American investors, but to bail out foreign investors. And when I say foreign investors, I don't just mean companies here in the United States that happen to have foreign owners. 
   I have sought at the Rules Committee to simply put an amendment in this bill to say that we are not going to buy any toxic asset that wasn't demonstrably owned by an American on September 20. That amendment will not be allowed. It was not allowed last time; it won't be allowed this time. 
   Why? Because they think they can hide from this Congress and from the  American people the fact that hundreds of billions of dollars are going to overseas investors. And there are transparency provisions in the bill on a lot of things, but the one thing that will never be revealed, when Goldman Sachs sells a bond on December 1 to Treasury, what will not be revealed is whether Goldman Sachs bought it from the Bank of China two or three days earlier with intention to sell to Treasury. We are going to be buying bonds that are currently in vaults in Beijing and London. 
   What Mr. Isaac also pointed out is that this bill is not going to solve the problem. People think that if you act in a panic and you throw $700 billion at something, you are going to solve it. Hardly. In his estimation, the credit markets will not be appreciably working any better than they are today. They may loosen things up for a week or two, but you are looking at a December that is no better than it would be if we did not pass this bill. 
   The FDIC could solve this problem under their existing powers. If they are a little shy to use those powers to the hilt, we can and should pass a bill that outlines that, yes, indeed, we do want them to use their powers. What should they do? They should provide for a temporary time a total guarantee on all of the general credit debt of banks, so the regulated commercial banks would be places where people know their money is safe. 
   They are subject to regulation, and the main part of this crisis is that the banks are unwilling to lend to each other as they traditionally do because no one bank is sure that the other bank is safe. We have got to say the commercial banks of America are safe and tell investors around the world that is where they can put their money with total safety. 
   Now, this leaves out some Wall Street entities that are desperate for that $700 billion. They can just taste it. But it allows us to solve this problem without appreciable cost to U.S. taxpayers. And the FDIC collects an insurance premium from the banks so it would be the financial system, not the American taxpayer, paying the cost of taking care of this risk. 
   Now, I would hope that every Member of Congress has received my blue paper. I have sent it out today via e-mail, I have handed it out on the floor, but I know there are a few that haven't received it. Please contact my office and read these seven pages. Learn how this bill will send half the money to foreign investors. Learn how this bill bails out firms that will continue to pay $1 million a month salaries, and could raise those executives to $1.5 million a month, should they choose to do so. 
   Please, read the paper. Read about the key provisions of the bill. Then you will be armed with the information necessary to deal with the fearmongers that tell you, well, you had to pass that bill. You had to dump $700 billion from a helicopter onto Wall Street, because somehow that was going to take a terrible economy and turn it into a great economy. 
   Such an action will indeed, will indeed, make things better for a few Wall Street executives, and they are very determined, and their employees on company time are calling our office. 
   With that, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (A SKEPTICAL VIEW OF THE WALL STREET BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Thank you. I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. 
   The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and by sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us were told in private conversations, if we voted against this bill, that, on Monday, the sky would fall and that the market would drop 2,000 or 3,000 points the first day and another 2,000 the second day. A few Members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted ``no.'' That's what I call fear mongering--unjustified, proven wrong. 
   We've got a week; we've got 2 weeks to write a good bill. The only way to pass a bad bill: Keep the panic pressure on. 
   Now, what has the Senate done to this bill? First, they've added pork to it in the hope that that would buy off some votes. Second, they've created a double hostage situation. Now, we already know that the first bill was a hostage situation. When Paulson announced this crisis, he basically sent a ransom note, and that ransom note read, ``We've got your 401(k), and you'll never see it alive again unless you send us $700 billion in unmarked bills.'' So we had one hostage situation. 
   There's the AMT patch, a necessary tax provision that Congress passes every year. Without this patch, the AMT tax, which is designed to fall only on the wealthy, will hit another 20 million American households. Everyone knows we have to pass this. We sent it to the Senate for them to pass. Instead of passing it, they created a hostage situation. They refused to pass it. They put it on this bill. So now we're being told, if you don't send $700 billion to Wall Street, we're going 
   to tax 20 million American families in a way no one in Congress wants to do. That's totally phony. If we vote down this bill, the Senate will pass the AMT patch bill that we sent them just like they do every year. 
   There has been some attempt to tell the American people that this bill isn't going to cost anything permanently because, in 2013, we're going to get the money back from the financial services industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. All the bill says is that the President has to send us a proposal to tax the financial services industry. Now, keep in mind, if the President has any good ideas in 2013, he'll send them to us or she'll send them to us. If the President is only sending us revenue ideas because they have to send them and they don't want to send that proposal, well then, they're going to send it with a note, saying, ``I'm required to give you this proposal, but I think it's a bad idea.'' What do you think we're going to do with a Presidential proposal that is disparaged by the President? 
   Furthermore, it would be absolutely impossible and contrary to the intent of the bill, contrary to the logic of the bill and contrary to the statutory provisions of the bill to construct a tax that hit only those companies that got bailed out. Instead, the tax is going to hit the entire financial services industry, and a proposal like that is highly unlikely to pass the House. If it passed the House and if it got over to the Senate, 41 Senators could block it, and Wall Street could have enough money to hire 4,100 lobbyists. 
   Now, why is it that we can't tax the individual companies that are bailed out on some sort of proportional basis? 
   Well, first, many of those firms aren't going to exist in 2013. Second, we're not even keeping track of how much money we lost on the assets we're buying from Goldman Sachs versus how much money we're losing on the assets we're buying from Citibank. We'll know how much we bought from each of them, but we might buy really toxic assets from one and only mildly troublesome assets from the other. We'll mix them together. Then we'll sell them off and we'll suffer a loss, and we won't know how to attribute that loss. How much are we going to tax Goldman Sachs? How much are we going to tax Citibank? We'll never know how to tax those we'll have bailed out. 
   Some of these companies we're bailing out are just going to be shell companies, so you know they're going to disappear before 2013, and you know that a tax bill is going to hit similarly sized banks with the same rate of tax: the banks that got a big bailout, the banks that got a small bailout, the banks that didn't get a bailout, the banks that sold us kind of bad assets, the banks that sold us assets that turned out to be worthless. 
   Such a controversial tax bill submitted under duress by a President is not going to pass this House, let alone pass the Senate, which can stop it with 41 votes. Wall Street gets their money now, and we get it back: never. 
   Now, as I said, hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be used to bail out foreign investors. That is why my amendment, which easily fixes that problem, has been rejected, because the White House demands that we bail out these foreign investors. That's what they want to do. That's what they promised the Saudi royal family. That's what they promised the Bank of China. Those promises will be honored with the tax money squeezed out of the American people. 
   They talk about executive compensation being controlled in this bill. They do put some controls on some bonuses being given to some departing executives--great--but they allow $1-million-a-month salaries. If some executive says, ``well, you know, you wanted to pay me a good bonus on top of my $1-million-a-month salary and now the bonus formula is being changed a little bit,'' the company can say, ``You know,  you're right. We wanted to give you more money. We'll raise your $1-million-a-month salary to $2 million a month.'' 
   Now, if that qualifies as limits on the executive compensation of companies that need and get a bailout under this bill, please explain to me how that is. Look, Bill Gates is running a great company. He doesn't need a bailout. I hope he gets paid a whole lot. But if your company has been run into the ground, if you need a bailout, if you're part of the reason for this panic situation, why do you need to pay over $1 million a year to any executive? That ought to be the limit. Frankly, it strikes me as a generous limit. 
   We're told that there's going to be oversight under this bill. There is a good, Democratic-dominated board that is created. It is a critique board, not a control board. It is a board that will issue press releases and reports, but it will not halt and it will not reverse and it will not delay any decision that will be made by the Secretary of the Treasury, which brings up another thing: 
   Why are we having Paulson run this thing? I thought he already had a job. The Secretary of the Treasury ought to be a full-time job if we're in a period of an unparalleled, sky-is-falling economic crisis. Furthermore, he is temporary. He is leaving Washington in January. Why doesn't this bill provide for an administrator selected in a bipartisan way and with bipartisan support who is willing to stick around for 2 or 3 years? Because this is a Paulson-Bush power grab. Paulson doesn't want somebody else to do it. He wants to be up on Wall Street, handing out the money to the companies he likes and ignoring the phone calls from the firms he doesn't like. 
   I want to point out that, if another Member comes to the floor in the next couple of minutes, he can claim the next hour. Otherwise, for better or for worse, this speech and all of the pontificating on this floor will be over soon. So I hope Members will come to the floor. We've got a lot to discuss. 
   The board is just a critique board. Paulson's power is undiminished, and we're having a part-time, temporary employee run this because that's what Paulson really wants. Homeowners are not going to get any relief under this bill. All $700 billion can easily be spent. 
   I see the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Sutton), and I hope that she claims the next hour of time. I thank her for coming here and for being here so quickly. I will use the remaining 3 minutes of my time, and I will look forward to being part of her Special Order, right up until the Vice Presidential debate starts.     
   We are told in 2009 we are going to pass really good legislation to make sure that this never happens again--corporate governance reform, regulatory reform, we are going to get it done. What is really going to happen? We may write a really good bill in the House, something Wall Street really hates. Then it goes over to the Senate where 41 Senators out of 100 is all it takes to block it. I don't think they will defeat reform legislation in the Senate. They will delay it and then they will dilute it. And by the time it passes, it will be so diluted, Wall Street will drink it down with a smile on its face knowing that no effective reform is really being imposed upon them. 
   So we are not going to see meaningful regulatory reform; although we will pass something and Wall Street will tell you it is a big deal. We will see million-dollar-a-month salaries, or one-and-a-half million or $2 million a month salaries paid to the executives of these firms while they are getting a bailout with our taxpayer money. 
   We are going to see a very large percentage of this money going to buy securities, bad paper, and toxic assets currently in safes in Shanghai, Beijing, London and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
   We will see all of the power in the hands of the Bush administration and in the hands of a part-time temporary administrator, namely the Secretary of the Treasury. 
   Under this bill, if it passes, we don't really know what is going to happen to the economy. No one knows. The only thing that is certain, two things: Wall Street executives are going to get huge amounts of money and our children and grandchildren are going to get stuck with hundreds of billions of dollars of additional Federal debt. And we as a country, having just done a bad $700 billion program, will not be able to do anything to help homeowners because we won't have the money. We won't be able to bail out local governments because we won't have the money. We won't be able to deal effectively with the real banking-lending crisis because we will have shot our entire wad on a bill that is guaranteed only to do one thing, and that is to help the truly wealthy on Wall Street. 
   My time has expired, and I look forward to the Speaker giving unanimous consent to the gentlelady from Ohio controlling the next hour.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are engaged in a long war on radical Islam, a war the President has analogized to the Cold War. Two roads in that war lead to disaster. The first disastrous road would be to abandon the battle, appease, disarm, blame America, and speak to Syria and Iran about what concessions we are going to give them. 
   The second disastrous course is to stay the course in our utter fixation on Iraq as the only battlefield in the global war on radical Islam. Those who propose that we stay the course, an erroneous course, I might add, give four different reasons: 
   First, they say that if we do not stay in Iraq and prevail, then terrorists will have a place to gather and plot against us. Mr. Speaker, terrorists can plot against us in the deserts of Somalia. Terrorists are plotting against us in the mountains of North Waziristan, in the mountains of Pakistan. Mr. Speaker, terrorists can plot against us in an apartment building in Hamburg. Even if we prevail in Iraq, terrorists will always be able to find a conference room. 
   The second reason we are given is that if we do not prevail in Iraq, the terrorists there will follow us home. Well, keep in mind on 9/11, the vast majority of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, a country with an apparently stable and obstensibly friendly government. So even if Iraq were stable and friendly, individual Iraqi terrorists might well come to the United States and carry out actions against us. Third, we are told that we have an obligation to the Iraqi people to stay there, to stay the course. We have liberated the Iraqis from Saddam Hussein, a man who killed millions in his war against Iran and against the Kurds. Now we have given the Iraqi people an opportunity to come together. We have bled sufficiently for Iraq. 
   Finally, we are told that we owe it to those Americans who died in battle to stay in Iraq until Iraq is a model democracy.     
   I would argue that instead we owe it to those who died to have an intelligent foreign policy that safeguards America. That starts with learning the lessons of the Cold War. Remember the 1960s and the 1970s, when we were told that if we didn't support every escalation in Vietnam, then the Communists would follow us home or, in the parlance of that day, there would be Communists on the beaches of southern California. 
   Well, we won the Cold War because we pulled out of Vietnam. The short-term outcome in Vietnam was not what we would have liked, but even if we had stayed in Vietnam another decade, it would have been no different. We won the global war on communism because we waged it globally, and we did not become fixated forever on Vietnam. 
   The time has arrived to pull back from daily battles on the streets of Baghdad. It is time for Iraq to no longer be viewed as the sole or exclusive battlefield in the war on terrorism. It is time instead for us to focus on the one part of the global war on terrorism that could lead to hundreds of thousands of American deaths, and that is Iran's nuclear program. We need to mobilize all of our diplomatic leverage to reshape our policies towards Russia, Europe and China, toward the single goal of putting together a coalition that will put the pressure on Iran necessary to force that country to abandon its nuclear program. We owe this to those who have died in Iraq, and we owe it to the American people. 
   Finally, we are told that this resolution is nonbinding, meaningless, that the President will ignore it, that the only way we have of affecting policy is to cut off funds, which is constitutionally problematic, since it involves tying in the hands of the Commander in Chief while we have troops in the field. But the very people who say this resolution is meaningless have it in their power to make it meaningful, have it in their power to avoid such constitutionally problematic approaches. 
   Because if the Republicans will vote for this resolution, they will make it  meaningful, they will make it decisive, the President will not ignore it, we will jolt the President into abandoning his stay the course, escalate the course approach. 
   Those who vote against this resolution may keep it from being meaningful. But if even a third of the Republican caucus votes for this resolution, then the President will no longer stay the course, he will be jolted, he will work with Congress cooperatively towards a foreign policy that makes sense for our country. 
   I look forward to having enough votes for this resolution so that it is, indeed, meaningful. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, we have already banned U.S. companies from conducting business operations in Sudan. Now we need to enlist American investors to change the behavior of foreign-based multinationals, to make it clear that they cannot have the capital of well-meaning Americans and the supposed benefit of cozying up to the government in Khartoum. 
   The way to do this, the way to change the behavior of the Government of Sudan, is to change the behavior of multinational corporations. The way to change the behavior of multinational corporations is to change American investment policies. 
   Scores of private organizations in this country, including the University of Southern California, have already  divested; some 19 States have already adopted divestment policies. This bill helps divestiture in two ways. First, it provides some critical guidance to those who want to divest. Those who want to divest are faced first with the issue of what standards to apply: Do I want to divest in any company that sells a candy bar in Khartoum, or do I only want to divest against those companies selling guns to the Government of Sudan? 
   This bill focuses on those companies providing the strategic assistance that helps the Khartoum Government and empowers that government. It identifies the key investment sectors of the Sudanese economy that government relies upon. It draws the line that establishes a clear standard. Others may depart from that standard and have an absolute rule: I don't want to invest in anything, any company doing business in Sudan. But this bill provides guidance to those who want one. 
   Second, the issue is which companies do I not want to invest in. Here the bill provides a list published by the Secretary of the Treasury of those companies violating the standards identified in the bill. 
   As the chairman of our committee points out, investors already have the right to divest. They shouldn't wait for us to pass this bill. The fiduciary duty to protect one's beneficiaries is enhanced if you divest from those businesses doing business in Sudan, because investing in terror is bad business and the sign of bad management; it exposes a corporation to reputational risk. 
   Likewise, our cities and States have the right to decide for themselves how to invest their money. But even if you buy the constitutional view, and I don't, that they can only divest when consistent with American foreign policy, you don't have to wait for this bill. Sudan is on the terrorism list. There is no clearer statement of American foreign policy that we want all Americans, and all cities, counties and States, to join with the Federal Government in carrying out the Federal policy to put economic pressure on the government in Khartoum. 
   So I hope people will act now. To some extent, what this bill does in stating that fiduciaries are free to divest is simply provide an end to an excuse. They don't need the excuse. They ought to divest

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at Natans, the centrifuges are turning. Iran is perhaps half a decade away from a nuclear weapon. Iran, however, is not without its Achilles heels. The mullahs have mismanaged the economy to the point where they are rationing gasoline in Tehran. Iran has a vibrant political culture in which the behavior of the elites and the behavior of the people can indeed be influenced by outside information. The key is to be able to broadcast into Iran on RadioFarda a message. That message is that Iran will be diplomatically and economically isolated around the world, and especially from the United States, unless it drops its nuclear weapons program. The problem is, I can't lie that well in Farsi. The fact is we have not yet begun to use the economic and diplomatic levers available to the United States. And it is not yet true that Iran's nuclear program subjects it to the possibility of economic and diplomatic isolation. 
   The bad news, Mr. Speaker, is that we have not had the political will to reach into our economic and diplomatic tool box. The good news is we've still got a lot of tools lying there in the tool box. One of the best is divestiture. Divestiture needs to be part of a bigger economic and diplomatic strategy to isolate the government in Tehran. If we can dry up, however, Iran's access to foreign investment, if we can sever the ties between the multinational corporations and the government of Iran, we may be able to increase the cost of Iran's behavior and put enough pressure on that regime so either it decides, or its people insist, that it abandon its nuclear program. 
   Now, the key is to change the behavior of these multinational corporations, and the best way to do that is with American policies that make them choose between the benefits of doing business with the American people, American investors on the one hand, and the so-called benefits they might get from doing business with Tehran on the other. 
   So what does this bill do to begin and continue the divestment process? The bill mandates nothing except for the creation of a list by the administration, which I will get to in just a second. It provides a clear authorization from Congress for States to divest from companies conducting the certain identified activities in Iran, and it would shield both private pension plan managers, mutual funds and public sector pension plan managers from harassing lawsuits should they decide on their  own initiative to divest from those companies carrying out certain activities in Iran. In doing so, this bill sweeps away an excuse from those investment managers who, up until now, haven't wanted to be bothered to divest, even though their beneficiaries are demanding it. 
   This bill also provides some standards. I mentioned this in the discussion of the Sudan bill. First, people want to know what activities should cause them to divest. Now, I have more than sympathy with those who say one penny of activity, sell one candy bar in Tehran and I don't want my money invested in your company. That's a purist approach. That's an approach some may choose to take. I think the better harnessing of America's economic power and the power of individual investors, individual decisionmakers, pension plans, mutual funds, et cetera, is to focus on three activities, and that is what this bill does. 
   It requires that 6 months after enactment, the U.S. Government, the administration, probably the Treasury Department but whichever department is identified by the President, produce a list of those international corporations that engage in any one of these three activities. The first is to invest $20 million in the energy sector of Iran. That is a standard we have adhered to for a long time since the adoption of what was then called the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, now the Iran Sanctions Act.     
   The second are those firms selling munitions to the government in Tehran. And the third are those who extend credit of $20 million or more to the Iranian Government. 
   And at this point, let me pause, because the question arises, what is it to extend credit to the Iranian Government when the Iranian Government issues a long-term bond? 
   Is it just the company that buys the bond or the financial institution that buys the bond, or is it directly from the Iranian Government, or is it those that provide a secondary market by buying those bonds from the original purchaser?

   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman and agree with him completely. This bill is designed to cause the list prepared by the administration to include those who invest in bonds issued by the Government of Iran. 
   I should point out that in identifying the three activities that are going to cause multinational corporations to be listed, that we are paralleling what we did just last week when this Congress passed the bill dealing with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which also focused on pretty much the same standards and said those multinational corporations engaged in those activities with the Government of Iran would not be able to be partners of OPIC in its activities around the world. 
   Now, the bill also provides that any State statute enacted prior to the publication of the first list of firms by the administration would be grandfathered. States do not have to wait and should not wait for the publication of this list by the administration. 
   States such as Florida, Ohio and California, which are proceeding with divestment measures, and any other States which might consider a divestment program need not wait for the Federal list, and whatever they choose to do will be grandfathered in this legislation. 
   Now, this bill states explicitly what I think was clearly true of both the Sudan bill we just discussed and this bill, and that is it provides a safe harbor but does not imply that that which lies outside the safe harbor is somehow forbidden. Section 7 of this bill would make it clear that the authorization that's been provided by this bill is just that, a safe harbor, that this bill in no way implicitly restricts or takes away whatever authorities the States, the pension managers and mutual funds already have

   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman and agree with him completely. 
   I believe that divestment is already clearly authorized in the terms of the fiduciary trying to meet their fiduciary obligation. Investing in terror is bad business for States. I don't think they have an obligation to, in making their own investment policy, to conform to some Federal foreign policy. But if they do, Federal foreign policy for a long time has been very clear: don't invest in Iran. That's why we've had the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, now the Iran Sanctions Act for quite some time. 
   So this bill will eliminate an excuse for those who do not want to, that have not yet, divested. It will provide a safe harbor, and it will provide guidance for those who want to use their investments to get multinational corporations to take the actions that will be most effective. 
   It provides a list of companies not to invest in, and it provides a standard to define what particularly it is we want the business community worldwide to desist from doing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, we talked earlier today about the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act. The purpose of that bill and the purpose of this bill is to change the behavior of multinational corporations so as to change the behavior of the Iranian Government. 
   This effort began perhaps with the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act over a decade ago. It worked so well vis-a-vis Libya, that we have renamed it the Iran Sanctions Act, as Libya has, indeed, changed its behavior. It is important that we clarify the law. The sponsor of the bill, the gentlelady from Florida indicated that this bill makes a number of important improvements to the Iran Sanctions Act. 
   The first is to indicate that it covers financial institutions, insurers, LLCs and other business entities; second, that when we talk about investments in the petroleum sector, that term includes refining petroleum and it includes development of liquefied natural gas. 
   Finally, I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida for including language in this bill that I had previously gotten into the Iran Freedom Support Act that was passed last year but which was dropped in conference. I want to thank her for putting it in this bill. That language deals with subsidiaries of U.S.-based multinationals. We currently have a ban on U.S. companies doing business with Iran, a ban on most transactions and investments. But some U.S.-based multinationals have used as a loophole through those regulations, through existing law, their foreign subsidiaries. What this bill would do is apply basic U.S. sanctions to all the entities controlled by multinational corporations based in the United States. 
   As to contracts existing on May 22, 2007, those contacts would have to be wound up at the earliest opportunity and could not be extended to cover additional activities. We then face the issue of what happens when a U.S.-based multinational buys a company that is incorporated abroad and that company already has preexisting contracts with or in Iran. 
   The activities of such subsidiaries would have to be wound up at their earlier possible opportunity, but furthermore, the U.S. buyer could not even buy that foreign company if the U.S. buyer knew that the company had contracts with the Government of Iran. 
   The message is clear: If you are building a company abroad and you think you might want to sell it to a U.S.-based multinational, do not have that company do business with Iran; otherwise, it will not be a company that can be easily acquired by a U.S.-based multinational. 
   This bill is an important part of an overall effort to put economic pressure on the Government of Iran and to let the Iranian elites and people know that they need to desist from their nuclear weapons program. 
   Also coming before this Congress, I hope soon, will be H.R. 1400, the Iran Counterproliferation Act, which also strengthens the Iran Sanctions Act and whose sponsor is sitting right here with us, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos. 
   We have to call upon the administration to actually enforce the Iran Sanctions Act. Since 1998, despite overwhelming evidence, no company has been identified by the United States  Department of State as having $20 million of investment in the Iranian oil sector which triggers the Iran Sanctions Act. It is time for the administration to stop ignoring existing law. It is time to strengthen existing law

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (TWO FIG LEAVES OF A BAD $700 BILLION BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. The New York Times reports that the administration has finally agreed to two of the tiniest fig leaves designed to help Members vote for this bad bill. The first is that the bill will include a provision to require some future President to propose a revenue bill to pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars we're going to lose. 
   Now, how meaningless is this? 
   If a President likes and wants to give us a revenue bill, he'll do it without a statutory directive. If he sends us a tax-raising bill with a note saying that he hates it but that he's submitting it only to comply with the statutory provision, certainly, such a proposal is dead on arrival. 
   If this is what it means to say you've paid for a bill, then will this same ``pay-for'' definition apply when we are discussing bills not giving money to Wall Street, but future bills that would provide for transportation, health care and tax cuts for the middle class? 
   The second fig leaf is the insurance provision. It simply authorizes the Treasury to set up such an insurance plan without directing that they actually use it. They [Treasury] hate it. They won't use it. If they did use it, it would send, perhaps, even more money to Wall Street. 
   This bill involves hundreds of billions of dollars that are going to bail out foreign investors, and million-dollar-a-month salaries will continue to go to Wall Street executives. 
   That's why 400 eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written to us to say, ``We ask Congress not to rush, to hold appropriate hearings and to carefully consider the right course of action.'' These are 400 professors of economics. Three Nobel Laureates say, ``Do not panic. Hold hearings. Let's write this bill well.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I must respectfully disagree with the characterization and description of this bill put forward by my good friend, Mr. Dreier, from California. 
   This bill does not really limit executive compensation. It does limit a few types of golden parachutes. But it doesn't have any limits on regular salaries. Million-dollar-a-month salaries will continue, and they can be raised to $1.5 million a month once the companies get those bailout dollars and feel they can afford to be that generous to their favorite executives. 
   Foreign banks are going to get hundreds of billions of dollars out of this bill. Now, the bill says that the Treasury only buys securities from U.S. entities. But how does this work then? Well, let's say the Bank of Shanghai is holding $30 billion of toxic assets, business mistakes they made in China. They simply have to sell those $30 billion of bad assets to their subsidiary in the United States. They all have small subsidiaries here. That subsidiary can  then, the next day, sell them to the U.S. Treasury. Or alternatively they can sell that $30 billion package of toxic assets to Goldman Sachs, and then Goldman Sachs can sell them to the Treasury the next day. 
   But keep in mind, if they choose to use their own subsidiary, they sell $30 billion of assets to the Treasury. By 2010, 2011 they can dissolve that subsidiary and leave this country. And how are you going to impose any recoupment tax on them? The concept that there is a guarantee that we're going to recoup our money is absolutely wrong. We would have to pass a $200 billion or $300 billion tax increase bill in 2013. And under section 134 of this bill, that tax is not just on those who are bailed out. It is on the entire financial services industry. How else could you construct a tax if you have one bank that got bailed out to the tune of $1 million and another bank that got bailed out to the tune of $1 billion? What tax rate would you apply to banks of that size? The only way to do it is to impose a tax on a whole segment of or the entire financial services industry. 
   That means you're going to have the unfairness of taxing community banks and credit unions to pay for the money we give to Wall Street. It also means the bill isn't going to pass at all. Imagine the unfairness argument that that creates. But also any bill to tax Wall Street needs to get through a Senate where 41 Senators can block the bill. And Wall Street will now have enough money, our money, to hire 4,100 lobbyists. All they need is a good argument. And that good argument is that there is no fair way to recoup the money from the individual companies that got it. Many of the companies getting this money in 2009 aren't going to be around in 2013. Many of them are going to be shell companies that are deliberately dissolved in 2013. 
   We do not have to panic. Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, tell us Congress should not rush. Let's not rush. Let's pass a good bill next week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation includes the text of H.R. 4246, the Defense Trade  Controls Improvement Act of 2008, which was introduced by myself and Mr. Manzullo, and it is Title I, subtitle A of this bill. 
   This subtitle grew out of hearings in our subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Terrorism Nonproliferation and Trade, which were held last July. I want to thank Chairman Berman for including the revised text of H.R. 4246 into this larger piece of legislation. I want to thank Mr. Manzullo for his efforts in crafting our original legislation, and I want to thank Mr. Ed Royce, ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism Nonproliferation and Trade, for his work as well. 
   The Defense Trade Controls Improvement Act, which is part of this larger legislation, seeks to address past performance failings and, most importantly, understaffing of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, the State Department agency responsible for adjudicating licenses for commercial arms sales. This agency was found to have more than 10,000 open cases at the end of 2006. Only an unsustainable winter offensive where leaves were canceled and overtime was made mandatory and people were moved in from other areas allowed this agency to reduce this huge backlog. Licenses had languished for months, not because they raised significant national security or foreign policy concerns in most cases, but because they simply sat in someone's in box unattended. 
   Why has the State Department consistently underfunded and understaffed the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls? I believe that there is simply an institutional bias in the State Department toward work that is more highbrow, more likely to be the subject of a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson's School of Diplomacy. But this work, the work of licensing munitions exports, is of critical importance; arguably there is nothing more important done by the State Department. And Congress provides typically over $1 billion to the relevant account which can be used by the State Department for a whole variety of staffing, yet they have consistently understaffed this very important function. 
   What the bill will do is basically add a couple of dozen licensing officers and avoid this tendency of the State Department to understaff the portion of the State Department which licenses munitions exports. 
   Why is this licensing process so important? Well, if we say ``yes'' and issue a license and make the wrong decision, the harm is obvious. We have sent the wrong technology to the wrong country which may hurt our military or the military of our allies in the future. But there is also enormous harm if we unduly delay or wrongfully deny an application. It means we lose jobs in the United States; it means our interoperability with our allies is diminished because they won't have American munitions and therefore, won't be able to operate as effectively with our military as they could; it can rupture or hurt our relationship with allies if we wrongfully do not export or unduly delay their request to purchase American munitions, and perhaps most importantly, when we don't act quickly and people in other countries buy their munitions elsewhere, we are building the munitions industry of other countries. 
   And what is the effect of that? More lost jobs for the United States, more losses on interoperability, and most of all, an undercutting of our policy objectives because once those munitions industries are well established in other countries, they will not be subject to any U.S.-State Department oversight and they may export to third countries things that we would not. 
   So right now the relevant State Department agency has roughly 40 licensing officers available to adjudicate 85,000 cases expected to be received this year. This bill will beef up the staffing by the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 so that there will be one licensing officer for every 1,250 applications that are based on what we anticipate to be the workload that year.     
   That is to say, we will go from roughly 40 licensing officers to roughly 68 licensing officers. This is hardly overstaffing. 
   The Department of Commerce performs a similar function with regard, not to munitions, but rather, dual-use exports. The relevant part of the Department of Commerce deals with one-third as many applications that has five times the staffing. Clearly, we need those 68 licensing officers at the State Department. 
   This bill also requires a complete strategic review of our arms export control system, a policy review that has not occurred since 9/11. 
   The bill codifies the administration directives with respect to processing times for licenses with respect to export of hardware to our allies. Our exporters will have reasonable assurance that licenses will be adjudicated, not necessarily approved, but adjudicated within 60 days unless there are extenuating circumstances.

   I hope this bill will further improve our licensing process. It is not for us to tell the State Department that they need to have one licensing officer for every 1,250 applications is not being overly assertive. When we provide over $1 billion to the relevant account, we ought to provide some guidance as to how that money should be spent.

   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to focus on an issue that I have been discussing with my colleagues for almost a decade and that I have brought to this floor several times since the year 2000. That is an issue I call ``engineered intelligence.'' By that, I mean the efforts of computer engineers to develop computers with intelligence that far exceeds that of the normal human being and, likewise, the efforts of biological engineers to create either intelligence enhanced forms of human beings, or new life forms that have intelligence far beyond that of the average human. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that science will have a greater impact on the coming century than it has had in the last several centuries, knowing full well of the enormous impact that science has had in the last 100 and 200 years. 
   As one futurist points out, if someone describes the future 40 years from now and paints a picture that looks like a science fiction movie, that picture may be wrong, but if someone is discussing the future 40 years from now and paints a picture that does not look like a science fiction movie, then you know they are wrong. We will be living in a science fiction movie. We just don't know which one.  
   I believe that the issue of engineered intelligence is one that will have a greater impact on humankind than even the development of nuclear weapons. Just a few years before nuclear weapons were first exploded, Albert Einstein wrote to Roosevelt, and explained that it was possible to create such a nuclear bomb. In fact, just a few years went by before it was a reality. 
   Now we have not a few years, but a few decades, to wrestle with the enormous ethical, theological and sociological impacts of the technologies that are out there--just 10, 20, 30 years away. My fear is that we will over the next 10 years do what we have done over the last 10 years: Basically, waste the time that we so urgently need to deal with issues that we have just begun, that we really have not begun, to think through. 
   Now, as we develop more intelligent computers, we will find them useful tools in creating even more intelligent computers, a positive feedback loop. I don't know whether we will create the maniacal Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey or the earnest Data from Star Trek. My guess is that we will create them both. There are those who say don't worry because even the most intelligent or malevolent computer is in a box, and cannot affect the outside world. But I believe there are those of the human species who would give hands to the devil, in return for a good stock tip. 
   I do draw solace from the fact that because a computer is intelligent or even self-aware, that this does not mean that it is ambitious. That is, will it try to affect the outside world? Will it have a survival instinct? 
   My washing machine does not seem to care whether I turn it off or not. In contrast, my pet mouse does seem to care. We should be working on elements to implant in computers to prevent self-awareness, survival instinct and ambition. But I know no politician is supposed to say that, because it sounds wacky; it sounds like science fiction. But if we are not talking about things that sound like science fiction, then we are not talking about the real issues that will confront us in the generation to come. 
   We also should focus not only on computer engineering but on the engineering of DNA. Biological engineering starts with an inherently ambitious raw material. Virtually all life forms seem to seek to survive, seem to try to affect their environment to achieve that purpose. Most of them seem to care whether their progeny survive. Now, bioengineers could create a 1,000-pound mammal with a 100-pound brain that will beat your kids on the LSAT. 
   These are issues that deserve the attention of all of us in the public sphere but particularly those who are our best philosophers, theologians and sociologists. 
   I thank the Chair for giving me the time to, once again, bring these issues before the House, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that these issues are confronted long before science confronts us with new reality.  
   I believe that the impact of science on this century will be far greater than the enormous impact science had on the last century. As futurist Christine Peterson notes: If someone is describing the future 30 years from now and they paint a picture that seems like it is from a science fiction movie, then they might be wrong. But, if someone is describing the future a generation from now and they paint a picture that doesn't look like a science fiction movie, then you know they are wrong. 
   We are going to live in a science fiction movie, we just don't know which one. 
   There is one issue that I think is more explosive than even the spread of nuclear weapons: engineered intelligence. I have spent nine years focused on this issue \1\ By ``engineered intelligence'' I mean the efforts of computer engineers and bio-engineers who may create intelligence beyond that of a human being. In testimony at the House Science Committee,\2\ the consensus of experts testifying was that in roughly 25 years we would have a computer that passed the Turing Test,\3\ and more importantly exceeded human intelligence. 
   As we develop more intelligent computers, we will find them useful tools in creating ever more intelligent computers, a positive feedback loop. I don't know whether we will be creating the maniacal Hal from 2001, or the earnest Data from Star Trek--or perhaps both. 
   There are those who say don't worry, even if a computer is intelligent and malevolent--it is in a box and it cannot affect the world. But I believe that there are those of our species who would give hands to the devil, in return for a good stock tip. 
   I do draw solace from the fact that just because a computer is intelligent, or even self-aware, this does not mean that it is ambitious. By ambitious, I mean possessing a survival instinct together with a desire to affect the environment so as to ensure survival, and usually a desire to propagate or expand. 
   My washing machine does not seem to care whether I turn it off or not. My pet mouse does seem to care. So even a computer possessing great intelligence may simply have no ambition, survival instinct, or interest in affecting the world. 
   DARPA \4\ is the government agency on the cutting edge of supercomputer research. I have urged DARPA to develop computer systems designed to maximize the computer's utility, while avoiding self-awareness, or at least ambition. 
   I have spoken about computer engineering. But there is a whole different area of engineering: bio-engineering. Roughly 30 or 40 years from now bio-engineers should be able to start with human DNA and 
   create a 2,000 pound mammal with a 300 pound brain designed to beat your grandkids on the LSAT. No less troubling, they might start with canine DNA and create a mammal with near-human intelligence, and no civil rights. 
   DNA is inherently ambitious. Those microbes which didn't seek to survive or replicate, didn't. Even birds seem to care whether they or their progeny survive, and they seek to affect their environment to achieve that survival. 
   In any case, you have the bio-engineers and the computer engineers both working toward new levels of intelligence. I believe in our lifetime we will see new species possessing intelligence which surpasses our own. 
   The last time a new higher level of intelligence arose on this planet was roughly 50,000 years ago. It was our own ancestors, who then said hello to the previously most intelligent species, Neanderthals. It did not work out so well for the Neanderthals. 
   I used to view this as a contest between the bio-engineers and the computer engineers (or if you use the cool new lingo, wet nanotechnology and dry nanotechnology), in an effort to develop a new species of superior intelligence. I felt that the last decision that humans would make is whether our successors are carbon-based or silicon- based: \5\ the product of bio-engineering or of computer engineering. 
   Now I believe we are most likely to see combinations that will involve nature, computer engineering, and bio-engineering: humans with pharmaceutical intelligence boosters; DNA enhancements; computer-chip implants; or all three. First, this will be used to cure disease, then to enhance human capacity. The partially-human will precede the trans-human. 
   Now how should we react to all of this? It is important that we benefit from science even as we consider its more troubling implications. I chair the House Subcommittee on Nonproliferation which deals with the only other technologies that pose an existential threat to humankind, namely the proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons. 
   The history of nuclear technology is instructive. On August 2, 1939, Einstein sent Roosevelt a letter saying a nuclear weapon was possible; six years later, nuclear technology literally exploded onto the world scene. Only after society saw the negative effects of nuclear technology, did we see the prospects for nuclear power and nuclear medicine. 
   The future of engineered intelligence will be different. The undeniable benefits of computer and DNA research will arrive long before the problematic possibilities. Their introduction will be gradual, not explosive. And fortunately, we will have far more than six years to consider the implications--unless we choose to squander the next few decades. My fear is that our philosophers, ethicists and society at large, will ignore the issues that will inevitably present themselves until ..... they actually present themselves. And these issues require more than a few years of thought.\6\ 
   I have been urged not to make this issue the centerpiece of my reelection campaign. One journalist has told me that he can guarantee that computers will not be self-aware or overly intelligent: ``All we have to do is get them elected to Congress.'' 
   I am confident that if we plan ahead we can obtain the utility of supercomputers, and the medical treatments available from bio-engineering, without creating new levels of intelligence. We can then pause and decide whether we in fact wish to create a new intelligent species or two. 
   Finally, I would quote Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1913 when he said, ``I think it not improbable that man, like the grub that prepares a chamber for the winged thing it never has seen but is to be--that man may have cosmic destinies that he does not understand.'' \7\ 
   Likewise, it is possible that within the next 30 or 40 years, our children--or should I say ``our successors''--will have less resemblance  to us than a butterfly has to a caterpillar. I don't know whether to cry or rejoice, but I do know that our best minds in philosophy, science, ethics and even theology ought to be focused on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and our leadership for putting together an outstanding bill and thank Mr. Lantos and the leadership of our committee for the provisions within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs committee. I expect to be the chair of the subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee that deals with terrorism and nonproliferation, and I want to focus on those matters in my short presentation here today. 
   The most important issue facing the United States and certainly the most important part of this bill deals with preventing nuclear attack on American cities. Since a nuclear bomb is about the size of a person, it could be smuggled into the United States inside a bale of marijuana. Now, I know that this bill will deal with port security, but we cannot expect our ports or our borders to be airtight. The key is preventing the worst people from getting their hands on the worst weapons. This bill implements several provisions that will be helpful in that regard. 
   First, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Nunn-Lugar program to help Russia get control over its thousands of potentially loose nukes, the weapons left over from the Cold War. Second, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to get control of the 20 tons of highly enriched uranium at various nuclear reactor sites around the world, many of them unsecured. But I want to emphasize, this bill only authorizes funds and it will be meaningless unless we appropriate the funds, and I look forward to an appropriation bill that does just that as quickly as possible. 
   This bill imposes sanctions limiting the sale of U.S. weapons to those who provide centrifuges to Iran. I hope the administration will be able to report to us, before they send the F-16s, that Pakistan has verifiably and permanently halted its aid to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. This bill will do a lot, but we have to do more to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the worst hands. 
   The bill also contains important provisions dealing with public diplomacy and youth education. I think that the United States should print the textbooks for the poorest nations in the world. In doing so, we can help parents in such poor countries--that make only a dollar a day or less--who are required to provide textbooks for their kids or their kids can't go to school. At the same time we can assure American taxpayers that our tax dollars are being used to help kids and not to teach hate. I look forward to a foreign aid bill that focuses on the textbook needs of those in the poorest countries in the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. You know, it is heartwarming to sit here for a while and to listen to these personal tales of our good friend, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. 
   I first got to know JUANITA in our days as activists during the 1980s on the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee. Both of us entered State government in the early nineties; both of us came here to Congress in the mid-90s. 
   JUANITA broke barriers. JUANITA led the charge. She was the first African-American woman on the Carson City Council, the first African-American woman to chair the Revenue and Taxation Committee of the California Assembly, where I enjoyed working with her on State tax issues. JUANITA was the first African-American woman to give the Democratic Radio Address response. And finally, she was the first African-American woman to serve as Chair of the House Administration Committee. 
   Now, her fine work on that committee has been detailed by so many of the prior speakers who have come to this floor. And the prior speakers have also spoke of her work on the Transportation Committee, where we in Southern California are so grateful to her for her efforts on behalf of the Alameda corridor. 
   JUANITA will be missed, of course, by her husband James, by her five children and by her five grandchildren. She will be remembered here for her record of legislative accomplishment, and she will be remembered here for the spunk she showed every day. And finally, she will be remembered for the courage she showed in these final days, because JUANITA barely mentioned to her closest friends that she was a bit under the weather. Right up to the end she was fighting the good fight. JUANITA's courage and strength will be remembered.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE TOM LANTOS, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, we're all deeply saddened by the passing of TOM LANTOS. He not only made history here in Washington; he embodied history, having survived the Holocaust. And he didn't just survive the Nazis; he fought them in the anti-Nazi underground during World War II. His personal history added to the gravitas of everything he said and everything he did here in Washington. TOM was our Nation's most passionate, eloquent, and respected advocate for human rights, for democracy and for freedom. TOM never bowed to political pressure in the face of any humanitarian atrocity. 
   As our friend, GARY ACKERMAN, pointed out, in a town with too many sheep, TOM LANTOS was a lion, for Darfur, for Tibet, wherever human rights were trampled. And of course TOM LANTOS led the walk out in 2001 from the Durban South Africa U.N. conference when that conference degenerated into an anti-Semitic hatefest. 
   Madam Speaker, I came here as a tax professional expecting to serve on the Ways and Means Committee someday. And when that day arrived, TOM LANTOS convinced me to stay involved instead on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He convinced me with his words, but more than that he convinced me with his example. He was courteous, gracious, beyond what you expect; but more than that, he was passionate and he was eloquent. And he was an example of what it is to be a great advocate for human rights here in Congress. He will indeed be missed, not only by Annette and the entire LANTOS family, but also by people around the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (HOMELESS VETERANS HOUSING AT SEPULVEDA AMBULATORY CARE CENTER PROMOTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the House for taking the time and focusing on an issue that is relevant to just one district, namely mine, a facility that is in my district. 
   I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for coming out to my district and for meeting with veterans and for meeting with those who run the VA in our area and for understanding this issue so well; and for meeting with the one developer who opposes this bill. 
   And I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida for taking her time to study an issue that after all just relates to one district and one facility. 
   Now, let me tell you why we are here. It is a story that I can relate briefly. 
   A developer came to our community and said they would like to provide housing for 150 homeless veterans with substance abuse problems in our suburban neighborhood. You can imagine in some communities those who believe in NIMBY-ism, ``not in my backyard,'' would have said, oh, take care of veterans, but not here. I am proud of my community. 
   I had countless meetings. Yes, there were a few naysayers. But finally after many meetings, the community was clear, we want to help this project. We want to help veterans, particularly those that are homeless and suffering from substance abuse problems. We as community organizations want to volunteer, our veterans organizations want to send people, our employers want to provide jobs, all so homeless veterans can get the help they need not only with housing but with substance abuse problems. 
   What we got in return was a clear statement of three principles: that the facility would be for veterans only; that there would be adequate staffing ratios set forth in the lease so that as long as the lease would run, we would know that it was adequately staffed;  and, finally, that the facility be clean and sober because it was designed for homeless veterans with substance abuse problems. We wanted to provide the special environment these veterans need to recover. 
   And we assumed that once we as a community urged the VA to go forward with a program, they would open it up to a variety of organizations and say we've got two empty buildings right here in the City of Los Angeles in the North Hills community; come and give us your proposals. Instead, something else happened. 
   First, for reasons I do not understand, the VA decided to spend a lot of time just focused on one developer. Second, that developer, who had promised our community, and these promises were reduced to writing, that the program would have guaranteed staffing ratios, decided to back out of that promise, decided that they would rather not have to provide any particular level of funding. 
   They had come to us and said the program would be veterans only and would be alcohol free. But then they discovered that certain sources of funds would be available to them only if it was for general public housing; and that in order to get certain sources of funding from HUD, they would have to open it up to non-veterans and they would have to allow alcohol because in a general housing facility open to all types of homeless people, you don't turn to every homeless person and say, We will give you a roof, but you can't have a beer. 
   So they had to change the proposal from a design to treat homeless veterans' abuse problems in the best way possible, to one that was a general proposal. And VA headquarters decided they had already had so many discussions, it was easier for them, they wanted their statistics to look good, they wanted to cut the ribbon on a facility, that they would just go down the road and provide a 75-year, rent-free lease on valuable land in valuable buildings in the City of Los Angeles to this developer, allow non-veterans, allow alcohol use, not require any staffing ratios. 
   Now, what does my bill provide? It says to the VA: have an open process; allow the Salvation Army to submit a proposal; allow U.S. Vets to submit a proposal; allow the groups that met with the chairman in my district to submit proposals; and do your best to get a facility that is veterans only; that has adequate staffing ratios guaranteed; and that provides the alcohol-free therapeutic environment these veterans need. Do it in less than a year, says the bill. And if for some reason you can't find some qualified organization to submit a qualified proposal, then go forward. Do your best for veterans, but go forward, because we don't want to delay the use of these buildings to provide care for veterans for any significant amount of time. 
   I am confident that if the VA opens its process that these groups who have met with me and who have met with the chairman will come forward. 
   Now, I have recently seen a letter that is issued by the one organization that does not want an open process. They would rather just go ahead and sign a lease. Keep in mind the four issues: staffing; alcohol prohibited; veterans only; competitive bidding. 
   This comprehensive and long-letter response doesn't deal with the staffing issues because there is no reason to sign a 75-year, no-rent lease without the VA at least putting in there you will have so much staff. This long response does not deal with the issue of alcohol use because there is no reason that an organization that wants to help homeless veterans with substance abuse problems would allow alcohol except for the reason that that opens up funding sources that they otherwise don't have. 
   Instead, they focus on two other issues. The first is they say legal counsel has advised us that restricting the project to veterans only would expose us to legal liability. That is their phony argument for not having it veterans-only. Why is it phony? I used to be a lawyer. I could have advised any client who paid me that they would face legal liability if they scratched their nose. The fact is while anybody can get sued for anything, any activity, including breathing, can subject you to theoretical legal liability, all over this country we have veterans-only housing. We have a dozen projects in L.A. County alone. 
   And while you can always find a lawyer to say something could subject you to possible legal liability, none of these hundreds of veterans-only housing facilities has been sued. 
   What is the real reason? They say we have located funding sources that will not allow veterans only. That happens to be true. The Salvation Army and U.S. Vets, I am convinced and they are convinced, can find the funding sources that will allow for veterans-only projects. But this New Directions group has found only the wrong funding sources. 
   It is true there are many properly funded veterans-only clean and sober housing facilities across this country, but it is harder to do that kind of project than to do a project that can accept funding from those sources dedicated to general public use. 
   This may be an issue we in Congress want to look at. We may want to make it easier to have veterans housing in this country, to allow veterans-only projects that are alcohol-free to compete for the HUD money from particular programs, but that is a national issue. The local issue is that many organizations can do it right and can get their funding from sources that want to fund veterans-only clean and sober facilities. 
   Now this organization has given me an oral promise that at least initially they will only have veterans living there; but it is a 75-year, rent free, no-competitive bidding contract; and we will have no assurance that within years this project will not include both veterans and non-veterans. 
   This is of such importance to veterans of L.A. County because there is valuable land owned by the VA in my district, and even more valuable in an adjoining district, and every group with a good cause comes and says, Let us use this land for a non-veterans project. Sell this land and give us the money and we will help people somewhere. 
   But the veterans of L.A. County are very clear.

   Mr. SHERMAN. I am convinced the goal could be done in months. The bill does not provide for a super technical process. It simply says invite other groups under this bill to provide competitive bids, and it provides an absolute limit of 1 year. So this is a short-term process. 
   We already have other groups thinking about making proposals. They are reluctant to make proposals until they are asked for it.

   Mr. SHERMAN. So what this bill does is it opens the process to competitive proposals. It allows other groups like U.S. Vets and the Salvation Army to submit proposals. It urges the VA to try to create what we always wanted to create--veterans-only, staffing ratios, alcohol-free, and it gives them 1 year to do this. I hope they will act much, much more quickly, and I will push those other groups to submit their proposals very quickly. 
   Speaking of quickly, I should end this speech quickly.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (THE WORLD BANK AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address two issues involving international economics. The first is the World Bank. 
   The entire world has been fixated on whether Mr. Wolfowitz arranged $195,000 for his paramour, which shows how little attention we pay to things at the World Bank that really matter. Because while we were focused on that, no one focused in the media on the fact that the World Bank is sending over $1.3 billion, roughly a quarter of it our tax dollars, to the government of Iran. 
   Now we are told that this is for wonderful projects in Iran having nothing to do with the government. We here in the House understand something about politics. One of the ways you get reelected, one of the ways the Iranian government holds on to power is to bring home the bacon. I know it's not kosher, I know it is not halal, but that's what that government does, and the World Bank helps them do it. 
   Now, we saw how did the United States use its clout inside the World Bank? Not to stop these loans to Iran and not to stop their disbursements, over $200 million being disbursed by Mr. Wolfowitz himself, but for only two goals. One was to try to prevent the World Bank from being involved in family planning; and the other was to protect Mr. Wolfowitz's career, notwithstanding his errors of judgment. 
   Where is this administration when it comes to prioritizing and representing the national security interests of this country? Iran is developing nuclear weapons, and all we can do with our clout in the World Bank is try to protect one individual of flawed judgment. 
   Second, I would like to address the idea of granting Fast Track to this administration. I am sure that when the President seeks an extension of Fast Track, he will offer those of us on the Democratic side all kinds of wonderful promises. But keep one thing in mind: Any trade deal that requires on this President for enforcement will be enforced only to the extent this President wants it enforced. 
   Look at the Iran Sanctions Act. This President refuses to acknowledge that any facts exist that require him to even decide what to do with regard to investments in Iran. 
   I assure you that if we sign a deal with the best possible labor standards but Presidential enforcement and something were to come to pass, perhaps a coup in Peru and all of a sudden every labor leader in the country is shot in cold blood, this President will not act to enforce those labor standards. He may express some concerns, but any agreement involving our trade which requires this President to acknowledge facts occurring on the ground is a nullity except to the extent that the President chooses to. Because we could have a circumstance where there is no enforcement of corporate interests without Presidential action, and he will act; and we could have a circumstance where there is no enforcement of labor standards without Presidential action, and you can be sure he will not. 
   So I look forward to changing the policies of this administration. Let us hope that at the World Bank we focus on preventing loans to Iran, rather than irrelevancies involving one particular paramour; and let us hope that this House takes responsibility, its responsibilities under article I of the Constitution to deal with international  trade issues in regular order and not to put American jobs on the Fast Track abroad.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (TRADE AND LABOR -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman from Illinois not only for recognizing me, but for his leadership in putting together this hour and so many other hours. I thank him also for mentioning that the subcommittee which I now chair has the trade jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee because there is a great debate in this country as to whether to continue, basically, our trade policy or whether to go in a completely different direction. 
   On the side of continuation, and those who favor continuation, they want to dress it up a little bit, add a little perfume, try to make it smell a little better, but those who basically want to continue the policy come in two forms. One is what I call ``the chattering classes,'' the lawyers and MBAs, because frankly trade has been a boom to those in those particular groups. The whole world looks to the United States for lawyering, for management, for advanced management classes. And in fact, those at the upper end of business and law have done extremely well under our trade agreements, notwithstanding the effect they've had on America. 
   The second group are those who took Economics 101 and became so enamored of the theory, so proud that they understood the basic theories, that they chose never to question whether those theories actually applied to real life. 
   On the other side of this debate are those from the heartland who have seen the actual effects of trade on their districts, and those of us who are just a little skeptical of a policy that has cost America a trade deficit last year of $800 billion. 
   What does that mean? That means that we bring in the Toyotas and the Volvos and the Mercedes, and what do we give in return? We give IOUs, promissory notes, investment assets, stocks and bonds. So every year we have to borrow $800 billion, and that number will be higher; it was a little less than $800 billion last year, it will be a little more than $800 billion this year. Now, when those Toyotas and Mercedes come over, they are never going back to Germany and Japan. But those promissory notes, those stock certificates, those bonds, those U.S. Government bonds, the private sector bonds, not only do we have to sell another $800 billion of them this year, but we have to fear that they are going to cash in the ones we gave them last year and the year before. The Mercedes are never going back to Germany, but the promissory notes we gave to Germany, they're coming back someday. And so those of us who are not on the front lines in terms of our districts have to worry about what our trade policy has meant. 
   So why is it that the theory breaks down? Isn't trade good for everyone? And isn't the way to encourage trade and fair access and open markets to negotiate a reduction in tariffs around the world? Sounds great, doesn't it? If you think the whole world operates the way America operates. You see, if you are sitting in 
   Beijing, and you want access to the American market, then you realize that the only way we in Congress, the only way we in the Federal Government affect the behavior of consumers and businesses is to pass written laws and regulations. And so, if you're in Beijing and you want access to America's markets, you negotiate to change America's laws and regulations. And once you do, then your goods can come flooding into the United States because individual businesses and individual consumers will buy them. 
   And we, being basically ignorant of the world and in love with our theories,  somehow picture China as just a poor, but larger, version of the United States, a place where their markets will be open if they only will change their written laws and regulations. And so we sign deals, and laws and regulations are changed. And when laws and regulations are changed, the United States, the effect is dramatic. And when laws and regulations are changed in an awful lot of countries, there is no effect at all, because if a society is not a society that follows the rule of law, then when we negotiate for a change in laws, we negotiate for an empty sack. And that is what happens, for example, with China. 
   Imagine yourself a Chinese business person, and you get a call from a commissar, maybe a member of their Parliament, saying, Don't buy the American goods, buy the French goods, because the French are smart enough to demand fair trade; they are going to insist on balanced trade. If we want access to the French market, we've got to buy their stuff. So buy the French stuff. That will help our international position. Don't buy the American goods. 
   You get that instruction orally. There is nothing America can do about it. Even with all of our wiretapping, it's highly unlikely that we will ever hear the conversation. 
   And what happens? We don't sell the American goods. That is where the theory breaks down. A society that follows the rule of law, negotiating for a change in laws with a society that does not follow the rule of law. That is why it is foolish for us to enter into these trade deals. 
   So, those who want to keep our trade policies pretty much the way they are are a little angry because the facts aren't on their side. Last year's trade deficit was bigger than the year before and bigger than the year before that, and this year's will be still higher. So they resort to ad hominem attacks on people like the gentleman from Illinois and myself. They describe us as simpletons, too dumb to understand their highfalutin theories, as Luddites, as xenophobes, and as people protecting the parochial interests of the heartland and Midwest. 
   Well, I am certainly no proof of whether we are all simpletons or not; I can't offer you anything there. I'm sure we are going to hear from quite a number of quite eloquent and brilliant legislators who will give the lie to that argument. But I can give the lie to the argument that we are here protecting parochial interests of the American heartland, because, as the gentleman points out, I am from Los Angeles. Our port is doing real well. The goods come into the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles in enormous quantities in those containers, and then the containers go back empty or filled with raw materials and scrap iron. 
   And also, in addition to representing the city of Los Angeles and its port, the port isn't actually in my district, but my city runs it, I also represent half the city of Burbank. And if there are any industries that benefit from these trade agreements, there are those industries that don't really produce much of a physical product, but rely on getting paid for intellectual properties, our drug companies and our entertainment companies. 
   And so, if I was here out of parochial interest, I might point to this or that different industry in my district or my city. And if any district should support these trade deals, it ought to be mine, but no district in America should support these trade deals because they are undermining the value of the dollar, they are undermining the power of America, and, ultimately, they are unsustainable. 
   For how many years will the world loan us $600-, 700-, $800 billion a year? For how many years will the world send us the Toyotas and Mercedes and expect nothing but pieces of paper in return? The day of reckoning is coming. Perhaps the implosion of the U.S. dollar is coming. But things that cannot go on forever don't, and a trade deficit of $800 billion and growing is simply unsustainable. 
   I have a lot more to say, but so many others do as well. I will yield back to the gentleman from Illinois.

   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify two provisions in the bill through a colloquy with its author, the distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee. 
   First is section 11(e)(2)(B), which provides certain powers to the so-called Car Czar. And I'd like to clarify that that would include the power to prohibit a plant closure. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?

   Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the distinguished chairman. 
   We have seen the Fed and the Treasury provide $7 trillion in expenditures and in risk assumption as part of the economic bailout. In contrast, we can keep the automobile industry alive until the next administration through an expenditure of somewhat over $14 billion, a risk of only $14 billion.

   Mr. SHERMAN. So a $14 billion bridge loan seems rather small in light that all this administration, the Fed and the Treasury have done. Keep in mind that Germany, Japan, Korea, China, France, every nation with an automobile industry is doing far more to protect their automobile industry than we are by providing 14 to $15 billion of bridge financing. That is why I will vote for the rule and for the bill. But this is far from a perfect bill.  
   Due to the efforts of the administration, we are now limited to receiving warrants worth only 20 percent of what we are investing. The original text of the bill mandated that Treasury could seek more than 20 percent. Given the risks that we are taking in lending money to General Motors and Chrysler, we should be getting far more than 20 percent warrants, and certainly the bill should not limit us to that. But the administration, in its generosity to the automakers, limits this to 20 percent warrants. 
   Second, this bill should prevent the auto companies from suing against the California tougher standards for air emissions and for global warming and higher standards for fuel economy. These companies should be trying to meet those higher standards, not suing to prevent them. 
   Finally, the bill does prevent the companies from owning luxury planes, but allows them to charter luxury jet aircraft. So I know the auto companies will be back, and I hope they fly commercial. We'll fine-tune this bill in the spring. Let's vote for it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS: BIG, FAST, TOUGH, TEMPORARY, AND SELF-REVERSING -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, let me commend you on your years of service to this House, to your district, and to the Nation, and I look forward to working with you and serving the people of this Nation in whatever capacity your future takes you. 
   I'd like to address the kind of economic stimulus that we should write next month. I hope that the economic stimulus is big, fast, tough, temporary, and self-reversing. 
   We face the specter, not just of a recession, but of a depression. A deflationary cycle threatens a long period of economic contraction. We need an enormous, immediate economic stimulus. But unless that stimulus is well-designed, it may not pass Congress, and we may not achieve its objectives or it may sow the seeds of future, disastrous declines in the value of the dollar. 
   Now, it is important that this stimulus be fast and be very large, but it also needs to be tough because Federal dollars should not be extended to private interests except on the toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yields, the largest equity upside, and the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. 
   Being tough on those who get bailouts will give us three advantages. First, it will increase public support for the bailout, and we are going to need a lot of public support to enact the size of stimulus that is necessary. 
   Second, by being tough on those obtaining bailouts, we can limit the number of companies that seek bailouts. Not even the Federal Government can afford to provide a bailout to everyone who will ask for it if executives see the Federal Government as a source of easy and cheap money. 
   Third, by getting a good deal on each investment we make, we minimize the eventual increase in the Federal deficit and the eventual burden to succeeding generations. Many of the companies that we make investments in will still not make it. So we had better make a good profit on our winning investments. We need to look at not only the rate of return that we get on preferred stock but on the value of the warrants because the warrants are our share, as taxpayers, of the upside of those companies that are successful. 
   It, therefore, concerns me that on a recent bailout of Goldman Sachs by the Treasury Department, we taxpayers got half the rate of return and one-sixth the warrants that Mr. Warren Buffett was able to receive on a very similar investment in the same firm. 
   So we must be tough. But we also must make sure that the stimulus we adopt is temporary and reversible. Keynesian economics offers a simple prescription for the difficult economic times ahead. Easy money now, and austerity when the economy improves. 
   But how in good conscience can I vote for a massive economic stimulus now if I believe that Congress will not be able to adopt fiscal restraint later? I know we in Congress love handing out money in the form of tax cuts or infrastructure projects or subsidies or aid. Can we count on a future Congress to discontinue expansionary policies and adopt austerity when times demand? 
   If we adopt a huge fiscal stimulus economy now, then both our tendencies toward profligacy and toward inertia may cause us to leave the spigot on too long, perhaps permanently. 
   What is likely to happen I fear is that the advocates of fiscal responsibility will prevent us today from getting the full measure of economic stimulus that we need now, and that advocates of tax cuts and free spending tomorrow will prevent us from turning off the spigot when that is what we should be doing. We will get inadequate stimulus in 2009, and we will continue the stimulus long after it is necessary and even when it is harmful. 
   To avoid this outcome, the stimulus package should be both temporary and self-reversing. The same statutes which  provide for a huge stimulus now should also provide for particular and identified tax increases and expenditure cuts to go into effect in 2013 automatically. The statute, of course, could provide that those automatic actions will be delayed temporarily if we fail to achieve 3 percent economic growth in 2012. 
   Now, sure, we're going to need to fine-tune this program later, but we need to give the upper hand to those Members of Congress who will advocate for fiscal responsibility in the early part of the next decade. If austerity in 2013 is mandated by statute that we adopt in 2009, then the advocates of fiscal responsibility will have a fighting chance when the budgets are negotiated early next decade. 
   Only if the economic stimulus proposal is tough, temporary, and self-reversing can we be confident that Congress will adopt a proposal that is big enough and fast enough to meet today's needs. And only if the stimulus measures are temporary and self-reversing can we make sure that the actions we take today do not lead to inflation, higher interest rates, a declining dollar and an enormous permanent increase in our Federal deficit in the years to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHERMAN. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. The visa lottery program is based on the absurd notion that the group of people coming to the United States are insufficiently diverse. There has never been such a diverse group of people. 
   The diversity lottery discriminates against those who live in Mexico, China or the Philippines on the theory, an absurd theory, that an immigrant from Paraguay will add more to American culture than one from Mexico. I think it is time to end this absurd cultural discrimination. 
   It makes sense for our country to let people come here for family unification or because the immigrant brings special skills. The diversity lottery admits people who bring neither. They need no family ties nor special skills. 
   Our other immigration programs require that the person either have a job or a family member who will issue an affidavit of support. Those coming here under the visa lottery have neither, and therefore are free to become a charge to our taxpayers. 
   I look forward to having a comprehensive immigration law so that our immigration laws make sense, but let's kill the one element of our immigration laws that make the least sense now. We shouldn't discriminate against those with family in the United States, those with special skills, or those from Mexico, China or the Philippines, on the theory that somehow we enhance our culture more by admitting immigrants from one country as opposed to another.
