<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, for those viewers of this debate each year and for my colleagues who think that really very little had changed when the House of Representatives changed from majority Republican to majority Democrat, we are seeing in this bill very profound changes in policy in this country, and none is more profound than the difference in the approach to the COPS program. This year's bill has $100 million for hiring in the COPS program. 
   In the COPS program, as many of you know, more than 100,000 police officers in small towns, big cities throughout the country were hired in the period beginning in 1995. Yet shortly after the beginning of the Bush administration, the COPS program was slashed and slashed and slashed to essentially die on the vine. 
   As you see in this chart, in 1995 you had in the neighborhood of 20,000 cops being hired each and every year. In 2005 and 2006, 2007, it was down to zero. 
   In this year's bill, to the enduring credit of the chairman and ranking member and members of the committee, this is now being funded at $100 million. That is going to allow us an opportunity to hire many, many more police officers. 
   Now, we have also, in the first couple of months of the new Congress, passed a reauthorization of the COPS program for another 50,000 cops on the beat. Now, it has gone to the other side of this building. It has gone to the other body and seems to be doing what so much legislation does, and that is dying a slow, excruciating death. They say the other body is the ``cooling saucer of democracy.'' They have turned into the deep freeze when it comes to many of the things that this House is doing. 
   But what this amendment seeks to do is to say let's take that success and let's take it even further. This is one of the programs, the COPS program, it is democratic with a small ``d.'' If you are in a small town, conservative neighborhood, you have gotten COPS. If you are in a big city like mine, you have gotten COPS. What the COPS program argues is that Federal law enforcement, that Federal anti-terrorism means helping local authorities hire more police officers. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Sheriffs Association all support dramatically increasing this program.     
   Now, Chairman Mollohan has taken a program that has essentially been killed and gives it more life. And this is what we need to continue on the trend towards. Now, whether we do it more in this bill with my amendment, or whether we finally get the other body to reauthorize the program and we can start doing this in regular order, we need to realize that as Tom Ridge, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, once said, ``Homeland security starts in our hometown.'' We can't just say to cities, go out and protect yourselves. We need a Federal program that works. 
   Now, I don't mind pointing out that at the apex of the hiring was also the highest point in our crime reduction in this country. We have seen over the course of several FBI index reports that it has started to creep up more and more and more, and by no small measure because of the reduction in the COPS program. 
   We need to continue on this arc. The committee has done an excellent job in doing that. 
   I would be glad to yield to the chairman if he has any feedback for me.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (GENDER-IDENTITY INCLUSIVENESS IN ENDA -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, later on this week or perhaps early next week, this House will embark on the latest chapter in our Nation's history of extending the civil rights that all Americans should be entitled to to one other group. We will be considering the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. It is an effort to make sure that people are not discriminated against in their workplace because of their sexual orientation, because of their gender identity. It is something that is intuitive to so many Americans, and, frankly, the overwhelming number of Americans. And it is an example of how sometimes we in this House lead on civil rights issues and sometimes we follow. 
   In this case, it is a little bit of each. Under ENDA, we will be following to a large degree. Hundreds of companies, including virtually all of the Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 companies, already recognized fundamentally that it is good business to judge people by the quality of their work, their intellect, their drive, by what they bring to the business, not what their sexual orientation or gender identity is. 
   Overwhelming numbers of companies, and not just companies that you would describe as being progressive, but companies from all across the political spectrum, financial services groups like American Express and J.P. Morgan and Lehman. You have companies like Clear Channel Communication, Coca-Cola, Nationwide Insurance, Nike, Microsoft. These are all companies that, when they write the contracts for their other workers, it is fundamental to them that there will be no discrimination based on someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. 
   For these companies and for the 90 percent or so of American people that responded to a Gallup poll in 2007, employment nondiscrimination based on gender identity and based on sexual orientation is obvious; it is not even an innovation. 
   But we are going to be leading in some important ways. There are still about 30 percent of people who respond to polls who are members of the lesbian, bisexual and transgender community who say that they experience discrimination at the workplace regularly. Some of them, 25 percent, say they experience it on a regular basis. Why should that be? Is that an American value? Is it an American value to say we should discriminate on someone based on the sense of who they love or how they express it? Of course not. 
   So, for those men and women throughout all 50 States, we will be leading later on this week when we pass the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. But it is very important that we also realize that we are leading on another element to this discussion. There is an active discussion going on in this Chamber and elsewhere whether or not to include gender identity in the same category we include sexual orientation. I say unequivocally the answer is yes. There are people who every day experience discrimination because of their gender identity. 
   Susan Stanton spent 14 years as the Largo, Florida city manager; 14 years, obviously doing a good job, rehired, reappointed. Susan was once Steve Stanton. When he started hormone therapy and planned to become a woman, was fired. 
   Diane Schroer, 25 years of distinguished service in the Army as David. Recorded 450 parachute jumps, received the Defense Superior Service Medal, hand picked to lead a classified national security operation. Retired and was offered a job with a private homeland security consulting firm. The offer was rescinded when Schroer explained he was transgender and wanted to begin the job as a woman. 
   But the question has come up: If we can't include gender identity in this bill, should we do anything at all? Should we take half a loaf. 
   My colleagues, I think the answer is no. I think we cannot toss this element of an important civil rights coalition to the side. We have to make sure, particularly in the context of us doing what is largely symbolic, there is no sense that the Senate is going to act on this, and certainly no sense that the President of the United States and this administration is going to. Maybe what we should say is we are in this together. 
   If we are going to make a symbolic stand, the symbolic stand should be let's pass a one House bill with only part of the protections. Let's let the symbolic message be that we are sticking together, that when we say ``GLBT,'' we mean it. And we should do something else. We should also make it very clear to those watching this discussion that we are not going to negotiate against ourselves. We are not going to say if we toss this element or that element off to the side, maybe we will be able to get what we need. There are some things that are immutable, some civil rights that are immutable. This is one of them. 
   We are going to stick together and pass an inclusive ENDA, or we are going to come back again and do it right.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Madam Chairman, I doubt I will take the full 5 minutes. 
   As remarkable as it might seem to anyone who is listening to these remarks, there is one national park in our country that was closed after September 11 that remains closed to this day. 
   We all remember that after September 11, there was kind of a general lockdown. We weren't sure what was going to happen next. National parks throughout the country were closed. That included this building. It included the White House. It included, frankly, monuments, memorials, and parks throughout the country. 
   Almost immediately thereafter, with some changes to security, some more enhanced like this building, some less so like some national parks, every single one of the national parks and institutions was reopened, except for one: the Statue of Liberty. Perhaps the single most symbolic of all parks, the Statue of Liberty remains closed to this day. It is true you can take a ferry and go around the Statue of Liberty. It is even true that you can go to its base, walk inside, and tap Lady Liberty's toes. But the Statue of Liberty and its iconic stairway that leads to the very top, to the crown, where all of us or so many of us remember standing on our tiptoes to see that regal view, remains closed today. 
   Now, my colleagues, you might be wondering how could it be nearly 7 years after September 11 the park is still closed? Let me tell you a few reasons why it is not the case. 
   First of all, there has been plenty of money. This committee and private beneficiaries have raised over $20 million for security enhancements, for changes. In fact, we all remember after September 11 a foundation was formed, Folger's and American Express and all kinds of institutions, the Daily News, my hometown newspaper. Kids were gathering up pennies and dimes and nickles. So there was no shortage of money. But we do know what there appears to be a shortage of, and that is imagination or courage on the part of the National Park Service. 
   We in this House, by a resounding fashion last year, 266 of us voted to say open up Lady Liberty to her crown. But the National Park Service, after years of kind of thinking about it and scratching their chin and twiddling their hair and flipping through papers, last year, at the urging of Mr. Dicks and others, finally sent this body a letter that said, ``we have concluded that the current access patterns reflect a responsible management strategy in the best interests of all our visitors.''     
   Well, that is bureaucratic speech, saying to Congress and the American people, take a hike, we're going to do what we want. Saying to the chairman of the committee, the ranking member, 266 of us, We don't care what your views are, we don't care about the private donations, we don't care about the reasonable accommodations that can be made, we're not opening up the Statue of Liberty. 
   And I say reasonable accommodations because there are things that can be done. Look, there is no doubt about it, there are narrow staircases, there are narrow passageways, not as narrow as this building, and there are sensitive locations, not as sensitive as the White House, but we've figured out ways to accommodate visitors, although in a limited fashion, in those places. 
   My colleague, Congressman Sires, who is here today to offer this amendment with me and who I, regretfully, have to admit, according to the Supreme Court, that the Statue of Liberty is in his district. Although I would point out that Lady Liberty's caboose faces New Jersey, not her proud crown. But I want to thank him for all that he has done and for seeing that this is a national issue. 
   Let me just say this in closing: you know, we have heard it thrown around a lot, We mustn't let the terrorists win, We mustn't let the terrorists win. Can you imagine the symbolic sacrifice and the symbolic surrender we have made by saying that, because there are security concerns, we're not going to reopen the Statue of Liberty? How many of us don't remember the experience of climbing those narrow staircases? 
   So what does this amendment do? This amendment says, you say you can't do it? We're going to give you another million dollars to do it. It takes $1 million and strikes it from the administration's account, puts it in the National Park Service account and says, if you need more money, here it is. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues on the Resources Committee, subcommittee Chairman Grijalva, full committee Chairman Rahall, for considering and tentatively agreeing to do hearings to look into this. 
   This is simply wrong. And to my chairman, Mr. Dicks, and to my ranking member, Mr. Tiahrt, there are no stronger advocates for the National Park Service than they, no stronger protectors of the national budget than they. 
   This is not a frivolous idea. This is Lady Liberty. This is making sure we restore the dignity of our National Park Service everywhere, but particularly in this most symbolic place.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Madam Speaker, first of all, I think that I speak for all of our colleagues and all of us here in paying tribute to the 137,000-some-odd American men and women who are fighting in Iraq, the 25,000 or so that are fighting in Afghanistan. We are here to do what we can to honor them. We are trying to express our patriotism. We are trying to do what we are obligated to do by standing up here. 
   The notion that it is our patriotic duty, our obligation to sit silent and to do whatever the President thinks is best and blindly walk in that direction, that is not the way to honor the troops that are there. I can imagine the challenges that they face every single day, and would the message going back to them be most appropriate that just as often as they wake up in the deserts of Iraq trying to figure out why people are shooting at them and what they can do to stop it, they should know that every single day we here in Congress are trying to think about ways to make their mission safer and make it more possible for them to accomplish their mission and to extract them as soon as possible. We pray that they are successful. Although I strongly oppose the President's initiative, that I am going to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, I pray that they are successful. I pray we don't lose another life. We want them to be successful. But it is not enough just to be silent and to be prayerful. We also have to act. 
   Some in this Chamber have objected to this resolution because what it seeks to do is to do two things: one is the thing that I have done already, which is to pay tribute to the troops, something we all share in doing; and two is begin on a path of oversight. It is not surprising at all to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle have such a difficult concept with this idea of doing oversight over something the President proposes. They have done no oversight over how the money has been spent over there, and so as a result, we found out in the first month of the Democratic Congress that a $12 billion pallet of currency was delivered to Iraq and promptly disappeared. We had hearings last week that showed that even Mr. Bremer and officials on the ground from the administration have no idea where $12 billion disappeared to. So it is not surprising that my Republic friends have a difficult time figuring out what it is we are doing here. We are doing oversight, and we are going to do more of it. 
   We are doing oversight over the equipment that the troops had. This weekend there were stories coming outside of Iraq that Iranian-built armor-piercing projectiles were being used in roadside bombs. It reminded us again that the troops had been sent there without sufficient hardware, without sufficient protective gear, without sufficient armor-plated vehicles to be able to do their job. We are going to do oversight on that as well. 
   And I have to say that as part of the oversight that we are doing today, we are doing oversight on how the troops are being used. And let us not kid ourselves. The troops have done a remarkable job. They have done just about every single thing we have asked. They brought down a dictator. They set up a trial. They allowed a government to be stood up. They built roads and bridges. They have done an extraordinary job, and we in this House support them in that work. 
   But now what is their mission? Their mission is essentially to stand in the middle of a shooting match of the worst order. It is not over a patch of land. It is not a shooting match over what a border is going to be. It is not a shooting match even over oil. It is a shooting match of the most ingrained type between Shia and Sunni that goes back hundreds of years. Are our troops going to solve that conflict with 20,000 troops or 40,000 troops? I don't believe so. And even worse, I believe it is an untenable mission to be giving them. They are essentially in a schoolyard where everyone wants to fight. 
   And I have to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, over and over and over again today I have heard this dynamic being described that if we were to leave or to support this resolution, we would let down our allies, we would embolden our enemies, and we would betray the Iraqi people. In fact, this policy does all of those things. Let us look at it. 
   What does this policy say to our allies? Well, it says to our allies in Afghanistan we are not going to devote the resources there necessary for you to do the job. This isn't an abstract notion. You can watch it happen every single day. So long as we have 140,000 troops or 130,000 troops in this shooting match largely in Baghdad, we are watching as Afghanistan slips further and further back into the hands of the Taliban. 
   We have heard, for example, from our so-called ally the Saudis, and what have they said? They have been most telling. They said recently, well, to you, the citizens of the United States, if you pull your troops out, we are going to be forced to put resources in to support our Sunni brethren. So the Saudis have said if the American troops leave, we are going to have to jump in on the side of our Sunni brethren in Baghdad. What does that say? What does that say? That says they will jump into a blood-letting, but they won't come in now to help us stabilize Baghdad. They have argued, essentially, that the only reason they are not involved is our troops are. Some ally. Some message we are sending to our ally Saudi Arabia. What they are saying is, You had better keep your boys dying because otherwise we are going to have to send ours in. 
   That is exactly what we want. We want them to send they resources in. We want them to take ownership of this. 
   And the same is true with Egypt and other allies in the region. They have said to us, You had better keep doing what you are doing, Mr. President. We are getting exactly the wrong message. 
   And I have also heard my colleagues speak frequently today about  emboldening our enemies. Well, it seems like just about anything Democrats propose is emboldening our enemies. 
   Let us take a closer look at this. Is Iran truly upset about what is going on in Iraq? Are the Iranians 
   truly wringing their hands every day saying, Boy oh boy, I hope the United States does not pull out of there? No. They have never been happier with this existing policy. Their worst elements, their worst Shia elements, are crossing over the border practically at will, joining the fight. The President of the United States himself has said it. I have heard people here on the floor say it. They like this confrontation that is going on. They want it to be like this. 
   But they are happy for another reason, and I say this particularly to my friends on the other side of the aisle. They are happy because I am truly concerned about the threat that Iran poses not only to the United States but to the world. Do you think we are in a position right now with our military stretched so thin that if we needed to act against Iran, we could? No. Our engagement in Baghdad, adding more and more and more troops, has stretched us thinner and thinner and thinner. And the most happy people in the world are the tyrants in Iran because they know they can get away with just about anything. And if you think I am wrong about that, take a look at the war back last year on the northern border of Israel. Hezbollah felt completely unencumbered, which is essentially, as we all know, an agent of Iran. They felt completely unencumbered again just to attack a democracy in the region because they knew that all of us were stretched entirely too thin to be able to respond. So this notion that we are going to send the wrong message to our enemies is completely wrong. 
   Do you know what would send the right message to our enemies, I say to my colleagues? You take some of those troops out of Baghdad, you put them on the Iranian border. That is how you send them a message. You get them out of the shooting match, but you keep them in the neighborhood. You keep them right on the border of Iran and you say, We don't need 140,000, but we are going to make sure you don't export any more problems. We are going to seal off the schoolyard. 
   And, finally, I have heard it said that this will be an abandonment of the Iraqi people. Well, ladies and gentlemen, there is no element here that I am more disappointed with, and I think I speak virtually for all of us. Our troops are in there trying to create stability in Iraq, and for some reason, overwhelming numbers of Iraqis say that they think it is okay to shoot at our troops. It is outrageous. It is outrageous. Our troops are in there trying as best they can to build this country, put it back together, and the Iraqi people over and over again are saying, You know what, it is kind of okay when I read stories about snipers shooting at our troops. 
   The Iraqi people have to have a moment where they confront the reality of the situation. Everyone agrees, I think, and whenever I say that, I hear someone come to the floor and think that everything is going just fine in Iraq, but just about everyone agrees that the Iraqi people themselves ultimately have to take responsibility for their own country. 
   Are we creating an environment that is more likely to happen or less likely to happen? Well, there is no sign that it is happening; so the de facto response to my own question is that it is not happening. But I would argue that every time we stand up and put additional troops in, we push the Iraqi people further from the point where they have to confront that they have to take control. Might it be messy? Yes. Might it even be bloody? Yes. But one thing is for sure: up to now the Iraqi people have simply said, We are not going to. We don't have to. We have got our boys from the United States of America, and now we have another 20, 30, 40,000 that are going to be rolling into town. 
   My colleagues, I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle complain, and I have to say, present company excluded, it sounded a little like whining most of the day. I have heard, well, we need more choices. I have heard we need more bills. I have heard we need more language. There are going to be plenty of opportunities to confront these issues, but today my colleagues have to confront the choice in front of them. Sometimes in this job you have to say ``yea'' or ``nay.'' And this week what you have to say ``yea'' or ``nay'' on is a resolution that is exquisite in its simplicity. It says two things and two things only. It says we support the troops. We are going to keep them safe. We are going to keep them secure. We are going to do anything that they need to show our support. And, two, we disapprove of the way the President wants to increase the number of troops going there. That is it. You are going to get to vote on other things later on because we are not done. Many of us believe very strongly that we need major tactical changes, and I know Mr. Murtha has a plan. The Blue Dog Caucus has a plan for more transparency. There are going to be plenty of choices. You are going to get oversight. 
   I know it has been years, I say to my colleagues, since you have seen any around here, but you are going to get it. But today what we have is a simple proposition. It is the same proposition that is being discussed in coffee shops, in church socials, in corner stores all around this country, and that is: Do we support what the President is doing by increasing our engagement rather than reducing it? That is what this is about. And all of the foot stamping and all of the complaining and all of the whining, I want another bill, I want different language, I want to deal with something different, I want a hug, well, for the time being this is the choice that you are confronted with. 
   If you believe that this surge is the right policy, you have a simple vote. You can vote ``no.'' If you believe that you don't want to support the troops, and there is no one like that, you can vote ``no.'' But this resolution is the beginning of finally starting to do what the American people are thirsting for, and that is this Chamber is a place where we stand up and say whether we support these things or not. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today, first of all, to express my gratitude to the chairman for crafting a bill which tries to do what we want to do, which is to take seriously the admonition by former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge that homeland security starts in our hometowns, and tried to officially get homeland security funds to our neighborhoods. 
   Congressman Cantor and I were going to be offering an amendment on the floor to address a program that has been funded in the last couple of years, albeit inefficiently, by the Department of Homeland Security, to deal with the problem that local neighborhood nonprofit organizations, churches, synagogues, civic institutions, are being visited by local law enforcement all the time saying, here are the things you need to do to make your institution more hardened for the challenge of homeland security. 
   Yet, with all the things they are being told to do, unlike a business that can pass along its expenses to stockholders, or unlike a government entity that can raise taxes or make choices on what they want to allocate, these nonprofit organizations really have no way to find the funds for things like security cameras, for emergency escape hatches, for communication devices within their facilities. 
   The nonprofit Homeland Security grants have done that. They have done it in a relatively efficient way. You haven't read the stories about great waste because they are relatively small amounts of money to pay for the things like I described. 
   This section of the bill, the administrative section, was where we thought maybe we could take some of the money to allocate for the nonprofit grants. The other body, an earmark, is going to take $20 million and allocate it for that purpose. It's only a $25 million program that we have allocated for the past couple of Congresses. I think that, frankly, the knowledge that this is going to be worked out in conference is comforting. 
   But we need to realize that one of the things we need to do, and frankly, it's a program that has been administered in a remarkably democratic, with a small D, way. It has been distributed to small towns, big cities, nonprofit organizations. They get visited by local law enforcement: These are the things you do to become more safe. They have gone out and done it. They have made applications to the States that have then funded these programs as they see fit. 
   We are not going to be offering the amendment, although I am grateful for the bipartisan work that we have done on this. I would like to ask the chairman, as this moves forward to committee, in the interest of time in moving the program forward, I just want to make sure that you are mindful of our concerns about making sure that these nonprofit grants continue to see the light of the day. 
   I yield to the chairman.

   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, it is gratifying to hear so many of my colleagues express their understanding of what happened in the campaign of 2006 and why a majority party on that side turned into a minority party. They are right. Some of it was because of the abject abuse of the earmark process. Some of it was about the abject abuse that resulted in people being indicted and people going to jail. 
   But that was only part of it. We on this side of the aisle got that message. That is why we have a transparent process that is going to open up all the earmarks to scrutiny. But that was only part of it. 
   The fact that some commentators have referred to the previous leadership of the party of this House as the most ethically bankrupt in our Nation's history, that was only part of the reason that the American people rejected the Republican mission. 
   They also rejected it because they ran up the largest deficits in recent memory. They rejected the Republican rule because there was a war that was being prosecuted without any oversight on that side of the aisle. The fact that wages were stagnant and the minimum wage hadn't been raised; that it was more and more difficult for the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class to send their kids to college. 
   Well, on the Democratic side, we said we are going to work late into the night past the dilatory efforts of our colleagues because we are here to fight for the American people.  
   You say, one way or another you are going to get your way by doing motion after motion after motion. 
   I have got to tell you something. It is worth it. It is worth it. This fight is important enough that we are prepared to stand here and try to get a Homeland Security bill to protect the American people. We are prepared to do it. We are prepared to stay here all night for a transparent process that allows us to assess some of these thousands of earmarks submitted by both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. Chairman, do you know how I know with certitude that we are going to pass this bill to protect the American people by having a Homeland Security bill that is sound? Because we said we were going to make it easier for parents to send their kids to college, and we did it. We said we were going to raise the minimum wage, and we did it. We said we were going to crack down on these oil companies getting tax breaks for doing nothing more than gouging the American people, and we did it. We have done the things the American people have sent us here to do. 
   The only way that my colleagues on the other side can think from stopping us to achieve the agenda of the American people is every couple of minutes saying, We want to go home. We have worked hard enough. We want to rise. 
   We are not going anywhere. You can do it again and again and again. And we will wait you out.

   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, tell them this. We will wait. We will wait because this is too important, if you want to trivialize the process. 
   I don't blame you for not wanting to debate this bill because the leadership of the previous Congress was shameful. There was no oversight. There was no questioning. There was no sense of what the responsibility is of this Congress. And your vision, or absence thereof, was rejected by the American people. 
   Now, my colleagues on the other side, the colleagues that my back is facing, are destined to be in the permanent minority because the American people want us to achieve things. We are committed on this side of the aisle to doing it. And if you think that you have problems with this bill, make an amendment to it. Make 10 amendments. Make 30 amendments. 
   We are going to be here because we believe in something else: Having an open rule to allow you to do this.

   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, we think that more and more it is becoming clear that we have a good portion of this institution that wants to solve these problems in a bipartisan way if we can, and as Democrats alone if we must. But one way or another, if you think, as one of the previous speakers said, ``You are going to do it our way or we are going to keep making motions to rise,'' keep doing it. We are not going anywhere. We are here to fight for the American people for 2 years, and we are not giving up. 
   There are people making much bigger sacrifices than we are. What we are here to do is to try to honor their sacrifice, honor the things the American people are going through. And that is why the American people turned to a Democratic House; a Democratic Senate; and in a matter of months, a Democratic President of the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for both his confidence and his leadership of our committee, and I also want to thank BOBBY SCOTT, the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee. 
   We are really here for three reasons. We are here because the COPS program has been a singular success. It has been a success because we identified in the 1990s that crime was not a program that only localities could get a handle on, that we had a Federal role. It is a success because it was a singularly democratic, with a small ``d,'' program.     
   And small towns and big cities throughout all 50 States wound up benefiting from the over 118,000 police officers that were put on the street because of this program. We know, for example, that 82 percent of the grants went to cities with 50,000 people or less. And while cities like mine did very well because there were more police on the beat, we know that there were a large number of very small towns that benefited. 
   We know, as you can see, that the COPS program provides resources to all 50 States. This wasn't a political program. If you were a police department and you showed a way to get more cops on the street, the Federal Government wasn't going to sit back; they were going to be actively involved. And we know that it was successful. We know it because the Government Accountability Office looked at the connection between police officers and the reduction in crime and found a correlation. We know the University of Nebraska looked at a very similar thing and said, with all the varying elements that go into reducing crime, was the fact that there are over 110,000 new police officers on the street  funded by the COPS program a correlative effect? And the answer was yes. 
   We are also here for another reason. We are here because crime has started to creep back up. We are starting to see index crimes in cities around the country start to rise again. After years of decline, we are seeing it go up. And we are also here because there is even more law enforcement burden being put on localities and States than arguably any time in American history. Tom Ridge once famously said that homeland security starts in our hometown. And when we were talking about the cuts that were being made to homeland security, we were reminded that actually it is the localities that we are asking to do more and more of these things. 
   So we are here in acknowledgement that localities need the help. Localities now have to do more than they ever had to do before, and that's why in this program for the first time we are funding T-COPS, cops that are going to be hired to do antiterrorism work. 
   But particularly the reason that we're here is a third reason, that my colleagues on that side of the aisle eliminated the hiring component. President Bush eliminated the hiring component. This is a visual about how many police officers were hired under the COPS program from 1995 to 2005. This is what has happened under President Bush and under our Republican leadership. This many police officers. Zero. Zero. Zero in Virginia. Zero in South Dakota. Zero in California. The program was eliminated under my Republican friends. And as they stand up here today, and you're going to see them vote in large numbers for this program, they're going to wrap themselves around the idea that they support the COPS program when in fact overwhelmingly it was quite the opposite. 
   Let me show you the abandonment that's going on in the COPS program. This is the number of cops that were hired in 1998. Look at the decline. Look at how many were hired in 2005 and 2006. So the third reason we are here is we are taking up the gauntlet that was, frankly, laid down, put in a box and sealed away by my Republican friends. They said, you know what? Law enforcement is not a local job, it's a national job, we heard in committee. We heard, oh, the program hasn't worked the way it was intended. The fact of the matter is, had it not been for the Democrats taking over this body, had it not been for the chairmanship of Mr. Conyers, this program would be zeroed out this year, too. You know how I know? Because we've had many years where those of us have stood up trying to change this where we were rebuffed again and again. 
   Now, I can't say all of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We've got many, including the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) who is an original sponsor of this. But it is stunning to me that anyone can stand up and say that they support this program after supporting this. 
   In conclusion, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues for passing this. We're going to ask for a recorded vote, and we're going to watch the large number of folks who helped write bills to zero out the COPS program suddenly embrace the idea that we have to put cops on the street. And I welcome my friends on the other side of the aisle to the cause of providing help for local law enforcement.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today at long last. 
   Under new Democratic leadership, the Congress will take up my bill, H.R. 1700, to bring the COPS program back from the scrap heap, back from a point where the program's hiring component has been zeroed out, and restore it to be what it proved to be during the Clinton administration: one of the most successful law enforcement programs in the history of the United States. 
   We are facing a rise in crime in the United States. In a survey of cities large and small, released last month, the Police Executive Research Board found that 71 percent of cities had seen an increase in homicides, 80 percent had seen an increase in robberies, and 67 percent had seen an increase in assaults with guns. Moreover the FBI recently reported that nationwide figures showed that last year, homicides, assaults and other violent offenses grew by 4 percent, and robberies, which are often interpreted as a precursor to more serious crime, jumped by 10 percent. 
   Democrats faced a similar challenge in 1993 when asked about the rise in drug-fueled street crime. 
   Then, Democrats, led by Bill Clinton, answered with the most far reaching and innovative Federal anti-crime initiative ever--the COPS program. It did the most intuitive thing--it hired more than 100,000 beat cops. It worked. It put police in every neighborhood, town and city. Sure, big cities like Chicago and L.A. hired officers with Federal help. But so did small towns like Marengo, IL, and Plano, TX. 
   Now, as crime rises and we work to combat the new challenges our country faces in the wake of 9/11 the COPS program is again the solution. 
   The background is this. The COPS program works. A study by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office recently stated, ``COPS-funded increases in sworn officers per capita were associated with declines in rates of total index crimes, violent crimes, and property crime.'' According to the study, between 1998 and 2000, COPS hiring grants were responsible for reducing crimes by about 200,000 to 225,000 crimes--one third of which were violent. Studies done by the Brookings Institution, the University of Nebraska, Yale and Georgetown Universities, the University of Maryland, and the Urban Institute--among others--found similarly that COPS works. 
   When John Ashcroft spoke about this during his confirmation hearings for Attorney General, he said, ``Let me just say, I think the COPS program has been successful. The purpose of the COPS program was to demonstrate to local police departments that if you put additional police, feet on the street, that crime would be affected and people 
   would be safer and more secure. We believe the COPS program demonstrated that conclusively.'' That is John Ashcroft. 
   When Tom Ridge was sworn in as the Secretary of Homeland Security, he said homeland security starts in our home towns. 
   Over the course of the last 5 years, local law enforcement has become deeply involved in homeland security. Big cities have been forced to upgrade not only their equipment and training but also the type of personnel they hire. Some cities have hired officers exclusively to focus on homeland security--police who work to gather intelligence, analyze terror threats, and monitor our most vulnerable targets. 
   And how have Republicans in Washington responded since coming to office? They have eliminated the program police departments big and small had grown to depend on: COPS Funded at over $1 billion a year at the end of the Clinton administration, President Bush has zeroed out the hiring component of what some believe to have been the most successful law enforcement program in the Nation's history. 
   The bill we are considering today would restore the COPS program and update to the challenges local law enforcement agencies face in the post 9/11 world. 
   This bill breathes new life into the COPS program by authorizing $600 million per year for hiring grants, which could fund up to 50,000 new cops on the beat over the next 6 years. And in an effort to make sure that police departments around the country can use this funding as they need--as terrorism becomes a greater burden on their limited budgets--this bill explicitly enables COPS to provide funding for officers who perform ``intelligence, anti-terror, or homeland security duties.'' 
   The bill also authorizes $350 million per year for COPS technology grants. These grants will allow police agencies to purchase things like laptop computers for patrol cars, crime mapping software, and interoperable communications equipment. 
   And the bill explicitly enables COPS to use funding for ``Troops to Cops'' programs that help returning veterans find employment as law enforcement officers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. CONYERS, the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee, Mr. SCOTT, and the Democratic leadership for bring this bill expeditiously to the floor for passage. 
   I also want to thank Joshua Fay-Hurvitz, Bobby Vassar, Greg Barnes, Mike Volkov, Caroline Lynch, Karas Pattison, Molly Lothamer, and other members of the Democratic, Republican, and Legislative Counsel staffs who have worked so hard to make this day possible. 
   I urge passage of the COPS Improvement Act.

   Mr. WEINER. And I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think one of the many reasons that the American people have turned the Congress over to Democrats is that we have said, like so many Americans, that we don't want to hear just more talk and rhetoric and posturing; that we want to start to actively solve the problems that people face in communities around this country. And whether it be a sheriff's department of two or three officers, or the NYPD which has some 36,000 officers, after today's vote and after it gets passed in the other body, God willing, and signed by the President, we are going to start to do what we need to do to improve homeland security, to reduce drug crime, to reduce the amount of the day-to-day challenges that people face; to hire more officers to go into schools, to get technology so officers can be out on the beat and doing it more. 
   This is a program that, frankly, never should have died. It is a program that I think too many of my friends on the other side just got blood in their eyes over the idea that it was offered under President Clinton, passed under President Clinton and single-handedly brought down crime during those years. That is not a good enough reason. Let us get past that kind of political haze and just realize that sometimes things are successful, even though they are the ideas of someone else. 
   John Ashcroft dissented on several occasions. He said, ``I think the COPS Program has been successful.'' Alberto Gonzales, someone whom I am not prone to quote very often, has said, ``The COPS Program has been beneficial.'' The Oneida County Executive, the former Mayor of Rome, says, ``This program has made a difference,'' a tiny city. John Ashcroft said when testifying before the House of Representatives, ``It has been one of the most successful programs we have ever worked with.'' 
   This is a bipartisan success, because every once in a while around here we get it right. We design a program with a goal in mind, and in this case it was to get the Federal Government off the sidelines. 
   There are many in this body who hold this kind of old-fashioned federalist notion that, you know what,  protecting citizenry is something that only localities do. Well, we realize now in the post-9/11 world that has changed. 
   We are doing something about it, and I commend my colleagues of all stripes for finally joining that bandwagon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of the House a problem that exists, frankly, in all 50 States and is having a dramatic impact not only on individual States but having an impact tragically on our national security--the problem that tobacco excise taxes, which are levied State by State, have had the unwitting result of having a great incentive for people to smuggle tobacco over State lines. This is happening because of a weakness in the Federal law that makes it a misdemeanor to do so. 
   Let me explain to you exactly what happens. In a State like New York, for example, the New York State excise tax for each pack of cigarettes is $2.75. New York City adds another $1.50 to that tax. So the base tax on cigarettes in New York is the combination of $2.75 in the State, $1.50 in the city. 
   If you go to, say, North Carolina or another State that has a lower tax, there's an enormous amount of incentive for someone to buy the tobacco in a State like North Carolina, sell it in New York on the black market, or sell it on the Internet and wind up saving a great deal of money on that float between the two tax rates. 
   Now this is illegal under the Jenkins Act. However, it's hardly ever enforced, and when you ask folks at the ATF why it's not enforced, they say quite simply, because the Jenkins Act is too weak. It only makes it a misdemeanor to do these things. 
   What has become clear in recent months, though, and in recent years, according to the Government Accountability Office, according to the FBI, is that not only are people trying to make a couple of bucks doing this, but terrorist organizations have been funded. 
   According to a GAO investigation, what has happened is that tobacco is being bought in North Carolina where the tax is only five cents a pack and being resold in Michigan where the tax is 75 cents a pack. They're taking that extra 50 cents which, when you consider cases and cases, truckloads and truckloads, and where do the profits go? $1.5 million was shipped overseas to Lebanon to fund Hezbollah. This is just one example.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (TRIBUTE TO THE NEW YORK SUN -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, we have had a great deal of discussion about New York institutions, great institutions that have been around for a very long time, frankly, succumbing to economic pressures, bad regulation, misfortune. But we are in a perilously close position in New York to losing another great New York institution, and that is the newspaper The New York Sun, which has been operating for the better part of 7 years now. 
   It isn't often that someone in our line of work rises to pay tribute to a periodical, particularly one that is frequently quite critical of those of us in public life, but The Sun is a unique New York institution. It is arguably the only newspaper, frankly the only outlet in New York City right now, that is truly covering civic affairs in New York, and doing a very good job of covering civic affairs here in Washington and around the world. 
   For the purpose of making these remarks, I just grabbed at random a copy of The Sun recently and pulled out this copy from September 8th. And I defy any of my colleagues to find a publication in their part of the world, and even the ones that are best known--The New York Times, The Boston Globe, any of them--that has coverage comparable to The New York Sun. 
   Right here is coverage of how Russian war games have begun in the Caribbean, with a long description of how the Monroe Doctrine is entangled; coverage by E.B. Solomont on health care, talking about the challenges facing children's health care in New York and around the country; conversation about arts and fashion. The Arts Section of The Sun provides arts coverage second to no one. They even found some time to put on the front page coverage of sports, Brett Favre's beginning of his career with the New York Jets. 
   Now, you might be thinking this must be a newspaper that has been particularly kind to my point of view, maybe the editorial page has been particularly kind to the values that I share. Very often, if not most of the time, I disagree with their editorial page. But it is always erudite and thorough and gives us a great deal to think about. 
   Not long ago, many readers were shocked to find out what, frankly, we are learning about in a lot of newspapers around the country, it has fallen onto hard times financially. Well, there are many ways that we are going to be called upon to participate in our civic life in this election year. Obviously first and foremost among them is we are going to be asked to vote. But one of the things that all citizens in New York can do--and for those of you who have access to the Internet, you can go to nysun.com and take a look at the newspaper online--one of the things we all can do is engage in our civic debate well-armed with some facts about the issues of the day. 
   There is no better place to get it than The New York Sun. You know, perhaps it is ``old media,'' but it is good, old-fashioned, substantive civic engagement with a balanced coverage and smart coverage. You are going to find things in The Sun that, frankly, the other newspapers gloss over, the other papers pay no attention to. 
   I recently got a lot of attention, and perhaps snickering, by referring to how ``tabloidy'' a lot of the broadsheet newspapers have become in New York City, and I singled out The New York Times for that treatment. Well, frankly, if all newspapers had the level of thoroughness and the level of sophistication and the level of respect that it shows to readers that The Sun does, I think that, frankly, the debate in New York City and around the country would be a lot better off. 
   This is volume 124, number 101. I don't know exactly what those numbers mean. But hopefully for years to come, New Yorkers, American citizens of all stripes, will be able to pick up this newspaper, and I think they will be better for it. 
   Now, while I have the microphone, I should say to any of their editorial page who are listening, you are wrong about 90 percent of the time, and hopefully you will get better over the course of the next 7 years. But, by all means, I am not going to stop reading, and I would encourage all of my neighbors to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to ponder a hypothetical. Imagine for a moment that a small town in your district, whether you represent a rural or urban district or suburban district you can imagine this hypothetical, but it's an unimaginable concept to many of us in the United States. Imagine if a town in that district was hit by a rocket, just landed out of the sky, launched from a neighboring town, or if you're near the border, launched from a neighboring country. Imagine for a moment how you would react as an elected official in that town, imagine for a moment how you would act as a parent of people in that town, imagine how you would act if you were government from that town. 
   Well, for one small town in the southern part of Israel, it's not something they need to imagine. Let me show you a map of Israel and point to a small town called Sderot. It's right down here near the Negev, right along the border of the Gaza Strip. 
   Sderot is a town of 24,000 people. It is not a wealthy town; it's basically a working class town. Like I said, not very big. But in the last 5 years, not one, not two, but 2,000 rockets have landed on that town, all of them launched from the Gaza Strip. 
   Now, as you ponder what it is that you would do, let me tell you a little bit about the effect it has had to the people of Sderot. Eight people have been killed as these qassam rockets have fallen. What is a qassam rocket? A qassam rocket is a fairly primitive rocket that is made out of basically a plumbing pipe with four stabilizers and filled with about a pound or so of shrapnel, that when it explodes, it blows the shrapnel all around. 
   This is a picture of some of the qassam rockets that have landed in Sderot over the last 5 years. This is what the back of the local police station looks like. They keep them all and they mark it when they land. Now, eight people have been killed by these rockets, three of them children, dozens have been wounded. There have been 155 of these rockets landing in this town just since June, when Hamas was elected as the representative party of the people of the West Bank, and some would argue Gaza as well. You see this small strip of land? That's the Gaza Strip. Lobbed one by one by one into this town of Sderot. Well, as you think about how your citizens might deal, let me tell you a little bit about how the citizens of Sderot have dealt. 
   For one thing, when there is any kind of notice that they get, and they have a rather primitive system of lasers that detect when there is heat out in the desert that seems extraordinary, a notice goes to the local police department and then they send out tzeva adom, tzeva adom, which just means ``code red.'' Then you have about 15 seconds. That's how much time the people of Sderot have to respond. They can do a couple of things. They can run into these concrete shells that have been built all throughout town. The way we might have phone booths in our towns, they have concrete structures that are called life shields. They are supposed to pull over or stop their car where they are and run to a building or wall. It's the only part of Israel where it's illegal to wear your seat belt because you have to be able to run out of your car as quickly as possible to avoid the rocket attacks. 
   And kids, of course, they're taught the old 1950s-era American idea of ``duck and cover,'' except when it comes to the children of Sderot, it would be more aptly described as ``duck and suffer.'' One in three children in that town suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. It is not coincidental or accidental that seven rockets landed in that town on the first day of school this past Sunday. There was a rocket attack today. 
   It is hard to find pictures that truly can express what it is like when a rocket falls on an elementary school; but this is a picture that was taken during a rocket attack last year, children essentially cowering in a corner of their school and holding their heads for their lives. 
   You know, it is easy to describe in dry terms what you're supposed to do when a rocket lands on your town, and thank God many of us will never know what that is like. But imagine what it is like when there are hundreds of  them, and now thousands of them over the course of the last couple of years. 
   Now, we here in Washington, we frequently think of things through the lens of what should the government response be. Well, what would your town's government response be if it was attacked by a foreign power day after day after day with rockets? Well, unfortunately for the people of Israel, there isn't a great deal that they can do, particularly since the international community has shown very little concern about the matter. 
   The United Nations, perhaps we can urge them to pass a resolution of condemnation. They've been unwilling to do anything. You might try to figure out what ways you can make your residents more safe. The Israeli Government sent 200 soldiers to this town of 24,000 people to escort their hundreds of kids to school. You might want to try to figure out where they're getting the artillery necessary to be launching these attacks. As you can see here, the border is only with one other country, and that's Egypt. Time and time again there have been found tunnels that lead into the Gaza Strip providing weaponry. You might want to crack down on Egypt to make sure that they stop providing the artillery. 
   But one thing for sure is you would do something. And sooner or later, I think it's fair to say that all of us, if we were put in this circumstance where there was one or even two or three at most rockets falling in our districts, we would demand that something be done. Well, I believe that it is time for those of us in the United States to realize that terrorism falls in all kinds of ways every day that barely gets a notice. 
   When several of these rockets fell in Sderot on the first day of school, you might have missed it in your neighborhood newspaper because it is so commonplace. It should never be, in 2007, commonplace for one nation to lob missiles down on the other. 
   Now, it comes as little surprise that just in the several months that Hamas took over control of the Gaza Strip that there has been an escalation in the number of rockets. But I also think that we need, as a country that is in solidarity with Israel and the many things that they're trying to do, you know, it's not the purpose of this map, but you can see that this is a nation that is surrounded with enemies. On the northern border they face Hezbollah, which declared war across the international border and lobbed weapons upon them in the Lebanese war. 
   You see here they're dealing with problems in the Gaza Strip. Now, I should point out that much of the escalation has happened in the period since Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip. There are no Israeli forces there anymore. Since the Israeli forces left, the rocket attacks have gone up. 
   So what can the Israelis do? Well, I guess they could reoccupy the Gaza Strip, and you can imagine the public condemnation and hue and cry that might occur if that happened. I guess they could try as best they could to track where these rockets are being fired from and try to go in as quickly as possible and counterattack. Well, it's not a very practical thing to do, perhaps they would argue. But one of the things they are considering doing is saying, look, we're going to cut off the power and supply to the Gaza Strip; we're going to make the citizens of Gaza Strip make a choice whether they're going to have terrorists in their midst or not. 
   Well, one thing that we can do, as far away from the front of the Sderot conflict as we are, is we could make it very clear that if we were in the same position, we would not be calling upon ourselves to show great restraint. We would try to figure out how do we solve this problem. 
   And so we, as the United States of America and the State Department, when they call upon Israel, show restraint, show restraint, don't retaliate, maybe that's a reasonable argument after one or two or 10 rockets. Now, I think we have to realize that what Israel is engaged in, what this tiny town is engaged in is playing defense in the war on terrorism every single day without much support and without much help. 
   So I take the floor today with my good friend from Nevada to say that, while we are not being asked to live in a town like Sderot, we should be mindful of the idea that such towns exist in Israel, that it is not just the province of people who live along the Lebanese border that are facing terrorism, it's not just the province of people who drive along the roads even in the inner country of Israel who find themselves being under attack. It's a daily attack on this tiny town. 
   Now, they don't have C-SPAN; I doubt they have C-SPAN in Sderot. But they do listen very carefully when the United States of America, when the Secretary of State, when the President, when elected officials stand up and say, listen, we don't envy the situation that Israel is in, but we understand it. And we understand that retaliation is sometimes a difficult thing to contemplate, but sometimes it's necessary. We know that if we were put in the same position and suddenly the good folks in Canada started lobbing missiles over the New York border, I would be demanding that we respond. If the folks who live in Arizona or Texas started getting attacked with missiles coming over the border, certainly none of us would be saying, show forbearance. 
   If these children were being forced to cower at rocket attacks day after day after day in any town in the United States, we would understand perfectly well that something needed to be done to stem the tide. But there are other things we can do. We can say we are not going to continue to be a supporter of Egypt, as we have, if they continue to allow their nation to be essentially a wide open font for terrorist activities. We are going to understand that, while it was every right, and sometimes I'm criticized for making this image, it's every right of the people of the Palestinian territories to choose to elect Hamas as their leaders, but it is also the right of the international community to say that this is what we expected would happen. We would have an increase in the international terrorism that emerged from the Gaza Strip, and now it has happened. And if we had a terrorist government in Canada, we wouldn't hesitate for a moment to see it as a threat to our security. 
   We can also understand that the people of Sderot's fight is all of our fight. When the United Nations is, resolution after resolution, condemning Israel for its heavy hand in this or its heavy hand in that, when it convenes a conference to talk about the plight of the Palestinians, putting aside the plight of the Israelis, they do a disservice to the basic common sense about who it is that is doing the attacking, who it is that is launching the missiles and who it is that is on the other side.     
   The other thing that we can do is make sure that weapons like this are never armed with high-tech guidance systems. Right now, the administration is putting the final touches on a plan to present to the United States Congress that would sell missile guidance systems, $20 million worth, to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has been one of the foremost advocates for Hamas in the world. They fund them. They support them. They provide them aid and comfort. 
   Imagine for a moment if these missiles weren't being lobbed relatively indiscriminately in the direction of schools, hospitals, shopping centers and synagogues, but imagine if they had laser guidance systems provided to the Saudis and then leaked to them, because that is what happens in that part of the world. Imagine this number of rockets that are hitting people and installations and churches, well, synagogues and not just falling to the Earth. 
   We can stop that sale. We in Congress can stop that sale. And we should do everything we can to do so. Ms. Berkley and I circulated a letter that over 115 Members of Congress signed onto saying this is a bad idea to be selling weapons, high-tech weapons, to the foremost exporter of terrorism in the world. But tonight when we lay down our heads, we should know that not far away, 2,000 miles away in Sderot, children are going to be walking to school, and most likely if tomorrow is like today was, they are going to hear a siren go off. They are going to hear a voice over the loudspeakers saying in Hebrew, ``condition red, condition red'' which meant that they have to go find cover somewhere. Imagine raising your child in that kind of environment.  Imagine the outrage that you would feel as a parent or resident of that town. 
   We should never forget that we are not going to be safe just because we don't have rockets falling on us every single day. So long as there are entities in the world that find comfort in being able to do that day in and day out, we all suffer. We admire Israel for what it does. It is probably the last remaining country besides the United States of America that every day is trying to fight terrorism. Our friends in Europe turn it on and turn it off as they might be willing to. Frankly, it is the United States and Israel every day. 
   But as much as we fight and as much as we invest in resources, as much as we honor the men and women of the armed services, 150,000 fighting for us in Iraq and Afghanistan, imagine if every single day we weren't having to go out and fight that fight, but it was landing in our community. That should be the lens that we look at this conflict through. There are complications. It is a nuanced and difficult thing. It is difficult trying to persuade people who are democracies in Lebanon, democracies in the West Bank and Gaza, that they shouldn't be voting for people whose campaign slogan is ``I want to drive Israel into the sea.'' It is discouraging. 
   It is complicated when you have a nation like Jordan for whom many of these people would consider their home country and have them take little responsibility for those people who are in the West Bank, as well as for those people who are in Gaza. It is a difficult, complicated part of the world. But there are some things that are immutable. And I would hope that we would all agree that one of the immutable things is that under no circumstance should any country have to withstand tens and tens, and hundreds, eventually thousands of rocket attacks on its land just because it is a small town and just because most people have never heard of it. My colleague, Congressman Wexler, and I had a long debate about how to pronounce it. He said ``Sderot.'' I said ``Sderot.'' It is unclear. It was written originally in Hebrew. It probably appears in the Bible somewhere. Perhaps we can find an authority on that. 
   These are not the most influential people even in Israel. But it is troubling to me. I think I speak for my colleague, Ms. Berkley, that day in and day out these attacks happen, and none of us even notice any more. Well, the children and the adults and the people of that community notice. They notice. They are traumatized by it. I think it is our obligation as citizens of the world to say that while you can have different viewpoints about where borders should be and you can have different viewpoints about the relative gripes of the Palestinians or the gripes of Hamas or who should prevail, Fatah or Hamas, or whether or not the Egyptians are doing enough, or whether or not the Syrians are doing enough, or whether or not they are all just exporting terrorism in one form or the other, I would hope that we could agree that it is an international abomination that this is allowed to happen. 
   I would be glad to yield to my colleague from Nevada.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Reclaiming my time, I think you have raised the essential question, why is it that people are attacking Sderot? What is the great political fight that is going on that leads people to be launching missiles out of Gaza into Sderot? 
   There was once upon a time a conflict over whether or not Israel should be occupying this territory. They are not. What is it now that the fight is over? What is it, now that Hamas has been elected and there has been this dramatic increase in them, what is the objective of those people who are committing these acts of terrorism? It is no longer a border dispute. The Gaza strip, the Israelis have said okay, it is yours. Take it. Take it and control it, govern it, be responsible for it on your own. 
   It also raises another question. Hamas was elected in the West Bank and Gaza. This notion that they only control the Gaza, the West Bank is under someone else's control, remember now, this is a new government under a democracy, and I largely have agreed with the President when he has said, you know, democracy is a virtue that we should try to encourage throughout the world. 
   Well, while there is a lot of complaints you can make about the people that they chose, this was a pretty free and clear election. No one has accused them of cooking the books or stealing the election. If anything, Fattah was in control of more of the apparatus, they should have won. 
   So now Hamas has been elected and there has been a dramatic increase of attacks. These are the numbers just since June. Every week, 7, 14, 12. This is a week. This is not over the course of a month, this is just over the course of each week how much there has been. And the question has to be, what is now the fight over? What is it that the terrorists, what is it that Hamas, what is it the people here are trying to do? 
   Well, could it be could it be that the people here in Gaza are always going to attack the citizens of Israel. What is then the logical extension our policy? It is fine to say, all right, let's try to figure it out. The Saudis have put forth this plan and said let's return the country to the 1967 borders. Maybe that is the solution. 
   Well, the Lebanese border is no longer under contest. The United Nations decided where the line should be. Israel said you are wrong, but we are going to observe your line. 
   The Palestinians said the Gaza Strip is ours. The Israelis said, well, we don't believe you can secure it and it won't be safe for us to leave, but we are going to leave anyway. So now you have people crossing over from Lebanon and taking prisoners and declaring war. You have the Palestinians electing a terrorist organization and increasing the amount of attacks. 
   What is it they want? This is not, my colleagues, a basic border dispute any more. Now you can only conclude if they are attacking a small town of 22,000 people just because they can, that their objective is going to be under every circumstance, whenever given the opportunity, they are going to attack. 
   Now, I don't say that to drag us into a larger discussion about what the ultimate solution to this challenge is, except to say for many Americans who look at this part of the world and don't see the nuances, they say can't they just work something out there? Just kind of find a border that works for everyone. 
   Well, Sderot is nowhere near the border here. It has never been under Palestinian control, ever.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. That is probably right. But the point is, to be serious here, we have heard a great deal here recently about the upcoming meetings that are going to be going on with foreign secretaries to try to resolve and prop up Abu Mazen, who is the leader of the Fattah faction that lost the election, but who many people in the United States, and many people in the world community, feel is kind of a better choice than Hamas. 
   Whether or not he is or isn't or whether or not he speaks for anyone or not, it is beyond dispute that Hamas holds sway in the Gaza Strip. It is also beyond dispute that they won for reasons that can be explained a lot of 
   different ways. They won. They are the representative people of the Palestinians. We may like Abu Mazen more, but he doesn't seem to speak for as many people. 
   But before I yield to the gentlewoman, I just want to point out that for people who say well, maybe if Israel left the Gaza Strip to Palestinian control, this would be resolved. As the gentlewoman from Nevada pointed out, been there, done that. And, remember, many people argued that it would be a mistake for the Israelis to acquiesce to the Palestinians' request because they would just use this as a launching ground for terrorism. 
   Well, those people turned out to be right, and, unfortunately, rather than saying okay, we are going to accept this as our Nation and we are going to show that we can sustain ourselves and not be a hostile neighbor, it has instead led to this, which is a dramatic increase in the amount of attacks that have gone on since the Palestinians took over the province of their own area.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Let me just reclaim my time briefly and just make one or two points. 
   When I posited in the introduction to this special order the idea, well, what would you do if you were faced with this kind of challenge? Well, imagine, if you can, that you were able to build a wall tall enough into the sky to intercept any of those rockets. You would say jackpot. We figured out a way to do it. It is not pleasant, it is not nice, but we figured out a way. Or a giant net to catch them all. 
   Well, they didn't have indiscriminate missile attacks coming from this part of the Palestinian territories. They had human beings who had strapped armaments around their waist filled with ball bearings and nails, and they had them walk into cafes and walk into discotheques and blow themselves up and everyone near them. 
   So Israel, after trying to detect them as best they could and stop them as best they could, and having remarkable success as doing that, found that, you know, what, we don't like doing this, but let's build a wall, a fence in some cases, a wall in other parts of it, to stop people from just walking across. 
   Well, it is the equivalent of trying to catch those missiles, and it makes a certain amount of common sense. It is a terrible message and a terrible sign and you hate to do it for your neighbor, just the same way if you were living next door to someone to build a high concrete wall between you and your neighbor. You would never want to do it, unless they started walking across into your lawn and blowing you and your family up. 
   So they went and they constructed this wall. Do you know, I say rhetorically, because I know the gentlewoman from Nevada knows, the amount of international hue and cry that went on, how outrageous it was for the Israelis? Even our government said they were opposed to the idea of building this security fence. 
   Well, it has been successful. They have figured out a way, albeit not the best possible way. The best possible way is to say the people of the West Bank, the people of Gaza, you want your own state. We want you to have your own state. The United States does. The Israeli government does. A recent poll showed that 87 percent of the population of Israel said we want the Palestinians to have their own state. But if every time you cede more responsibility to the territories it leads to more violence, it makes you long for a solution.     
   So what is the solution? Well, the most ideal solution is for the Palestinians, as you say, to stand up and say, look, we have high-rises here in Gaza City. We are living not very good lives here. We have been cut off from the international world because the source of our economic activities is being good neighbors to everyone else in the world. Israel and Egypt both went up economically the moment they signed the Camp David Accords because they realized that international cooperation, although not a great love, but international cooperation leads to benefits for everyone. 
   So the people of Gaza have to say, look, what is it that it is getting us? We are terrorizing our neighbors, but to what end? Eventually the Israelis are going to have to say something. The Israelis are deliberating now on what steps to take. Can you blame them if they say, we are going to cut off all electricity to the city until it stops? Can you blame them if they say, we are going to close off all border crossings until it stops? You can't possibly blame the Israeli Government for whatever they do to protect the people of Sderot. 
   But the objective should not be what kind of defensive, and you know that the Israelis are now experimenting with not one but two antimissile systems to try to stop them. It is billions of dollars. 
   When I visited Israel last week, the defense minister was saying, I am not satisfied with having one antimissile system. We may need to have two of them to protect them both from the Lebanese border and from the rockets coming in on Sderot. 
   But the real solution is for the Palestinian people and the international community to say, look, if you want to live side by side as a two-state community, let's get to talking about how to do that. If your objective is to have nonstop violence, then you act the way you are, the way Hamas and their supporters are acting in Gaza. You just keep doing acts of war over and over again. The Israeli people, God bless them, whenever there is a hint of a possibility of a chance of some kind of a negotiated settlement, they pursue it.

   Mr. WEINER. And then the question has to be raised, as much good intention as Secretary of State Rice and the administration may have here, having sit-downs and negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas and trying to present him with aid and trying to make his government or the idea that his thoughts or actions would be better for the Palestinian people, does that bring us one inch closer to stopping the attacks on Sderot? Does it do anything to truly enforce the idea that Gaza is under control? And the people voted for them. And by the way, this notion that they just carried, this is not like an electoral college map, they just carried Gaza, they have broad support throughout the West Bank as well.

   Mr. WEINER. But I have to say to the gentlelady, this notion that it was a response to corruption, when someone campaigns and gives you a flyer, vote for me and I am going to wipe out the State of Israel, and then the moment they get in, they increase the amount of attacks going on, at a certain point you have to say this is not about who is going to fix the potholes. They are doing exactly what they said. 
   It might be true that message took hold in an environment where Fatah was corrupt, but I think we in some ways let them off the hook a little bit. They did campaign on the idea of driving Israel into the sea.

   Mr. WEINER. But I think it is important to realize that we hear it just about every day out of the State Department, and this is true under Democratic administrations as well, Israel must show restraint. Every time there is an attack we hear that, Israel must show restraint. 
   Imagine if there were two attacks in New Jersey or in Pennsylvania. Imagine if there was one, and imagine if al Qaeda had just won the elections in Toronto and these attacks started, would any of us say we have to show restraint?

   Mr. WEINER. I believe that Israel has shown restraint the likes of which I don't think we have seen a nation on Earth ever show. If you think of the sheer number of attacks they have withstood over the course of time, putting aside the 2,000 or so in Sderot, forbearance has been the bottom line. 
   But I think if you want to truly solve this problem, first you have to let the Israelis do what they need to do to protect this tiny town.

   Mr. WEINER. Also, you have to recognize when you look at these borders, no one, not even Hamas says the West Bank is still occupied. Israel left, and now there is no other explanation for the activity except to say that one of the things that they are doing is living up to their campaign promise. 
   This isn't the subject of rhetoric. Our colleague from Pennsylvania who has joined us saw this stockpile. This is the police station in Sderot. This is what they have in the back. You can see a little bit in the photographs, they mark taunts, Hebrew taunts on all of the rockets before they send them. This is essentially a pipe you can get down at a hardware store, four wings that stabilize it, and then there is essentially a pound and a half of armaments in the tip, just enough to kill and terrorize wherever it lands.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. I thank the gentleman. It should also be pointed out that Sderot is becoming something of a ghost town, and more and more people are leaving the city. It is not a wealthy town. It doesn't have great industry. It was one of those places that makes Israel the nation that it is. A lot of North Africans have moved in there. It is a place of great diversity. You would be surprised seeing some of the faces that they are Israelis. 
   You also realize very quickly, one of the most stunning things to recent visitors, is what a tiny spit of land it really is. This neck of land, it is not far that you are going to be able to go. 
   When they had the Lebanese war, and Hezbollah had much more sophisticated weaponry, we had weapons that were going this far south. You have these that go this far north. There aren't too many places to go. There have been suicide bombings all throughout this area. There aren't too many places you can run. 
   So saying to the residents of Sderot, why don't you just leave, it ignores the fact that there aren't too many places. You essentially have one nation, as we all know, that is at war with 20 of her neighbors. This is not a peaceful neighborhood. 
   But the question arises, you don't get a chance to think about it when you are raising kids in that town and trying to figure out how to keep them safe. We spoke to a schoolteacher when I visited there a year ago, and that teacher tells the story of having 10-year-old kids having to take tranquilizers in the morning because it is a traumatizing experience to get up in the morning. 
   While there is some randomness to where the weapons hit, there is not a randomness to the time of day. They launch them during the mornings when the kids are on the way to school and in the afternoon when they are coming back from school, and they have a particular fondness for Sabbath and for  holidays. There was a synagogue that was blown up right after morning prayers on a Saturday morning. 
   What is it that we should learn from this about going forward what our strategy should be? Well, for one thing, this tiny tract of land is where the weapons are coming through. They are not coming through Israel or through the Mediterranean Sea; although, there were one or two cases in years past where boats were intercepted, but we have a pretty sophisticated understanding what goes on here. It is coming through tunnels from Egypt. 
   So we should be saying to Egypt, for a country that gets $3.5 billion in aid every year, we should say to them, enough is enough. Until you show the ability to get control of this border, we are not going to provide any of our aid in the form of military. You want humanitarian assistance, that's fine. 
   Secondly, the last thing we want to have is for these to be tipped with laser-guided systems like the ones being proposed to that part of the world. We can't let that technology seep into the region so these now have precision guidance. 
   Finally, we have to say to the United Nations and to the international community: What more do you want the Israelis to do? They have left. They have left that part of the world. What is it that you are demanding they do? 
   I would say to the people who sponsor these resolutions in the United Nations condemning Israel, okay, picture yourself as being the chief administrative officer of a government who is getting attacked by thousands of rockets; what do you propose they do? A giant net in the sky? They tried building a wall and a fence here, and they were criticized for that. 
   From a policy perspective, and ``restraint'' is a nice and vague term, what we should be doing is saying to the Israelis, you need to protect yourselves, and we should be leading the charge at the United Nations to consider this international acts of war. They are a democracy. They are a freestanding government. These are acts of war. I think that the Israelis would be well within their rights to respond however they would like. 
   The final thing we have to do, and if some of my southern colleagues were here, they would come up with an interesting colloquialism on how to say this.     
   But I hate to be a fly in the ointment about this whole idea of propping up Mahmoud Abbas. If Mahmoud Abbas has any ability to stop these rockets from launching from Gaza into Sderot, let him start to do something about it today. We keep hearing about this international conference and coming up with agreements and giving him money. I don't understand what possible good it's going to do when Fatah has no authority and no control over this part of the world.

   Mr. WEINER. Well, in conclusion, our time is expired, but I want to thank the gentlewoman from Nevada and the gentleman from Pennsylvania for joining us here today, and I just would close with this. 
   There are big, complicated conflicts that are going on in that part of that world. They're not going to be easy to resolve. For years, we've been watching with some level of success but a great deal of failure, but just imagine the circumstances if tomorrow, when you dropped off your kids at school, a couple of times during the day they'd have to look like this rather than studying their school books. Imagine if an 8, 9, 10-year-old child had to be on tranquilizers in order to get through the day. 
   There are some things that just are without any political nuance, without any varnish, and are just wrong. What's going on in Sderot is just wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. I thank the gentlelady for this time and for her leadership. This is an issue that you would think, from around the country when people gaze upon the memorials that will take place on September 11, for most Americans to realize how many people who responded that day are not being cared for, they would be stunned and surprised. 
   We have a great many ideological debates that go on in this Chamber. We have a great many arguments about philosophy and what government should or should not do. 
   It should be the source of no contention, it should be the source of no real  debate, that people who rushed to help their fellow citizens on that day, whether they be at Ground Zero or the fields of Pennsylvania, whether they be at the Pentagon, those people should be honored, of course, but they also should be cared for. 
   And yet years later, day by day, victims of September 11 are dying. It is easy for us to remember, those of us from New York, about how that day was such a heart-wrenching day and how it was also uplifting to see how many Americans, like the gentlelady said earlier, people drove from miles around. The West Side Highway was largely closed, and parked on the sides of the roads were license plates from all around the country of people who said I am going to go and try to help. 
   What that help consisted of in the weeks after September 11 was standing on a pile of rubble with buckets and paper masks and people lifting large pieces of stone and the rubble trying desperately to find anyone who could be saved. 
   If we fast-forward to today, you realize many of those people are dying. They are dying difficult deaths. It has been argued by some that we don't know exactly what the cause of those deaths are. Well, that is not true. A lot of the monitoring has been done. A lot of the studies that have been done by medical experts in New York City and the hospitals in the area, we know with some certitude what happened, and the things we are finding in the lungs of those that are dying is very clear that it came from that horrific day. 
   We also have heard from some who say we don't know how expensive this could be. It could be untold millions and millions of dollars. Well, the first thing is to try to get some sense of responsibility, and I believe it is largely a Federal responsibility, and I think that debate, frankly, belittles the strength of the Federal Government and the idea that this was an attack on our Federal Government. 
   But we do have some sense of what the costs are going to be. Now we need to start to say one final thing. We know what the cost is to some degree. We know what the cause is with near certitude. We are going to accept the responsibility to take care of these people. It seems to me intuitive, and yet here we are 6 years later still having this discussion. And I think, as I said earlier, we can have large discussions about how you provide health care in this country, and I am willing to engage in that. We can have discussions about how we should make our country safer so we don't have a September 11 again. We should have those types of discussions. 
   But as long as we can all embrace the idea this is the responsibility of government to take care of these people because they did not run to that pile waving their Blue Cross/Blue Shield card or waving their Medicare card or waving their union membership, they just showed up and did what they were asked to do. Sometimes they did much more than they were asked to do. 
   I firmly believe that many of those who are dying today, even if they knew that if they did it again they would die, they would still do it. That was the kind of sense, that was the kind of pathos that existed that day. People were so eager to do whatever they could, they were willing to make sacrifices. 
   But the question becomes: Should we let them pay that price? Should we let them, day by day, as we just 
   saw yesterday, two more police officers died from 9/11-related diseases, should we let it happen? And the answer is ``no.'' 
   I want to end the way I began, by offering my congratulations and thanks to the gentlelady from New York. 
   This is a difficult issue, because as much as people would like to say that they are doing everything to honor those victims of September 11, we know in this Chamber that there are some people who are steadfastly pushing back every single day. And Mr. Nadler and the gentlewoman from New York, and many members of the New York delegation, but none more than the two of them, have fought every day to keep this on the front burner. 
   Every year now on September 11, we are going to cast our memory time immemorial back to September 11, 2001. Let this be the last year we have to mark this day by pointing out the shoddy treatment of those who rushed to Ground Zero to volunteer. 
   I know that the gentlelady has communicated this to Speaker Pelosi and she has been very supportive of this. Let's hope we can find the type of bipartisan consensus that is truly reflected in this country in paying honor to the memory of those that were lost and paying honor to the sacrifice of those still with us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate my friend, the gentleman from West Virginia, on his legislation that substantially reforms the governance of hardrock mining on public lands. 
   Abandoned mine sites pose serious environmental and safety hazards. Currently, there are more than 80 hardrock abandoned mines or mine-related sites on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List. Polluters should pay to clean up the pollution they leave behind. 
   I would like to have a colloquy with the gentleman from West Virginia to clarify the use of federally appropriated funds from the Hardrock Reclamation Account under sections 411, 412 and 413 of the bill. 
   Does the gentleman from West Virginia agree that moneys in the Hardrock Reclamation Account shall not be provided in a manner that reduces the financial responsibilities of any party that is responsible or potentially responsible for contamination on any real property?

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, the House has under consideration the bill H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2007. Mr. Chairman, I want to highlight an amendment that I offered which has been included in Chairman OBERSTAR's amendment before the House. It directs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study of the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York underground oil spill at Newtown Creek. 
   Newtown Creek is a 3.5 mile-long waterway that flows from the East River and separates the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. It is the single most polluted waterway in New York City, a legacy left by more than a century of heavy industrial activity. The creek's banks are home to the largest oil spill in the United States, which dates back to the 1950s and is estimated to be 150 percent of the size of the Exxon-Valdez spill. 
   In 1978, a Coast Guard patrol detected petroleum on the surface of Newtown Creek and identified a spill that spreads from the banks of the creek through the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn. Evaluations at that time identified a spill totaling 17 million gallons attributed to refineries operated along the banks of the creek by the predecessors to ExxonMobil, BP/Amoco and Chevron-Texaco. To date, 9.4 million gallons have been cleaned, primarily conducted by ExxonMobil under a 1990 consent agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that sets no timetable for completion and includes no meaningful criteria for compliance. Estimates indicate that it will take until at least 2026 to finish the remediation, almost 50 years since we discovered the spill. 
   Today, even though it has been 30 years since the oil spill was detected, the best information on the spill's size are estimates. While we have evidence that the spill is 17-30 million gallons, covering 55 to 70 acres, the full-extent of the spill remains unknown. 
   This information is critical. More than 200 observation wells and 35 recovery wells have been installed since 1978, but until we know the full extent of the problem, we may be wasting time. 
   In 2006, Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency to revisit the findings of the United States Coast Guard's July 1979 report entitled ``Investigation of Underground Accumulation of Hydrocarbons along Newtown Creek.'' The 2006 study did not collect new data, determine the size or location of the spill, or conclusively assess its impact on public health and safety. It recommended reevaluating the entire plume. 
   Given this, the provision included in Chairman OBERSTAR's amendment instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a full-site characterization of the Greenpoint, Brooklyn underground oil spill. 
   This study is to be driven by the collection of new field evidence and will not be limited to the review or co-review of existing or scheduled data collection by private parties or state and municipal entities. This new evidence includes the collection of data from new product, groundwater and soil monitoring wells, as well as from existing groundwater and soil monitoring wells at the Greenpoint Oil Spill site. This site is loosely bound by Newtown Creek on the northeast, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway on the east and south, North Henry Street on the west, and Greenpoint Avenue on the north. 
   Specifically, the full-site characterization is to include: 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of the free-product plume, or the portion of the underground petroleum plume that floats on top of the site's groundwater in its refined state or crude state, including any historic remnants currently distinct or fragmented from current spill delineations. 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of the dissolved phase of the plume, or the portion of the underground petroleum plume that has dissolved into the groundwater, including the geographic extent and concentrations of groundwater contamination. 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of soil contamination, including current and historic smear zones, or the area of soil contamination that may exist within the zone of horizontal and vertical water table fluctuations that have occurred since the time of the petroleum release. 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of soil vapor contamination, including vertical and horizontal pathways within the vadose zone, or the area between the land surface and the water table. 
   The evaluation of the entire spill area, covering both the free-product and dissolved plume, using three-phase numerical modeling techniques simulating the movement and interaction of water, oil, and vapor in a geologic medium, and use of such model to make an estimate on the length of time that will be required to recover free product, contaminated groundwater and contaminated soil from the underground plumes. 
   The investigation and collection of data on monthly groundwater levels over a representative area of the free product and dissolved phase contamination areas to establish background water levels. 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on current and historic groundwater pathways in the region. 
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the impact of tidal fluctuations on groundwater levels in the region.  
   The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on seepage of free product and dissolved phase groundwater into Newtown Creek along the full spill area shoreline. 
   Chemical analysis and description of the oil product in the Newtown Creek region in its free product phase, its dissolved phase, and its smeared phase. 
   An investigation of reports of oil in building foundations in the area of Roebling Street and North Eleventh Street in Brooklyn, New York, to determine whether those oil pockets are distinct from the Greenpoint Oil Spill, are historic remnants of the Greenpoint Oil Spill, or remain hydrologically connected to the Greenpoint Oil Spill. 
   A detailed, three-dimensional representation reflecting the latitudinal and longitudinal location of the oil spill in the Newtown Creek region and also the observed and corrected thickness of the spill. 
   A revised estimate of the volume and area of the spill in its three phases: free product, polluted groundwater, and smeared soils, and evaluate the remaining plume volume using corrected product thickness values. 
   There is no geographic limit to the study. Testing is to be performed at potential, historic migration pathways and currently or newly detected product and groundwater contamination areas near the Greenpoint oil spill. The study will begin with areas to the north, south, southeast, and east of the current published spill location. Emphasis is to be placed on the path the spill may have taken when it was subject to hydrologic pressures related to groundwater withdrawals in the early-to-mid part of the 20th Century. 
   As outlined in the amendment, this study is to be completed no later than one year after enactment of this law. 
   I would like to express my thanks to Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman CUMMINGS for their willingness to work with me on this project. Furthermore, I would like to commend Mrs. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, who represents the people of Greenpoint, and has worked closely with me on this initiative. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank the staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittees on Water Resources and Environment and Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, particularly Ryan Seiger, John Cullather, Lucinda Lessley, and Ben Webster, who have worked with me to address this critical, but often overlooked, issue. 
   I'd also like to thank Riverkeeper Incorporated, and its chief investigator, Basil Seggos. This organization's dedication and advice on remediating the Newtown Creek oil spill over the last six years has been an invaluable asset. 
   Finally, I'd like to thank Dori Friedberg of my staff for her time, work, and counsel on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their hard work shepherding through the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2007, and express my strong support for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (PREVENT ALL CIGARETTE TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the full committee for not only his sponsorship of the legislation, but the great work of him and his staff to try to bring this to the floor. It's kind of a complicated issue. 
   You know, we accept it as an article of faith that cigarette smoking is down in this country. We believe that because, as you look at the taxes paid in the 50 States and the various cities, there has been a decline. But a lot of information really leads us to believe that that might not be true at all, that all we're really seeing a reduction of is a reduction of the amount of taxes that are getting paid to the various States. And that is because, as both Mr. Smith and Mr. Scott have pointed out, more and more States are levying more and more State taxes on cigarettes. It's almost an easy thing to do. You know, some have commented that State governments are addicted to tobacco taxes. It has gotten to be so much that in New York City, for example, if you are a smoker--which I'm not--you pay an additional $4.25 per pack compared to South Carolina, where you pay an additional 7 cents a pack in State taxes. 
   Well, what I just described is, in a nutshell, the incentive for smugglers. They can buy cigarettes at a very low tax rate, sell them in a higher tax rate locality and be able to make money on the vig. Well, you might say to yourself, isn't that against the law? It is. It is against the law for anyone to buy cigarettes and not pay the tax of their locality. But there is no way for authorities to know that for sure. But we have some signs and some statistics that show that it's happening in record numbers.  
   I will give you an example. In just my State of New York, 280 million packs of cigarettes were sold on Native American reservations. In 2006, it's 360 million. If you take the number of residents on Native American reservations and do the math and assume that those cigarettes are being smoked just on the reservation, that would mean 44 cigarettes an hour for every Native American in the country over the age of 18, or basically a cigarette a minute. So that's not happening. 
   What is really happening is that more and more people are buying cigarettes on the Internet, they're not reporting that they're buying them on these Web sites, which are by and large on Native American lands, and they're not paying taxes on it. And that's what's happened. Now, not only is this a great source of great revenue loss to States--my home State of New York estimates anywhere from hundreds of millions to as much as a billion dollars of lost revenue--but according to the Government Accountability Office, it might be used, as so many other smuggling operations are, for things more than just illicit activity, but terrorism. 
   It was found in a GAO investigation that there was a group that was buying cigarettes in North Carolina, smuggling them to Michigan, taking the money that they were making by selling them on the streets of Michigan, and then using the money to fund Hezbollah operations. That was just one investigation, one prosecution. 
   Now, as I've said earlier, it's already against the law to do many of these things, so why aren't there more prosecutions? Well, right now violations of the Jenkins Act, which is the prosecution that this would be under that say this type of activity is illegal, are misdemeanors. So even if you are a U.S. attorney and you say I really want to crack down on this and you wait outside and you try to do a sting, really the most you can hope for is a misdemeanor prosecution. One of the things this legislation does is makes it a felony. 
   A second thing that it does is it closes perhaps the largest truck-size loophole in the law, it allows people to buy cigarettes on the Internet. Now, because of the actions of New York, DHL, FedEx, UPS, they all say we no longer are going to allow anyone to transport cigarettes. 
   The only entity that still transports cigarettes is the United States Postal Service. They have come to Congress and said, if you want to ban us transporting tobacco, you've got to tell us by law. We can't do it. Effectively, that's what this legislation does. 
   Now, just to make it very clear, if you want to purchase cigarettes online, what is supposed to happen is the Internet carrier is supposed to then take a document, mail it to your home State and say that Anthony Weiner purchased X number of cases, then you're supposed to pay taxes on it. That never happens. States that have done stings know it has never happened and the ATF says it doesn't happen. Now that is going to be required, otherwise, you're not going to be able to do any transporting of tobacco at all. And finally, it requires the same type of age verification that we have for other things on the Internet. 
   This is a commonsense thing that I think is going to mean that we can really make sure States get the revenues, we can make sure that the black market in tobacco is eliminated, and frankly, we can make sure that the ATF has the tools they need to crack down on this. 
   This legislation is a long time in coming. It would not have been possible, as I said earlier, if it were not for the help of the ranking minority member of the full committee, the Chair of the subcommittee, the members and the staff who have done a remarkable job; on the full committee side, Perry Apelbaum and Ted Kalo, on the minority side, Sean McLaughlin, the chief of staff and general counsel on the minority side; Ameer Gopalani, who is the counsel on the subcommittee, Jesselyn McCurdy, who is another counsel. And on the minority side, Kimani Little and Caroline Lynch. Also, towards the end, to help us deal with many of the jurisdictional matters that we had, Congressman Waxman and the ranking member of the Government Oversight and Reform Committee, his staff director, Phil Barnett, Naomi Seiler, the counsel, Robin Appleberry, folks who worked very late into the night last night to help to make this happen. Congressman McHugh's staff, who has been very active on this, Rob Taub, his Chief of staff; Joe Dunn, Jonathan Schleifer and Dori Friedberg of my staff. These are all people who helped make this happen. 
   Now, I would say, before I yield back, as with so many things, this is a relatively easy fix that we were able to work in a bipartisan fashion to make happen. 
   None of this is worth anything unless the folks on the other side of this building finally start to legislate, finally start to take some of these things that passed by overwhelming margins, things like the COPS bill we passed in our committee, and others, that we've managed to cross the partisan divide and do good government. And I would hope that my colleagues in the Senate at some point awaken and decide to start passing some of this legislation. If they do that, it would be greatly appreciated. 
   I also want to point out that, to all of the groups that have been so active in trying to make this a reality, and it's a disparate bunch, Altria--I guess previously Phillip Morris--Sara and John--I can't read their last name--the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, National Association of Attorneys General, the American Wholesale Marketers, New York State Association of Wholesale Marketers--Artie Katz with them, these are disparate groups who don't agree on very much. And we have worked out a bill that I think passes not only bipartisan muster, but has enlightened elements of the industry involved. 
   And I should make one final point. There is a good deal of byplay going on in the 50 States about the rights of Native Americans dealing with their State governments. We say very clearly in this legislation, we are not seeking to litigate that at this time. There are two contradictory Supreme Court decisions that are out there, there are many different interpretations. We make it very clear here that what we're seeking to do is to empower the Federal authorities to operate where they're allowed to, the State authorities only to operate where they are. But I think that because of the support of the National Association of Attorneys General, folks like my State and the active advocacy of organizations and journalists like those at the New York Post, who have been beating the drum on this, we are going to finally get this done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Madam Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, our bipartisan efforts to isolate terrorism and terrorists and to find a lasting and secure peace in the Middle East got two setbacks this week from sadly predictable sources. 
   First, the United Nations appointed a human rights inspector by the name of Richard Falk whom my hometown newspaper, the Daily News, correctly called ``the nutty professor'' because of his position, as he goes into this job of overseeing human rights, that the Israelis are like Nazis. This is who they appoint to try to come to a peaceful human rights conclusion in that part of the world. 
   And then, sadly, we had another chapter in how not to be a former President from Jimmy Carter who goes to the Middle East, and rather than trying to pursue peace, embraces Hamas, the organization responsible for hundreds of rockets falling in Israel. 
   It is hard to imagine two institutions or two people that could be more of a setback than these two. The United Nations once again shows that they are unfit for their role of trying to find a moderate and lasting peace in that part of world. And, sadly, Jimmy Carter continues to write a chapter about how not to be a former President.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (REAUTHORIZATION OF THE COPS PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, the time has come for the United States Senate to free the COPS program. We here in this body, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, voted to reauthorize the single greatest legislative weapon frankly ever passed by Congress to help reduce crime. 
   It reauthorized the highly successful COPS program, authorizing the hiring of another 50,000 new cops, authorizing hiring of special terrorism cops for cities like New York that have cops that specialize simply in combating terrorism. 
   Now, that same bill is held hostage in the Senate, frankly, by my Republican colleagues. The time has come for us to realize that if there has been one program that has been democratic, with a small D, meaning it's had beneficial effects all throughout the country, it's been the COPS program. Whether it's a small sheriff's department or a large police department like New York City, the program has been a success. 
   We should keep on pushing. There are a lot of things we disagree on, but frankly, this should be one that unifies us. This will give us a chance to modernize this program, get some money into the pipeline in States and localities so that they can go ahead and hire more police officers and continue the successes we have had reducing crime.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, this can't possibly be the best they have got. This can't be. I cannot imagine that a party that governed for the last 12-some-odd years, who had a Congress that met less days than the do-nothing Congress, who wasted billions of dollars in the Iraq war doing no oversight, drove up the deficit to record heights, wasted homeland security funds, it can't possibly be that the best that party has is to now devote an afternoon talking about the security arrangements for the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. 
   Well, let's talk a little bit about what we have. Putting aside for a moment, which apparently is what the other side wants, putting aside for a moment the bill we are here to debate, which is a way to improve energy programs with existing infrastructure, and I can guarantee my colleagues will be lining up to take advantage of that program, we have, in the first 100 hours of this Congress, raised the minimum wage; we have lowered the cost of people to send their children to college; we have implemented the 9/11 Commission Report. We have moved through an agenda with efficiency to get things done for the American people, and now my colleagues on the other side want to have an argument with the White House over the appropriate arrangements for the Speaker. 
   Now, look, I am sure that my good friends on the other side are so detached from reality that they think this is what the American people want to work on. This is a party that squandered the leadership that they had. Now the Republic Party is in the minority for the foreseeable future. The Republic Party is so completely bankrupt of any ideas of their own, they have taken to bringing up 3 hours of discussion and a debate between the White House and themselves about what kind of security the Speaker should have. 
   The Republic Party is the minority party not only for this reason, but this is one of them. And then to make it worse, the Members that the Republic Party sends over can't possibly be the  A team. This can't be the best. This can't be the most articulate, most informed voices of the Republic Party, can it? This is it. 
   I was in my office and I heard a Member of the Republic Party, and you will correct me, Mr. Chairman, if I am wrong, complaining that he had to sit in a middle seat. No, not a middle seat. Complaining that he had to eat peanuts on his flight. I don't even know what this is about. 
   Let me tell you what the American people are interested in. They are interested in the idea that, like Damocles' sword, global warming is now hanging over the head of all of us, all of us, Republican or Democratic, even the Republic Party must be concerned about that. We have had thousands of scientists that have reached a consensus----

   Mr. WEINER. Reclaiming my time, even those members of this panel, these scientists that took a look at global warming, global climate change, 90 percent of them, a record level of consensus, say that human causes are to blame. 
   We are not going to leave it to the Republic Party to solve this problem. They are in the minority. They are probably in the permanent minority if they are going to spend their time obsessing about security arrangements for the Speaker and disagreeing with the President of the United States' spokesman. But we are. Nancy Pelosi, this party is going to do something about global warming; we are not going to wait for the Republic Party to join in. Just the same way we said we were going to increase the minimum wage, the same way we said we were going to increase safety by implementing the9/11 Commission Report, the same way we said we were going to reduce college costs for the American middle class and those striving to make it, that is what we are going to do. 
   You can have this debate all you want about the security arrangements for the Speaker, but we are going to go about doing the job of the American people. That is why the Democratic Party is in charge, not the Republic Party.

   But frankly, there are people that are working on that right now, and I think, and maybe you do as well; I will ask you. Do you agree with the statement of the White House that this is a silly issue that people are making too much of and that we should get back to the job of the country?

You voted to make it less expensive for parents of New Hampshire to send their kids to school. You voted for a responsible continuing resolution that increased spending to put cops on the beat in New Hampshire.

Many of the people that are here on the floor from the Republic Party were shot down continually when they came to the floor trying to cut out wasteful spending. More wasteful spending happened under their leadership than, frankly, anytime in history. 
   The Republic Party showed such an inability to govern this country that they were vanquished into the minority arguably for the foreseeable future. The Republic Party was repudiated, but this is how they want to use their debate time, on a measure that we have accepted, on what protection to provide the Speaker. 
   I doubt very much, I say to the gentleman from Massachusetts, that the American people are tuning in with rapt attention to see how we are going to provide security to the Speaker. But if that is really what they think we should be having this debate about, I for one, Mr. Tierney, disagree. I think we should be figuring out how to do the people's business. We have already lowered their cost of college. We have increased the minimum wage. We have put an ethics plan into place. We have shown again and again we are doing the business of the American people; and the Republic Party seems, based on this debate, to be obsessed with how we provide security for the Speaker.

   Mr. WEINER. If I could just further answer your question, because you asked a good question about the schedule; the gentleman asked a good question about the schedule. I just want, on behalf of all of us on this side of the aisle, to express our apologies for making you all work so hard. It wasn't our intention to inconvenience anybody. We are just trying to get the people's work done.

   Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, it is easy in the era where we look at the big numbers and the headlines in the newspaper to forget about the great acts of heroism that are going on right this very moment in Iraq and elsewhere in our world. I rise to bring to the attention of this body the heroism of Lieutenant Patrick Dowdell. He is serving with the 4th Infantry in Iraq as we speak. That is a division that has lost, unfortunately, over 135 heroic men and women. He is not the only hero in the family. His younger brother, James, recently began service in Ladder Company 174 in East Flatbush. I hope you will join with me and all of his neighbors in Breezy Point in expressing tribute to this family. 
   This family has one other chapter of heroism in its book. Lieutenant Kevin Dowdell, the father of both Patrick and James, was lost on September 11, a firefighter, in the World Trade Center. We join with this entire body and all of this country in commending Rose Ellen, their mother, and the acts of heroism that they are paying both here and in generations in the past. May God bless them, and God bless the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEINER. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEINER. I thank the sponsors of this legislation and of the amendment. 
   I think this is an opportunity for us to expand on the notion that many Americans already support, and that is the idea that Americans very much want to be asked to help, they want to be asked to volunteer, they want to be asked to serve. Despite the conventional wisdom about growing apathy in the country, studies have actually shown that almost 30 percent did volunteer work in 2006, up dramatically since 1989, the last time the survey was asked. 
   We found when asked is government, is Washington, is our country asking enough of us, overwhelmingly Americans say no, we are not being asked to do enough. Unlike the period after Pearl Harbor when FDR famously called us all to this national sense of calling, we failed to do it. The bill that we have today hopefully will reverse that to some degree and get more people involved doing more things. 
   One of the things the bill does that is most laudable is expands outreach to let cities, localities, and organizations know the program has grown much more flexible over the course of years. I believe that cities should be thinking about their own version of kind of a city version of AmeriCorps, addressing specific problems, maybe not as general as the AmeriCorps program is, where we have many people going, doing discrete individual things, but create programs that cities say let's try to tackle the problem of child hunger, let's try to tackle the problem of affordability. This type of a program would allow cities to take more control, something that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support. 
   Not that long ago, I gave a speech in May, where I laid out a proposal in something I called AppleCorps, that New York City would come up with their program to take advantage. The idea would be if you get cities involved, maybe we can get them to put money in on top of what we in the Federal Government are offering to tackle those challenges that they face. 
   One thing is very clear, that when Roosevelt once famously asked, ``Now that we are in this war, we are all in it, all the way. Every single, man, woman, and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history. We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories.'' This bill seeks to do that. 
   Thank you very much for the time.
