<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1362 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate on the motion controlled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
   Madam Speaker, the Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act is a comprehensive and fiscally responsible way to continue and advance America's leadership in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
   I might add that the two persons for whom this act is named were persons that exemplified and manifested throughout their careers the need for the Foreign Affairs Committee to proceed in a comprehensive and responsible manner. 
   The bill authorizes $48 billion to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria for fiscal year 09 through fiscal year 2013, and includes guidelines and goals for reducing the burden of these diseases. 
   The bill supports culturally competent prevention and treatment measures that are based on empirical evidence rather than ideology. 
   Additionally, the underlying bill includes provisions that support a multi-faceted approach to treating and preventing the three diseases, and encourages foreign and domestic health care entities to collaborate. 
   The bill prevents foreign governments from unjustly profiting from U.S. aid and prohibits them from taxing the funds that the bill authorizes. 
   Lastly, the bill seeks to improve oversight, transparency and accountability in assessing the progress of United States global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programs. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States has become an important player in combating these global epidemics. However, although the underlying bill has bipartisan support, some have argued that it is imprudent to invest in global health programs while we are experiencing so many problems domestically. Nothing, in my opinion, could be further from the truth. Investing in global health ultimately leads to communities and countries that are more economically, socially and politically stable. In this globally connected era, it is imperative that we address health and development in foreign countries. 
   Malaria was virtually eradicated in most of the West more than 50 years ago. In fact, the Washington D.C. area was particularly vulnerable to this disease. Effectively resolving this health threat undoubtedly contributed to the ability of our country and other Western countries to thrive and prosper. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the 40 percent of men, women and children who are at risk for contracting malaria live in poorer countries, with less access to education, preventative health care, and treatment. 
   As we consider this important bill, we would be remiss if we did not look at it as an opportunity to think about how we can improve our response to HIV/AIDS and other debilitating diseases that affect people in this country. 
   The fight against HIV/AIDS is also a fight against the health, economic and educational disparities that continue to exist in communities that have been historically underprivileged. 
   Nearly three decades after the first national reports on HIV/AIDS, the disease has reached every corner of the world and has claimed an estimated 25 million lives.  
   Although the scope of HIV/AIDS has changed, the link between socioeconomic disparity and those who contract and die from the disease remains consistent around the world. In our hemisphere alone, whether you're talking about Honduras or Haiti or my home State of Florida, people of African, indigenous, and Hispanic ancestry are disproportionately contracting and dying from HIV/AIDS. 
   Madam Speaker, this issue hits close to home for me, as Florida has consistently ranked third in the Nation in the number of reported cases of HIV/AIDS. In 2006, blacks accounted for 45 percent of all AIDS cases in men and 69 percent in women, which is more than any other racial or ethnic group in the State of Florida. Sadly, in that same year, the HIV/AIDS case rate among black women was 17 times higher than among white women. 
   In the absence of a cure, education and increased access to medication are the most powerful and cost-effective ways to treat and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS around the world. Yet the resistance of antiretroviral drugs and other treatment has not translated into accessibility. Less than 25 percent of patients in developing countries and 30 percent of patients domestically receive antiretroviral treatment. Even more, the consequences of allowing people to remain ignorant about HIV/AIDS has proven to be just as deadly as the virus itself. 
   Consider this: Political leaders of countries particularly stricken by HIV/AIDS have told their citizens that HIV/AIDS can be controlled by consuming garlic, lemon juice, and beet root. Such a statement sounds unquestionably absurd to most. However, around the world, people continue to be misinformed about preventing and treating this disease. They allow fear to halt open and honest discussions about this disease. 
   Personally, I have hosted three town hall meetings in the last year and a half in the congressional district that I'm privileged to represent. At each of them, activists, specialists, religious leaders and the general public have openly discussed and asked questions about how to address HIV/AIDS in their community. These fora have been educational and meaningful tools in fighting this disease, and more are needed. 
   I might add that at those fora, Madam Speaker, some courageous young women that are HIV/AIDS infected appeared and gave their testimonies, compelling in respect to their own issues, and informative as to those that were in the audience to hear people who are living with this disease actually put forward ideas about the need for greater education, information and treatment. 
   As a leader in global health and human rights, Madam Speaker, this country, all of us, must not allow ignorance, stigmatization, and unequal access to medication to continue in this country or abroad. By supporting this bill and the underlying bill, we're investing in global health, the global economy, and our global community as a whole. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, this is a good rule for a critically important bill. The sooner that the House approves this rule, the sooner the U.S. can continue to save and improve millions of lives around the world and here at home. 
   The Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act has received overwhelming support across the political spectrum because it balances fiscal responsibility, oversight and comprehensive health care programs. 
   I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting a bill that uses scientifically proven strategies, international cooperation and cultural competence to combat some of the most devastating diseases in recent history. 
   We executed an aggressive response to the tuberculosis and malaria epidemics in this country because we understood that it would allow us to be a stronger and better Nation. Although we have made tremendous progress in our country, the battle is far from over. 
   As the richest nation in the world, we now have the privilege of helping other countries on their road to development. We must use the knowledge that we gain from these partnerships to address the disparities that continue to deprive countless men, women and children in this country and abroad of a healthy and productive life. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule that brings the underlying bill to the House. 
   Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to address this request of my good friend and colleague from Florida about energy. What he is saying is, and the people on his side of the aisle, is immediately upon the adoption of this resolution, the House shall, without intervention of any point of order, consider in the House the bill, H.R. 6107, to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain of Alaska, and for other purposes. 
   Now this bill that we're here on, Madam Speaker, is named after two of the most distinguished persons that have ever served in this body. My colleague from Florida and all of us that are here knew both of these men and  knew their seriousness when they came to this floor about matters. We commemorate their memory with this bill. But what we do is we denigrate their memory by bringing up political hyperbole, political grandstanding, exhausting political hyperbole and bumper stickerism. Enough of this. 
   Everybody knows that we have put forward, on the side that I am privileged to represent as Democrats, numerous measures dealing with these matters. We all know that there are 68 million acres off the shore that are leased already to oil companies. Footnote. Has anybody asked any of these oil companies whether or not they want to drill in these areas? And in ANWR there are 23 million acres that are available. 
   How dare we come here with this pitiful excuse for a previous question and say to the American people that on a matter of this consequence, on a matter of dealing with malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS that we would come here and denigrate the name of the two persons that we commemorate with such a foolish proposition. It makes absolutely no sense. 
   Now we will hear, obviously from now until the time that we're out of session, from my Republican colleagues about energy. And I have said to them repeatedly and over and over and over again, that all the hyperbole, switchgrass, deed exhaustion, coal, shale, offshore, ANWR, all of those things, geothermal, I can name them. All of us in here can name them. Many of those are things in the future. All of us know that we have a crisis in this country. Every man and woman in the House of Representatives and in the United States would like to solve that crisis. We know that speculators are involved in this. We put forward energy legislation. Nancy Pelosi led with energy legislation. Markey and Dingell have been on the floor repeatedly with energy legislation. We are here about AIDS, and someone would dare come here and talk about energy. That's crazy.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just read, House Resolution 1368 provides that section 803 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 shall not apply during the remainder of the 110th Congress. 
   This resolution is needed today because of a procedural gimmick which was stuck into the Republican Medicare prescription drug bill in the dead of night shortly before the bill found its way to the floor back in 2003. The provision was a way for Republicans to get conservatives in their party to support an unpopular bill that may very well be the largest campaign donor payback program in the history of this institution. However, even this provision failed to prevent one of the most shameful nights in the history of this institution as arms were twisted and threats delivered into the wee hours of the morning to get the votes needed to pass this bill. 
   Under current law, when the Medicare trustees project in two consecutive trustee reports that general revenues will exceed 45 percent of Medicare spending within a 7-year window, an expedited process is triggered to reduce the percentage. This expedited process, however, bypasses regular order in the House, as well as the Rules Committee. Once the percentage of Medicare funding coming from general revenues reaches 45 percent, the President is required to send legislation to the House and Senate that will address the matter. That bill must then be introduced by the House majority and minority leaders and referred to the appropriate committees. 
   The process by which that bill, or any bill meeting the requirements of the trigger, moves through the committee process and is discharged to the floor includes a privileged motion. The privileged motion requires only one-fifth of the House, or just 87 Members, to second the motion and force a vote on that motion that would bring the bill itself to the floor for a vote. Under the trigger, if this small minority of the House is successful and the motion passes the House, the bill would come to the floor within 3 legislative days and can be debated with up to 5 hours of general debate and 10 hours of debate on amendments. 
   Adding to the unprecedented nature of this provision, amendments are given blanket waivers with the only requirement being certification by the  Budget Committee that the bill will eliminate excess Medicare spending from general revenues. Astonishingly, the trigger waives the rules of the House and blocks Members from raising points of orders against the bill for earmark, PAYGO, or any other violation of House rules. All that a Member needs to do to force a vote on discharging a bill is introduce a bill titled ``To Respond to a Medicare Funding Warning.'' As long as that bill meets the requirements of the Budget Committee, then anyone, Democrat or Republican, may seek to disrupt the proceedings of the House. Realize, if the House fails to pass this resolution today, it will leave itself vulnerable to chaos and extraordinary political gamesmanship. 
   We will lay the groundwork to effectively becoming the Senate, stalled and unable to act as a victim of its own rules and procedures. Every moment of every day here in session, under the guise of trying to fix Medicare, a Member could move to discharge a bill which includes provisions that have nothing to do with Medicare. The only way to avoid this chaos and potential shutdown of the House in the 110th Congress is for the House to pass this resolution today. 
   What is perhaps most troubling about this entire process, Mr. Speaker, is that Congress fixed the revenue problem in a more comprehensive manner last week when the House and Senate both voted to override the President's veto on the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. In that bill, Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, removed waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare advantage plan without hurting seniors. Under our leadership, seniors continue to have access to their doctors and prescription drugs without having their premiums raised or coverage reduced. 
   Very occasionally, Mr. Speaker, many of us talk with different people in our constituency. Last week I had an opportunity to talk with a physician in this city named Stern. And Dr. Stern indicated to me that I should, among other things, fight real hard to have people understand how effective Medicare is and what a single payer plan could do for this Nation. We talked considerably about this, and I'm delighted that I had an opportunity to be edified by someone that is in this profession. 
   But because of this Medicare trigger provision, a provision which was not in the House or Senate bill and was slipped in the conference, I will repeat, slipped in the conference during the dead of night, and I was here, Pete Stark and David Dreier, all of us were here when this happened, forced to deal with the legacy of, in my opinion, the misguided former majority. 
   I urge my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to do the right thing and support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   I want to say to my friend, the ranking member, everything debated in this House doesn't have to be a battle. Turning off this provision is the correct thing to do, and I will tell you why. 
   The perceived problem with Medicare funding has already been addressed. Let me repeat that. The perceived problem with Medicare funding has already been addressed. The recently enacted Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act fixed the funding of Medicare to keep it below the 45 percent trigger. 
   Let me refresh your memory. On July 15, the House voted to override the President's veto of this important legislation. Every single member of the Rules Committee, Democrat and Republican, voted to override. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a champion of SCHIP, which required overriding twice a veto by the President.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have sat and stood here with great amusement as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor to oppose this resolution. After all, if it were not for their actions, this resolution wouldn't even be necessary. 
   The ``45 percent Medicare trigger'' was nothing more than a gimmick designed to gain the votes of conservative  Republicans for their Medicare prescription drug bill. It was drafted behind closed doors. I was here, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Rangel tried to get into their conference. They locked the doors without any consultation with Mr. Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee, members that were in the minority without any involvement or notification to the minority. It was then slipped into the conference at the last minute and had not passed the House or the Senate. 
   It's amazing, Mr. Speaker. My friends on the other side agreed to this trigger and preach fiscal responsibility and are now supporting a process which could force the House to allow legislation to the floor in clear violation of its PAYGO and earmark rules. 
   I was really amused that the distinguished gentleman that is head of the Republican Study Committee came in here as much as he talks about earmarks and is going to come here and talk about fiscal responsibility. 
   I was also amused that the last lady speaker who took it upon herself to talk about this measure but forgot, I guess, that she voted to override the President's veto last week. 
   But now they come to the floor to complain because their Members bought a pig in a poke. Give me a break.     
   The last time I checked, they were the dealer with all the cards in 2003. 
   Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday, Medicare will turn 43 years old. Since its founding, the program has provided health care to hundreds of millions of seniors, including my momma and my grandpapa. 
   Almost 35 percent of the people living in my district are senior citizens, and the overwhelming majority of them depend on Medicare. 
   Members have a choice today between reviving the Republican legacy of political and procedural gimmickry or standing up for seniors and sound public policy. 
   While Republicans choose to play games and engage in political hyperbole, my Democratic colleagues and I have chosen America's seniors. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   As a longtime cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, I applaud our Leadership for bringing this bill expeditiously to the floor. American workers from coast to coast are standing up to cheer because their voices no longer fall upon deaf ears in the House of Representatives. 
   Under this Democratically-controlled House, worker pleas for fairness in organizing are finally being answered. 
   Consider, over the last 60 years, there have been only 42 instances where union misconduct was found by the National Labor Relations Board. In direct contrast, over 30,000 workers received back pay from employers who illegally fired them for their union activities in 2005 alone. 
   In my district, I have walked the picket lines with literally hundreds of workers who were wrongfully fired or laid-off for trying to organize a union. Whether it has been at a body armor plant or hospitals and nursing homes as well, I have seen, firsthand, employer intimidation aimed at discouraging union involvement. 
   This legislation cracks down on intimidation and coercion. It also gives employees the choice--through a public or private ballot process--to decide whether or not they want to organize a union and experience all that one has to offer, including higher wages and better healthcare for its members. Whatever their decision, under this bill, the choice is theirs. 
   Madam Speaker, when I was a child, my parents took us out of Florida in search of higher wages. Like every other American family, they wanted a better life for them and for me. 
   When workers seek to organize and take advantage of their collective bargaining rights, they too are searching for an improved life for them and their families. They aren't trying to take advantage of the system or run the company which employs them out of business. All they want is fair pay and benefits for an honest day's work. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act preserves and enhances the American worker's right to organize. I stand by these efforts and this much needed legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Title IV of our rules package is one of the ones of which I am most proud. Over the past 12 years, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, while allegedly praying to the gods of fiscal responsibility, have nearly sunk our ship of state in red ink. Today we begin to right this ship and staunch the unmitigated gall of telling the American people that, on the one hand, they need to be more responsible with their money, but, on the other hand, Congress should face no such obstacle. 
   Today we will say ``no more'' to spending money that the government doesn't have, only to pass down to the young people of America, some of whom we saw here yesterday afternoon, passing it on to them before they even have a say in how their money is being spent. 
   Yes, today we say to the American people that Congress, like you at home, Jane and Joe Lunchbucket, will not spend money that we don't have. Our credit card is maxed out and we start to reduce it today. 
   My fellow Democratic colleagues will provide more details about this new set of House rules presently, but there is one more point I want to make perfectly clear. I am not going to, and I hope my colleagues aren't going to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle lecture us about not doing enough here today. 
   I have read some of their ``talking points'' from the Budget Committee. And while I may not be a whiz kid, I know a little something about being lectured to. 
   And having this particular group of Republicans lecture us on fiscal responsibility is a little like having the horses on the farm complain to the ranch hand that he is not using a big enough shovel to clean up. 
   This analogy is not only appropriate, Mr. Speaker, it is perfect.

   Pay-as-you-go was the law of the land from 1990 until 2002, paving the way for a balanced budget in the late 1990s, 4 years of budget surpluses, and bringing down the national debt by $453 billion. The Bush administration has turned a projected 10-year $5.6 billion surplus into a nearly $3 trillion deficit. America's debt has already climbed 50 percent to more than $28,000 per person, and President Bush has borrowed more from foreign nations than the previous 42 United States Presidents combined. 
   Something has to change and that change is coming now. The pay-as-you-go budgeting with no new deficit spending is just a first step, a key first step, in reversing record budget deficits.

   Mr. Speaker, I have seen 15 State and Foreign Operations measures go through the House of Representatives in almost 16 years of serving in this body. Some bills were well-intentioned, but fell short of meeting America's critical needs and objectives, while others missed the target altogether. 
   Regarding today's State and Foreign Operations bill, I must commend Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Wolf, their respective staffs and the rest of the committee for coming together in a bipartisan fashion to craft this meaningful piece of legislation. Despite critical budget constraints and critical concerns, the bill is fiscally responsible and begins to address our Nation's foreign policy initiatives as they relate to fulfilling our commitments abroad. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and as a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe I can speak to our country's need to restore world stability after years of following misguided and shortsighted foreign policy.  
   This bill provides $34.2 billion overall for foreign assistance and State Department operations, with much-needed emphasis placed on international AIDS programs, children's health care, basic education programs and targeted peacekeeping operations. By increasing funds for critical global health, basic education, refugee and disaster assistance programs, we are heightening world stability and rebuilding our image abroad as a nation builder, not divider. 
   In an effort to shift away from a Middle East foreign policy that focused a little too narrowly on Iraq, we are now reaching out to neighboring Mediterranean countries that need our attention and assistance. The escalating situation in Iraq has forced thousands, indeed millions, of refugees to flee into neighboring countries, Jordan being one of the most heavily affected. 
   During a trip to the region almost 2 weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, I witnessed firsthand the heart-wrenching effects of people displaced. What I learned in Jordan and saw in Kosovo is that there are people in this world being forced to live in conditions so inhumane that even our wildest nightmares could not comprehend. As such, I am pleased to support the bill's allocation of $830 million to provide refugees worldwide with food, water and shelter. As I spoke last evening during the testimony in the Rules Committee, I said to Mrs. Lowey and to Mr. Wolf that I am hopeful in conference that they will be able to add funds specifically for Jordan for reasons that I perceive are necessary. 
   While we must remain vigilant and diligent on combating the evils of terrorism, we must also simultaneously seize opportunities to establish, maintain and strengthen diplomatic ties in every region of the world. I am pleased also to see that the bill provides $365 million to enhance our public diplomacy efforts, and allocates $501 million for cultural, educational and professional exchange programs globally. 
   The underlying legislation includes critical foreign aid to our allies in the world, including Israel. It also restores funding in many of the areas which the present administration sought to cut. 
   As I mentioned, I serve as chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, and the President Emeritus of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. Mr. Speaker, I am fond of saying that if you can say all of that, you ought to be president of the assembly. I am deeply appreciative that this bill funds America's commitment to the OSCE and the Helsinki Commission, and I indeed thank the chairwoman and ranking member, especially the chairwoman, for her efforts toward this end. 
   Mr. Speaker, America has a responsibility in the world. We are, as is constantly reported, the last remaining Superpower. Contrary to what many might argue later in this debate, our power cannot and must not be flexed only in our military might. On the contrary, our power must be flexed in what we do to help repair many of the things that are broken in the world. 
   The underlying legislation is a critical component in this effort. I am pleased to support this open rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, America's leadership role is not limited to the Presidency. Nor does it solely fall upon the shoulders of this body. Branches of our government must share responsibility. 
   During this critical time in world history, when America's image as a global leader is tarnished and questioned, we must lead from this Chamber. We must take it upon ourselves to make it possible for America's image in the world to be restored. We must make it our business to try and make all that is wrong right. 
   When America leads in a constructive, inclusive and thoughtful manner, others in the world follow. This approach toward global leadership is not, as some have charged, a soft approach to conducting the war on terrorism. On the contrary, it is a clear recognition that America cannot do this alone. 
   If we have learned anything in the last 6 years, it is that no one in this world is safe from the directions of terrorism. It will take a global effort to curb the efforts of those who are seeking to destroy us and others in the world. 
   But if we have learned anything else during the last 6 years, it is that the policies of the present administration have failed and America's standing in the world is in dire need of restoration. 
   Parts of the Middle East, from Iraq to Gaza, are living in a civil war. People are dying in Darfur as we and others around the world do nothing. And children throughout the world are starving to death and dying of malnourishment and lack of potable fresh water. 
   The underlying legislation, the first Foreign Operations appropriations bill of this new Democratic majority, sends a clear message to our friends and enemies alike that America's priorities in the world are making must-needed changes. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1257 provides for consideration of H.R. 6063, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Science and Technology. It also waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order the 12 amendments listed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions.     
   Mr. Speaker, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act is a commonsense and fiscally responsible authorization plan for NASA that will strengthen our ability to improve our Nation's economy, communities and programs, as well as our national security. 
   The bill authorizes $20.21 billion for NASA for fiscal year 2009. This includes $1 billion in funding to accelerate the development of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Ares 1 Crew Launch Vehicle. This ensures that we do not lose ground to Russia and China as we work to build the next generation of space flight vehicles.  
   I would take a point of personal privilege to point out, Mr. Speaker, that the husband of a Member of the House of Representatives, Gabrielle Giffords, is on the present space vehicle that is in outer space. I learned from, we call her ``Gabby,'' that her husband will be home Saturday, and we wish him and the crew all safety and Godspeed. 
   Additionally, the underlying bill provides for programs in human space flight and exploration, aeronautics research and development and scientific research, including Earth observations and research. 
   The bill authorizes an additional Space Shuttle flight to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the International Space Station. 
   Lastly, the underlying bill contains important provisions related to education, space traffic management and astronaut health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill's bipartisan support is a testament to the fact that my colleagues on both sides understand the tremendous importance of supporting NASA. However, in this time of soaring drug and food prices, a plummeting economy and war, some are asking why Congress should invest in our Nation's space program. To put it another way, why are we going in space when I don't have gas to get to the grocery store? While I wholeheartedly disagree, I would be remiss if I did not at least acknowledge their concerns. 
   It provides us with the opportunity to recount the many lifesaving and life-altering methods and products that were made possible through space technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, people of all ages know that putting men on the moon in 1969 was one of NASA's pioneering achievements. Missions to space have given us all a sense of national pride and allow us to better understand the universe in which we live. Few know, however, that for 50 years space technology has laid the foundation for consumer products that help businesses run more efficiently and allow everyday people to live safer, longer and better lives. 
   Think about it. The United States has some of the most cutting-edge medical technology in the world because of NASA. The pacemaker, voice-controlled wheelchairs and the MRI all rely on technology that was first developed for space exploration. 
   More than 560,000 Americans will die from cancer this year, including over 40,000 in my home State of Florida. Space technology has led to life-saving advanced screening and treatment methods for breast cancer that are more accurate, cost-effective and less invasive. 
   Do you want more? We have all come to realize the consequences of not protecting our environment and conserving our resources. NASA has made significant contributions to the way that we adopt environmentally-friendly practices in our homes, businesses and everyday lives. It has been at the forefront of documenting climate change. 
   Further, solar energy, environmental control sensors that monitor emission levels and water purification systems that could save millions in poorer countries from developing deadly and debilitating water-borne diseases were all made possible because of space technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the microwave oven, food products and drinks that have been developed because of space technology. 
   The past 7 years have made us acutely aware, Mr. Speaker, of the importance of having the infrastructure and tools to respond to natural and man-made disasters. There too, NASA has played a crucial role in national security by providing the resources and technology to make our communities, borders, waterways and airways safer. We owe wireless technology, storm warning devices and radiation hazard detection in part to space technology that was developed and tested under NASA programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, for me, the future of the U.S. space program hits close to home. The Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral has a profound impact on Florida's economy and well-being, and my colleague in the minority, Mr. Diaz-Balart, and I know this all too well. 
   Again a point of personal privilege. Where Cape Canaveral, Cape Kennedy is, Mr. Speaker, as a child I fished there in the Haulover Canal, and I can't tell you what a tremendous, scintillating experience for me it is to see an area that was and still is pristine, now the place where our national pride is raised every time a space vehicle is launched. 
   In 2006 alone, the space program contributed nearly $1.7 billion to Florida's economy. It provides thousands of direct and indirect jobs, encourages businesses and recreational travel, and also helps groom the next generation of mathematicians and scientists by providing learning and research opportunities for students of all ages. 
   Mr. Speaker, by supporting this rule and the underlying bill, we are investing in the welfare of our great country and installing the next chapter in the American book of creativity and innovation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I won't use it all. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a good rule for a great bill. And I was getting very confused as I heard my colleagues talking. The bill is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. This measure has received overwhelming support across the political spectrum because it balances fiscal responsibility, oversight and advancement. 
   My colleagues protest rightly the accelerating price of gasoline for consumers in this country. And heating oil can't be far behind when winter comes. 
   But to stand and say that the Speaker of the House of Representatives has not done anything about this particular matter ignores the fact that in the other body on just about every measure that has been proposed, some that have passed out of this body, the other body in the minority have stopped them in their tracks. Now I know back in April that the Speaker called on the President to suspend purchases of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I regret that I am buying into the notion that you have accelerated that this good space bill now has become something to do with gas. 
   As you know, the ranking Republican of the Science and Technology Committee, Representative Mr. Hall, and the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Representative Feeney, are both original sponsors of this bill. In fact, Representative Feeney praised the Democratic members and staff for crafting the bill in a bipartisan fashion from the beginning. And I too join with praising the staff on both sides for this measure. 
   The underlying bill authorizes funds that will maintain NASA's current operations while allowing it to lay down  the foundation to achieve future goals in the areas of space exploration and scientific research. 
   Furthermore, the bill provides our need and desire for a better environment, educational opportunities, and improved national security. When we invest in quality programs like NASA, we are investing in the American people and the future of our country. NASA has undoubtedly contributed to the tremendous successes that America experienced in science and technology in the later part of the 20th century. If properly funded, NASA will ensure that America remains a world leader in science, space travel, and technology in the 21st century and beyond. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to take just one more moment to respond to my friends who want us to lower gas prices. They are correct, but this body has, through the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, sought to crack down on oil price gouging, hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, and repeal subsidies for profit-rich Big Oil so we can invest in a renewable energy future. I want you to know that those measures alone have passed out of this House. 
   Now let's just be for real here and stop scaring the American public. There is no Member of the House of Representatives or the United States Senate that does not want gas prices in this country to be lower. There is no Member that does not want food prices to be lower. All of us need to understand something, there is no short-term fix for the problem that we have gotten ourselves into, and the majority are the people that got us in most of this fix that we are in, and it is Democrats under Nancy Pelosi that are trying to pull us out of this hole that we got ourselves in.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my good friend. Reclaiming my time, I think my good friend knows and doubtless has heard me talk about my opposition to oil drilling in ANWR. 
   What I would say in response to my friend, if we started drilling in ANWR today, it would be 10 years before a drop of oil would enter into an automobile if that is what we are still using. We need energy conservation. We need renewable energy. We need all of the things that everybody is talking about, and we need to understand that nothing is going to happen in the morning. It is going to take a very long time and an awful lot of sacrifice. And I personally just get tired of people beating up on people here in this body. That is what leads to the partisan rancor. That is not what we are asking for. 
   I believe that we can get out of this problem. They ought to lock all 535 of us up here in this Capitol and require us to work together and require businesses to stop gouging people as they are doing. 
   Now this ain't the energy bill. This is the space bill, and this rule is about space.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 807, a resolution honoring the life of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, champion of the Florida Everglades and founder of Florida's environmental movement. I am proud to have introduced this resolution with my colleague and good friend, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I share Representative Ros-Lehtinen's desire to recognize and commemorate the significance of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's lifelong work to promote awareness of the need to protect and conserve Florida and the entire Nation's natural resources. 
   As co-chair of the Everglades Caucus, I particularly share Ms. Douglas's passionate commitment to restoring the River of Grass to the pristine ecosystem it once was. 
   Ms. Douglas deserves much credit for raising awareness of the importance of these majestic wetlands and making restoration efforts a national priority. In 1947 she wrote the infamous book, ``The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which helped draw national attention to the Everglades. This book is responsible for initiating public support for President Harry Truman's 1947 declaration officially protecting the Everglades as a national park. Today, this book serves a the ``bible'' for all Everglades supporters and environmental activists around the world. 
   Ms. Douglas is also responsible for founding the Friends of the Everglades, an educational and advocacy group dedicated to the protection and restoration of the Everglades. Through the group's ecosystem conservation efforts, Ms. Douglas's legacy lives on. 
   This resolution enjoys bipartisan support from every Member of the Florida delegation. The support this resolution enjoys indicates the respect our delegation has for Ms. Douglas's lifelong work and the impact of her contributions on the entire State of Florida. 
   I am proud to join Representative Ros-Lehtinen in introducing this bipartisan resolution and pledge to carry on Ms. Douglas's legacy effort by continuing to champion Everglades restoration efforts in Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this excellent resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 845, a resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of Everglades National Park. I  proudly introduced this resolution with my colleague and fellow co-chair of the Everglades Caucus, Representative MARIO DIAZ-BALART.  
   I applaud Representative DIAZ-BALART for his commitment to working together to preserve and restore the Everglades. 
   I thank the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, Representative NICK RAHALL, a true champion of protecting our Nation's natural resources, especially our majestic national parks, for his support for protecting Florida's environment. 
   I also would like to thank the ranking member of the Committee, Representative DON YOUNG, for his support as well. 
   The bipartisan support this resolution enjoys is reminiscent of the past and present bipartisan support Everglades restoration efforts enjoy. 
   Today we honor the 60th anniversary of Everglades National Park. The park, which spans 3 million acres of wetlands, is habitat to many endangered species and is an international center for business, agriculture, and tourism. 
   Our work to restore the Everglades is the largest restoration effort of its kind in history. 
   As a fifth generation Floridian and great grandson of a Creek Indian, my passion for these majestic wetlands extends back to my birth. 
   I have seen species that have since become endangered, and a living ecosystem that has since been degraded by management and development activities. 
   Regrettably, since the passage of landmark legislation in 2000, restoration efforts in Congress have been mired. Now the Everglades is paying a hefty price for Federal delays. Expected project completion timeframes have been shifted, and the restoration price tags increased. 
   With new perspectives and new priorities, Congress is again reaffirming our commitment to the Everglades. 
   Just last November, Congress overrode a President Bush veto and passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, authorizing $1.8 billion in Everglades restoration funding. 
   As we pause to celebrate the anniversary of the Everglades National Park today, we enhance our vigilant efforts to restore the park to the pristine ecosystem it once was. 
   I thank the leadership of the House for their work on this bill, and urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 239 provides for consideration of H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour and 20 minutes of general debate with 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The remaining 20 minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute, consisting of the text of the bill, modified by the amendments, recommended by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and printed in the bill, shall be considered as adopted. 
   The bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended. 
   Now, the rule makes in order five amendments, three Republican amendments and two Democratic, which are printed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution. 
   The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report and shall be considered as read and shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. 
   All points of order against amendments, except for clauses 9 and 10, are waived. 
   Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is an important day for the more than 2.7 million Federal employees who show us, day in and day out, their commitment to improving our great country. It is an important day because the House, in bipartisan cooperation, is closing the loopholes which permitted retaliation against Federal employees who have reported unlawful fraud, corruption, incompetence and abuse of power. 
   Today is an important day because the House is saying loud and clear that whistleblower protection is an essential component of government, of government accountability and of government fiscal responsibility. 
   Throughout our history, whistleblowers have played integral roles in improving our government and holding it accountable for its negligence. From Shawn Carpenter to Joseph Darby to Mark Felt, and everyone in between, whistleblowers have faced harsh penalties from those who would prefer that what they know is never shared with the public. They have, nevertheless, put their careers on the line, and in some instances even their lives, to do what they knew was the right thing to do. Their courage is to be commended and their conviction embraced. 
   When history judges this current administration, I believe it will look down upon the drastic and despicable actions taken by this administration, which have stifled those seeking to speak truth to power. These actions are, indeed, some of the very reasons why this bill is so desperately needed. 
   For example, in 2005, the Bush administration officials placed a gag on a senior NOAA official who was scheduled to give an interview arguing that global warming exists and has contributed to greater and stronger hurricane activity. Three weeks later, Hurricane Katrina made landfall, first in my State of Florida, and then in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, killing hundreds and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, jobless and ill. 
   How can we forget former CIA operative Valerie Plame? Her life, and the lives of others, were placed in jeopardy after the Vice President's chief of staff revealed her name to a reporter in retaliation for her husband, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, revealing that the administration lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and where they were trying to retrieve uranium from Africa. 
   When the Bush administration hasn't been able to directly punish whistleblowers, it has simply tried to unilaterally change the law. Just this past September, after a senior Environmental Protection Agency scientist revealed that the administration had purposefully misled the public regarding the air safety at Ground Zero following the attacks of September 11, the Bush administration issued an executive order declaring that EPA employees are no longer covered by Federal whistleblower protections. That is outrageous. 
   These three high-profile cases, and there are a great deal more, these three capture only a small snapshot of the problems in the current administration. More importantly, they highlight the need for extended protection across all agency lines to Federal whistleblowers. 
   Unfortunately, for nearly the last decade, Federal whistleblowers have received nothing more than lip service. Let me make it very clear, I said for the last decade, that includes the previous administration and this one. Even when the House drafted legislation in 2002 establishing the Department of Homeland Security, it failed to  include whistleblower protections for DHS employees. 
   Now, I am proud that I was the author of the amendment which extended these protections and was the only Democratic amendment adopted by the House during consideration of the legislation. The protection of whistleblowers in recent years has unfortunately garnered only lip service. Today, the House is backing up these words with real action that protects our 2.7 million Federal workforce. 
   I close by noting that this bill is not perfect. That is why the Rules Committee has made five amendments in order, the majority of which, I might add, are going to be offered by our colleagues, the Republicans, on the other side. 
   Democrats are proud to continue our efforts to work in a bipartisan manner, and to provide the minority with many opportunities to improve already good legislation.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation is desperately needed. Federal employees need to know that Congress is on their side. They need to know that their jobs will not be at risk if they choose to reveal fraud, abuse of power, neglect, or corruption in their workplace. 
   The extension of these whistleblower protections is absolutely critical to our national security and our government accountability. I am proud to support the underlying legislation and hope that my colleagues will do the same. This is a fair rule for a bill that is supported by Members from both sides of the aisle, including the chairman and ranking Republican of the Government Reform Committee.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, continuing along the lines of what Congressman Meek has been speaking about, I sat behind him and he did not know that I was there. I thought that it would be helpful if I would join my very good friend, who is a member of the 30-somethings, and have him know that those of us that are the over 30-somethings have the exact same sentiments as it pertains to the circumstances as exist in our respective communities because of the Iraq war. 
   Representative Meek, I wish to just bring to the table one example. I won't use the many in the congressional district that I am privileged to represent which abuts your district, and we have overlapping circumstances in a variety of our communities in South Broward and North Dade, and in this case I am going to carry it way west to the Everglades. 
   For the last 7 years, I have been about the business of trying to get a water treatment plant in Belle Glade, Florida for the people of Belle Glade, South Bay, Pahokee, and that general area. I won't even talk about the hospital; I won't even talk about the police that you have already talked about that we have tried to get. And so I thought, well, certainly now that we have political circumstances that are favorable to the majority, that it would be very easy to get a water treatment plant. 
   Now, you and I know this: we know that in Iraq we have paid for water treatment facilities that have been blown up. We know that we have paid for sewers that the materials were stolen. And we know that we are building an embassy, I guess we are building an embassy, at more money that I can ever contemplate that must have a big bull's eye on it, but we are not sure who is building it. We know about no-bid contracts. We know about millions of dollars being poured into this situation while our communities are suffering. Now, something is wrong with this picture. 
   I heard you loud and clear regarding the extraordinary debt. And I don't mean to take much of your time, I came down here to file this bill, but I could not resist. And I yield back to my very good friend from Florida.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2643, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 514 provides for consideration of H.R. 2643, the Department of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008. It is an open rule, and allows all Members the opportunity to amend the bill.     
   Mr. Speaker, the funding levels in the underlying bill make clear the change in priorities of this new Democratic Congress. This bill refocuses our Nation's priorities to ensure that all Americans have access to clean water and air as well as appropriately addressing climate change and conservation, all of which have not been seen since Democrats last controlled this body in 1994. Democrats are restoring our obligation to the American people to protect and preserve the land and shores and all creatures who inhabit this Earth. 
   I commend Chairman Dicks and Representative Tiahrt for their hard and, perhaps most importantly, bipartisan work on this legislation. I do believe that they did a tremendous job in crafting this bill. 
   This bill restores our promise to America's underserved minority communities and to our children to ensure that our cherished land, water, and air will be preserved for generations to come. I commend the committee for including funding for important environmental justice programs I have long advocated for such as $1.1 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. This is $437 million above the administration's request and will help over 150 communities with drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects. 
   The bill also includes $140 million for sewer and water grants, which received zero funding in 2007 and was not in the President's budget request this year. Further, this legislation provides $16 million for rural water technical assistance that was also zeroed out in the President's budget request. We are ensuring that all communities have clean and safe drinking water. 
   The underlying legislation also includes limitation language that I authored in the 109th Congress, ensuring that EPA respects the needs of environmental justice communities. It appropriate $7 million for environmental justice programs, the amount that Congresswoman Hilda Solis, I, and others requested. This is $3 million over the administration's budget request and $2 million over fiscal 2007 levels. 
   This bill provides much-needed funding for our national parks and wildlife protection. The legislation includes $2.5 billion for our national parks, $223 million above the 2007 levels.  
   Democrats are appropriating $1.4 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service, $86 million above 2007 levels and $130 million above the President's budget request. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, our national parks have been shortchanged for too long. This funding will be used for critical maintenance and repair, conservation, and recreation, and for the preservation of our natural heritage. 
   Importantly, the underlying legislation maintains the longstanding Presidential and congressional moratoria on drilling for natural gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. The committee rightly rejected attempts to permit drilling to occur off the shores of coastal States, including my home State of Florida, and I am sure my colleague from Tampa (Ms. Castor) will speak more specifically to that issue during her time on the rule. In doing this, we continue to protect and preserve the health of Florida's beaches and tourism industry, the largest industry in our State. 
   Amendments may be offered today on the floor that will seek to strip Florida and other coastal States of their protections. I urge all of my colleagues to do what is right for our Nation and reject such amendments. Drilling for natural gas on the Outer Continental Shelf will have zero impact at the gas pumps. It will not under any circumstances reduce the cost of a gallon of gasoline. 
   This legislation offers a more forward thinking approach to our Nation's energy needs. Instead of looking for short-term, short-sighted solutions, Democrats have a smarter, long-term energy strategy. For starters, Democrats have increased funding for programs such as the global climate change research, providing $10 million above the President's request for new research on global climate change and its impact on rivers, groundwaters, and on organisms. 
   The bill also increases our investment in energy conservation and alternative fuels and research capabilities by nearly 60 percent. What a difference a change in Congress does make for our Nation. 
   Critically important to my district and to the entire State of Florida is restoration of America's Everglades, one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world and a unique and world-renowned eco-region. The Everglades is one of the Nation's most fragile ecosystems and remains an area of national and international significance. Increased funding to advance this restoration initiative ensures that the Federal Government keeps its commitment to the River of Grass, the largest environmental rescue in the world. Chairman Dicks and Representative Taylor, in my judgment, should both be applauded for their continued effort to restore and preserve this pristine ecosystem. 
   Democrats also take significant steps to finally work to fulfill our promise to our neglected Native American communities. In all, the bill provides almost $250 million more in funding for Native American health care and education opportunities than last year. 
   This legislation truly provides for each and every one of us. By investing in the health of America's natural resources, we are investing in the future of this majestic country. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, later today I intend to offer an amendment that would designate $1 million for grants for the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, the only national program dedicated to the preservation, interpretation, and dissemination of underground railroad history. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   I am pleased to support this rule and the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to my good friend on the Rules Committee, let me clear up something for the American public. 
   Mr. Dicks and Mr. Tiahrt, in a very responsible manner bringing this appropriations measure to the floor, had to work assiduously to ensure that this is a bipartisan effort and that we are being proper stewards of the environment. There is no question, I don't believe, that anybody can say about that. 
   But I've listened now for a considerable number of days about the hammering of earmarks. Now, I'm not here as an apologist for anybody, but I think something needs to be understood that is not clear in the minds of many, particularly in the American public because of the confusion that has been put forward by my colleagues on the other side. Let me use as a ``for example'' in this particular measure some of the so-called earmarks that I say are needed in these communities. And I go specifically to Florida and specifically to Republicans who work on this floor with me. 
   I support the city of Sarasota's water system placement that Congressman Buchanan asks for. I support Congressman Crenshaw's town of Callahan for the wastewater treatment plant. I support the fourth-ranking member of the Republican Party's request for the city of Brooksville Southwest Florida Water Management District for the Peace and Myakka Rivers. I have fished in those rivers. I have seen them be damaged. They are nowhere near the district that I am privileged to serve, but I support that particular effort of Congressman Putnam. 
   I support the city of Clearwater for wastewater and reclaimed water infrastructure. I have been in Clearwater when it was flooding and the people had problems in that area. That's offered by Mr. Young, the former appropriations Chair, and Mr. Bilirakis. Enough already, colleagues. These people need this environmental protection. They need these water treatment facilities. They need the things that Mr. Dicks and Mr. Tiahrt have worked out. And it's wrong for folks to come down here and to try to give the American public the impression that because somebody that is sent here for the purpose of trying to use the budget for the purposes of protecting the environment and the American people, that they have done something wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Vermont, my good friend who is on the Rules Committee (Mr. Welch).

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation moves our country in a better direction, providing improvements long overdue to our entire Nation. Our investments today will ensure that our children and grandchildren will have water and air that is cleaner, natural landscapes and historic structures that are protected, and arts and humanity centers that are bolstered. 
   This bill fulfills past due obligations to our underserved communities and to our entire planet. Republicans in the last Congress and in the current administration have continued to fail to effectively fund the environmental and conservation needs of the American people and its natural resources. 
   Today, under the Democratic leadership, we are reversing this trend and restoring funding to vital programs and agencies, fulfilling our promise to this Nation and to this Earth. The investments this bill makes are of vital importance today, and their benefits will be felt for years to come. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with my good friend, Congressman Michael Castle of Delaware, to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. 
   Our amendment designates $1 million of the increase in appropriations to the National Park Service for operations and grants affiliated with the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. 
   Madam Chairman, Members on both sides of the aisle agree that the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom is a phenomenal resource of the National Park Service. Interest in the network continues to grow within affiliates in 28 States and the District of Columbia now operating since its inception in 1998. More opportunities than ever are now available for families throughout the Nation to engage in interpretive learning experiences related to the significant triumph of the underground railroad. 
   Madam Chair, the President's request of $493,000 for the operation demonstrates a slight increase for the network, but the true problem lies in the lack of grants for affiliates. The grant opportunities for network affiliates have only been funded three times since the establishment of the network in 1998 and woefully less than the $2.5 million authorized in the establishing legislation. 
   Our amendment is not just about preserving black history. Madam Chair, it is about preserving American history, and we cannot let our history be forgotten. Indeed, once Congress establishes a phenomenal program such as this, it should be ready to take the necessary action to ensure its perpetuity. This is our past and we must be faithful stewards of it. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt for their help in bringing this timely amendment to the floor today. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to, at this time, yield to my friend, Mr. Castle.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1084 provides for consideration of H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   The rule makes in order the eight amendments listed in the Rules Committee report on this resolution. Six of these amendments will be offered by Republican Members, two by Democrats. Each amendment is debatable for 10 minutes. This rule is a continuation of our commitment to ensuring that the minority be given a fair opportunity to amend legislation on the House floor. 
   The rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American public has a vested interest in protecting our Nation's lands from the destructive uses that would ruin their natural beauty. In my home State of Florida, the protection and preservation of the magnificent ecosystem known as the Everglades, which spans 3 million acres of wetlands and is home to rare and endangered species, is of utmost importance to me and my constituents. It is a national priority to ensure that these majestic wetlands and others around our country will be preserved for all future generations of Americans to enjoy. The preservation of the National Landscape Conservation System is equally important to this Nation and to this Congress. 
   The underlying legislation would protect 27 million acres of land of the American West considered to have significant historical, cultural, ecological, scientific or scenic value. Most of the lands in this system are already protected and administered by the Bureau of Land Management, including wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers and national monuments. This bill will help to streamline management of the system and reduce overall bureaucracy in the program. 
   If the statement of the gentleman from Alaska yesterday in the Rules Committee is any indication, and I am referring to our colleague Congressman Young, there is a small minority of Members who may try and argue that this bill strips the private property rights of landowners. Quite the contrary. This bill protects only the lands the Bureau of Land Management already has authority over. Additionally, no owners' rights have been violated in the past, and there is no reason to believe they will be violated in the future.  
   Some may also argue that the underlying legislation changes the core management authority governing the individual National Landscape Conservation System units. Conversely, the bill includes an extensive savings clause that makes it abundantly clear that nothing in the bill alters the management authority governing the individual units. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would not affect the Bureau of Land Management's budget, direct spending or revenues, or the budgets of State, local or tribal governments. 
   Finally, the amendments made in order under the rule go a step further to address energy development, grazing rights, hunting and fishing and border security, ensuring that this bill does not change the law in these areas at all. All this bill does is help conserve and protect our Nation's land, our Nation's heritage. 
   It enjoys broad bipartisan support from groups including the Wilderness Society, Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, American Hiking Society, the National Council of Churches, Boone and Crockett Club, National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Wildlife Foundation, and the Outdoor Industry Association. 
   The bill also enjoys the often unheard of support from both President Bush and former President Clinton. 
   It is my sincere hope that the House will pass this rule and underlying bill with the same overwhelming bipartisan support it currently enjoys. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the National Landscape Conservation System Act as we further our efforts to protect and preserve public lands throughout America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this is a fair rule and an inclusive rule. We have heard here why we must pass this rule and the National Landscape Conservation System Act. Far too many of our Nation's natural treasures have already been compromised by a variety of destructive threats. It is Congress' responsibility to ensure that the National Landscape Conservation System is forever protected. Each National Landscape Conservation System unit has been established by Congress or Presidential proclamation and is managed according to its enabling authority. This legislation establishes the system in statute. 
   It is crucial for Congress to act as a good steward for environmental land protection and fully codify the National Landscape Conservation System. It is our duty to help preserve the natural heritage of our Nation for all future generations of Americans to one day enjoy. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my late great friend Congresswoman Julia M. Carson, a dedicated public servant from Indianapolis. I thank my colleague, Congressman Visclosky, for introducing a resolution to recognize her achievements by naming a post office in her honor in Indianapolis as the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building. 
   Julia Carson was born on July 8, 1938 in Louisville, Kentucky and served in various elected offices. We first became colleagues when she was elected to the 105th Congress and served together until she passed away on December 15, 2007. 
   As the first African American and first woman to be elected to Congress from Indianapolis, Julia Carson was a woman of outstanding ambition and achievements. Not only was Julia a star in her city of Indianapolis, but she was a star of the nation. Her many invaluable legislative contributions, including the recognition of Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold Medal, were a testament to her star qualities. I hope that my colleagues realize what we lost when Julia passed away. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no one more deserving of this enduring recognition than Julia Carson. This resolution is fitting recognition for a tremendous woman who continued to deliver the truth until her final days. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as we can all attest to her unprecedented devotion in serving her community and society.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BARRINGTON ANTONIO IRVING -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure to commemorate the achievements of Captain Antonio Barrington Irving, the youngest pilot and first person of African descent to fly solo around the world. 
   I thank Chairmen Oberstar and Costellos and Ranking Member Petri and the distinguished staff for their support and willingness to expedite the consideration of this resolution. 
   Since we introduced H. Res. 661, my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) and I have been joined by a bipartisan coalition of 43 cosponsors who also share our desire to encourage youth to pursue careers in aviation. It is our hope that recognizing Barrington Irving's achievement will encourage many more youth to reach for the same skies in which he made history. 
   Barrington Irving was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1983, and soon after moved to Miami, Florida. When he was 15 years old, he met Captain Gary Robinson, a Jamaican airline pilot who became a lifelong mentor, inspiring him to fly one day himself. 
   Enduring the challenges of growing up in inner-city Miami, Irving never let his dreams of becoming a pilot be stifled. He worked miscellaneous jobs to save for lessons, and eventually earned a joint Air Force-Florida Memorial University flight awareness scholarship to study aviation and take professional flying lessons. 
   Barrington took tremendous steps to pursue his dream in aviation while still a student at Florida Memorial University. 
   Mr. Oberstar, I am sure that a colleague of yours and a mentor of mine when I first came to Congress would be very proud of this young man, William Lehman, who at one time was in the same position as yourself as Chair of Transportation, developed the program at Florida Memorial University which allowed for a significant number of youngsters to achieve status as captains in aviation, many of whom have gone on to become commercial airline pilots and military pilots, and I am sure that Alabama Bill, as some of us know him, would be proud today. 
   The reason I mention it is this program, when Carrie Meek came to Congress, Kendrick's mother, she continued the efforts on this program, as did Kendrick and others. I guess it comes under the heading ``earmark,'' perhaps. And if that is the case, then I continuously urge my colleagues to review the status of things when responsible acts are taking place and they are being made to sound irresponsible because they are identified as earmarks. We need to be very cautious in this institution in that regard because we ignore a lot of time opportunities like in this particular case. 
   This young man contacted many companies and convinced the aircraft manufacturer Columbia to provide him with a plane to fly around the world if he could secure donations and the components.     
   After successfully securing donations, Barrington embarked on a 24,600-mile flight around the world from Opa Locka, Florida on March 23, 2007. Only 23 years of age, he was still a senior, majoring in aerospace, that program that I talked about that Bill Lehman helped to develop at Florida Memorial University, and he was a senior at the time he began this flight. 
   He traveled the world as an ambassador of aviation, teaching young people in 27 cities around the world about opportunities in aviation and the importance of academics. He returned from his journey on June 27, 2007, concluding his flight at the same small airport from where he began in Miami-Dade County, Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker and Mr. Chairman, this young man embodied the perseverance and dedication necessary to truly pursue one's dreams. 
   Barrington Irving deserves praise not only for his achievement, but for the continued community contributions of Experience Aviation, Inc., a nonprofit organization he founded to address the shortage of youth pursuing careers in aviation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Petri and the staff as we work on many initiatives to come that will reprioritize opportunities in aviation for our youth and promote achievement in all fields of human endeavor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just read, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1294, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2007. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate in the House, equally divided and controlled by the chairperson and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides something that has been long overdue to six Native American Tribes in Virginia.  
   After literally centuries of injustice, some 3,175 members of these great tribes will finally gain Federal recognition under this bill. Just like the great Seminole and Micosukee Tribes in south Florida that I am privileged to represent, these six tribes now have the chance to finally receive the proper recognition and respect they rightfully deserve. 
   Just like the other 562 Federally recognized American Indian tribes in the United States, these tribes will finally have access to basic services, such as child welfare services, adult care and community development, services every one of us in this body take for granted. 
   Each of these six American Indian tribes descended from the historic tribes that occupied the Virginia coastline in 1607. Their rich history and tradition forever ties them to this land. Over the centuries, they have survived racial hostility and State-sanctioned attempts to stamp out their heritage and cultural identity. 
   Notwithstanding their ancient bonds to this soil, they continue to walk oppressed among us. The reason for such injustice? Because in the early part of the 19th century, Virginia officials intentionally destroyed the majority of their historical records and artifacts that affirmed the existence of Native Americans in Virginia. Virginia finally recognized them in the 1980s, and it is appropriate and long overdue that Congress is finally following suit. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Native American tribes, whose land was forcibly taken from them centuries ago, are still struggling for their basic rights and freedoms to this day. I ask, does this story of repression, refusal and repudiation not ring true for so many generations of Americans? Now, it takes acts of Congress to give them the recognition they have long deserved. 
   Legislation providing Federal recognition for these six tribes, the Chickahominy, the Eastern Chickahominy, the Monacan, the Rappahannock and the Mattaponi is today what we seek and what for too long has been denied. I ask again how we reconcile this kind of repression and repudiation. 
   The Queen of England is in the United States today. Last week, she visited the coastline of Virginia, Jamestown, where many of these people that we seek to get designation for and recognition for today came from, and yet she would not have had an opportunity to see them in their cultural array for the reason that they are not recognized. 
   Legislation providing Federal recognition for these six tribes has been introduced in both the House and the Senate in every Congress since the 106th, without action. To deny them recognition once more is to perpetuate the tyranny. 
   The underlying legislation would be a small step in rectifying our Nation's history of suppressing these great people. I am proud to support this rule and the underlying legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute in order to respond to the gentleman. 
   And what would be wrong with that? I am reminded of the comedian Flip Wilson who said that when Christopher Columbus discovered America, the Native Americans must have been running down to the shoreline saying, ``Discover me.'' 
   Enough already. We have abused these people continuously. We put them on reservations, and now we would stand here in this body and argue that they are not entitled to designation? This particular set of tribes, all six of them, have gone to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and sought recognition there. And since the 106th Congress, we have introduced measures here, whether or not they gamble or didn't gamble. 
   They gamble in Connecticut, and they gamble in Florida. And this crazy Nation is going to gamble its brains out, but it ain't the Indians' fault. And if it is their fault, then they ought to have that right from what we took from them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Reclaiming my time, in closing now, on behalf of the six tribes that I believe we have a great opportunity today to finally bringing closure to their injustice. Indeed, in my view, Congress has a duty to end the suppression and provide these six Native American Indian tribes with recognition long overdue. 
   Number one, they were not recognized by the Federal Government. And if they didn't exist for a very long time, it was because of the Federal Government. And then when they tried to come back and say that we are going to meet all of these exacting requirements under the petition, who had destroyed their records, the Virginia government had destroyed their record. 
   What part of that don't you all understand, that these people can't make something out of whole cloth in a situation where their records have been destroyed? 
   How vicious can one situation be when you destroy the records of individuals and then ask them to corroborate and prove they exist? That is a virtual impossibility. 
   In this particular case, if there is one group of Native Americans that deserve an exception, and I might add they would be all six of these in light of the fact that systematically at every courthouse in Virginia every one of their records were burned or destroyed, and that was under the aegis of the authority of the Virginia government. 
   Give these people a break, if no one else. Now they have made it very clear that they do not intend, they forgo the right to gamble. And all things considered, I don't see my colleague from Connecticut and I don't see any colleagues from California and Nevada and me and others from Florida around turning the revenue back that is being produced. The State of Florida, for example, is about the business of trying to come up with better formulas so they can get more of the revenue that is coming into the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes. I suggest to you that Connecticut probably would be near bankrupt if it hadn't been for the Indian tribes and the revenue that comes into that State. 
   Somewhere along the line when you have taken from people, you ought to at least give them an opportunity to have the playing field level. And we are talking about in this case only 3,175 members, 562 Federal tribes have already been recognized. And yes, Mr. Shays, I think every other one of them ought to be recognized, including my ancestors that are Creek Indians. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION ACT OF 1998 AMENDMENTS -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to rise today in support of H.R. 2185, a resolution that I introduced with my good friend Congressman Mark Kirk and the bipartisan support of 30 other cosponsors. 
   I would like to first extend my appreciation for the hard work and efforts made by all parties who worked to craft this important bipartisan piece of legislation. Congressman Kirk and I worked closely with the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Office of Management and Budget, and Departments of State and Treasury on this bill. I thank each of these bodies for their input, cooperation and support. 
   This innovative program allows eligible developing countries to utilize all funds spent on tropical forest preservation toward foreign debt payments to the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2185 builds on the already successful and sound economic and conservation law, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, TFCA, of 1998. 
   For 7 years, the program created by that act has simultaneously accomplished two key goals: providing relief for the burden of debt on developing countries and promoting increased international tropical forest conservation. 
   The program's achievements speak for themselves. Since its inception, 12 ``debt-for nature swaps'' have been signed in developing countries in Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, generating $135 million in debt relief for these countries and conserving some 50 million acres of tropical forests. 
   Our legislation reauthorizes and expands this program. 
   By reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, the House is continuing to strengthen the indigenous economies and civil society of developing countries while protecting both the world's forests and endangered marine habitats. 
   Additionally, by continuing to protect our rainforests we are protecting future medicinal storehouses. The medicinal value of these rainforests cannot be underestimated. Today some 120 prescription drugs sold worldwide today are derived directly from rainforest plants. By conserving our rainforests, we are providing possible cures for life-threatening diseases. 
   By expanding this legislation, we are improving on an already responsible, sensible and successful initiative to conserve more ecosystems and relieve more countries' debt. 
   One of the most significant expansions we made to the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in this bill extends the program to apply to all forests, coral reefs and associated coastal marine ecosystems. Including coral reefs and related marine areas under the scope of TFCA will encourage the conservation of these endangered marine environments. 
   Coral reef ecosystems throughout the world face numerous threats and even possible extinction. Threats to coral reef, in turn, threaten the species and livelihoods that depend on them. Coral reef offers protections from storms, wave damage, and erosion and also provides various economic opportunities from fishing to ecotourism. 
   By providing incentives for developing nations to conserve their coral resources, we are in effect protecting coastal landscape's and maintaining coastal quality of water of some of the most important coral reef ecosystems in the world. 
   Another important alteration we made to the legislation expands the programs eligibility to additional countries. Current law forbids governments of beneficiary countries to be grant recipients unless there are ``exceptional circumstances.'' However, for many countries their governments are the sole managers of their ecosystems, thereby preventing them from receiving the funds. By increasing the Treasury Department's authority to provide funds to governments of beneficiary countries, our legislation extends the programs' eligibility to even more developing countries. 
   A final significant change we made to the program authorizes additional funding for audits and evaluation and allows these funds to be used for monitoring and administration. Increasing the funding amount allows the Treasury Department to better monitor all deals and improve oversight over the entire program. 
   Top notch strategies and technologies needed to conserve and protect our international ecosystems can be found right here in the United States. In my State of Florida, several institutions have long been at the forefront of efforts to preserve these marine habitats. 
   The Florida Aquarium, a non-profit education and research institution in Tampa, has developed cutting edge technologies and protocols for coral conservation including how to safely introduce cultural coral into wild reefs. Until the museum pioneered this technology, there was no viable solution to ``quickly'' rebuild destroyed and dying reefs. Developing countries participating in our debt relief initiative could greatly benefit from the museum's technology and expertise, and I strongly encourage these countries to seek out the museum as a resource in their efforts to rehabilitate coral. 
   The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, located outside of my district in Fort Pierce, does equally outstanding work to investigate the causes of and prevent coral reef degradation and deforestation. Dr. Brian Lapointe of the Center for Coastal Research at Harbor Branch has spent the majority of his career studying threats to the marine ecosystems in island nations such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Martinique and St. Lucia. He has successfully assisted these countries by helping them understand the effects of human impact on coral reef. 
   Dr. Lapointe and others at Harbor Branch Oceanographic have tirelessly worked to educate communities on rehabilitation strategies and future conservation techniques. People like Brian Lapointe and institutions like Harbor  Branch Oceanographic can help countries that get assistance through the Tropical Forest Conservation Act program to restore and protect valuable and irreplaceable coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. 
   This bill is a win-win-win situation. With the passage of this bill, Congress can further alleviate debt in developing countries, provide long-term sustainable financing for environmental conservation and protection for important world ecosystems, and advance medicinal research and increase United States assistance to developing countries and further our credibility overseas. Reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act provides numerous benefits to developing nations, to the United States, and to our planet. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Madam Chairman, yesterday in the Rules Committee I commented that democracies should be about tolerance. Democracies and religions should be about tolerance. 
   Today we get an opportunity to manifest our tolerance within the body politic of this country. And it is an important day, just as 1964 was an important day for passage of the Civil Rights Act. As one who has stood in this struggle with brothers and sisters throughout this land to make this country live up to all of the creeds that are our values, American values, we cannot nor should we ever permit discrimination in the workplace or anyplace. It is wrong, it is intolerant, and it is un-American. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with my friends, Ms. Barbara Lee of California and Ms. Corrine Brown of Florida, which emphasizes the need for HUD to place a greater priority on the security in our Nation's public housing communities. 
   Indeed, I applaud the work of Chairman Olver and Ranking Member Knollenberg, and I am very supportive of their bill. 
   However, a recent criminal act that occurred in the district that I am privileged to represent demands a response. I won't go into the details because it was a brutal act that was done allegedly by 10 young men in a project referred to, known as Dunbar Village. 
   Until 2002, there was a program at HUD that funded security and safety in public housing communities. A footnote right here: I recently spoke with the inspector of HUD, who informed me that you cannot have good public housing without good security. 
   However, in 2001, the Bush administration felt that the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program had a limited impact and did not reflect HUD's core mission. When the drug elimination program was consolidated with the public housing operating fund, a grant of $168,000 for securities services was cut just from the West Palm Beach Housing Authority, which overseas Dunbar village. 
   Mr. Chairman, this incident has demonstrated that the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program had a far-reaching impact in reducing all forms of crime in public housing facilities. 
   Our amendment sends a message to HUD to the tune of $20 million that the Department has a responsibility and the authority to fund security programs in public housing facilities around this Nation's communities. At this funding level, 10 percent of the $200 million increase in the account could fund security programs in over 100 public housing communities. These functions include employing security personnel, reimbursing local police for additional security services, making physical changes to improve security, funding community policing accreditation activities, as well as training and equipping voluntary tenant patrols. 
   HUD should recognize this amendment and the despicable incident, like the one that occurred in my district, and others around this Nation as clear indication that they need to do more to improve the safety in their facilities. Unfortunately, it takes violent acts such as the one that I have discussed for us to open our eyes and for Congress to begin reversing funding trends and program adjustments that have left our communities vulnerable. 
   This amendment does not place an undue burden on the desperately needed increase in the public housing operating fund. While all of the $200 million increase could be used for activities prioritized in this amendment, we rise today to call attention to the need for secure public housing. 
   Once again, I commend Chairman Olver and Ranking Member Knollenberg for their work on this legislation and including the $200 million increase in the public housing operating fund. It is our hope that this amendment is a welcome contribution to their work. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to begin demanding that incidents like those experienced by the residents of Dunbar Village never occur again. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today with Representatives Poe, Filner, and Bono to offer an amendment prohibiting the Federal Aviation Administration from eliminating, consolidating, colocating, or planning to consolidate or colocate any terminal radar approach control center, or TRACON. 
   Our amendment is virtually identical to the amendment that was overwhelmingly approved by the House in a bipartisan fashion by almost 100 votes just last June. Yet, since the House went on record of opposing further consolidation, the FAA has done virtually nothing to address our concerns. Even more, it has accelerated its consolidation efforts while shutting out stakeholders from the process. 
   Mr. Chairman, the TRACON system guides airplanes within a 50-mile radius of the airport on their takeoffs and final approaches. The FAA has embarked on an ambitious consolidation and colocation plan which will significantly limit our air traffic capacities in the future. I warn that this policy is shortsighted. 
   It is now rumored that the FAA's current consolidation proposal seeks to eliminate or consolidate nearly 50 TRACONs in over 30 States across the United States.     
   In some instances, entire States will be left without any approach radar system within their borders. In other instances, consolidation runs the risk of placing undue stress on nearby TRACONs already having to deal with larger airspaces and staffing shortfalls. 
   In Florida, the FAA is planning to consolidate the TRACONs of Miami International, Ft. Lauderdale International and Palm Beach International airports into one TRACON. Note that all three of these airports are within a Federal high-risk urban area, and smack dab in the heart of Hurricane Alley. 
   Once this plan is implemented, if a terrorist attack or natural disaster were to strike the Miami TRACON, then all three international airports would lose their approach radar system. Controllers in Jacksonville, an airport more than 350 miles away, will be forced to direct approaching aircraft throughout virtually the entire State. 
   Realize, Mr. Chairman, this is not a question of whether or not consolidation can technologically be done. It can be done and it is being done. On the contrary, this is a question of should it be done and what risk is Congress willing to run. 
   Further, in the instances where consensus is possible and consolidation could be appropriate, the FAA is still refusing to involve stakeholders in the process. To that end, this amendment appropriately exempts the TRACONs of Palm Springs and southern California from the limitation. 
   Opponents of our amendment likely will argue that the construction of some new control facilities, including one in my district, will be delayed and funds lost if we do not allow consolidation. To them I say, why can't we keep those funds available until all stakeholders can reach a viable solution? Congress does it all the time. 
   Some point to the FAA authorization bill as the appropriate place to address this issue. And I have great respect for the chairman of that committee with whom I've had a conversation. If that's the case, though, why do we keep throwing money at the problem in this bill? At the very least, we should tie this money to smart policy and a transparent process. 
   The FAA's TRACON consolidation runs the grave risk of leaving our air traffic system vulnerable during critical times and setting a dangerous precedent for a process that excludes stakeholders from decisions that impact their lives. This is not a risk that Congress should be willing to take. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, going forward, my colleagues argue that we would lose $110 million that expires at the end of this year for FAA. I remind my colleagues that this is the United States Congress, and I have been here when we have extended the kinds of funds that would be made allocable to agencies by time. If we wanted to, the $110 million that has been discussed could be extended for 2 or 3 years, and FAA could be delayed in that particular undertaking with reference to so-called modernization. 
   What they did in this particular measure, after we passed the measure last year, FAA then accelerated their process rather than sitting down and talking with the stakeholders such as the Members of Congress or pilots or air traffic controllers or airport operators or aviation operators and the general public; absolutely no discussion, and then put forward the measures that have come out now. That is the primary reason that I am on the floor. Sixteen thousand controllers and engineers believe this to be the case. 
   For the Record I will include a letter from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 99, the Fiscal Year 2008 Congressional Budget proposed by my esteemed colleague from South Carolina, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee JOHN SPRATT. I would specifically like to commend the hard work and expertise of my colleagues of the House Committee on the Budget that has brought forward this budget that prioritizes education, the environment, agriculture, health care, and positive international relations for the future of our Nation. 
   I never forget in my work within the walls of this House that I am my brother's keeper. To this end, I am willing to contribute financially what is necessary to complete that task. All citizens of America must take ownership of the vital services, which require Federal funding to maintain. 
   Mr. Chairman, every day in the House Rules Committee, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle propose legislation that has financial implications. I hear about necessary programs for veterans affairs, education, alternative energy development, health care, and every other possible issue, all of which cost money to implement. Interestingly, though not surprisingly, no one ever comes to Committee talking about giving money back to pay for their requests. You see, it costs money to provide the necessary services and infrastructure to our constituents. But it is clear that Republican opponents of Chairman SPRATT's budget are not willing to pay. 
   The Fiscal Year 2008 Democratic budget is fiscally responsible in its projections for revenue generation and ability to pay for necessary services for our constituents. While we may have inherited an economic mess from the former Republican majority, this budget will repair the damage inflicted to our economy and provide for a budget surplus by 2012. It is fiscally sound and domestically and internationally responsible. 
   Mr. Chairman, the House today has an opportunity to consider an alternative budget offered by the Congressional Black Caucus.  While I wholeheartedly support the budget prepared by Chairman SPRATT, I would also like to express strong support for the Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget brought forth by my friend Congressman BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia. I commend Congressman SCOTT and my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus for their work on this budget. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget meets a stringent test of fiscal responsibility by providing for a budget surplus of $141 billion in Fiscal Year 2012 while funding even more national priorities. More specifically, under Function 300: Natural Resources and the Environment, this budget allocates over $1 billion more than Chairman SPRATT's budget for Hurricane Katrina recovery, environmental justice, and national parks. Another key feature of this budget is that it funds the State Children's Health Insurance Program at a level that will provide insurance for every uninsured child in America. 
   Mr. Chairman, I could speak for quite some time about the phenomenal features of the Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget. I hope that all of my colleagues in this Congress recognize its innovation and merit as another possible means to overcome the budgetary challenges that were exacerbated by the former Republican majority. Both the Democratic and Congressional Black Caucus budgets are common sense solutions to the difficult financial situation with which we have been forced to deal. I urge my colleagues to support both plans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 764 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The resolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule makes in order an amendment offered by Representative Flake of Arizona. This was the only amendment submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't intend to speak for long about this legislation other than to express my sincere hope that this body will move forward expeditiously with its passage. Our Nation is greater because of its vast diversity and the living narrative of all those who contribute to it. However, make no mistake, our government has treated a number of cultural communities in a less than favorable manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are not here to debate the particulars of our Nation's dealings with Native Hawaiians. However, it is only right that all indigenous people should have a right to determine how they should interact with our government.  
   As my good friend from Hawaii, Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE, mentioned in the Rules Committee, the current system of land tenure for Native Hawaiians is organized under the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. This State agency does not meet the needs of Native Hawaiians in the most effective manner as it is currently arranged. What the community demands and needs is an entity in which the Native Hawaiians can be effectively engaged. Rightfully, this legislation will give Native Hawaiians an opportunity to create such an entity and empower themselves with self-determination. 
   I do want to make note of my concern that there are some in this body who are seeking to create controversy where none exists. Contrary to what some say today, this bill does not allow gaming on Native Hawaiian lands, nor does it lay the groundwork for gaming. On the contrary, it takes the necessary steps to put Native Hawaiians on the necessary path to control their destiny. 
   Additionally, similar legislation has passed the House in the 106th Congress and was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee in both the 107th and 109th Congresses. Unfortunately, the measure was never taken any further until today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides the appropriate framework for debate on this bipartisan legislation, which is the culmination of many years of negotiation. I have been in this body, and I have seen NEIL ABERCROMBIE, and now MAZIE HIRONO, and before, Patsy Mink, work actively on this particular legislation. 
   The lack of amendments submitted to the Rules Committee for this legislation is a testament to years of bipartisan collaboration. It is only right that we bring this legislation to the full floor today in this manner. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The underlying legislation enjoys the support of Hawaii's Republican Governor Linda Lingle, the business community in Hawaii, the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and Hawaii's entire congressional delegation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I customarily do not find myself on the floor after the close of business, but I am here today because I genuinely find myself in the position of concern that I believe a significant number of Americans share. 
   We have passed, out of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, a measure that will provide health care to many of this Nation's children who presently are uninsured. The President, exercising his prerogative, vetoed that  measure, and as a result of that, further discussions are ongoing, and the need, again, is to put forward a measure that will provide health care for 10 million children in this country that find themselves and their families without the necessary assistance for medical care. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President, on the day before yesterday, proposed that there be an additional $49 billion spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   There's no one in the House of Representatives who does not support the military efforts of the United States military. There's no one in the House of Representatives who is not exceedingly proud of the extraordinary work that the military has done. The military has done what the Commander-in-Chief required of them, and for those of us, as policymakers, expect that they would be able to do. 
   And quite frankly, one of my colleagues is preparing legislation that talks about the benchmarks that we had originally set for the military and the fact that the military, the U.S. military and the coalition forces have achieved all of those benchmarks. And, in short, we could not arguably say, with the removal of Saddam Hussein or with other temporizing measures that have been brought to various provinces in Iraq, that the military has not been successful. They have been. And when they come home we want them to receive the proud accolades of the American citizenry, and that's every Member of the United States House of Representatives. 
   But let's compare the cost in that particular effort with the cost for our children's health. Forty-one days in Iraq would provide health insurance for 10 million children. 
   Now, I don't know all of the nuances of the defense budget, but I have reason to believe that if we did not give all of the money as requested by the President that this particular effort could be run for a substantial period of time. 
   I might add, all of us are mindful of how stretched the United States military is. But you know something? Without knowing, I would venture a guess that some soldier's child may not be properly insured in this country. Some soldier's child. To my way of thinking, that is absurd. For us to be in the position, a Nation as resourceful as our Nation, a Nation as accomplished as our Nation, a Nation with genuinely the best physicians and nurses and hospitals in the world would find ourselves in this position. 
   We must pass SCHIP, and we must do so immediately.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Houston for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 287, a resolution, as has been stated by both my good friends, that celebrates the 500th anniversary of the first use of the name ``America.'' 
   I'd like to especially thank the original cosponsors that worked with me to introduce the legislation: Majority Leader Steny Hoyer; and the leaders  of the Americans Abroad Caucus, Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY and Congressman JOE WILSON.     
   I also want to thank the chairman and ranking Republican of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend, Chairman Lantos, and my good friend from Florida, we came here together, my colleague, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, for supporting this legislation and bringing it to the floor today. 
   Finally, I would like to express my deep appreciation to Representative ELIOT ENGEL and his staff for their help in moving this resolution forward. I would be terribly remiss if I did not mention a young man in my office, that this is among his first experiences, Alex Johnson, who found the work, not robbery, to bring this forward along with my legislative director, David Goldenberg. 
   It is important to recognize the collaborative community initiative that has emerged to commemorate this occasion. The Americans Abroad Caucus and the national initiative for similar proclamations in all 50 States coordinated by the America 500 Birthday Organizing Committee have established a foundation for this important resolution to be taken up for floor consideration today. 
   This resolution transcends the simple acknowledgment of the first use of a term on a map, but, rather, commemorates scientific achievement toward a shared understanding of the world. It is this world which increasingly exchanges culture, technology, and scientific advancement that thrives through shared understanding and the innovation we celebrate today. 
   When German cartographer Martin Waldseemuller first used America to identify a previously uncharted continent on his, previously mentioned by Ms. Jackson-Lee and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 1507 map of the world, I doubt that he truly realized the magnitude of his achievement. His choice of the term ``America'' to memorialize the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci shifted the geographical understanding of the world and established a term that would be attributed with symbolic identity in the centuries to come. 
   This symbolic identity is the source of pride that continues to motivate me and all of us to serve this great Nation. It is this American spirit which guides our role in the world and should motivate all Americans to work towards a renewed commitment to positive international relations. 
   My colleagues should know that the last remaining copy, and I believe Ms. Jackson-Lee pointed it out in her remarks, remains as a trust, as a top treasure of the Library of Congress. I would encourage my colleagues and citizens in this country to visit and see this treasure which established the geographical origin of the American identity. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Lantos, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, and Representative Engel for their work on this. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me to commemorate the origin of the term which has resulted in an international American identity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1239, the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Reauthorization Act. I introduced this legislation with my good friend, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle). 
   The widespread bipartisan support this legislation has received with 67 cosponsors and endorsement by the National Parks Conservation Association has demonstrated that black history is synonymous with American history as life experience shared by all citizens of America. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Mr. Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor, and I would especially like to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the subcommittee chairman, and his counterpart, Representative Rob Bishop, for their support. And my congratulations to Mrs. McMorris Rodgers on her recent addition to her family and her finding time to come and support this legislation as well. 
   With passage of this legislation, I hope that the National Park Service will give the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom its due priority with adequate staffing to maintain the growing network. Toward that end, I would also like to thank the staff of the respective committees who helped to expedite this matter. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I joined my esteemed former colleague, as did many other Members, and the person to whom I am referring is Representative Lou Stokes, in 1998, he led the effort to establish the National Underground Railroad to Freedom. I don't think any of us could have foreseen the emergence of the National Park Service as one of the largest stewards of black history in the United States. Nor could we have predicted the rapidly expanding support and interest for one of the most intriguing multicultural collaborations in the history of our Nation. 
   The Network to Freedom is a key feature that diversifies engagement in interpretive opportunities of our National Park System. It has grown to 300 programs, sites, and partners in 28 States and the District of Columbia. This network is a national treasure of historic buildings, routes, programs, projects, and museums with thematic connections to the Underground Railroad. 
   The legislation before us today appropriately adjusts the authorization levels for the Network to Freedom to reflect the growth of interest nationally, and the resulting expansion of opportunities. These adjustments will help to resolve the financial challenges facing the Network to Freedom that include the lack of consistent development grants and administrative support for affiliates. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill protects the interpretive interests of our National Park System by providing the necessary support staff and oversight for  the Network to Freedom to exist in perpetuity. It is time to take a stand for the future of our national parks and American history. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and preserve a vital asset to the history of our Nation, the Underground Railroad.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NETWORK TO FREEDOM AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1239, the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Reauthorization Act. I introduced this legislation in February with my good friend Representative Castle of Delaware as one contribution to the celebration of Black History Month. 
   The widespread bi-partisan support this legislation has received with 67 cosponsors and endorsement by the National Parks Conservation Association has demonstrated that Black history is synonymous with American history as a life experience shared by all citizens of America. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor. I would also like to thank Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and Representative Rob Bishop for their support and minor adjustments to this legislation to meet the needs of the National Park Service administration. With passage of this legislation, I hope that the National Park Service will give the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom its due priority with adequate staffing to maintain the growing network. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I joined my esteemed former colleague Representative Louis Stokes in 1998 to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, I do not think we could have foreseen the emergence of the National Park Service as one of the largest stewards of black history in the United Sates. Nor could we have predicted the rapidly expanding support and interest for one of the most intriguing multicultural collaborations in the history of our Nation. 
   In this polarized historical moment of American politics, remembering the Underground Railroad as a unifying narrative in our history could not be timelier. The sacrifice at the risk of death made by conductors and travelers of the Underground Railroad was an unprecedented contribution to the abolition of slavery. The contributors to this network included the members of the Society of Religious Friends, commonly referred to as the Quakers, as well as other concerned individuals. Thus, the Underground Railroad was one of the first synergistic partnerships that fostered the development of the thriving multicultural society that is the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Network to Freedom is a key feature that diversifies engagement in interpretive opportunities of our national park system. It has grown to 300 programs, sites, and partners in 28 states and the District of Columbia. This network is a national treasure of historic buildings, routes, programs, projects, and museums with thematic connections to the Underground Railroad. 
   The legislation before us today appropriately adjusts authorization levels for the Network to Freedom to reflect the growth of interest nationally and the resulting expansion of opportunities. As a part of a concerted movement to overcome the funding challenges that threaten all national parks, this legislation moderately expands the operating funds of Network to Freedom to an authorization for appropriations up to $2 million and establishes appropriate oversight for grant funds. These adjustments will help to resolve the financial challenges facing the Network to Freedom that include the lack of consistent development grants and administrative support for affiliates. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will protect the interpretive interests of our National Park System by providing the necessary support staff and oversight for the Network to Freedom to exist in perpetuity. It is time to take a stand for the future of our National Parks and American history. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and join me in preserving a vital asset to the history of our Nation: the Underground Railroad.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (SNOQUALMIE PASS LAND CONVEYANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Snoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act would transfer an acre and a half of Forest Service land to the King and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51--also known as Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue. This land would be conveyed at no cost, but would have to be used by the Fire District specifically for the constructon of a new fire station or it would revert back to the federal government. 
   Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue serves a portion of two counties on both sides of the Cascade Mountains along Interstate 90. This is a very rural area, with a small number of full-time residents, but it is also the major transportation corridor for goods and services between Eastern and Western Washington, as well as a destination for winter recreation. In recent years, this area has been the scene of major winter snowstorms, multi-vehicle accidents, and even avalanches. The Fire District is often the first responder to incidents in the area. 
   For decades, the Fire District has been leasing its current site from the Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was never designed to be a fire station. Through their hard work and dedication, they have served their community ably despite this building's many shortcomings. However, with traffic on the rise and the need for emergency services in the area growing, the Fire District needs to move to a true fire station. 
   They have identified a nearby site that would better serve the public safety needs of interstate travelers. This location would provide easy access to the interstate in either direction, reducing response times in emergencies. The parcel is on Forest Service property, immediately adjacent to a freeway interchange, between a frontage road and the interstate itself. The parcel was formerly a disposal site during construction of the freeway and is now a gravel lot. 
   I acknowledge that the Forest Service does not normally support conveyances of land free of charge. However, I believe an exception should be made in this particular circumstance because of the important public service provided by the Fire District, the heavy traffic and emergency calls created by non-residents in the area, the distance of Snoqualmie Pass from other communities with emergency services, and because of the high amount of federal land ownership in the area, which severely limits the local tax base. In fact, the Forest Service has acquired 20,000 acres in King and Kittitas counties at a cost of more than $52 million over just the last ten years. I would also note again that under this bill, this land would revert back to the Forest Service if for whatever reason a new fire station is not built on the property. 
   Passage of this legislation would not guarantee that a new station would be built--the Fire District would have to work hard to gather the financing that would be required from state and local sources, as well as any applicable federal grants or loans. However, the conveyance of this site at no cost would help this Fire District hold down the overall cost of this project. 
   I first introduced this legislation last year, with my colleague from Washington, Mr. Reichert. Unfortunately, the bill was not considered before the end of the last Congress. We reintroduced the bill in early March and were pleased the Natural Resources Committee held a subcommittee hearing on the bill in April to take testimony on the issues involved. At a subsequent markup of the bill last month, the acreage involved was reduced to acre and a half to address concerns that a fire station would not require three acres. With this change, the bill was approved by voice vote in committee. 
   Last week, at a meeting in the region, several environmental interest groups expressed reservations about the conveyance. Over the next several weeks, it is understood these groups will meet with the Fire District to discuss their concerns. I am committed to working with my colleagues from Washington state in the Senate, as well as the Natural Resources Committee, to facilitate these discussions to ensure we have the public safety infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of this unique area. I am confident this can be done with little or no impact to the environment. It is my hope that the parties can reach agreement on this issue by September when  the Congress will reconvene and can resume work on the legislation. 
   I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee to review this issue and bring this bill forward. I look forward to continuing to work with the community at the Pass and my Washington colleagues to improve public safety in the area.

   Let me tell you, I heard my other colleague, Mr. Sessions, talk about all this wonderful bipartisanship that took place for 12 years. Well, I have been here 14, and all I know is rancor and disagreement and very little in the way of bipartisan spirit that has been engendered here in this body. 
   But let me talk about this business about closed rules. It was understood that in the ``Six for '06'' that the rules would be closed. I assure you, and everyone else has, that there will be more open rules than you provided. You had 195 total rules in the 109th Congress. Twenty-two open rules. Twenty-two open rules, 20 of which were appropriations bills, only truly open. And you had 50 closed rules, 67 restrictive rules, 26 conference report rules and 30 procedural rules.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the Rules Committee for yielding to me. 
   I think my friend from Arizona raises issues, and sometimes it is not clear with reference to earmarks. I don't recall hearing too many people argue about the earmarks that the President of the United States has within the prerogative of the President. Two-thirds of Federal spending is nondiscretionary. And in a budget the size of ours, which is $2.9 trillion, that means discretionary funds in this particular budget are about $935 billion. 
   What they fail to do in their point of order or that we hear in the Rules Committee is to say to the general public that the name of the Member requesting the earmark exists, the name and address of the intended recipient, and if there is no specifically intended recipient, the intended location of the activity, the purpose of such earmark, a certification that the Member or spouse has no financial interest in such congressional earmark, and it requires the House Appropriations Committee to make open for public inspection approved earmarks. 
   Now each of these earmarks has an asterisk and each of these earmarks is easily identifiable. Clearly, there are things that people disagree with as to whether or not in the particular constituency that that constituency is going to benefit. 
   Democrats cut in half the number of earmarks. I believe my friend from Arizona knows that when this measure was sent to the Senate, the Senate increased the number of earmarks that are here. But I don't care whether you call it earmark, toe mark, arm mark, elbow mark, whatever it is, it is something that benefits the American people. And in a budget that has $2 trillion in it, we can find some reason for us to control that as opposed to the executive branch.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Well, you helped make those rules, my good friend. Perhaps you didn't utilize the fact that you did as a draft. But in either event, I take it that I have made my point and you have made yours. 
   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, many of the changes to House rules that our Republican colleagues did make in 1995 and subsequently, in my opinion, were good ones and some of them we have kept. Proxy voting in committees was eliminated. That was an excellent reform. We have kept it. It is in our rules package. You gave the Speaker emergency power to recess the House and convene in another place in case of a terrorist incident. That was a good reform, and it is in the package that we have offered. You prohibited public works projects being named for serving Members of Congress. That always kind of bothered me, and I am glad that you got rid of it, and it was a good reform and it is in our package. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, title I, I think, is pretty straightforward. I think we should all be able to agree on it, and the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee has indicated he agrees. They are the Republican rules of last Congress that today's majority agrees with, draft or no draft. We will get to the changes later. But title I are the rules that today's minority wrote 2 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   You know the rules. I agree with you that that draft that you are talking about came from the 109th; but all I am suggesting to you is that you are not surprised by anything in title I, because you participated in writing it and, therefore, I think that the record should reflect that, notwithstanding the fact.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Thank you very much, Ms. Slaughter, and thank you very much for your leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have appended to this podium the faces of 90 people who never should have lost their lives in this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I voted against using troops in Iraq more than 4 years ago, I believed then, and still believe today, that this was not a war of necessity, but rather for the Bush administration a war of choice and convenience. As we have learned since that vote, the concern that I and others had was, indeed, justified. 
   Today's vote is not a vote on supporting our troops. After all, there is no choice when it comes to supporting our military. We all stand by them, Republicans and Democrats alike, especially when they are in harm's way. 
   But should we send our troops into battle without proper body armor? For over 4 years the Bush administration has said ``yes.'' Democrats have said ``no.'' 
   Should we force our troops into second and third and fourth tours of duties with shortened times in between those tours? The Bush administration continues to say ``yes.'' Democrats say ``no.'' 
   Should we welcome home our troops with inhumane conditions at our VA hospitals around this Nation, not just at Walter Reed, and a shortchanged veterans health care system? The Bush administration says ``yes.'' Democrats say ``no.'' 
   Should we stay the course of rhetorical arguments filled with fear and deception, like I have heard here today? Or should we finally start holding this administration and the Iraqi Government accountable? For over 4 years the Bush administration has said ``stay the course.'' Democrats and the American people demand accountability and a plan to bring our men and women home. 
   Choices arise only when we start asking ourselves the real questions about how we can best support and protect our troops. On these issues, there are very clear choices between the Bush administration's ``stay the course'' stubbornness and the Democratic plan for accountability.     
   This bill is not the end-all-be-all when it comes to getting us out of Iraq. It is not the long-term solution which  so many of us crave. But it is the first step, a very necessary step, on the road to holding the administration and the Iraqi Government accountable and bringing our troops home. 
   Many Democrats did not vote for this war, but make no mistake about it, one way or another we will end it. Incidentally, whatever happened to exit strategy? Most importantly, we will do so in a manner that enhances our security here at home and contributes to the restoration of order and stability in the Middle East region and throughout the world. 
   This is an excellent rule, Madam Chairman, and the bill that has been fashioned by the Speaker and the leadership of this House is a correct start to adhere to the wishes of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is aimed at combating corruption in energy-exporting countries and promoting a global energy security. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have held a series of hearings on the issue of global energy security. I offer this amendment today as a culmination of findings from those hearings. 
   This amendment encourages international participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and similar efforts. This amendment will increase the accountability of where our energy comes from by urging international disclosure of energy transactions and requiring the Secretary of State to submit an annual report on EITI compliance. It also states  that it is the power of the United States to decrease reliance, energy reliance on corrupt foreign governments. 
   I thank Chairmen LANTOS and DINGELL and my colleagues of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and the staff of the Helsinki Commission, and mine, for their anticipated support. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and the underlying legislation.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the H.R. 3221, the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. The purpose of this amendment is two-fold: to combat corruption in energy-exporting countries and to promote democracy and the rule of law in these countries as well. 
   In my capacity as Chairman of the bipartisan, bicameral Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), I have held a series of hearings on the issue of global energy security in the 110th Congress. The topics of those hearings have spanned the vast diversity energy concerns of the 56 CSCE member nations. I offer this amendment today as a culmination of findings from those hearings. 
   The United States is the world's largest consumer of oil, accounting for 25 percent of global daily oil demand, despite having less than 3 percent of the world's proven reserves. As a result, we are increasingly dependent on foreign sources of energy. 
   Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, the countries that the U.S. has become dependent on for that energy are not reliable politically. In fact, only two of the world's top 10 exporters, Norway and Mexico, are established democracies. The non-democratic exporting countries face political instability, which pose a serious threat to the supply and transit of the oil and gas that America runs on. 
   While it is imperative that we work to limit our dependence on foreign oil and change the dynamic of supply and demand, it is just as important to create more stable and reliable sources of energy. As the National Petroleum Council recently reported, ``There can be no U.S. energy security without global energy security.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment meets our objective of global energy security by supporting international participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and similar efforts. This amendment also urges these countries to establish domestic reporting requirements for all companies that purchase natural resources or make payments connected with the extraction of such resources to increase the accessibility of these transactions for accountable monitoring. 
   My amendment further requires that the Secretary of State submit to the Congress an annual report which details the United States' own participation in the Extractive Industries transparency Initiative, as well as our bilateral and multilateral diplomatic efforts to further global participation in EITI. This annual report would also entail other U.S. initiatives to strengthen energy security, deter energy kleptocracy, and promote transparency in the extractive industries. 
   Finally, my amendment states that it is the energy policy of the United States ``to increase energy security by decreasing energy reliance on corrupt foreign governments.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, in order to have a comprehensive energy security policy for the nation, we must develop a complete strategy to improve transparency and accountability in oil-exporting states. My amendment will do just that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying legislation.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. There is a requirement for countries to participate in the extractive industries reporting. 
   Basically what we are doing is, for the first time, asking the Secretary of State to encourage countries to participate in EITI. EITI is to be renewed on September 30. And if we nudge some countries, without mentioning names, some of them may very well determine to participate. That way we will have more assurance of our energy supplies and try, as best we can, not to participate in the future with foreign corrupt governments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my very good friend and cosponsor of this resolution, Representative Crowley, for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution on the floor is the culmination of longstanding efforts I have made with Representative Wexler, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe; Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Representative Mark Kirk; and many others to open the largest closed Holocaust-era archive in the world and release critical Holocaust records. 
   As I stand today in support of a resolution making this significant event in Holocaust history, I cannot help but reflect on the longstanding life and career of a true champion of human rights and Holocaust issues, the former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the first and only Holocaust survivor Member of Congress, Representative Tom Lantos. 
   These archives will forever contribute to the world's collective memory of the Holocaust atrocities experienced and the immense bravery exhibited by Representative Lantos and his wife and other survivors who are no longer with us today. 
   The opening of the Bad Arolsen archives will enable Holocaust survivors, their descendants, and future generations of researchers and the public access to some 50 million records on the fates of 17.5 million individual victims of Nazi brutality. 
   In our world today, filled with growing international intolerance, including anti-Semitism, hate, racial bigotry, xenophobia, and religious discrimination, it could not be more critical for us to ensure unfettered access to these Holocaust archives. The ultimate release of these documents serves to further delegitimize world leaders and other extremist factions who spew anti-Semitic propaganda and downplay or deny the significance of the Holocaust. 
   I am thankful for the collaborative efforts and leadership shown by the Holocaust Memorial Museum, new leadership of the International Committee of the Red Cross at the International Tracing Service, the State Department, survivor groups, and this body of Congress to pressure the member states of the ITS to throw open the doors of these archives. 
   Our success sends a robust message to the world that the horrors of the Holocaust shall forever remain at the forefront of our collective and individual memories. The ultimate release of these archives proves that the world recognizes the moral importance of combating the scourge of modern-day anti-Semitism. 
   May we never forget the atrocities of the Holocaust. May this historic event serve as a constant reminder to the world of what happens when humanity is silenced and evil permitted to wage war on the innocent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would have the gentleman know that the earmarks that he refers to are clearly delineated in this conference report. 
   This point of order is about whether or not to consider this rule and ultimately the funding of vital education, health, and veterans programs. In fact, I would say that it is simply an effort to try to kill this conference report and, in my view, on a faulty premise at that. 
   Every single earmark in this conference report has been properly disclosed in conformance with House rules. This parliamentary ruse won't work because these programs are too important to the health and vitality of the Nation. 
   With this conference we keep our commitment to our veterans with the largest single increase in the 77-year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also invests in critical domestic priorities in the Labor, Health, and Education bill with major investments in K-12 education, college affordability, increasing access to quality health care, medical research, worker protection, and job training programs. Voting ``no'' on this question of consideration will prevent consideration of this package, which has strong House and Senate bipartisan support. 
   Furthermore, the parliamentary maneuver that my good friend chooses to use today to stop this legislation is completely transparent. Just so that we keep the record straight, Madam Speaker, the changes proposed in the Boehner discharge petition that our Republican counterparts seem so eager to have adopted would not cover any measure not now covered by our earmark rule, clause 9 of rule XXI. As a matter of fact, Mr. Boehner's resolution does not even include the projects that are covered by House Resolution 491, which was introduced by our majority leader, Representative Hoyer, and is now in effect. 
   So despite whatever roadblock the other side tries to use to stop this bill, we will stand up for America's hardworking families and America's veterans. We must consider this rule and we must pass this conference report today. 
   Madam Speaker, I have the right to close, but in the end I am just going to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to consider the rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Such earmarks are marked with an `X' in the list below.'' 
   If that ain't transparency, I don't know what is. All of them have the ``X'' mark, the asterisk, and are clearly following the spirit of the law. 
   When the Republicans were in charge, they had 14,000 earmarks, and nobody knew where they were, where they came from, when they came. And now we have them in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 794 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3043, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration. The conference report also includes the House and Senate compromise on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. 
   The rule includes two additional provisions. The first provides that only the majority leader or his designee can move to proceed to consider H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. It addresses a procedural motion under the trade act and is often adopted by the House, including three times during the last Congress alone. The second ensures that in the event that the Senate on a point of order strips out the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs provisions from this conference report, that the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion of the report will not be further delayed and, instead, sent immediately to the President for his signature. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and the underlying conference report. Of all the conference reports which Congress will consider, the vote on this one will be the most telling. It will be the most telling because Members will have an opportunity tonight to take an up-or-down vote on the needs of our children and Congress's commitment to America's veterans. Members are either for $5.1 billion in mandatory increased funding for veterans military benefits or they are not. They either support  $1.1 billion in increased funding for Pell Grants or they don't. We are either for restoring the President's $287 million cut in job-training programs for the unemployed or we are not. 
   Do you support $530 million in increased funding for VA hospitals and other medical facilities, or do you oppose the funding increase? What about Head Start? The conference report includes $154 million in increases in funding for this critical early childhood education program. Low-income energy assistance programs? There's a $250 million increase in funding for these programs, which ensure that millions of Americans are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. 
   How about the National Institutes of Health? The conference report increases funding for this vital agency by $1.1 billion so that America will continue to be the global leader in medical research and technology. Or Ryan White AIDS programs? There's an $85 million increase for them. I am especially appreciative of this increase because of the continued epidemic that HIV/AIDS poses throughout south Florida and particularly in the district that I am privileged to represent. All of these priorities and many more are funded in the underlying conference report on which Members will have an opportunity to cast a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' vote if this rule is approved. 
   Democrats promised, Madam Speaker, that we would govern differently than the previous majority, that our legislation would reflect not the ideological views of a few, but the priorities of the many. Moreover, we vowed to work in a bipartisan fashion. This is exactly what we did with this conference report, as indicated by the numerous Republican Senators spanning the ideological spectrum who signed the conference report. 
   Finally, we promised earmark reform, and that is what is done in this report. After Republicans spent 12 years increasing the number of earmarks to more than 14,000, Democrats cut the number of earmarks nearly in half in this conference report. Perhaps most importantly, we have made available for public viewing earmark disclosure statements, and any new earmarks placed in this conference report are clearly marked and in full accordance not only with the letter of the law but also its spirit. I am proud that we kept our promise for transparency and reform. 
   Madam Speaker, the importance of this conference report transcends partisan politics to address the disparities that exist in the competition to meet our human needs. The programs in the underlying legislation prioritize the livelihood of citizens from all walks of life and helps those individuals live at a standard that should be expected in the greatest Nation on Earth. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying conference report. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   What we have heard from members of the minority regarding their opposition to American priorities is nothing new. After all, it was their manufactured obstructionism in this body and the other that delayed this bill and has continued to delay the remaining appropriations bills from being signed into law. 
   Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle announced that they would oppose this conference report long before it was ever written. The President, using his misdirected, ill-conceived and ideologically driven policies as justification, has been threatening to veto this bill for literally months. 
   Shame on them. Shame on them for refusing to support the malnourished and the sick. Shame on them for voting against providing energy assistance or for low-income families. Shame on them for voting against making it more affordable for kids to attend college and obtain an early childhood education. Shame on them for not supporting increased funding for military housing. 
   Shame on them for passing measures and not funding them. Shame on them for opposing increased funding for veterans health care. Shame on them for voting to send our troops into harm's way but refusing to take care of them and their families when they got home. There is no smoke and mirrors here; there is no required reading between the lines and nuancing. This is a vote about priorities. Today's vote on this conference report will be the most telling of them all. 
   I ask my colleagues and vigorously urge them to support this rule and the underlying conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my full support for H. Res. 942, a resolution that recognizes Black History Month as a time to acknowledge the many contributions that African Americans have made in our Nation's history and as a time for all Americans to fully understand the events and struggles that shaped our great Nation. 
   When Aristotle said, ``If you would understand anything, observe its beginning and its development,'' he suggested that we cannot fully know what something is if we do not know its past. This certainly holds true for our country. Knowing our Nation's history does more than tell us who we were; it tells us who we are. And if we look honestly at our past successes and mistakes, it tells us what we can become. 
   Unfortunately, the long practice of omitting, abbreviating, and misrepresenting African Americans in American history has resulted in an incomplete and skewed story of our country's history. Fortunately, the social change of the civil rights movement inspired a change in the way that America told and understood its history. It became clear that American history--like America's schools and lunch counters--needed to be integrated. 
   Over the years, Black History Month has become a chance to realize our rich diversity by studying the artistic, scientific, and political contributions that African Americans have made to the United States and the rest of the world. Realize Black history is American history, and February should not be the only time that we acknowledge the contributions of African American men, women, and children in U.S. history. African Americans have played a key role in just about every single moment in American history, and it is high time that our history books reflect that. 
   Driven by my commitment to the human and civil rights of all, I have worked hard to ensure that all people--regardless of their nationality, sexual orientation, gender, or race--have access to their most basic rights. My experiences in and before I came to this body have taught me that all people have influenced our country's greatness. It is critically important that these contributions are acknowledged and retold. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we observe and celebrate the contributions of African Americans in America we must not forget that we are making history as we speak. We are living in an historical era in which extraordinary people from all walks of life are seeking opportunities that were previously not available to them. Outstanding Americans such as Barrington Irving, the youngest and first person of African descent to fly around the world, teach us that we can achieve great things in this land of opportunity as long as we have the will and drive. As we all know, for the first time in history, the two contending candidates for the Democratic nominee for President are a black man and a woman. 
   As we reflect on the numerous contributions and experiences of African Americans in this country, we must be cognizant of how we as a modern multi-ethnic and multicultural nation deal with the issues of our time. How we do this will determine how future generations will view us in the history books. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. 
   You know, for over a year now the Intelligence Committee and Members of this body have been in negotiations with the administration regarding FISA. When I hear my colleague talk about it, I know that, in the realm of the American public, she's persuasive enough to make it appear that there's something that's happening that is dreadful and America's about to be attacked because we don't have sufficient information that we are receiving from those persons who would do us harm overseas. 
   The simple fact of the matter is that Jane Harman, the former Chair of this committee, and Bud Cramer have been actively involved. It is not as if nothing has been going on with reference to FISA. 
   I don't have that same fear. I serve on the same committee that she does. I have every reason to believe that the negotiations are not causing this country to not receive the information that is necessary; and if anyone would argue that this Nation's FISA program is not under courts at this particular time and that the issue is that the administration wishes to move it from under the courts, then I would have them to know that there needs to be greater discussion. 
   One of the things that has happened is some of the stuff we can't talk about is being nuanced, and I rather think that that is not the way to go about trying to change a law. Yes, it's important that we receive the information about those who are going to do us harm, if they can. And, yes, it's important that we be able to intercept their foreign-to-foreign communications. But to give the general impression that there is this necessity that it be done yesterday is not what the reality is.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my good friend from Ohio for yielding. 
   If it is that we must say that my friend from New Mexico, Mr. Speaker, is to receive credit for a discussion of FISA, it should also attend the facts that for over a year the Intelligence Committees of this Congress have been in negotiations with the administration regarding matters having to do with FISA. 
   Just so we assure everybody that the matter of FISA is on the agenda, it will be taken up before we leave. And I can only say that there are many of us in this body who do not feel that it is inappropriate to establish an appropriate entity for oversight, no matter where information may be coming from. 
   The thing that I wish to dispel is that there is no reason for us to be fearful of us not having information that is needed. It is true that the Director of National Intelligence has said that there are matters that we may be missing. But there may be matters that we may be missing even if we fix FISA if we hurry to judgment and not do it correctly. 
   So civil liberties are important to Americans. Civil liberties are paramount when it comes to our consideration of gathering information. We don't want to troll and catch some American citizens and have their information poorly used. 
   Now, I don't know about anybody else, but there is one provision that considers giving the Attorney General this power and not courts. If it was this Attorney General, then I'm awfully glad that we're in the present posture that we're in, because I would not want this Attorney General making those decisions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1298 provides for consideration of H.R. 2176, a bill which provides for, and approves, the settlement of certain land claims of the Bay Mills Indian Community. 
   In lieu of the substitute reported by the Committee on Natural Resources, the rule makes in order the substitute printed in the Rules Committee report. The Rules substitute consists of the text of H.R. 2176 with that same language and the text of H.R. 4115 as reported by the Committee on Natural Resources. That bill provides for, and approves, the settlement of certain land claims of the Sault Sainte Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. 
   This is a fair rule, and it gives the proponents and opponents of the two Michigan Indian land claims bills a straight up-or-down vote on the bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation seeks to settle a land claim agreement which was reached in 2002 by the then-Republican Governor of Michigan John Engler and the two tribes. The current Democratic Governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm, has also approved the deal. 
   Under these bills, both tribes have agreed to relinquish their claims to land in Charlotte Beach, located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, in exchange for a parcel of land outside of Port Huron, Michigan. The agreement reached between the tribes and the State allows the tribes to conduct gaming on their new land. 
   If approved by Congress and the President, this agreement secures the private ownership rights of the Charlotte Beach land in question and will help to restore the fair market value of the land. It will also provide the two tribes with an opportunity to help create jobs and economic opportunities in Port Huron while further providing for their membership. 
   The underlying bill conforms with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and the land being given to the two tribes was selected by the State of Michigan as appropriate places for economic development. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation is nothing new. Under the Constitution, only Congress--not the Department of the Interior or a Federal court--holds the power to settle Indian land title and claims. As such, Congress has taken similar action in at least 14 different instances in recent years when there have been disputed land claim settlements. Not once in those instances did Congress prohibit a tribe from conducting gaming on the tribal lands. We also never forced a tribe to jump through hoops to exercise its right to do what it wishes on its own land. I see no reason why we should start now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have little doubt that today's debate on this issue will be both spirited and intense. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that the House will do the right thing and pass this rule and the underlying legislation.     
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I am forever amazed, Mr. Speaker, at my colleagues' way of going about trying to assert something into measures  that we are dealing with, that, when all is said and done, don't have anything to do with the measure that we're dealing with. 
   I agree with my colleague that we have a serious crisis in this country having to do with energy policy. But I also would urge him to understand that the President's energy policies have failed this country and that when he and his party were in the majority and had an opportunity to do all the things they are talking about, that many of them were not done. 
   The fact is there are 68 million acres offshore and in the United States that are leased by oil companies. They are open to drilling and are actually under lease but are not developed. The fact is that if oil companies tapped the 68 million Federal acres of leased land, it could generate additional oil, six times what ANWR would produce at its peak. The fact is 80 percent of the oil available in the Outer Continental Shelf is in regions that are already open to leasing, but the oil companies haven't decided it's worth their time to drill there. And, when they are saying it's not worth their time, they are saying they don't have the equipment to do it. The fact is that drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield any oil for a considerable period of time in the future, probably as many as 8 to 10 years, and then would only save the consumer less than 2 cents per gallon in 2025. 
   All of us know all the things to say here. We know to say ``switchgrass'' and ``shale'' and ``geothermal'' and ``solar,'' and we could go on and on and on with the number of potentials for alternative energy. But yesterday, when we tried to do something about price gouging, it was the minority party that defeated the measure, that was on the floor of the House, under suspension. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, back to the bill. I support gaming in this country. I support the MGMs and the Harrah'ses of the world and their right to run a casino wherever legally they may be permitted to do so. I support the Seminole Indians and the Miccosukee Tribes in Florida that I am proud to represent. And I support and have supported continuously their right to run a casino. I also support Jai Lai in my community and their right to run a casino. I also support casinos in my community and their right to run a casino, just like I support these two tribes in Michigan as well. I also support competition and economic development and the job creation it can spur. And I take full exception to my colleague from Lansing, who is a dear friend of mine on the other side who spoke earlier. I can attest to job creation in the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribe areas that were told that there would be no jobs created, and literally thousands of people, mostly not Native Americans, are working in those establishments. 
   Finally, I support all of us in this body coming to terms with what happened to Native Americans, Africans, and people of Caribbean descent and others after Columbus discovered America in 1492. I'm always reminded of Flip Wilson's comedy routine that he did that, if Columbus discovered America, then the Native Americans must have been running down the shoreline, saying, ``Discover me.'' 
   So, before Members of this body start talking about Indian tribes unfairly swapping pieces of land, they should remember that the land wasn't ours in the first place. We took it from the tribes and then often relocated them to some far-off, remote, and undesirable place that we could find for them to be placed. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not an ideal situation for any of us in this body. We all wish that a unanimous agreement would have materialized in Michigan. Yet, despite a land claims compact being reached by the State and the tribes, a Republican and Democratic governor, some just don't want this agreement to go through, and that is their prerogative. Thus, as it has done at least 14 times in the recent past, Congress must do what is right and settle this dispute. When an injustice has been done and there are efforts to perpetuate that injustice, something must be done. Someone must step in and stop it from happening again. 
   I urge my colleagues to do just that and to support the previous question, the rule, and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3521, PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 974 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 3521, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule makes in order two amendments printed in the Rules Committee report accompanying this resolution. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased that the rule makes in order an amendment offered by my colleague from Florida, Representative Kendrick Meek. His amendment ensures that in extreme cases where HUD is forced to take over control of a housing authority, it must honor any and all existing agreements between the local housing authority and tenant associations. This amendment is needed in sou th Florida and throughout the country, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the skyrocketing number of foreclosures and the lack of affordable housing are some of the greatest financial problems our Nation faces today. In Broward County, the county in which I live in Florida, foreclosure rates tripled in 2007 alone. It is obvious this situation has grown beyond a crisis and extends into our entire economy. 
   One group of service providers that is suffering significantly from this econo mic crisis is our public housing authorities. For this reason I support this rule and underlying legislation that will provide flexibility to public housing authorities during our Nation's housing crisis so that they are able to sufficiently meet the needs of our constituents. 
   There are approximately 3,300 individual public housing authorities in the United States serving 1.2 million households. Low- and middle-income individuals and families making between 50 percent and 80 percent of the median income level in their community are eligible for Federal assistance. Without this assistance, literally millions of people would be homeless or in some cases even worse. Despite this known reality, HUD recently issued a ruling which will result in funding cuts for over 800 housing authorities throughout the country. If the House does not act, then 26 percent of the housing authorities in the United States will lose significant funding because of HUD's decision. To make up for the anticipated funding shortfalls, t he underlying legislation gives housing authorities the flexibility to transfer funds from their capital to operational accounts. This move will ensure that housing authorities will not be forced to close down existing public housing units because of HUD's short-sightedness. 
   Finally and importantly, the legislation also reaffirms the role that tenants play in determining where they live and how those communities are governed. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the problems addressed in this legislation are not the only obstacles public housing authorities have been forced to deal with over the last 7 years. As my colleagues know, the current administration has a long record of failing to meet America's low- and middle-income housing needs. For example, funding shortfalls have become regular staples in the President's public housing budgets, while the administration continues to neglect the more than $18 billion backlog in deferred maintenance for public housing units, allowing the deterioration of public hou sing units to the point that many of them are completely uninhabitable. This is simply unacceptable. 
   In my district some housing units are literally falling apart. Roofs are leaking and in some instances even caving in. Appliances are broken and decades, not years, old. Units are deteriorating, unattractive, and lacking in some of the most basic amenities. Even more is that security in many of the public housing communities has been consistently disappearing. Residents in some public housing units in my congressional district alone are literally afraid to leave their homes. 
   Yes, we are working to address these and other public housing issues. But we will not be able to fully address these issues if the underlying legislation does not pass. 
   Mr. Speaker, this housing bill was reported out favorably by the Financial Services Committee, the whole committee, by voice vote. The minority members of the committee did not offer any amendments during markup, and not one Republican amendment was submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   It is my sincere hope that the House will pass this rule and underlying bill with that same overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007 as we work to improve public housing throughout America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am hard put to move hurriedly, so I will yield myself such time as I may consume. I am also hard p ut, Mr. Speaker, to restrain myself and not get involved with the ongoing discussion and the numerous ads that I saw during the previous recess that were very much in error concerning the House of Representatives' actions on the FISA legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I served for 7 years on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. I find it hard to believe that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or that anyone, would believe that the distinguished Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Silvestre Reyes, the distinguished Chair of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, the distinguished Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, their counterparts in the United States Senate, all combined would want to put this Nation in jeopardy in any way. 
   Enough of the fearmongering. Enough of making people think that something is going to happen that is not going to happen. The simple truth is that there will be legislation that will be legislation fashioned by the House and by the United States Senate and not by the United States Senate and not by this administration without those of us who have actual concerns about the United States Constitution having our say in that regard. 
   Civil liberties and civil rights are critical to America, and the foundational aspects of our country allow full airing before conclusions are made by people that have oriented the most secretive administration that I know of in the history of this country. 
   I won't go much further on that score on the previous question, Mr. Speaker. I return now to what we have heard about why we must pass this rule and the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act, which we are here about today. It is nice to have the nuances. It is nice to have the process. It is nice to have the procedural opportunities that the minority takes, and correctly they can bring up those matters which are not on the agenda today. I can assure my friends on the other side that the Speaker of the House of Representatives and those i n this body, including the Blue Dogs, will address FISA legislation, and it will be appropriately undertaken to protect every American, every American's civil liberties and civil rights, and more important, to protect the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve an opportunity to improve their lives. Transitional public housing opportunities have served this purpose for decades, nurturing families and yielding such leaders as some of us who serve in this Congress. Public housing authorities must be empowered to effectively and flexibly manage their assets with appropriate tenant oversight. My colleague on the other side mentioned private sector tools. I am fascinated by the notion that the private sector, which all of us respect, has been so careful with all of their management. If their management has been so succe ssful, why is it, then, that there is a housing crisis in this Nation with reference to foreclosure? 
   This morning, Mr. Speaker, and I take the liberty of doing this because occasionally we come to the floor and talk about different matters, but a distant cousin of mine in Fort Worth, Texas, called me. Her name is Sharon Samuels. And Sharon shared her story with me about her involvement with her mortgage company, Countrywide. She has been in her home since 1993, she said, and in addition, thereto, had ne ver taken out any of her equity out of her home. She has three children, all of them that she has managed to educate. And she was pursued by Countrywide to enter into a mortgage set of circumstances that has now led from her mortgage rising from $1,100 to $2,200 and foreclosure proceedings going forward without any forbearance or opportunity for her to do anything  other than lose all of her assets that she had developed during the years since 1993. I mention that because that is the private sector th at has put an individual in a home, in a position of being in need of this kind of stuff that we are talking about here today. Hardworking Americans families should not suffer as a result of HUD's failed policies. 
   I applaud my colleagues for joining together in this effort that will benefit the low-income families, the elderly and the disabled Americans who live in public housing. This bill has been endorsed by all the groups that represent not only public housing administrators and agencies but also te nant advocacy groups. The bill is supported by the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, the National Association of Housing and Development Officials, National Housing Law Project, and the National Training and Information Center. 
   But guess who doesn't support it? Some people on the other side of the aisle who had an opportunity in the Financial Services Committee to offer amendments if they so choose, and they chose not to do so, and yet the y will come here today and say that we are lacking on our side of the aisle in providing the necessary standards and providing the necessary tools for people to live in public housing. 
   Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, I ran for the United States Congress, and among the things that I said was I would try to improve public housing in my congressional district and throughout this Nation. I don't feel that I have succeeded. Twelve of those years have been spent under Republic administrations that were controlled by Republicans, 12 years in the House, 8 years just now, ending soon, happily, in November so that these $18 billion backlogs and so that housing won't collapse and fall down around people. 
   This is the same administration that didn't answer in New Orleans. But what have we done? In the limited time that we are here, and I continue to hear criticism about what we have not done. What we have done in the House, we passed the section 8 voucher reform program that increases the number of families, veterans, and seniors that are able to afford safe homes by adding 20,000 new vouchers. We did expand the Homeownership Act of 2007 that allows the population of borrowers to have access to the Federal Housing Administration. In this House we have passed the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, which creates a fund to use and build more affordable housing for low-income families and families who have lost their homes to foreclosure.     
   They keep saying that the agenda isn't good. We passed the Housing Finance Reform Act and expanded the size of loans that can be issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We passed the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act that increases transparency and heightens standards to keep brokers from practicing predatory lending. Save us from these people who argue that asset management is a landmark program change now several years in the making? You bet it is. 
   What I don't understand is why is it poor people are always the ones that have to take it right on the chin every time this Nation gets itself in a crisis. The National Training and Information Center sponsored by La Raza; the Center for Community Change; the Chicago Rehab Network; Cleveland Housing Tenant Association; Fall River Housing Joint Tenants Council; Legal Aid Justice Center; Miami Workers Center, all sorts of organizati ons. I will include all of the letters of all of the organizations I have for the Record.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just read, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1361, the Relief for Entrepreneurs: Coordination of Objectives and Values for Effective Recovery, or RECOVER, Act of 2007 under a structured rule.  
   Continuing our ongoing efforts to provide the minority with opportunities to amend and improve legislation on the House floor, the rule also makes in order all three Republican amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, as someone who represents a district which has been victim to countless natural disasters, I have known about the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program for quite some time. 
   Businesses in the district I am privileged to serve and the district of my good friend Mr. Diaz-Balart and throughout South Florida have relied on this program to sustain themselves during the difficult days, weeks and months following natural disasters. Loans provided under SBA's disaster loan assistance program have, at times, literally kept Florida's economy going. 
   While I have seen the greatness of this program, Mr. Speaker, I and my constituents have also seen its shortcomings. Indeed, the problems addressed in the underlying legislation, and I commend the Chair's recommendations and their efforts in that regard, but the problems are not new, and they certainly were not created by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita or Wilma. On the contrary, they have manifested for quite some time and have been raised by me and many of my colleagues in Florida over the years. 
   In Florida, we saw SBA's limitations during the 2004 hurricane season. By no fault of its own, SBA was inundated with loan applications and overwhelmed by the situation. Long delays in application processing and slow disbursements of approved loans led many in my part of the country to question why Congress didn't do anything at the time to increase the Small Business Administration's capacity during disasters. 
   Although it took the largest disaster of our time for us to open up our eyes, I am pleased that this Congress under this leadership is giving the SBA the tools that it needs to keep America's small businesses in business after a disaster. 
   The RECOVER Act enhances the SBA's capacity to provide assistance during and after natural disasters. The legislation mandates that the SBA establish and maintain a comprehensive disaster plan which will be overseen by a new associate administrator for disaster assistance. 
   Using FEMA's citizen volunteer program as its model, the underlying legislation establishes a disaster reserve corps capable of providing the people-power necessary to respond to an influx of SBA loan applications. 
   The RECOVER Act improves SBA's customer service operation and increases the limit of SBA disaster loans from $1.5 million to $3 million. It also expands the scope of organizations which can qualify for such loans and makes it easier for businesses to pay back their loans. 
   The bill also requires improved disaster response coordination between the SBA and FEMA. This is a critical, yet unfortunate, requirement of the bill. Critical because coordination during disasters across agency lines is desperately needed; unfortunate, notwithstanding of the fact that these things are going to occur, I am dumbfounded that our agencies aren't already coordinating to the maximum extent possible during disasters. 
   I have participated in the conversations, sat in the meetings where coordination between agencies is nonexistent during disasters. Turf battles supersede logic, and coordination is a distant memory of the past. 
   I ask: Why does it take an act of Congress to get Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts when authorization for such coordination already exists? The only turf that matters and should matter during disasters is the turf of the American people. 
   We have to be in the business of providing our citizens with every available resource to respond to and recover from disasters. The underlying legislation does just that. 
   I am proud to support this rule and the underlying legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, disasters in this country are not limited to hurricanes or the Southeast. As I was saying yesterday in the Rules Committee, the chairwoman had storms in her district earlier this week, and there is massive drought going on in parts of this country. All of these are disasters and all of these have major SBA implications. 
   I have lived, and continue to live, in disaster-prone areas, like so many others in Congress and in this country. If our failures of the past have taught us anything, it is that we can no longer be response oriented when it comes to disasters. 
   Mitigation and planning saves money, saves time, and most importantly, saves lives. 
   The RECOVER Act creates a comprehensive and universal plan at the SBA for disaster response. It is the first step on this important path to improving the Federal Government's response to disasters. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule, the previous question, and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (CEECEE ROSS LYLES POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6772, a resolution designating the post office located at 1717 Orange Avenue in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the ``CeeCee Ross Lyles Post Office Building.'' As a cosponsor of this legislation, I would like to like to express my appreciation for the effort of my good friend from Florida, Congressman TIM MAHONEY, for introducing this important legislation. He and I share the privilege of representing Fort Pierce in the House. 
   Through the designation of this post office we honor the memory of Ms. CeeCee Ross Lyles. Ms. Lyles was a flight attendant aboard United Flight 93 on that fateful day, 9/11 over 7 years ago. Shortly before the plane crashed, Ms. Lyles called her husband to tell her that she loved him. While her time on earth was cut short by terrorists, her memory will live on in our community. This post office designation will forever commemorate the life of Ms. Lyles. 
   Ms. Lyles was a true Fort Pierce Floridian through and through. She was born and raised in Fort Pierce and later served as a police officer for 6 years there. In 2003, the City of Fort Pierce erected a statue of Ms. Lyles in the Liberty Garden at Veteran Memorial Park. 
   The legislation before us today ensures the memory of Ms. Lyles and all other 9/11 victims live on in our collective memory. I urge swift passage of this legislation to properly recognize and memorialize the heroes of 9/11 and the life of Ms. CeeCee Ross Lyles.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (SUPPORT FOR THE MUSEUM OF THE HISTORY OF POLISH JEWS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 3320, introduced by my friend and colleague, Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. This bill would authorize the United States to provide $5 million to assist in the development of the permanent collection of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. 
   This past May, I had the opportunity to travel to Poland and, while there, met with Jerzy Halbersztadt, the director of the museum, and Ewa Wierzynska, the deputy director. The museum they are helping to establish is truly an historical undertaking and one that deserves the support of the United States. 
   Warsaw was once home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, and if we are to truly understand what was lost in the Holocaust, we must try to wrap our minds not only around the figure of 6 million, but around the 1,000 years of Polish Jewish life that preceded that tragedy. Poland is not only a place where Jews died, but a place where they lived and flourished. Moreover, it is estimated that 80 percent of all Jews and over nine million Americans trace some of their ancestry to the Polish Jewish community. This museum has the potential to touch the lives of our own citizens in deeply personal ways. 
   As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am heartened by the educational role this museum can play in fulfilling the goals that the OSCE participating States have undertaken in the field of combating anti-Semitism. I believe this museum will contribute to tolerance and mutual respect in Poland, will help counter the broader phenomenon of anti-Semitism in Europe, and will serve as an inspiration to the thousands of visitors who will come every year. The historical record of the Polish Jewish community must be preserved and shared with future generations. 
   Unfortunately, my own schedule did not permit me to return to Poland for the June 26 groundbreaking ceremony for the museum, which will be located in the heart of the pre-World War II Jewish district and next to the monument to the Jews who resisted the Nazis during the 1943 ghetto uprising. However, I did send a member of the Helsinki Commission staff, who witnessed firsthand the extraordinary turnout for this event. Among those present was the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv Meir Lau, whose parents were from Poland and who suggested that invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust, be among the first to visit the museum. 
   I don't know if the Iranian President will accept this invitation, but I have no doubt that many Americans will be among the 500,000 people who are expected to visit the museum on an annual basis. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this extraordinary museum, with an extraordinary mission.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 2895. I commend Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters and the full committee for their work on this legislation, and particularly the work of Ranking Members Bachus and Biggert as well as those that I have complimented. 
   The purpose of my amendment is to include flood and disaster specific insurance counseling in the home ownership counseling criteria for beneficiaries of the trust fund. 
   I know that we're all concerned about the current instability in the housing market, and increasing foreclosure rates around this country, and especially in places like where I live. One of every 50 households in my congressional district have filed for foreclosure already this year. All of us know that that's unacceptable. 
   Mr. Chairman, the unfortunate truth is that many of these foreclosures have come from a lack of financial literacy and limited understanding of all the costs associated with owning a home. In many regions of our Nation more prone to disasters, appropriate insurance is one of many added costs of homeownership that can push people to the edge.     
   And when you are on the edge, staying in your home or returning to your home after a disaster rests on having the right insurance. 
   I don't even need to point out to the Members the tragedies of withheld insurance from many of the victims in Hurricane Katrina. Knowledge of the specifics and nuances in disaster and flood insurance policies will encourage further financial empowerment and homeownership stability among our Nation's most vulnerable populations. 
   I urge Members to support the amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment reflects homeownership counseling criteria which I initially included in the Workforce Housing Act of 2006, a bill which I introduced last year. 
   While my legislation from the 109th Congress focused on developing mortgage down-payment accounts and other development incentives, local and state housing trust funds have also been very effective in providing access to affordable housing. I applaud the approach of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, which will take these local successes even further. 
   Once again, I commend my friends Chairman FRANK and Chairwoman WATERS for shepherding this legislation to the floor and considering my contribution to their fine work. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.  
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I assure the Chair that I shall not use all 5 minutes, but I do wish to take cognizance of the fact that Ms. Waters is not here today. I am handling this amendment as her designee. She is in Jena, Louisiana today along with thousands of others who are mindful of continuing injustices in this country. They are demonstrating to highlight those injustices. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a simple clarification of the language in section 807. This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a working group to review FAA proposals to consolidate FAA facilities and services and make recommendations to Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  
   This amendment is a simple clarification of the language in Section 807. This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a working group to review FAA proposals to consolidate FAA facilities and services and make recommendations to Congress. This working group will include individuals who represent FAA employees, air carriers, general aviation, and the airport community. The FAA may not realign or consolidate FAA facilities and services until Congress has had an opportunity to consider the working group's recommendations as well as public comments. The purpose of this section is to ensure that FAA consolidation cannot take place without the input of affected stakeholders, the public and Members of Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California, Representative Waters has concerns about the FAA's consolidation of FAA regional offices. The FAA has nine regional offices serving airports in all 50 States. One of these offices, the Western-Pacific Regional Office, is located in Hawthorne, California, in MAXINE WATERS' congressional district. My home State of Florida is served by the Southern Regional Office, which is located in Georgia. 
   Last year, the FAA consolidated administrative and technical support services in the regional offices. The previous year, the FAA consolidated financial accounting services in these offices. The FAA did not seek or accept input from Congress, regional office employees, or the affected communities prior to consolidating these services. 
   It has come to our attention that the FAA is currently considering plans to consolidate the engineering services in the regional offices. However, no public comment has been requested by the FAA, despite the fact that engineering services are critical for the safe operation of air traffic control towers. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would clarify that Section 807 applies not only to the consolidation of FAA field offices and air traffic control facilities, but also to the consolidation of FAA regional offices and the services they perform. This amendment would ensure that proposals to consolidate the FAA's regional offices will be subject to the same open and transparent process as proposals to consolidate other FAA offices and facilities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (URGING ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRACING SERVICE TO EXPEDITE RATIFICATION PROCESS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend and an original cosponsor of this resolution, Representative GARY ACKERMAN, for the time. 
   Let me first say how grateful I am for the bipartisan cooperation and support of many House leaders to ensure that this important legislation was promptly brought to the House floor. 
   In particular, I thank the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative TOM LANTOS, a true champion of this issue, and so many others in the international forum. I also thank the ranking member of the committee, and my fellow Floridian, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN. Both of them were critical in moving this bill forward. 
   I am also deeply appreciative of the tireless commitment to justice and fairness of the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, my colleague and very good friend from Florida, Representative ROBERT WEXLER. Representative Wexler not only held a critical hearing on this matter in his subcommittee, but also shepherded the resolution through the full committee. 
   And of course, I applaud the Republican cosponsor of this bill, my friend, Representative MARK KIRK, for his commitment to this issue. Both of these individuals have been instrumental in bringing this issue to the forefront of the United States Congress. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, very occasionally we don't mention our young staff people, but Eve Lieberman, in my office, had an awful lot to do with the work on this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, appallingly, 62 years after the concentration camps of Europe were liberated, Holocaust survivors, their families and researchers still lack immediate, unfettered access to the Holocaust archives located in Bad Arolsen. 
   This important legislation follows upon previous efforts I made, with Representatives WEXLER and KIRK, to open the archives. Earlier this year, I led bipartisan congressional letters to several European countries urging them to swiftly ratify the agreement to open the archives. 
   I was also privileged to testify at a hearing on this issue, along with Holocaust Museum experts, the State Department and Holocaust survivors. Since that hearing took place last month, and the letters were penned, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that the United Kingdom and Germany have ratified the treaty. 
   Indeed, our efforts are paying off. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done. 
   In our world, filled with anti-Semitism, hate, racial bigotry, xenophobia and religious intolerance, it is imperative to expose the horrors of the Holocaust to all humanity. 
   When the leader of Iran hosts numerous Holocaust denial conferences, and others in the world attempt to legitimize it, it could not be more important to open these Holocaust archives. 
   The majority of the member countries of the International Tracing Service have been derelict in their obligations under the amendments to the Bonn Accords which they signed last May. These amendments require full and open access to the archives. Shamefully, it remains unclear when these countries will fulfill their obligations. 
   If European countries are actually committed to closing this dark chapter in world history and combating modern day anti-Semitism, then they must ratify these amendments immediately. 
   With every day the archives remain closed, Holocaust survivors who have suffered some of the most unimaginable and tragic horrors and terrors are being forced to suffer even more. It is unconscionable that these individuals are now the ones burdened the most by unwarranted bureaucratic delays. 
   In passing this legislation, Mr. Speaker, the House is proving its commitment to this issue, and that it is watching the remaining European nations to ensure their expeditious ratification. The short time left for the remaining Holocaust survivors does not afford us time to deprive them of this critical information any longer. 
   Next month I will attend an anti-Semitism conference in Romania. It will be my great hope that by that time the other countries have ratified this matter. 
   I thank my friend from New York, Representative Ackerman, for the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my friend from New York for yielding me the time.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 624, a resolution that I introduced with my good friend and fellow cochair of the Democratic Israel Working Group, Representative Gene Green. 
   I first want to thank my very good friend and cosponsor of this resolution, who yielded time to me Representative Ackerman, for his steadfastness not only on these issues, but of issues of critical import for foreign affairs of these United States. 
   I would also like to thank the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend, Representative Tom Lantos, and the ranking member of the committee and my colleague from Florida, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for helping move this important bipartisan bill forward, and my longstanding good friend today who spoke favorably today of this measure. I thank Representative Wilson for his comments on this legislation and others, as well. 
   On June 19, 2007, for the first time ever in history a representative of the State of Israel was chosen to chair a United Nations committee. This resolution serves to properly mark this unique triumph for the State of Israel in our history books. The man chosen for this distinctive appointment at the United Nations is Mr. Ron Adam, the former director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry's U.N. Political Affairs Department. The committee he was chosen to chair is the Committee on Program and Coordination. This 33-U.N. member body provides an important role to the functioning of the United Nations, approving the work plan for all United Nations agencies and bodies. 
   Madam Speaker, since it first joined the United Nations in 1949, the democratic State of Israel has been considered a second-class nation at the United Nations, unfairly subjected to unjustified repeated one-sided attacks from other nations. To this day, Israel is still denied full representation within the United Nations and its constituent agencies and bodies. Meanwhile, other rogue and repressive regimes, in violation of United Nations human rights principles, are afforded full rights and privileges. 
   The United Nations should not and cannot continue to be a vehicle for unilateral attacks against Israel. Such dealings truly undermine the United Nations' credibility, integrity and effectiveness. Shamefully, anti-Semitic rhetoric and sentiment within the United Nations remains pervasive. Such statements are of grave concern to the United States and responsible nations. 
   I want to commend both past and present United Nations leaders for publicly recognizing and speaking out against the existence of blatant biases and injustices within the United Nations walls. Despite the targeted discrimination and unwarranted hate it faces within this international forum, Israel has consistently played an active role within the United Nations. Israel already sits on several significant committees in the United Nations, and representatives from Israel have served as deputy chairs in the United Nations numerous times. 
   I am hopeful that Mr. Adam's appointment to chair the CPC will help normalize Israel's bilateral and multilateral relations. I am also hopeful, as has been expressed by Representative Ackerman and Representative Wilson, that Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations will work to end the unfair vilification of Israel at the United Nations and to use his good offices to support Israel's bid to join the Asian regional grouping. Finally, I am hopeful that Israel will be granted membership on the Security Council for 2019 and gain full participation rights in the United Nations. 
   I am but one member of this institution. I know I speak for Gene, who probably is en route here, who has some other feelings by virtue of our cosponsorship of this matter. I urge this administration, as Gene Green and I have and others, to do everything it can to see Israel's ascension in the United Nations. 
   Israel's new appointment is the beginning of a new dawn for the nation's status within the United Nations. I congratulate the government and people of the State of Israel for this great accomplishment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker I rise today as a proud original cosponsor of House Resolution 107, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah since last summer. 
   The critical bipartisan legislation being introduced today calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the three Israeli soldiers who were captured last summer. Ehud Goldwasser, 31, and Eldad Regev, 26, were kidnapped by Hezbollah on July 12, 2006. Gilad Shalit was kidnapped by Hamas on June 25, 2006. 
   Moreover, my cosponsorship of this legislation follows up on the July 29, 2006 letter I wrote to American Red Cross Interim President Jack McGuire urging the American Red Cross to apply pressure to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to look into the well-being of the three Israeli soldiers. My colleague, Canadian Senator Jerry S. Grafstein, wrote a similar letter. 
   To date, Gilad is the only captive Israeli soldier to have been confirmed to be alive by his captors. Hezbollah has not given any indication as to whether the other two Israeli soldiers they captured are injured or even still alive. Contrary to the most basic standards of humanitarian conduct, Hamas and Hezbollah have prevented access to all of the Israeli captives by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
   I and all in this country, resent terrorist groups who use human life as a strategic tool to further their radical agenda. In calling for the release of these Israeli prisoners, the United States stands with Israel and sends a united message to terrorists that their fanatic behavior will be unsuccessful in deterring a Middle East peace. 
   I support the efforts the Israeli government has thus far made in attempting to gain the captives' release. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and her fellow ministers, as well as Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, have continued to raise this issue at the highest levels in their diplomatic meetings. 
   These three brave soldiers have been held hostage without medical attention and without communication or access to their family for far too long. The United States Congress has not forgotten these men and will make every effort to secure their freedom. The Shalit, Goldwasser and Regev families should know that I and the United States stand by them and pray for the return of their sons.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY OF ROME -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues in supporting H. Res. 230, a resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which was signed on March 25, 1957. The Treaty of Rome established a customs union--formally known as the European Economic Community--among six countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Today, that customs union is known as the European Union, and now includes 27 countries spanning the length and breadth of Europe. Most importantly, it has grown into an institution that inspires countries to be their better selves. 
   If one travels to Europe today, it may be hard to remember that, 50 years ago, the continent was still recovering from the second of the two world wars it had unleashed in less than half a century. It may be hard today to recall or imagine the magnitude of devastation that still scarred farmland and cities alike. It may be difficult to conceive of the bitterness, anger and thirst for revenge that bled across the continent like the blood of those fallen in war. The fact that Germany, a country that had unleashed a war of aggression against its neighbors just a few years before, was included in this new ``community'' was really nothing short of a minor miracle. 
   Moreover, fifty years ago, Europe was still riven in two--no longer by a shooting war, but by a cold war. While a small group of nations was beginning the slow process of rebuilding their own countries and forging transnational relations based on cooperation, mutual trust, and mutual benefit, another part of the continent had fallen under the boot of communist dictatorship, where the Soviet Union exploited its neighbors, striping them of wealth, prosperity, and opportunity for generations. Just one year before the Treaty of Rome was signed, the Soviet Union underscored its opposition to any independent foreign or economic policy on the part of East European countries--a message unequivocally sent by its invasion of Hungary. 
   As the years passed, and the success of the European Economic Communities became ever more apparent, it is no surprise that more countries joined this union. Membership in Council of Europe, the European Union's sister organization and home of the European Court of Human Rights, helped pave the way for membership in the EU. Meanwhile, the NATO alliance created a zone of military security where the post-war citizens of Western Europe could build a zone of financial security. 
   Since the fall of communism, there is no doubt that the aspiration of joining the European Union, much like the goal of joining the NATO alliance, has helped focus the attention of many countries on overcoming their past differences for a larger, common good that also brings substantial benefits to their own citizens. Today, I commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and the new vision it held for the European continent, one that has helped spread peace and prosperity to nearly 500 million people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1213 provides for consideration of general debate for H.R. 5658. This debate will come under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 2 hours of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. The rule waives all points of order against the bill's consideration except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. 
   As the chairwoman of the Rules Committee announced yesterday evening, the committee intends to meet later today to report out an additional rule which will provide for the remaining consideration of the bill, including amendments and final passage. 
   This two-part process has been used over the years to ensure that the Rules Committee has ample time to consider the amendments submitted to the committee, and there were a substantial number of amendments offered. 
   Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most comprehensive and important pieces of legislation that the House considers each year. The overwhelmingly bipartisan support for this bill is proof that we understand our obligation as legislators to support our military and ensure our national security by coming together and producing quality measures. 
   I am proud that the chairman and ranking Republican of the Armed Services Committee introduced the underlying legislation together. Chairman Skelton and Representative Hunter are to be congratulated for a job well done. Without their work, the unanimous support for the bill with a vote of 61-0 in the Armed Services Committee would not have been possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, for too long, President Bush's administration has neglected the needs of our military. I was just in Baghdad 2 days ago, and I saw evidence of this neglect. While the President has shown little hesitation to send troops into harm's way, his refusal to take care of them and their families when they return is downright despicable. 
   The underlying National Defense Authorization Act gives our servicemen and -women and their families the resources that they need and deserve. That includes providing a 3.9 percent pay raise for all servicemembers and expands the authority of the Defense Department to offer bonuses. 
   This bill takes care of our soldiers and their families by increasing access to financial aid for education, expanding survivor benefits, and enhancing health care services. And it rejects President Bush's proposal to inflict $1.9 billion in TRICARE fee and premium increases and other increases in health care costs for soldiers. 
   The bill also strengthens our national security by providing our troops with state-of-the-art equipment and authorizes the expansion of the military. 
   It includes fiscally responsible provisions that are designed to increase efficiency and accountability in the military. 
   The bill cracks down on the Blackwaters of the world and requires the Department of Defense to put into place policies and systems under which contractors are held accountable for their actions. 
   The underlying legislation also addresses the issue of readiness. Our Armed Forces are hurting today because we continue to ask them to do more with less. 
   Under this bill, Congress is making it clear that at least one of the three branches of government will not allow rhetorical and ideological policies to stand in the way of doing the right thing by our troops. 
   We continue to send our brave young men and women into battle without proper equipment or protection. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes nearly $800 million for personal body armor, as well as $2.6 billion for mine resistant ambush-protected vehicles for our troops in the Middle East.  
   Finally, the bill prohibits the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, requires the Iraqis to invest in the reconstruction of their own country, and I, for one, have emphasized this repeatedly since the beginning of this adventure in Iraq. And this bill provides funds to help train both Iraqi and Afghani security forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, no one political party holds a monopoly on national security. The underlying legislation is clear evidence that, under new leadership, Congress is addressing the needs of our armed services. 
   America cannot afford to continue to make the same mistakes we have made in the past. The stakes are too great, and the world is too dangerous. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Democrats were elected to the majority in 2006, we promised America that we would govern responsibly, with conviction and in a bipartisan fashion. 
   The Duncan Hunter Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, named appropriately after our colleague from California, is a bill that is a perfect example of all three of these things. It is further proof of how things have changed here in the House in a very short period of time. 
   The bill continues the necessary cleaning up of the mess created by the Bush administration by modernizing our forces and restoring readiness to our military. It gives our Armed Forces the tools they need to get the job done abroad while taking care of our soldiers and their families here at home. 
   This is a good rule for a great bill. I urge my colleagues to support both.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, if we have learned anything from the failures of the war in Iraq, it is that reliable intelligence is critical to ensuring America's national security. The terrorist attacks of September 11, combined with the continuing threats fueled by extremism, radicalism, hopelessness and poverty underscore the importance of this legislation. 
   The new Democratic majority is working every day to ensure that we congratulate our intelligence community for its successes but also hold it accountable for its failures. This report is a strong step in the right direction, and it enjoys bipartisan support. I am proud of our product and hope that my colleagues will agree. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 270 provides for consideration of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour 20 minutes of general debate. One hour is to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except those arising under clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Homeland Security shall be considered as an original bill for purposes of amendment and shall be considered as read. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill. 
   Importantly, the rule makes in order the eight amendments printed in the report accompanying this rule and waives all points of order against such amendments. The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report and by the Member designated in the report or his or her designee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to commence debate on this very essential piece of legislation. Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 11. While we in this body have done a great deal of talking about Homeland Security, our record on the issue suggests otherwise. 
   Under Republican control, the majority maintained that mandating certain security enhancements was not necessary at the time. Democrats, on the contrary, believe that they are and will not allow this need to go unmet any longer. 
   The fact that this bill was reported favorably out of the Homeland Security and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees with near unanimity and the cosponsorship of the ranking Republican member of the Homeland Security Committee suggests that our concerns are almost universal in this body. 
   Moreover, this rule makes in order a total of eight amendments, half of which will be offered by the Members of the minority party. The rule and the process further prove that Democrats refuse to allow partisanship to supersede our responsibility to protect the American people. 
   Congress's prior reluctance to mandate certain security enhancements out of fear that it might rock the administration's boat has left us woefully behind the curve when it comes to rail and mass transit security. That is why I am very pleased that the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act makes the necessary investment in these absolutely critical enhancements. 
   The bill requires that the administration develop a security plan for all forms of covered transportation. The bill also creates a system and methods under which all agencies tasked with the responsibility of protecting our country can work together. 
   We don't stop there. The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to expand its coordination network through enhanced communication and cooperation at all levels of government. 
   It requires DHS to develop security training programs for railroad and public transportation employees and extends whistleblower protections to all providers, public or private, who provide covered transportation services. 
   Under this bill, the number of surface transportation security inspectors will increase by six times by the year 2010, and the bill mandates that the administration issue regulations requiring enhanced security measures for the shipment of security sensitive materials and requires that these shipments not go through highly populated areas.     
   Perhaps most importantly, this bill pays for these improvements and authorizes $7.3 billion in security enhancements to make America safer. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office has determined that the United States must provide much more leadership and guidance in constructing a rail and security transit plan. This bill answers that challenge and fills the void left by the administration's failure to secure all modes of transportation in this country. 
   It, just like the rule, is worthy of the support of this body. I urge my colleagues to support both. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. And I would say to my friend from Florida that, in his concerns about the motion to recommit and the time to see it, I am sure my friend is mindful that when a motion to recommit comes to the House floor that it comes without the Members of the House having had an opportunity to know the substance of the motion to recommit. 
   I might add, that period of time, particularly in the last 2 months, we have seen that when the minority has presented the motion to recommit, that what winds up happening is even Members of the minority don't know what is in the motion to recommit. Therefore, it seems more than reasonable that a sufficient amount of time be given for that purpose. And I also think in the interest of fairness that we have been considerably fair in accepting more motions to recommit than have our friends in the minority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I listened with great intensity to my friend from Florida regarding the resources that the American public provides to the United States Government for its distribution. He seems to decry the fact that this year we are going to spend $7 billion on rail security. My ultimate question would be, What did you spend on rail security last year, the year before, the year before and the year before that? 
   Somewhere along the line, I believe that the American people want us to  make sure that our rail system and our bus system are as secure as we can make them. This is a start in that direction. 
   I also heard my friend from Orlando say that the rule itself is the most egregious that he has seen in 15 years. Well, I have been here every one of those 15 years that he has been here, and if he wants to see egregious, then travel with me back to the 4 years in the minority that I was on the Rules Committee, and I will show you egregiousness.     
   Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission gave the Transportation Security Administration a C-minus for its efforts to develop a security strategy for all modes of transportation. GAO, as I previously mentioned, has said that the U.S. has failed to provide the appropriate leadership in enhancing all forms of covered transportation. 
   Something needs to change. This bill provides the necessary leadership and funding to move us forward. 
   For too long, Congress has neglected its responsibility to do whatever is necessary to protect the well-being of the American people. This is a fair rule. It gives four amendments to the minority and four amendments to the majority; hardly as egregious as the many times no amendments were granted to the minority when Democrats were in the minority. 
   I urge my colleagues to support both the substantive legislation and this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 269 provides for consideration of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007, a closed rule providing 1 hour of general debate in the House, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill and against its consideration except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the bill shall be considered as read. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to speak very long about this legislation other than to express my sincere hope that this body will move forward expeditiously with its passage. 
   As my colleagues know, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act was placed on the Suspension Calendar last week after being unanimously voted out of the Committee on Financial Services by a voice vote. It was our hope, and the hope of so many Native Hawaiians, that the House would support it with as much enthusiasm as did the committee of jurisdiction. 
   Unfortunately, as we all now know, there are some in this body who believe that it is in their best interest to create a partisan divide where no such division should exist. They have in my opinion falsely accused my friends and representatives from Hawaii of ulterior motives, and in doing so, have delayed justice and fairness to some of our most loyal citizens. 
   Contrary to the false accusation made by its opponents, this bill is not a bill aimed at achieving Native American status for Native Hawaiians, no matter how important that issue may be. 
   This bill provides low-income Native Hawaiians access to the American Dream. They, just like all of us in this body, have had at one point in our lives a dream to own a home. This bill brings them one step closer to realizing that dream. 
   Shame on those who continue to paint this bill as anything other than what it is. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation which is so critically needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   I appreciate very much my friend's attitude with reference to this matter and his suggestion that he would accept the representation of our two colleagues from Hawaii as well as me and other members of the Rules Committee. 
   I would also urge that your concerns, albeit, I believe, likely to be taken care of on another day, have been addressed by the committee that reported this out unanimously, meaning the Republicans and the Democrats on the relevant committee voted this matter out. 
   I would also urge that the Hawaiian State legislature has indicated that there are no intentions at all to seek any special status; and the Governor of Hawaii, who is a Republican also, has made it clear that no special status is sought. 
   Toward that end, it would seem to me that this matter, having been supported, had the enjoyment of the support of 262 Members last week, and that is a total that I hope we will reach today, because this legislation is desperately needed. This is an issue of fairness and access. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this appropriate rule and the underlying legislation and to clearly understand that it has nothing to do with citizenship and everything to do with housing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be bringing this bill to the House floor today. This minor change in House rules represents a major step forward for the nearly 5 million Americans whose voice is not currently represented on the floor of this House. That is right, Madam Speaker, 5 million Americans go unrepresented on the floor of the people's House. 
   This is one of the few things we can do for the American body politic that is not only the right thing to do, it is easy to do as well. 
   One of the most simple, yet eloquent and powerful statements in support of what we will do today was made by one of our former colleagues several years ago. Ben Blaz served in this House for 8 years as the delegate from Guam in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.     
   Delegate Blaz is a man of unquestioned patriotism and uncommon valor. He retired from the Marine Corps with the rank of brigadier general, and during his time in the corps he was awarded the Legion of Merit, a Bronze Star with Combat V and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. 
   I give you a little background on the former Delegate so that our colleagues can have some context when I tell you what General Blaz had to say at one time on this House floor. What the general said about his status in the House and the faith of his fellow Guamanians was this: ``We are equal in war, but not in peace.'' 
   So it is today, Madam Speaker. Over the past several months, and as recently as this week, in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, young Americans from Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C. have fought and died in defense of their country and in service to the Nation they love. In the helicopter that crashed last week, two from the Virgin Islands were on that helicopter and lost their lives. 
   And yet our colleagues, Mr. Fortu&#241;o from Puerto Rico, Dr. CHRISTENSEN from the Virgin Islands, Mr. Faleomavaega from American Samoa, Ms. Bordallo from Guam and Ms. Norton, from Washington, D.C., have no right to cast a vote and be a voice for their constituents and our fellow Americans out on the battlefield. 
   But, you know, Madam Speaker, I may be overstating the importance of this modest rules change. It is, after all, more symbolism than substance. Yes, our colleagues who I just mentioned will finally be able to cast a vote on the House floor, but, and this should be the clincher for my Republican friends who generally prefer to see democracy squelched in the people's House, if a vote cast by a Delegate or the Resident Commissioner or by them collectively amounts to the deciding votes on a question before the  House, then the vote is retaken without permitting them to participate. 
   So who could possibly be opposed to giving our colleagues, arguably some of the most gifted and thoughtful legislators in this Chamber, the right to cast a nondecisive vote on the House floor? I mean, that really should be done. 
   Let me close for now by doing something I don't often do here, and that is to quote the current President of the United States. Last night, Madam Speaker, standing where you are, not 25 feet from where I stand today, the distinguished President of the United States, President Bush, said, ``This is a decent and honorable country.'' 
   What we are trying to do on the House floor today, colleagues, is the decent and honorable thing to do. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I would merely urge the gentleman to recognize that Puerto Rico has 4 million citizens, and I don't know what planet he is living on, but everybody in the District of Columbia pays taxes. And I don't understand this continuing argument. I am curious to know what would happen if Dallas, Texas, didn't have the right to vote in the House. 
   I would also remind the gentleman that the United States District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has already ruled that this matter is not unconstitutional. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez), my good friend and classmate who is the Chair of the Small Business Committee. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I come before this House of Representatives, and I would like to speak not only on behalf of the 4 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico, but also on behalf of the seven American Puerto Ricans who lost their lives in Iraq fighting to protect our Nation. 
   Today I rise to remove the muzzle from the mouths in support of the close to 5 million U.S. citizens' voices that are represented by the Delegates of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I say voices because that is all their representatives in Congress are allowed to utter at the well of this House of Representatives. It is time to allow them to also act on behalf of their constituents in this Chamber by allowing them to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. 
   Right now these Members are allowed to fully participate, not only debate, but also vote at the committees on which they serve with distinction. The change proposed is very measured. It simply allows our respected friends and colleagues to vote in an additional committee, the Committee of the Whole House. 
   Why are my colleagues from the other side of the aisle so unwilling to allow them in this committee? They do not seem to mind them in the other committees. Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues have even placed the Republican Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in several committees, including Foreign Affairs. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this rule may have constitutional problems. The reality is that the courts don't agree with this. I will tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you cannot pick and choose which court decisions you agree with or you like. That is not how democracy works. 
   But as you all know, the Committee of the Whole House does not vote on final passage of legislation. It carries out similar work as the standing committees. 
   The only thing this new rule does allow is for our Delegates and Resident Commissioner colleagues to vote in a committee. The difference for their constituents is that this committee is not located in a small room, but meets here in this Chamber for all to watch. 
   Today's debate is about whether this House believes it is right to give these Members the opportunity to express their positions and values through the act of voting out in the open. Openness is a strong democratic value that all of us should support. 
   I want to emphasize this. These men and women are Members of this House. Let us help them express the voices of their U.S. citizen constituents by allowing them to vote in this committee as well.

   But I say to those who argue that there is symbolism involved here that indeed there is. But death is more than symbolism. Death is real, and the persons who die that come from the 5 million persons that these Delegates and the Resident Commissioner represent are real people. They and their families need this symbolism.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, better known as the 9/11 Commission, made several recommendations on steps that the government could take in order to prevent and prepare for future terrorist attacks.     
   In particular, the Commission said, and I quote, ``Congressional oversight for intelligence and counter terrorism is dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee, in each House of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities is another.'' End of quote. 
   Subsequent to the report, commissioners also suggested creating a new appropriations subcommittee dealing only with intelligence matters. It is my pleasure today to see the House implement this recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. 
   This House rules change, by creating a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel within the House Appropriations Committee, responds to the commission's recommendation by creating a new panel that is made up of members of both the Appropriations Committee and the Intelligence Committee. 
   The Select Intelligence Oversight Panel will strengthen the oversight process by providing a mechanism for considering intelligence funding and the way appropriated funds are spent on intelligence activities from the combined perspectives of the Appropriations and Intelligence committees. The Select Intelligence Oversight Panel will be primarily responsible for reviewing and studying, including through the hearings process, the President's budget submission for intelligence and the execution of intelligence activities. 
   The committee will also be tasked with making recommendations to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and to other Appropriations subcommittees on intelligence programs, projects, and activities. Moreover, this new panel will, on an annual basis, prepare a report to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee containing budgetary and oversight observations and recommendations for use by the subcommittee in preparation of the classified annex to the Defense Appropriations Bill. 
   I see that the Republican members of the Rules Committee, in a letter to the chair lady of that committee, are complaining that we are not allowing the committee process to work its will, and that it is unfair to the Republican side. I would say, to paraphrase Shakespeare, ``They do protest too much, methinks.'' 
   The 9/11 Commission report was published more than 2 1/2 years ago. Aside from sitting on their collective thumbs, what did the Republicans do on this specific recommendation? Nothing, much like what they did on the rest of the 9/11 report. 
   Okay. Fine. The President now claims the right to open every citizen's mail without judicial approval. The President says he can listen to every citizen's phone calls without judicial approval. Oh, and read everyone's e-mails too, without judicial approval. But I don't remember those being recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Madam Speaker, we are doing this for the security of our Nation and our people. As I said at the outset, this was in large part a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Now, I see my friend from California, and he is my friend, about ready to speak. And I would simply say to the ranking member, maybe you should ask the families of the 9/11 victims if they think Congress should spend another 2 years debating action and then taking none, or whether we should take action and move forward on behalf of the families affected by those terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the rest of the country that is looking for results, not rancor. 
   No more rancor, Madam Speaker. No rhetoric, Madam Speaker. Results. That is what the American people have asked for, and that is what we will deliver.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Let me read from Mr. Dreier's House Resolution 30. You said there is established a select intelligence oversight panel of the Committee on Appropriations. The select panel shall be composed of not more than 14 Members, delegates or the resident commissioner appointed by the Speaker. The select panel shall include the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Defense, six additional members of the Committee on Appropriations, and four members on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   That is the exact same thing Mr. Obey is doing with the exception of the constitution of the number on the committee.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I would be more than pleased to yield to my friend because I don't like the characterization that you put forward that I am being disingenuous by saying that you are disingenuous and that you were going to take my words down. 
   I need time to respond to Mr. LaHood as well. He commented on the nomenclature of the intelligence committee, and his comment was that I know better. And he knows that I know that the nomenclature is difficult because he and I were on that steep learning curve, he before me, and I had to learn as well. 
   But I can tell him that Mr. Murtha and Mr. Young know that nomenclature as well as you and I do, RAY, and you know that. 
   If I have time at the end, I will yield. 
   As I said before, this is a specific recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. I am proud that the House Democrats can again do more in 1 week than Republicans were able to do in the last 2 1/2 years since the 9/11 Commission made their report. The gentleman that I have already referenced knows of what I speak. 
   With that, I yield to my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 824 provides for further consideration of H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007, under a closed rule. 
   The rule provides 60 minutes of debate. Thirty minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairperson and ranking Republican of the Committee on the Judiciary, and 30 minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairperson and ranking Republican of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   The rule considers as adopted another amendment printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   Mr. Speaker, with the resurgence of al Qaeda and an increasing global threat from weapons of mass destruction in places such as Iran, every single person in this body wants to ensure that our intelligence professionals have the proper resources they need to protect our Nation. 
   As vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I assure you that each and every one of us on that panel and others, Republican or Democrat, are working tirelessly, and often together, to do just that. 
   But the government is not exempt from the rule of law, as the Constitution confers certain unalienable rights and civil liberties to each of us. 
   After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Bush administration upset that balance by ignoring the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act law, establishing a secret wiretapping program, and refusing to work with Congress to make the program lawful. 
   Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee have been trying to learn about the Bush administration's FISA programs for years. But the administration, which has been anything but forthcoming, has sought to block our oversight efforts nearly every step of the way. 
   When the administration finally came to Congress to modify the law this summer, it came with a flawed proposal to allow sweeping authority to eavesdrop on Americans' communications while doing almost nothing to protect their rights. 
   The RESTORE Act, true to its name, restores the checks and balances on the executive branch, enhancing our security and preserving our liberty. It rejects the false statement that we must sacrifice liberty to be secure. The legislation provides our intelligence community with the tools it needs to identify and disrupt terrorist networks with speed and agility. It provides additional resources to the Department of Justice, National Security Agency, and the FISA Court to assist in auditing and streamlining the FISA application process while preventing the backlog of critical intelligence gathering. 
   The RESTORE Act prohibits the warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans in the United States, including their medical records, homes and offices. And it requires the government to establish a record-keeping system to track instances where information identifying U.S. citizens is disseminated. 
   This bill preserves the role of the FISA Court as an independent check of the government to prevent it from infringing on the rights of Americans. It rejects the administration's belief that the court should simply be a rubber stamp. 
   Finally, the bill sunsets in 2009. This is a critical provision because it requires the constant oversight and regular evaluation of our FISA laws, actions which were largely neglected during the last 6 years of Republican control. 
   In so many ways, the underlying legislation is more efficient and effective than the administration's proposal which passed in August. 
   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, last month, we came to the floor on this bill, but when it became clear that Republicans were intent on playing  politics with the security of the American people, we refused to take the bait.     
   At that time, Republicans announced that they intended to offer a motion to recommit the bill that had no substantive base, was already addressed in the bill and in current law, and was designed to delay consideration of this important intelligence tool. Their reasoning was disingenuous; their motives were absolutely political. As a result, Democrats refused to partake in their game of political theater. 
   If the House does not pass this bill today because of Republican obstructionism, then it will be abundantly clear that the minority and the administration are willing to put politics in front of the safety of the American people. We are back today, and we will continue to come back to the House floor, however many times it takes, to give our men and women in the intelligence community the tools that they need to do their jobs and keep America safe, while also preserving our civil liberties. This is a balance that is not only difficult but absolutely critical. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for a year and a half, the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees have been working with the administration to craft a bill that will ensure our Nation is protected, without sacrificing American constitutional liberties. Let me just talk about some of the people that have had input into that particular measure. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers; the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Silvestre Reyes; the ranking members of both of those committees, including Mr. Hoekstra; all of the members of the Select Committee on Intelligence, including myself; Ms. Harman, who serves on Homeland Security. 
   Countless testimonies during that year and a half, hundreds of discussions and negotiations between the staffs of the respective committees, and a markup of this particular provision that the Republicans brought only two amendments to in the markup in the Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   We negotiated. We compromised. We reached an agreement. Then the administration backed out of the agreement. So we negotiated some more. We compromised some more. We reached another agreement. We reached agreements until we were blue in the face here in August. Everybody was so tired, and the administration continued to back out of the agreement. Then, less than 24 hours before the bill was supposed to come to the floor in August, the administration reneged on the agreement and refused to work with us to protect the American people. 
   Last month, Democrats again brought this bill to the floor, and yet again Republicans tried to play politics with the safety of the American people. Just as they did this past summer, Republicans and the administration now seem content on letting the clock run out on the current FISA law rather than working with us to get something done. They choose and chose obstructionism rather than bipartisan cooperation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American public needs to know that there are no persons in the United States Congress that do not want to protect the security and liberty of the United States. 
   So I do not cast aspersions on my colleagues for having a different view as to how administratively we should proceed to protect those securities and liberties, but everybody here is mindful of all of our responsibilities. So the hyperbole is off the chain sometimes when I hear people talk and it is as if we didn't really do substantively what was required of us as individuals on behalf of the American people. 
   None of us should be ashamed of any of the work that was done with reference to the RESTORE Act. We made a bad bill better. And it is not as good, for example, as I would like for it to be, but it is as good as we are going to get with this administration at this time. 
   The esteemed chairperson of the Intelligence Committee, Representative Reyes, has noted on more than one occasion: You can have your own opinion, but you can't have your own facts. 
   Mr. Speaker, those are the well-documented facts that I just got through dealing with. The RESTORE Act protects the American people. It protects them at home and on the streets. It protects their safety and the constitutional rights, which have been intact more than 225 years, and no one need fear when the fearmongers come here and try to divide people by having somebody think that undocumented aliens are going to be put in some category. I personally am just tired of the smearing that is being done with reference to immigration in this country. We need a solid immigration policy, and we need a policy that contemplates all of the particulars of that immigration set of circumstances. 
   Mr. Speaker, this body has the responsibility today to pass this rule and the underlying legislation today. The security of this Nation requires it of all of us, and I believe all of us want that security and liberty. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

It is fascinating that we find ourselves in the position of debating giving immunity to people that we don't know what violations they have committed that we are giving them immunity for. Very strange. 
   But I would ask the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished minority leader a very serious question: Who has the classified information? As I listened to both of you, I did not get clarity as to whether either of you know what is supposed to be that information. And if that person has classified information, at what level is it?

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my good friend from California for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in vigorous support of this rule. I would like to thank Chairman Peterson, Chairwoman DeLauro, Chairman Rangel, and Mr. Goodlatte, who I feel have crafted a sound bipartisan compromise bill for all of us to support, and they are to be complimented for their hard work during these fiscally challenging times. 
   The underlying legislation makes important reforms that benefit farmers across our Nation and assist many industries which are the economic engine of the congressional district that I'm privileged to serve. The bill before us today is an important achievement for the State of Florida and for the constituents that I serve. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I represent, along with my colleague from Florida (Mr. Mahoney), the second largest sugar-producing district in the country. The Florida sugar industry has a $3.1 billion economic impact on the State of Florida, and I thank the committees for including the provisions that assist this important industry. 
   I also thank the committees for including the Pollinator Protection Act, which I authored and which was carried by Mr. Cardoza, who is carrying this rule and working with me. This act authorizes funding to conduct research on colony collapse disorder to prevent the continuing decline of the pollinator population. People, if there ain't no bees, there ain't no food. 
   Finally, this bill addresses rising food prices here at home and overseas by substantially increasing funding for nutrition programs and food banks and promoting duty-free imports in the  Caribbean, thanks to Mr. Rangel, and to Haiti, where citizens are forced now to eat mud cakes to survive. 
   Having worked as a boy in farms, I understand firsthand how food gets to the table. I am proud to say that this bill serves our farmers well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Jubilee Act which urges expedited international debt relief for Haiti. The current situation in Haiti, a nation that has been historically afflicted by violence and natural disasters, is increasingly desperate and volatile. 
   In recent days, thousands of Haitians have flooded the streets of Port-au-Prince and other cities throughout the country in desperation to decry rapidly escalating food prices in a nation where three-quarters of the population lives on under $2 a day. The cost of staple foods in Haiti has skyrocketed 50 percent within the last year. 
   Haiti is not only the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, but it also ranks third behind Somalia and Afghanistan as the nation with the highest per capita daily deficit in calorie intake. Recent anger over food prices threatens the stability of this Caribbean nation already haunted by chronic hunger. 
   The humanitarian crisis in Haiti underscores the importance of quick and deliberate leadership by the United States. Haiti still is scheduled to pay almost $50 million in 2008 to unilateral financial institutions. 
   This amendment would put Congress on record encouraging the expedited cancellation of Haiti's international debt to help alleviate poverty and increased stability in Haiti. The United States government cannot and should not turn a blind eye again to the struggles of this undeveloped, underdeveloped, impoverished nation. 
   I applaud President Bush's recent announcement that he would release $200 million in U.S. emergency food aid to help alleviate food shortages in developing countries, including in Haiti, but these funds are not nearly enough to assist with the immediate or long-term humanitarian crisis. They fall far short of putting Haiti on a sustained path to development. I ask the President and all of us to do more. 
   This amendment is an initial step in the right direction. We could follow it up with giving temporary protective status, as President Preval of Haiti has requested and President Bush could grant. I ask for my colleagues to support this amendment and ask that they join us in supporting our Haitian friends. 
   Yesterday, 247 Haitians were sent back by the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard has increased its vigilance in the area in light of this impending crisis. At a time of extreme instability and crisis, Congress must not turn its back on Haiti. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (APOLOGIZING FOR THE ENSLAVEMENT AND RACIAL SEGREGATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 194, a resolution that apologizes for the enslavement and segregation of African-Americans. 
   This is a significant moment in our nation's history when the nearly 20-year fight to consider federal legislation that apologizes for slavery has at last become a reality. Indeed, it is fitting that we consider legislation of this content and caliber at this time. A global trend has emerged within the 21st Century in which governments have apologized for slavery and discriminatory laws and promised to work toward a better future. 
   Within the past year, states that were once members of the former Confederacy and were a cesspool for racist and bigoted laws and practices did something that no state had done before: they apologized for the enslavement of black people in this country. More than 240 years after the abolition of slavery and more than four decades after the abolition of Jim Crow, it is time for the federal government to do the same. 
   In 1988, Congress apologized to Japanese-Americans for holding them in concentration camps during World War II. Congress expressed regret for its policies on Hawaii a century after the native Hawaiian kingdom was overthrown. And just five years ago, the Senate apologized for not enacting anti-lynching legislation that would have saved the lives of thousands of black people across the South. 
   America's greatness is exemplified in part by our ability to evolve. Under federal and state laws and customs, African Americans were denied their fundamental rights from 1619 until 1965. Today, we show our growth by officially acknowledging the wrongful actions and policies that were targeted toward African-Americans during slavery and Jim Crow. 
   Sadly, there are some who continue to oppose Congress apologizing for slavery and segregation. They see apologizing as a futile action that is too little too late. Others contend that an official apology would do more harm that good and would conjure painful images from the past that would fuel resentment. These assertions miss the point. 
   Failure to pass this resolution that acknowledges the wrongness of slavery and segregation would send the dangerous message that America is unwilling to come to terms with one of the first and last great atrocities that it placed on its citizens through the rule of law. Slavery and racial segregation were permitted through federal law and our government must express the appropriate and long-overdue remorse for its tolerance of this injustice. 
   As we all know, Mr. Speaker, words matter. ``All men are created equal,'' is perhaps one of the most famous phrases in American history. In our nation's infancy, this statement encompassed the principles of a country that promised to protect the freedom and well-being of its new citizens. Yet it was written when hundreds of thousands of black men, women and children were enslaved and counted as only 3/5 of a person under the Constitution. Nevertheless, President Abraham Lincoln later used this phrase to argue that the institution of slavery contradicted our nation's most fundamental values. This statement proved that America had the potential and duty to become a fairer and more equal nation. 
   The legal abolishment of slavery did not translate into the end of racial inequality. Equally, the legal abolishment of Jim Crow has not translated into the elimination of disparities. The reality is that although the men, women and children who were enslaved in this country are long gone, the wealth, culture, and even the congressional buildings that they helped construct remain. 
   Indeed, in the years following Jim Crow, blacks have undoubtedly taken advantage of increased opportunities and have achieved in every imaginable sector. 246 years after emancipation and 43 years after the abolishment of legal segregation, the United States has made serious improvements in drafting and implementing policies that encourage equality. However, it would be wrong to conclude that these successes negate the fact that 346 years of oppression have contributed to the economic and health disparities that continue to affect much of the black community. 
   On this historic day, we must recommit ourselves to bringing about an end to these disparities and injustices. And in passing this resolution, the House will send a message to the American people and others that the most powerful nation in the world is willing to look honestly at some of the most shameful parts of its history, accept responsibility, and apologize for its actions. Together, we will continue to lay the necessary foundation to build a stronger future.

   While the minority has been engaged in manufactured obstructionism, the House has enacted on legislation to require a comprehensive strategy to withdraw our troops from harm's way.

   Finally, while the minority has engaged in manufactured obstructionism, the House has not acted on providing emergency assistance to our fellow Americans who are grieving and suffering in Minnesota. 
   Manufactured obstructionism is what they are doing, and the American people will not stand for it. 
   By allowing this bill to come to the floor today, we can get this bill to the President's desk immediately. Whatever differences we have here today, this should be something we all can support.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 600 authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules at any time through the legislative day of Friday, August 3, 2007, on the following measures:  
   First, H.R. 3087, a bill to require the President, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; and, second, a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain electronic surveillance. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is particularly important at this juncture in my remarks that I make it very clear that we have heard a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about the need to reform FISA. The Director of National Intelligence has identified a specific intelligence collection gap and spoken of ``a backlog for things requiring a warrant,'' and I quote him. He claims that this is hindering our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks. 
   Congress, Mr. Speaker, takes its responsibilities to protect the Nation seriously. None of us on either side of the aisle want to leave our intelligence professionals short. The Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and the leadership have been working around the clock to come up with a solution that addresses this particular problem. However, again and again, the administration has overplayed their hand. Each time we get close to an agreement, they ask for more, and I might add the negotiations on this have been going on for over a year. 
   First they said Congress needed to clarify that the government shouldn't need a warrant to collect foreign communications. There was never ever any disagreement about that. 
   Then they said they wanted broader authority to conduct electronic surveillance of terrorist communications. We agreed to that. 
   Then they said they wanted immunity for the telecommunications carriers. We agreed to give them prospective immunity and would consider retrospective immunity when we get back. 
   But we insist on a couple of things. We want to preserve the role of the FISA Court as an independent check on the government to prevent them from infringing on the rights of Americans, and we insist that this legislation have a sunset. In this rushed environment before recess, we should not make permanent changes to FISA. 
   Last night, the congressional leadership was willing to make further changes for Director McConnell. He said with those changes he would support the bill because it would ``significantly enhance America's security.'' And I am quoting him again. But after this agreement was reached, congressional Republicans insisted on a much broader, permanent bill, giving the Attorney General, this Attorney General, not the Court, the discretion to make decisions about surveillance involving Americans. Clearly, in my judgment, they are not negotiating in good faith. 
   If they reject this bill, the other side is saying, in the face of a resurgent al Qaeda, they don't want to plug the collection gap identified by the Director of National Intelligence immediately. They are rejecting ``significantly enhancing America's security.'' 
   Now, if the other side insists on manufacturing obstructionist delays and rejecting agreements that will enhance our security, we can stay here all August and September and December until we get this done. The security of this Nation deserves no less. 
   This rule is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because under clause 1(a), rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, as my colleagues well know, the Rules Committee must authorize consideration of these motions. 
   This is not an unusual procedure, as some on the other side may suggest. In fact, in the 109th Congress, alone, my friends on the other side of the aisle reported at least six rules that provided for additional suspension days. 
   This rule limits the suspension of rules to only these two bills and will help us move important legislation before we leave for the August recess. Time is, indeed, of the essence. Not because many in this body wish to go home this weekend but, rather, because of the gravity of these situations both here at home and abroad. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this rule and the underlying piece of legislation. 
   I do wish to put my colleagues on notice that, following the conclusion of debate on this rule, I intend to offer an amendment to the rule. My amendment will permit the House to consider emergency legislation today appropriating $250 million to begin the reconstruction of the I-35 bridge, which collapsed this week in Minnesota. We have properly given our condolences and continue those to those who have lost loved ones and those who are awaiting word regarding those who are still missing and those who have been injured. All of us grieve with all of them. 
   Without this amendment and this rule, this legislation will not be permitted to proceed; and these emergency funds would be delayed. Realize a vote against this rule and my amendment to the rule will be a vote against providing this emergency assistance to the people of Minnesota, specifically Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. At this time, I am very pleased to yield to my colleague, with whom I've served 7 years on the Select Committee on Intelligence. She was the ranking member and is now the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   Before yielding to Ms. Harman, who has gone down this road for well over a year to get us to this point, I would like to say to my friend from Texas that perhaps it would be helpful if he would ask the minority members of the Intelligence Committee about the bill. 
   Secondly, the measure that we are dealing with is a rule providing for suspension, not consideration. 
   That said, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from California (Ms. Harman).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I'm glad you do understand it. 
   I would ask the gentleman from Texas to ask his Republican colleagues on the Intelligence Committee why they didn't share the bill with the Rules Committee Republicans. We cannot control what you do or do not do. 
   And under the circumstances, Ms. Harman just made it very clear to you that the goalposts keep moving. You try to act as if you don't know that for a year and a half that this has been going on here in this intelligence community, working with this administration, trying to take care of this matter. 
   Now understand this. First, you said on that side that Congress needed to clarify that the government shouldn't need a warrant to collect foreign-to-foreign communications. There was never any disagreement about that, and stop saying it to the American public. 
   Then they said they wanted broader authority to conduct electronic surveillance of terrorist communications. We agreed to that. 
   Then they said they wanted immunity for the telecommunications carriers. We agreed to give them prospective immunity and consider retrospective immunity when we get back. 
   Last night, not yesterday, not midnight to noon, and some people have gotten caught in the dark, last night, the congressional leadership was willing to make further changes for Director McConnell. He said that with those changes he would support the bill because it would, in his word, ``significantly'' enhance America's security. 
   But after this agreement was reached, congressional Republicans insisted on a much broader bill giving the Attorney General, not the Court, the discretion to make decisions about surveillance involving Americans. Clearly, in my judgment, as I said previously, you're not negotiating in good faith. 
   I remind you once again that this rule is to make in order a suspension day. You will have all the time you need to do all the reading you need to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 746 provides for consideration of H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007, under a closed rule. The rule provides 90 minutes of debate. Sixty minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and  ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. Thirty minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   Mr. Speaker, with the resurgence of al Qaeda and an increasing global threat from weapons of mass destruction in places such as Iran, every single person in this body wants to ensure that our intelligence professionals have the proper resources they need to protect our Nation. As vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I assure you that every one of us on that panel and others, Republican or Democrat, are working tirelessly and often together to do just that. But the government is not exempt from the rule of law, as our Constitution confers certain unalienable rights and civil liberties to each of us. 
   After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Bush administration upset that balance by ignoring the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly referred to as the FISA law, establishing a secret wiretapping program and refusing to work with Congress to make the program lawful. Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee, led by the distinguished chairperson, SYLVESTRE REYES, have been trying to learn about the Bush administration's FISA program for years. But the administration, which has been anything but forthcoming, has done everything it can to stop us from doing our job and helping them to do theirs better. 
   A footnote right there, Mr. Speaker. In today's Washington Post, it is reflected as late as now, when the RESTORE Act is on the floor, the administration has agreed to give certain information to the Senate and still not to the House. 
   When the administration finally came to Congress to modify the law, it came with the flawed proposal to allow sweeping authority to eavesdrop on Americans' communications, while doing almost nothing to protect their rights. The RESTORE Act, true to its name, restores the checks and balances on the executive branch, enhancing our security and preserving our liberty. It rejects the false statement that we must sacrifice liberty to be secure. It does not go as far as I would want it to go. It does not go as far as some people would like for it to go, but it does protect our liberty and secures this Nation. 
   The legislation provides our intelligence community with the tools it needs to identify and disrupt terrorist attacks with speed and agility. 
   Yet another footnote, Mr. Speaker. While we concentrate on surveillance as it pertains to wire, I would have people know that the terrorists by now have been pretty well educated about these matters and may very well be using other methodologies totally unrelated to the telephone. 
   I remind people when it was leaked to the media that Osama bin Laden was using a certain kind of wire, he hasn't been heard from in that forum since. So let's be very cautious to not put all our eggs in the surveillance basket. There are other methodologies that might be employed that I assure you the intelligence community is mindful of and right on as it pertains to discovering them.     
   It provides additional resources to the Department of Justice, the National Security Agency and the FISA Court to assist in auditing and streamlining the FISA application process while preventing the backlog of critical intelligence gathering. 
   The RESTORE Act prohibits the warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans in the United States, including their medical records, homes and offices. And it requires the government to establish a recordkeeping system to track instances where information identifying U.S. citizens is disseminated. 
   This bill preserves the role of the FISA Court as an independent check on the government to prevent it from infringing on the rights of Americans. It rejects the administration's belief that the court should be a rubber stamp. 
   Finally, the bill sunsets in 2009. This is a critical provision because it requires the constant oversight and regular evaluation of our FISA laws, actions which were largely neglected during the last 6 years of Republican rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, all the American people have to do is pick up a newspaper to read about what happens when this government has unfettered access to warrantless electronic surveillance. According to a letter to Congress from a company executive, Verizon alone has fielded almost 240,000 phone record requests from the FBI since 2005. Nearly 64,000 of these requests, or over one-quarter of them, were made without a warrant. 
   This is almost 100 phone record requests per day by our government to Verizon seeking private information about our citizens, without a warrant. Realize, we are just talking about requests made to Verizon by the FBI. And these are just the requests that Verizon told Congress about this week because the Bush administration has consistently refused to answer our questions about the President's program. 
   Even more, it doesn't factor in the hundreds of thousands of requests that were made to other phone companies during the same time that we don't know about. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we have learned anything since the terrorist attacks of September 11, it is that the balance between security and civil liberties is not only difficult, but absolutely critical. 
   The RESTORE Act does absolutely nothing to block or hinder the efforts of our intelligence community. And Member after Member on the other side of the aisle are going to come down here and comment that it is hampering our intelligence efforts. Quite the contrary. It enhances their ability to do their jobs effectively and ensures the integrity of their efforts. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. 
   This legislation is an important step in gathering the most current research to implement the vision of fuel independence and energy efficiency set forth by this Congress. 
   I commend the hard work of my colleague from Tennessee, the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon, who has brought forth this legislation, and the ranking member and I look forward to its passage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to this legislation today because I feel that as we move forward with energy reform, it is important to recognize the tremendous contributions to scientific research and academia made by land grant institutions, historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and other minority-serving institutions. 
   This amendment specifically recommends that the assistant administrator of the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency utilize the wealth of knowledge currently available at the research-oriented universities throughout our great Nation. 
   As a graduate of Fisk University and Florida A&M University, I have seen firsthand the outstanding research generated by faculty and students alike. An example of these contributions at Florida A&M is the Environmental Sciences Institute. The institute has consistently partnered with Federal agencies to furnish informative environmental policy research. The research has included 40 publications during the 2005-2006 academic year and the services of Dr. Larry Robinson on the National Research Council. 
   Fisk University also embodies this important mission in its designations as a core research center for NASA and international recognition as a scientific research institution. 
   And since we are dealing with energy, I would urge that the president of Fisk University is the former Secretary of the Department of Energy. 
   The recent development of the Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials has established an outstanding resource for chemistry studies with the support of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. This center generates over 34 publications a year and holds several patents for application by the United States Air Force. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am confident that this amendment will emphasize the importance and value of the research conducted by the phenomenal network of Land Grant Institutions and other universities represented by many of us in this great Congress. It is vital that we acknowledge the role of research institutions as community partners in the implementation of congressional mandates. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to foster these partnerships for a prosperous future of responsible energy use.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has exercised unprecedented leadership in the global fight to combat trafficking in human beings, I rise in support of H.R. 3887, the Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   From our earliest awareness of this cruel phenomenon which enslaves an estimated 27 million victims, the Commission has led in the effort to mobilize nations to implement effective measures to combat human trafficking. My fellow Commissioner and former Chairman of the Commission, Representative CHRIS SMITH is among those who has led the effort to bring an end to this modern day form of slavery, authoring the trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its subsequent reauthorizations. 
   Today, the Commission continues its work to support efforts to combat this global crime within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Most recently, the Commission conducted an oversight hearing last October 11, to explore the progress made in combating human trafficking and the adequacy of resources dedicated to identifying victims of trafficking for forced labor, an area that we believe would benefit from additional resources and attention. 
   The reauthorization bill that we are taking action on today marks another important milestone in preventing the inhumane practice of human trafficking, protecting trafficking victims, and prosecuting the criminals that perpetrate these crimes. 
   In addition to bolstering the resources needed to continue various anti-trafficking programs, H.R. 3887, which I cosponsored, would strengthen mechanisms for fighting human trafficking overseas, through the provision of capacity building support to foreign governments to bolster investigative mechanisms and legal protective frameworks for immigrant populations and migrant workers. Importantly, the measure would also address the transnational nature of human trafficking by providing increased support and protection for refugees and internally displaced populations. This legislation also seeks to improve transparency and evaluation of trafficking programs, and would designate governments that remain on the special watch list for 2 consecutive years among those whose efforts to combat trafficking are inadequate. 
   This reauthorization bill will improve mechanisms to better identify and protect trafficking victims, while increasing accountability on the part of governments in their anti-trafficking efforts. It takes a comprehensive approach to a gross criminal exploitation, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1343 provides for consideration of H.R. 5959, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate controlled by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and makes in order seven amendments. 
   Three amendments are to be offered by my colleagues in the minority, including one by the Republican whip and one by the ranking Republican of the Intelligence Committee. Three are to be offered by Democrats, and the last one by two bipartisan sponsors. This is a fair rule, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, more than ever, strengthening our intelligence apparatus and giving it the flexibility it needs to meet continuing threats should be one of this body's highest priorities. The resurgence of al Qaeda and increasing global threats underscore the importance of the authorization bill before us today. 
   The Intelligence Authorization Act authorizes funding for 16 United States intelligence agencies and intelligence-related activities of the United States Government for fiscal year 2009. 
   Due to the classified nature of this bill, I wish to point out that Members can view the classified portions of the bill by making an appointment with the Intelligence Committee in H-405 of the Capitol. 
   Despite the House's best efforts, for the past 3 years an intelligence authorization bill has not become law. Therefore, I am very pleased today with this well-balanced, bipartisan bill. I am hopeful that this great work will continue, concluding with the President's signature of the underlying legislation into law. 
   This year's intelligence authorization bill adds crucial funding to enhance human intelligence collection, as well as for other enduring and emerging global security challenges we face in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The bill also provides funding to address the impact of climate change on our national and energy security. 
   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, we have seen the devastating costs that flawed intelligence and a misinformed Congress can have on national security. This bill enhances accountability and transparency through long overdue oversight and monitoring. 
   The underlying bill increases reporting requirements to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on the nuclear capabilities of North Korea, Iran, and Syria. 
   The bill also amends the National Security Act to require the executive branch to provide Congress with the necessary information about our intelligence operations to ensure proper oversight. 
   As someone who sat through countless hours of Intelligence Committee hearings and briefings, I have been appalled by the unwillingness and outright stonewalling of the Bush administration when Members have asked even the most basic of questions about our intelligence community policies and practices. 
   Additionally, the underlying legislation helps restore our Nation's global credibility by ensuring that we meet our international obligations. The reporting requirements on compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act regarding detentions and interrogations bring credibility and security to our Nation for future generations. 
   The bill also furthers our commitment to improving the intelligence community's security and clearance process. It increases pay for intelligence officers--and I would underscore much-needed increases--and enhances oversight and accountability through the creation of an intelligence community Inspector General. 
   Moreover, the underlying legislation includes a provision that would require reporting on plans to enhance diversity within the intelligence community, and a lot of effort has gone into this particular measure, beginning with our former colleague, Louis Stokes, and our departed colleague, Julian Dixon, and the work of my colleague, Sanford Bishop, and myself, as well as the Chair and countless members of the committee in trying to ensure that we have appropriate diversity in the intelligence community. 
   The diversity of our Nation should be directly reflected in our intelligence community's workforce. We cannot, and will not, appropriately meet our security challenges without ensuring this. I appreciate and support these efforts, as the issue, as I expressed, was one of my top concerns when I served on the Intelligence Committee. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Reyes for including in his amendment a provision written by my colleague on the Rules Committee, Representative Peter Welch, that addresses the employment needs of resettled Iraqi and Afghani interpreters. 
   Our government has a moral responsibility to provide proper resources for these allies who risked their lives to assist our efforts to fight global terrorist threats. This measure will help fill gaps in our intelligence-gathering activities and is a start toward fulfilling our obligations to our Iraqi and Afghani allies. 
   Mr. Speaker, the threats posed to our Nation are only intensifying. To keep pace, America's intelligence community requires the most robust and modern tools to identify and disrupt such attacks. This Intelligence Authorization Act does just that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining portion of my time. 
   I am fascinated by my colleagues' arguments on the other side. We did have a Rules Committee hearing on this matter, and there are four members of the Rules Committee on the minority, none of whom raised any of the issues that we have heard here today on the floor; understanding full well that Mr. Flake comes now and says that we should have a special session. 
   I also know that here on the floor I offered to Mr. Flake an opportunity, by unanimous consent, to offer any amendment he may have, and he didn't have an amendment at that time. I assume his argument is that we would need to be in what he says a ``secret session.'' 
   But one thing I do know, being one of the few Members that does serve on the Rules Committee and on the Intelligence Committee, and that is that everyone knew the funding level of the issue that is being discussed. Mr. Flake may not have, but I can assure you that the remaining Members on the Intelligence Committee knew that the mark was included in our draft and the Community Management Account making that minority staff certainly aware at the time between the chairman and Mr. Hoekstra. 
   Now, today more than ever, we must make the creation of a strong and flexible intelligence apparatus one of the highest, highest priorities of this body. The terrorist attacks of September 11, combined with the continuing threat of further attacks, underscore the importance of this legislation. 
   When the American people elected Democrats to the majority, they sent a very clear message that ``business as usual'' is no longer accepted. They said to all of us, Republican and Democrat alike, that there are problems in the way we operate, and we need to change how we do business. We must, in my opinion, congratulate our intelligence community for its successes, but we also must hold them accountable for their failures. Rubber-stamping the administration's every action is not acceptable. Democrats are working every day, as are Republicans, to make America a safer place for all. 
   I genuinely urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   I heard arguments about the climate change requirements put forward for there to be a national intelligence estimate in that regard. And there are arguments against it. I do not quite understand those arguments. We made it clear that much of the information is collectable by analysts at this time and that it would help prevent future terrorist developments. And the way the argument has been couched on the minority is as if this largest ever intelligence budget, largest in the history of the Congress, is not doing everything that is needed to be done because someone requested that there be a national intelligence estimate with reference to climate change. One day, some people in this body are going to get their head out of the sand and understand that something is changing in this climate of ours, in this world and that we all owe it as much as we can afford to make sure that we pass on a safe environment to all our children. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just read, House Resolution 388 provides for consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 under a structured rule. 
   The rule makes in order a total of ten amendments, almost half of which will be offered by Members of the minority, including one which will be offered by the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Representative Hoekstra. 
   The rule also makes in order an amendment that I offered, along with my colleague on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Rogers of Michigan, and our bipartisan amendment is a commonsense solution to holding the Office of National Director of intelligence accountable for its actions. 
   The House will have a chance to debate our amendment later today, and I hope my colleagues will support it. 
   I would like to point out that Members who wish to do so, as the Chair of the Intelligence Committee has pointed out previously, can go to the Intelligence Committee office to examine the classified schedule of authorizations for the programs and activities of the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the national and military intelligence programs. 
   The importance of the intelligence community touches all Americans as our Nation's first line of defense against increasing world threats. Effective intelligence is the first method to protect our citizens and prevent debacles like the war in Iraq. 
   The underlying legislation authorizes funding for all United States intelligence agencies, including the national and military intelligence programs. It is the largest intelligence authorization bill ever considered by the House and takes significant steps to eliminate duplication and ineffectiveness in our intelligence agencies. 
   The bill increases funding to improve human intelligence, training and send additional intelligence analysts overseas to maximize their abilities. It also requires additional intelligence reports on North Korea and Iranian efforts to become nuclear capable. We also take significant steps to improve the collecting, deciphering and understanding of intelligence. 
   The effectiveness of our intelligence community is significantly jeopardized when the diversity of the intelligence community does not reflect the diverse world in which we live. Women and minorities continue to be disproportionately underrepresented in the senior ranks and the core mission areas of analysis, human intelligence collection, and science and technology. 
   Simply put, we still do not have an intelligence community that looks like our country or the world. Minorities make up 37 percent of the American population, yet only 21 percent of the intelligence community, and the numbers for African-Americans and Latinos is woefully below that number. This is a problem that is addressed in the underlying bill, which requires the development of a strategic plan to increase diversity within the intelligence community and mandates increased diversity among the rank and file of the community. 
   I am fond of saying in the Intelligence Committee hearings that it doesn't take more degrees than the thermometer to be a spy, but somebody back there decided that that must have been the case. 
   Another significant concern exacerbated by this lack of diversity is a deficiency of linguist abilities in the intelligence community. There are countless stories of intelligence tapes that had piled up in the months leading up to September 11 when the terrorist attacks occurred here. That was done because we didn't have anyone to translate them. 
   Experts and administrators lament the fact that we don't have enough Arabic, Farsi, Urdu or Dari speakers, and we always go in that direction, but we don't have enough Asian language speakers, either, in the intelligence community and the military. 
   How can we expect to completely correct that course without thoroughly modernizing the recruitment, selection and security clearance processes to quickly bring on board people with these critical skills? The underlying bill provides for the commonsense modernization of our security clearance procedures to address this growing problem, requiring that the system make more efficient use of those who are proficient in foreign languages or with cultural, linguistic or other subject matter expertise that is critical to national security. We must make these necessary modernizations to adapt to the ever-changing threats around us. 
   Finally, following the recommendations of 11 three- and four-star generals, the bill requests that the National Intelligence Council produce a National Intelligence Estimate on the national security impact of global climate change. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed discontent with this provision, because they believe that enough research is currently under way about climate change. In doing so, in my judgment, they failed to recognize that climate change is impacting global security. 
   Just look at the Middle East, the battle for scarce resources among those who have been displaced, particularly in Iraq, has the potential to generate sociopolitical environments that foster the creation of terrorist cells. If we can't even agree on the implications of climate change, it is obvious that more research is necessary, especially observing the impact of climate change on the movement of people and resources, and how that connects to terrorism. 
   Footnote right there, I pointed out in the Rules Committee that Iraq would be the classic example of what I am talking about. There are 2 million refugees, and it is almost like it is kind of hidden, that are displaced from their homes in Iraq. There are 400,000 to 500,000 internally displaced in Iraq. Yet, what we find is they are being pushed into Syria, Jordan and Egypt where there are already significant water resource problems. Someone tell me how that doesn't equate to an environment where terrorists will be produced. 
   If we can't agree on this, I can assure you that we are going to have significant problems in the future. Even the National Defense University has recognized these implications by prioritizing response to large-scale national disasters in some of its most recent training simulations. As scientists explore the connection between such disasters and climate change, it is imperative that the national security implications of such events be thoroughly understood. 
   I am glad that our committee addresses this issue in the bill. If we have learned anything from the failures of the war in Iraq, it is that reliable intelligence is critical to ensuring America's national security. 
   I am pleased to support this rule and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank you, and I have enormous respect for a colleague who has offered an amendment where it appears we are competing. 
   But I agree our amendment, after his, does, I believe, what is necessary, and that is to answer the question that a lot of us have with reference to the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Director of Intelligence. 
   If I could just share one brief anecdote. When the war on poverty began in the area that I live in, I was the attorney and original scrivener of the development of the program. When that program came into existence, within a year they had seven employees. They were extremely effective. 
   They grew in 6 years to 1,500 employees, and they became much less effective, totally disrespected and in disarray. I am fearful that the same thing will happen here. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my friend from Michigan and am pleased to sponsor this amendment with him. 
   Madam Chairman, when Congress established the National Director of Intelligence, it fulfilled one of the 9/11 Commission recommendations to centralize and concentrate the filtering of intelligence. Since its inception, however, the Office of the Director never realized its potential, growing in size with indication of limited long-term planning. As a result, many of us who are familiar with the office question its efficiency and effectiveness. 
   Capping the size of the ONDI is a responsible manner by which Congress can and should go about holding the administration accountable for its decisions and actions. This is not, as some might suggest, an anti-NDI amendment. 
   On the contrary, my friend, Mr. Rogers, and my amendment, is the much-needed solution for Congress to reassert its oversight authority over the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. For too long, Congress has abdicated its oversight authority and responsibility when it comes to American intelligence. 
   This amendment says to the administration that, while we support your efforts, we will not give you a blank check with which you could continue to grow a new bureaucracy before we know what you are doing with what you already have. A bigger bureaucracy does not make better intelligence. 
   I ask my colleagues for their support of the Rogers-Hastings amendment and ask them to join us in holding America's Intelligence Community accountable for its work.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I know the chairman knows of my immense respect for his perspective, and I appreciate very much what you have said with regard to how you would carry forth the intent of mine and Mr. Rogers' amendment, as well as Mr. Thompson's, in capping this. 
   What I say to you, Mr. Chairman, is I don't know in all of my experience of any bureaucrat, I respect the new DNI director, but I don't know of any bureaucrat that has ever said, I don't need no more people. And I also know for a fact that, in this particular case, in the standing up of this particular directorate what has happened is it has impacted already the infrastructure by virtue of the persons that have already moved to that agency. The now-CIA Director came from NSA to that deputy position. And I could go on and on and on without giving forth that. And that is what we are trying to stop. 
   What you do when you want to cut bureaucracy is you say to them, stop right where you are. Now, they will be back, and we will then do the oversight necessary in order to give them an opportunity to grow the way that they should rather than the way that they have been exponentially.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my esteemed colleague on the Rules Committee for yielding 1 minute. 
   I regret very much my colleague, who is my friend from California, had to be about his business because I wanted to respond directly to him dealing specifically with his comments as if this legislation is directed only to Africa. 
   This legislation wisely expands to the Caribbean basin. And I urged yesterday in the Rules Committee that people understand that American tourists visit these places and, in many instances, it is in our best interest to make sure that these kinds of humanitarian concerns are taken care of. 
   Haiti is involved in this legislation. And I doubt seriously if there's anybody that doesn't believe that we should be about the business of trying to help Haiti. 
   My colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) just said that it is the right thing to do. It is the humanitarian thing to do. It is the right thing to do. And lest we ignore the extraordinary problem we have here in the Nation's Capital on HIV/AIDS, lest we ignore the need to expand the Ryan White Act, failure to do these things causes us to do so at our peril. This is de minimis by comparison to what is needed or what is required.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security  bill which would establish in statute, a FEMA Office of Long-Term Recovery in Florida for a period of no less than 3 years. 
   FEMA initially opened an Office of Long-Term Recovery in Florida following the devastating 2004 hurricane season, which left my home State in peril following the landfall of four Category 3 or greater hurricanes. The results have been incredible, and it hasn't only been residents of my State who benefited from the work that FEMA is doing in Florida and elsewhere. 
   Since it was created, the office has reduced response times to disasters and helped to mitigate the impact of future storms. 
   In the first months of the office's existence, FEMA officials were successful in more than doubling public assistance reimbursements from $1 billion to $2 billion. Moreover, the full-time recovery staff, well versed in State and Federal and local policies, was able to rectify the mistakes made by previous emergency management teams. 
   The permanencies of the staff and the relationships they have cultivated with local governments, nonprofits, communities and Federal officials have reduced FEMA's response time to disasters, saving taxpayers' dollars and lives, while reducing confusion. 
   From this office, more mitigation funds have gone out to recipients than ever before in FEMA's history. The office also closed down two large-scale housing missions, something never accomplished in all of FEMA's history. Florida's Office of Long-Term Recovery has made FEMA more of a customer-oriented business, where citizens and government alike are better served by more responsive managing. 
   Congress has already established long-term recovery offices in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Texas, and rightly so. It would be appropriate that we officially establish a similar one in Florida to serve the State and region. Footnote there, there is a storm off the east coast that has now been named, which is indicative of the fact that we can expect not only Florida but the areas mentioned to continue to have this problem. It is the eve of hurricane season; and the House, acting today, could not be more timely. 
   Before I conclude, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. I would like to especially thank, personally, Mr. Thompson of Mississippi and Mr. Oberstar and my good friend from New York (Mr. King) and Mr. Mica for their help on this amendment. They all know the great benefit that this office provides for the State of Florida and the entire region, and I ask for my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today with my good friend from California, Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, to offer an amendment to the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. I certainly commend the Chair and ranking member for all of their efforts on this measure. 
   Madam Chairman, gang violence is a cycle that poisons many of our districts and deprives many of our youth from pursuing productive educational opportunities. Many who have been engaged in gang activity unfortunately return to the same streets after they serve time in our juvenile justice system, and the cycle begins again. Only holistic partnerships that engage entire communities are going to break this cycle of gang activity. 
   To meet this need, I introduced the Path to Success Act July 6 of last year. Our amendment today reflects the content of the Path to Success Act and will authorize a nationwide program through the Department of Education to promote public and private community-centered partnerships aimed at reducing gang violence. 
   Madam Chairman, our amendment will establish a program that is set up to the task of disrupting the juvenile justice pipeline. It will give former gang members a chance to attend college and be engaged positively in their communities. Through educational and vocational training opportunities at community colleges as well as partnerships with law enforcement for pro-active gang prevention efforts, our amendment will give former gang members hope for the future while taking juvenile justice in a new direction. 
   Also the American Psychological Association, the American Association of Community Colleges agree with the need for this new direction and have endorsed our amendment. 
   I urge our colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. At this time, I am pleased to yield 1 1/2 minutes to my colleague from California, the original cosponsor of this measure, Ms. LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Hastings.  
   And, Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Hastings-S&#225;nchez amendment to H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. I thank Mr. Hastings for his leadership on this issue and was pleased to work with him in this effort to provide constructive opportunities for youthful offenders. 
   The Hastings-S&#225;nchez amendment would authorize grants to community colleges to create partnerships with juvenile detention centers and residential facilities that would reduce recidivism rates by providing education, vocational training, counseling, and related activities. 
   Gangs, crimes, and youth problems are often symptoms of larger problems, problems that require comprehensive solutions. Too often, we have spent far more time, money, and effort on enforcement than we have on prevention, missing opportunities to rehabilitate the youth that we incarcerate. 
   Unfortunately, taxpayers have not experienced a great return on these massive anti-gang investments. For example, the State of California will spend over $9 billion on incarceration this year, yet gang activity in California continues to rise. 
   Young people who are involved in gangs do not have to be condemned to a lifetime in gang involvement. 
   This amendment would leverage power of community colleges to help in the campaign against youth violence. Community colleges already have expertise in providing job training and education to nontraditional students. By encouraging them to develop partnerships with other local agencies and community-based organizations, we can multiply the opportunities that young ex-offenders have to get involved in their communities in a positive way and cut down on the odds that they will return to gang activity. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Hastings-S&#225;nchez amendment to help make our communities safer.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 567 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, to provide for the implementation of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration. 
   This is a typical rule for a conference report and was reported out by the Rules Committee by a bipartisan voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Americans decided last November that they were tired of the way business was being done in Washington, they elected Democrats to the majority. 
   We promised them that we would implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission, and today we are fulfilling that promise in bipartisan fashion. We are showing that compromise can, indeed, yield good policy. Democrats have shown with this bill that that compromise can indeed be positive for America. 
   There were many who did not want to see Democrats succeed in completing work on this bill. They preferred political posturing over protecting the American public. For them, inaction is an acceptable solution, and obstructionism their plan to get back into the majority. 
   The American people should take great comfort in knowing that we will not allow them to succeed. 
   I commend my good friends, the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, BENNIE THOMPSON, and the ranking member for their tireless work on this conference report. It was not an easy job, but their diligence and commitment to protecting America persevered. 
   This product takes significant steps to further protect the American people. Democrats are leading in delivery while fixing the shortcomings in our homeland security network highlighted by the 9/11 Commission. 
   First, this conference report places a priority on providing homeland security grants based on risk and not political preference. This is especially important to my constituents, as south Florida has seen its recent homeland security grant allocations decreased as political consideration has increased in the process. 
   When it comes to first responders, the conference report includes $1.6 billion for a first responder interoperability grant program. 
   The report also invests in rail, transit and bus security, authorizing more than $4 billion for these crucial grants. 
   Further, this report requires the screening on all passenger air cargo within 3 years. This is, without doubt, the furthest that Congress has ever gone to ensure that the flying public is safe and protected. 
   Within the next 5 years, the conference report requires the screening of all container ships as they leave foreign shores and head to the U.S. This, too, was another of the 9/11 recommendations. 
   If America is going to be safe, Mr. Speaker, then Congress must do everything in its power to ensure that cargo coming into our ports has been screened and checked. As someone who represents a district which is within just miles of three major international seaports, I'm pleased that the committee included this provision in the bill. The safety and security of south Florida literally depends on it. 
   I'm also pleased that the Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, of which I'm a proud member, were able to reach an agreement regarding the public disclosure of total spending in the intelligence community. This was another key recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, and Democrats are again keeping their promise to turn those recommendations into law. 
   It is a new day in the House of Representatives. With honesty and transparency as our guiding principles, Democrats are working to strengthen and restore faith in our intelligence community. Even more, we are sending the message to the American people that this Congress will no longer allow the intelligence community to operate without proper oversight. 
   This conference report is another installment of how Democrats are working to protect the American people and hold the Bush administration accountable for its failures and shortcomings. 
   This is a good conference report and a good rule. I urge my colleagues to support both. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, before yielding to Mrs. Maloney, who was directly affected in her district in New York during 9/11, I would just say to my friend from Florida that when he and his party were in charge, the question is, what did they do? Did they pass $250 million annually for airport checkpoint screening? Did they pass $450 million annually for baggage screening? Did they do 100 percent screening within 5 years? Did they protect from lawsuits people who in good faith report what they believe are terrorist activities around airplanes, trains, or buses? Did they do stronger security measures? No. They did none of that.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, you do know and every Member of this body does know that the 9/11 Commission Report was published in the year 2004. Since that time an election has occurred. Before that time and even before this 9/11 Commission Report came into existence, President Bush did not even want to appoint a 9/11 Commission. He came kicking and dragging and screaming to even cause it to come into existence. And the extraordinary work that has been done by Lee Hamilton and Governor Kean and the other members of that committee recommended to this body in 2004 that we undertake these measures. 
   So now we come here, and I ask them, what did you do before that? The answer is nothing. 
   Mr. Speaker, this body has a responsibility today to pass this rule and the underlying legislation. We can't afford to continue to procrastinate, as my colleagues did since 2004. 
   Today this new Democratic majority is delivering another piece of our Six for '06 promises. Today this Democratic majority is passing and sending to the President for his signature the 9/11 Commission's outstanding recommendations. 
   The fact of the matter is that bad people who want to do bad things will always try to find a way to succeed. This conference report ensures that we are doing everything we can here in the United States and abroad to stop that from happening. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and the rule.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. 
   Consider, the cost of sugar over the past 27 years has actually decreased, and it remains the only commodity in the country that has actually contributed toward paying off the national debt. 
   But as the cost of sugar has gone down, the price at grocery stores for candy manufacturers and bakery manufacturers and other sweets are charging more for their products, whose main ingredient is sugar, has increased. 
   Footnote right there. Why does the confectionery industry get smaller and cost more? 
   I don't need to sugarcoat the facts, Mr. Chairman. American consumers are getting a sweet deal on sugar. It's so cheap in the U.S., they give it away in restaurants. 
   Unlike other commodities, the U.S. sugar program doesn't cost the American taxpayer one dime. 
   Do my colleagues realize that if this amendment passes, over 146,000 jobs, 25,000 of which are in South Florida, will be in jeopardy. Congress can't turn its back on these hardworking Americans simply because candy companies in the U.S. want to pay their workers pennies in South America rather than living wages in South Florida.  
   In my district, the cities of Belle Glade, Clewiston, South Bay and Pahokee will almost cease to exist if this amendment passes. Talk about getting a raw deal. As my distinguished colleague Dale Kildee, who himself represents a significant portion of sugar beet country, is fond of saying and correctly so, we have the cleanest, greenest, and safest sugar supply in the world.

   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment today to give pollinator protection and the concern of Colony Collapse Disorder a prominent presence in H.R. 2419, the Farm Bill Extension Act of 2007. This amendment reflects the contributions of countless organizations and a bi-partisan coalition of Members of Congress who share a common concern for pollinator decline. 
   When issues like Colony Collapse Disorder and pollinator decline threaten one-third of American agriculture, they must be taken seriously. I commend Chairman Peterson and the Committee on Agriculture for their tireless work on provisions in the current Farm Bill Extension Act to address pollinator research. However, my amendment demonstrates the need to clarify that significant research and conservation programs will play an important role in combating Colony Collapse, Disorder and North American pollinator decline in years to come. If we want our children to enjoy food grown in this nation in the coming years, then we must save bees and other pollinators. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds a section to the bill authorizing $86.5 million over 5 years for facilities improvement and research grants to combat Colony Collapse Disorder and North American native/managed pollinator decline. These funds would be authorized through a combination of initiatives at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, ARS, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, CSREES, and the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, APHIS. This section of the amendment is very similar to my legislation H.R. 1709, the Pollinator Protection Act, which has the bi-partisan support of 50 cosponsors. This amendment also incorporates welcome adjustments to the Pollinator Protection Act which I collaborated with Senator Barbara Boxer to develop in the companion legislation, S. 1694, the Pollinator Protection Act of 2007. 
   My amendment also clarifies the importance of native and managed pollinators in vital conservation programs of USDA. This component of the amendment reflects the content of H.R. 2913, the Pollinator Habitat Protection Act of 2007, which Representative Earl Blumenauer and I recently introduced, similar to S. 1496 introduced by Senator Max Baucus. On the Senate side, this similar legislation has received vast bi-partisan support from 33 cosponsors. 
   Mr. Chairman. Moments like this truly demonstrate the collaborative capacity of this great Congress to meet a dire need with thoughtful policy that truly engages stakeholders and impacted communities. 
   I thank Members of Congress that worked with me in both chambers of Congress in this effort to save American agriculture. I also thank the many scientists and organizations for their endorsement of this amendment, namely: the American Beekeeping Federation, Inc., American Honey Producers Association, American Farmland Trust, California Farm Bureau Federation, California State Beekeepers Association, Center for Biological Diversity, Coevolution Institute, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense, Florida Farm Bureau Federation, National Wildlife Federation, Partners for Sustainable Pollination, Sonoma County Beekeepers Association, Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, Wild Farm Alliance, and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. 
   I thank Chairman Peterson for his support and I urge my colleagues support this vital amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, who came here to discuss what I thought I came here to vote on, and that is the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2008. 
   Lest we lose sight of the importance of flood insurance, coming from an area where that is a continuing critical problem and knowing that those in the Midwest and certain portions of the South are presently suffering in that regard, it is regrettable that we are not focusing on the importance of that particular legislation. 
   Now, let me also add my voice to the voices of my colleagues on the other side who continue to say that they want to do something about the continuing increase in the price of gasoline. 
   I recently was before an editorial board, the Sun Sentinel Newspaper, in my hometown, and I was asked the question: What are you all in Congress going to do about gas prices? 
   A footnote right here. I would that my colleagues would stop the folly of using the words of an aide in a congressional office as the strategy of the Democratic Party. What I said to my newspaper was we were going to use an awful lot of hyperbole between now--we, meaning the Congress; we, meaning the U.S. House and Senate; we, meaning Democrats and Republicans; we, meaning liberals and conservatives. 
   What we were going to do between now and the election, I said to them, was talk a lot about things that are likely to take place in the future but that cost an immense amount of money in order to accomplish. And I said to them, let me give you the hyperbole. We are going to use the language geothermal. We are going to say biomass. You are going to hear alternative energy, solar or wind. You are going to hear all of those things, and many of those things are certainly going to be a part of our energy production at some point in the future. 
   I also rather suspect that what is going to happen is those companies that supply energy today are more likely than not to be involved in that research and production of the alternative energy sources. But to say that the Democrats have done nothing, and I am now here 15 years and I have seen 12 years of the Republicans' attempts to do something about energy which amounted obviously to nothing. 
   So the Democrats are in charge 1 1/2 years, and we are told with a White House that is more than involved in the energy issues of this Nation and this world, and with a Senate that won't move a single solitary thing that is productive coming from the House of Representatives; we still have managed to enact into law the Energy Independence and Security Act in 2007, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act.     
   We enacted into law the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, and I won't go into all of the details. There is more coming, reducing transit fares, cracking down on price gouging, use or lose it, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to have forgotten that we just voted on before we left here, and that we are likely, just so I give them a heads-up, give you another chance not to go with use it or lose it, which compels the oil industry to start drilling or lose permits on 68 million acres of undeveloped Federal oil reserves which they are currently warehousing, keeping domestic supply lower and prices higher. We need to further close the Enron loophole which was also a part of that legislation. 
   We have also passed the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. We passed the Gas Price Relief For Consumers Act. We passed the Energy Gouging Prevention Act. 
   So I continue with what I said to my newspaper, we were going to say switch grass. We were going to say algae. We were going to say use cane as Brazil does. We were going to say all of those things, and then when we finish, we are not going to do one single solitary thing that is going to cause Jane Lunchbucket, when she goes to the gas pump next Thursday, to witness a reduction in her gas prices. 
   We have tried as best we can to deal with speculators that we know have driven up some of these prices. We are doing everything that we can to try to ensure that the 200,000 acres of oil shale that are already under the control of six companies are utilized. 
   We allow that people need to understand that if we drill off the coast of Florida, and let it be clearly understood by everybody in this House of Representatives that I will be the last man standing saying that you will not drill off the shore of Florida beyond the limits of the law that all of us agreed to until such time you change that law. Florida's beaches are pristine. Florida's tourism depends upon them, and I am astounded that my California colleagues would come here and say that they want that kind of drilling. We own that opportunity. Sixty-eight million acres are already leased; as well as 23 million acres in the Arctic. What in the world are you talking about? Why are the oil companies not doing that drilling at this point? 
   And you come down here with some simplistic solution saying that some child in an office back there said drive small cars and wait for the wind. We aren't going to wait for the wind. T. Boone Pickens is not waiting for the wind. He has been an oil man all of his life, and he has decided that among the things that he is going to do is get involved in wind research. 
   I go to Denmark frequently in an organization that I work with. Denmark is supplying more than 30 percent of their energy with wind. And most of the windmills that you see come from that Denmark area. Assuredly at some point wind is going to be a major source, as is geothermal, as is gasification. 
   All of us know the buzz words, but let's stop kidding Americans. The solutions are costly, and the energy companies are the ones that are more likely to do this rather than us sitting around here with some mumbo-jumbo and a bunch of people running down here so that they can have a bumper sticker. 
   Everybody goes home, everybody buys gas, everybody knows it is high, and none of us in this place are going to do one doggone thing between now and the time that we leave here that is going to cause it to come down that much that it will be dramatic. 
   I have one more proposal: A tax credit for Jane Lunchbucket and Joe Lunchbucket. Give them a tax credit. When I was a child, we had oil coupons because oil was cheap, not cheap, but at the same time was not plentiful. So during the Second World War, we did what was necessary, and I would ask all of my colleagues in this body, just ask yourself the question: What would Roosevelt do? I think what he would do is say that we have a national crisis and that we owe it to ourselves to focus on what it will take, worldwide, in this global economy that we live in and in our Nation to undertake to do what is necessary for the American public. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding me this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. (COMMEMORATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OKEECHOBEE HURRICANE OF SEPTEMBER 1928 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I thank my good friend and new Member, in one sense of the word, from Maryland for yielding time to me. 
   I also want to thank the chairwoman and ranking Republican of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton and Sam Graves. And I thank Chairman Oberstar for his continuing leadership as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to have introduced this resolution with many  of my colleagues from Florida. All of them, as well as the majority leader and his floor staff, were so helpful in getting this resolution to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution that commemorates last week's 80th anniversary of the Okeechobee hurricane of 1928. Numerous communities in the congressional district that I am privileged to serve last week remembered the destruction of the Okeechobee hurricane, also known as Hurricane San Felipe Segundo. The storm ravaged Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, and numerous islands of the Caribbean. 
   The resolution also pays tribute appropriately to the over 4,000 lives lost from this tragic storm. More than 3,000 were lost in the United States alone, the second largest death toll ever recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Floridians living near Lake Okeechobee in communities that I am now privileged to represent experienced a devastating loss of life when the hurricane led to extensive breaches of the levees surrounding the lake. 
   Of the more than 3,000 casualties in the continental United States, more than 75 percent were migrant workers near Lake Okeechobee who were overwhelmingly African American. 
   The lack of capacity to respond to the storm and racial overtones of the era led to extensive disparities in the treatment of victims of the hurricane. Many African Americans were buried in poorly or unmarked mass graves, including one site in West Palm Beach where over 670 unfortunate souls were laid to rest. 
   Similar graves for white victims of the tragedy were visibly memorialized, whereas many African American graves were forgotten and still not known and some not recognized until many years later. 
   Mr. Speaker, neglecting these darker moments of our history can overlook important lessons, as we saw with the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav, and most recently, Ike. Beyond just recognizing the victims of the Okeechobee hurricane, their loss is a reminder of what can happen when there are injustices in disaster response and mitigation. 
   The potential for devastation due to failing infrastructure following disasters exists in many places throughout our Nation. That is why this resolution also places emphasis on hurricane preparedness and education. 
   It also commends the Army Corps of Engineers for the work that they are doing today to repair the Herbert Hoover Dike. The dike, which was built in the 1930s to protect the Lake Okeechobee communities that were flooded and destroyed by the Okeechobee hurricane, is in dire need of repairs. To date, Congress has appropriated well over $100 million to repair the dike. Without continued help, these communities will be vulnerable to devastation from future storms. 
   I wish to add a footnote. I came here 15 years ago. And all of my colleagues from Louisiana on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and in the House were continuously arguing then about the levees in New Orleans, and I just shudder to think about the fact that we were tardy in responding to them. 
   The experience of the Okeechobee hurricane still touches the lives of so many of my constituents and people throughout Florida and the Caribbean. 
   One of them I wish to personally memorialize, Dave Larramore, who we referred to as Brother Larramore. One of his favorite expressions was ``ain'tchaknow.'' 
   Brother Larramore was from the Bahamas and he was in Okeechobee when that storm occurred in 1928. He lost eight members of his family. He was holding on to his wife who was holding his child, and she dropped the child, and he grabbed the baby; and they were the only ones that came out of that storm. 
   He told that story often and stories of others. I take this opportunity to remember him with the kindness that this body offers to our people when they pass, no matter how long ago that it was. 
   The House's consideration of this resolution today is both appropriate and timely. I ask for my colleagues' support.
