<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. I am actually walking into the floor at a good time to pick up on the point that the Chair of the committee is making. 
   This has kind of turned out to be the kind of debate that you hear in politics: Democrats believe in government and government can do everything; and Republicans believe in the private sector, and the private sector can do everything. The truth of the matter is neither one of those things is correct. There are some things that government can do and there are some things, a lot of things, that the private sector can do. One thing I think the private sector cannot do effectively is to insure against the kind of things that are really governmental responsibilities, protection of ourselves, our national defense. When that fails, it becomes a responsibility of government to accept and provide a safety net for our business community, or for our people. 
   It is unfortunate that this debate has deteriorated into that kind of dichotomy. You have to either have all of government or all of the private sector. 
   We think this is an ideal time for the government to be providing this kind of insurance protection so that business and the private sector and real estate development can continue to operate without fear of intervention by foreign powers or terrorists. 
   And I rise in support of the amendment

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I have been listening with some interest to the comments on this amendment, and I think there would be substantially more credibility for the people who are advancing it if there had actually been some units constructed or even started in the 17 or 18 months since Hurricane Katrina occurred. 
   It is somewhat amazing to me how we have fought for so many years to do community development, and all of a sudden HUD and our colleagues here want to do community development, but they want to do it in this distress atmosphere where there is no housing, even for people to move back into who would participate and do work on the units. 
   Here is what has happened. The hospitals that had damage to the first floors went back in and put patients on the second, third and fourth floors. The housing, the public housing that had damage to the first floors, the Public Housing Agency, which, by the way, is in receivership under HUD, not an independent local housing authority, but in receivership, being operated by HUD, took the position that it would be unsafe to put public housing tenants back in those units by restoring second, third, fourth floors of the housing units. 
   Now, I can't figure out how it is safe to put medical patients on the second, third and fourth floors of hospitals where you have gone in and basically done some remedial stuff on the first floors of the hospitals, and yet it is unsafe to put people who have no housing to return to on the second, third, fourth floors, and restore the first floors of the public housing. 
   This is not an argument against doing longer-term community revitalization. That needs to happen, and we are supportive of that. But in this distress situation, there needs to be, first, restoration of the housing that was there so that people can move back in and get back into their communities and stop being scattered all over the country. And that should be the highest priority that we are pursuing, and that is what the bill does.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am struck because I was here about 15 or 20 minutes ago debating the last amendment. We operate in a structure that requires us to deal with one amendment at a time, and when you deal with one amendment at a time, you kind of get segmented into these little places that you are. But the thing that is astonishing here in this opposition to this amendment is that if you look at it in the context of the last amendment and this amendment, I don't know what it is you all would have these people do for housing. 
   In the last amendment, you said we don't want to build or renovate or restore any public housing in New Orleans because we want to do community development in New Orleans, and that is going to take a long time, and it is counterproductive to restore public housing in New Orleans while we are doing this community development. 
   Then in the next amendment you say, well, we don't want to give people vouchers so they can in the meantime stay in Houston, Texas, or Charlotte, North Carolina, or California or anywhere else. 
   Then my colleague gets up and starts his comments by saying, well, we are all working toward the same objective. 
   I keep wondering what that objective is. Our objective is to house these people temporarily and long term. Then in the last amendment you cut off the notion that you would house them long term because you don't want to renovate public housing. In this amendment you are cutting off the notion that you will house them short term because you don't want to give them vouchers to have housing immediately. 
   So when and where are you planning to house these people? Now, there is, my colleague reminded me, a NASA facility in Houston. Maybe you would like for us to put them on a spaceship and send them out. 
   My friends, these are not welfare recipients. Even if you have these stereotypes about these people feasting at the trough, these are people who were displaced by a hurricane. Regardless of these images that you may have about welfare recipients, these are people, these are our United States citizens who were displaced by a natural disaster, and all we are trying to do is provide housing for them, both on an immediate basis and on a long-term basis. 
   They have had three or four cutoffs now where one day they are sitting in a hotel and they are told, your assistance is being cut off. Imagine what that does for family values and for the notion of stability. 
   Have a heart and let's pass this amendment so that we can provide some housing to these people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Let me, first of all, thank the gentlelady for convening this Special Order in memory of our dear friend and colleague, JULIA CARSON. 
   If you didn't know JULIA CARSON, you probably would think she was a study in contradictions. That is kind of always the way I felt about her. She was this person that, from the very beginning when she came to Congress, which was the first time I met her, appeared to be a very fragile person. You would see her on the floor and she didn't appear to be well; and yet you would go on a trip to South Africa, and there she would be out among the children meeting with them and undertaking the rigors of an international trip that you knew was an imposition physically on the most physically fit Member of Congress.     
   You would see her and talk to her and her voice would be so mild and gentle, and yet when she undertook an issue, it was just like a metamorphosis because she was so articulate and passionate about that issue. And you would see her and she would look at you sternly and make a quip, and you would walk away thinking it was kind of a straightforward statement. And then all of a sudden it would dawn on you she had zinged you without you even being aware of a subtle point that she had made. 
   There were these contradictions there that I loved about JULIA CARSON. Once you got to know her, sometimes she would game you, as Barney Frank has indicated. She would appear unsophisticated politically, and then all of a sudden she would pull one of the most important political maneuvers, like the tribute to Rosa Parks that took such delicate balancing to pull the elements together. This was a woman, a lady of contradictions, apparent contradictions, yet once you got to know JULIA CARSON, you knew there was one person there who was just steady as a rock. She was solid. We loved her and we express our sincere condolences to her family. 
   With that I know there are many who wish to speak, so I yield back.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the way he has framed this issue as a fiscal responsibility issue; although I think he frames it incorrectly in this case. 
   There really is no precedent in disaster situations if you go back throughout all the disaster situations for even requiring a local 10 percent match, and I think in another bill there will be language that would actually waive the 10 percent local match. 
   This component of it disallows the use of Federal money that has been granted to the local communities to provide that 10 percent match. I think the issue is going to go away in another context anyway, but it is counterintuitive to say to local communities whose complete tax base has been destroyed that they should somehow provide a 10 percent match for Federal funds that are given, and historically in disaster situations, there really has never been a 10 percent match at all because we have recognized that the distress situation that is created by a disaster makes it highly unlikely, improbable, impossible in many circumstances, that the 10 percent match would be able to be met by the local community. 
   You take that and multiply it times five, because this is five times the worst natural disaster that our country has ever had. So we should reject this five times, not just once.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   There is probably no worse instance to be doing legislation than having to do it in response to a crisis. Legislating to clean up a mess is just not as fun as it is if you do something thoughtfully looking forward to try to prevent a mess from occurring. 
   And we've been, for the last several years, trying to legislate. We had predatory lending legislation. We've been on the forefront of that. But we've been having difficulty getting people to recognize that a crisis was coming if we didn't respond to cut back on irresponsibility in the market. 
   There are two problems here. The first is, is there a real crisis that needs to be responded to? And that is really the question that I have gotten a lot more calls from my constituents about. The second issue of course is what do you do about it if there is a crisis? So let me talk about the first of those first. Is there a crisis? And that question I really don't have an answer for other than the answer that we were given by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve 1 week ago Thursday which was that we are in a real crisis situation that could mushroom into something worse than the Great Depression. 
   It's not my responsibility as an individual Member of Congress to go and prove that. But when the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve tell me that there is a real problem, the stakes become too high for me not to take it seriously. It's not my responsibility to go and convince the American people, and I wish we had a President that had enough communication skills and enough credibility with the American people to convince them that there is a real problem. Unfortunately, that burden hadn't been carried sufficiently by the administration.     
   But I am convinced that the odds are bad enough that if we don't do something today, we will regret it for a long, long time to come. Having jumped across that threshold, we have shaped this package as responsibly as we can shape it, and I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS REPORT ON THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I thank my colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones from Ohio, for yielding time. I don't think it will take me 5 minutes to do this, but I did want to spend a little bit of time talking about the annual legislative conference that was conducted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation this past weekend. 
   I heard the comments of my colleague from California, Ms. Diane Watson, and I was fortunate to be able to sit in on one of her issues forums related to the Cherokee Freedmen, and I thought it was a very balanced and productive session, and very informative. 
   I've been privileged to be a part of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual legislative weekend for all 15 years that I have served in Congress. And I would have to say that the first 13 of those years I did my piece of the conference by conducting a discussion and issues forum on the Voting Rights Act, access to the vote, and I participated in various issues related to the Judiciary Committee. But last year and the year before last, I was honored to serve as the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and I took a different perspective during those 2 years because it gave me an opportunity, as Chair of the caucus, not only to do my own issues forum, but it was part of, I viewed it as part of my responsibility to drop in on all of the issues forums and brain trust discussions that were going on. 
   And I can tell you firsthand that there was nowhere in the world that there were more thoughtful provocative discussions going on about the state of black America, our role in the United States, our role in education, justice, our role internationally, than take place at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual legislative conference. 
   That is the place to be to discuss the issues that impact our community, and I saw it firsthand, from issues related to the hip hop generation to the confidence of our African American youth, to the prison pipeline that, unfortunately, has been created, to the disparities that exist in health care and education and even in our international foreign policy. 
   So I'm honored to have been able to have viewed the weekend from a different perspective for the last 2 years. 
   But I will tell you, Madam Speaker, and my colleague, Representative Tubbs Jones, that I was honored to get back to being able to do just my thing again this year. And we had a delightful discussion about the Voting Rights Act in my issues forum.     
   Last year we had just passed the 25-year reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and so we took that year to kind of pat ourselves on the back and talk about what we had just accomplished. But we knew the onslaught would be coming immediately. And within that 1-year period, there has been a concerted effort, litigation has been filed, which is a direct frontal attack on the Voting Rights Act and its reauthorization. 
   So the first part of my issues related to that legal attack, which had just been argued in a court of appeals about 2 weeks ago, and I had the lawyer from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund there at my brain trust to talk about that attack and its likelihood for success. And I'm happy to report that we do not believe it is a serious attack, although there will certainly be others to come.  
   That presentation was followed by a presentation by Donna Brazile on the various methods that have been used throughout the country to discourage minority participation in the voting process and what we plan to do about it in the 2007 election and, more importantly perhaps, in the 2008 Presidential election cycle, some of the strategies that we plan to follow to combat those efforts to diminish and reduce minority participation in the voting process. 
   And then our third panelist was a director of a board of elections in Florida who talked about the desirability of creating a paper trail so that people who do show up and vote at the polls can reliably be certain that their vote will be counted and properly assessed. 
   So we just had three panelists. They did outstanding jobs. We had ample time for discussion and participation by the attendees at the conference and at our issues forum. It was a delightful experience and one that I look forward to being around next year at this time to replicate. 
   I again applaud you for convening this Special Order tonight to allow us the opportunity to talk about not only the fun things that happened at the foundation's annual legislative conference but, more importantly, the wonderful substantive discussions that take place around every issue that impact our community. 
   With that I will thank our convener this evening.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to recognize the 25th anniversary of Reverend Dr. Clifford Anthony Jones as pastor of the Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
   Since moving to Charlotte 25 years ago to the accept the call to lead Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, Pastor Jones has been an important leader in our community and has made significant contributions to our State and internationally. In addition to his important religious role as the leader of a large, dynamic congregation, he is recognized as a leader in race relations, in education, and in community development. Under his leadership, Friendship Missionary Baptist Church has acquired 108.5 acres of land in Charlotte on which they are pursuing plans to develop HIV/AIDS housing, single family housing, a child care center, commercial space, an assisted-living facility for seniors, and centers for Alzheimers and hospice patients. Amidst all these accomplishments, Pastor Jones is also recognized as an outstanding husband and father and is a published author. 
   Pastor Jones has also been an active force internationally. He has organized and led medical and religious mission teams of doctors, nurses, technicians, and teachers to provide needed healthcare, medical supplies, and educational training in Jamaica, Africa, India, and Guyana for children and families struggling in poverty. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm sure my colleagues join me in wishing Reverend Dr. Clifford Anthony Jones, Sr., and the Friendship Missionary Baptist Church congregation a happy 25th pastoral anniversary and best wishes for years to come.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to this debate, and the only thing I could be reminded of was a few years ago when I had a very, very serious political campaign mounted against me and that had about $800,000 spent on television ads telling people how terrible I was, and at the end of the campaign, my mother finally called me and said, ``Are you really that bad?'' 
   I don't recognize the bill that's being described here on the floor. Title II and title III we have overwhelmingly passed previously. Title V was overwhelmingly passed out of the Financial Services Committee. And all of the representations that are made about title I seem to me to be just outrageously overstated. 
   Like FHA is going to assume all of this responsibility. This is a bailout. 
   This is a voluntary program. FHA is not out soliciting any of these loans. They will evaluate the credit worthiness of everyone who comes to them. 
   Like this will cost $300 billion. 
   There's no way this program will cost $300 billion unless every single person who gets involved in it defaults and we get nothing out of a foreclosure or reclaiming of the property. 
   Like this is going to benefit speculators. 
   The bill explicitly says that this is limited to homeowners, not people who have been speculators. I don't know what else we could say on that. The language is absolutely explicit that only homeowners qualify for this program.  
   Or maybe like the most outrageous one that I've heard today: Well, the market will take care of this. 
   Well, the market is how we got here in the first place. If the market had been taking care of this, we wouldn't be in this crisis. We wouldn't be having the problem that we are trying to solve. And so this notion that the market is somehow going to overnight correct itself and we will solve this problem solely through market forces just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. But, again, my mother started to question after a while, after people said it over and over and over again. Maybe my colleagues think if they say it enough, that this is terrible, they will convince somebody.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   The gentleman has indicated that this is about transparency. I really don't think it is about transparency. The underlying bill is about transparency and giving shareholders the information they need to at least express themselves about salary increases and golden parachutes, both of which I think all of my colleagues have acknowledged are problems that need to be addressed. 
   What this amendment is about is more about two things. One is the ability to express ourselves to each other as shareholders without impediments. That at some level is a free speech issue. The second thing this amendment is about is balance. What the gentleman would say to shareholders is, if you communicate with other shareholders about executive compensation or a golden parachute, then your vote gets disqualified. But if the corporate executive communicates with other shareholders about this issue, they can do it in an unimpeded way and without any consequence. 
   So if the gentleman were interested in making this a balanced amendment, what he would do is to add a provision that said, if the executives communicated with the shareholders about the vote, then they would be disqualified from getting any salary increase if they didn't disclose if they had spent anything other than a de minimis amount of money communicating with the shareholders. That would give it some balance. But right now, it is, as the gentleman from California has pointed out, a completely unbalanced equation. And it is not unlike what is already existing in this executive compensation arena because the scales are  totally unbalanced against shareholders, and the underlying bill attempts to at least in some measure restore a sense of balance and give shareholders more rights. It doesn't do it in an intrusive way. In fact, there are a number of proposals, including one on the Senate side, that would be a lot more intrusive than this bill. 
   I think this is the least intrusive way to do it, and I support the underlying bill and oppose the gentleman's amendment to the bill.

   So a broader amendment, were it germane to this bill, would probably be received favorably by all of us because we believe that fiduciaries in general should be reporting to the people that they are representing. But when you limit it only to pension plans, you eliminate foundations, you eliminate family trusts, and you eliminate a whole range of other fiduciaries that should have the same obligation. And singling out pension plans in this context I think is the wrong thing to do.

   I doubt that the gentleman could imagine the number of visitors that come into Washington for these events, for these maneuvers, along with the families of these service people. We regularly, as Members of Congress, get invited, though we are seldom here on Friday evenings to take advantage. 
   But if you look at the benefit that is probably coming out of these maneuvers and the participation of the public and the support it builds up for our military and for the economy in this area, it is just a dramatic illustration. I just wanted to make that point.

It's unfortunate that the earmark was named after the Perfect Christmas Tree, but the book itself, written by a local author, has produced a substantial amount of employment and funds for this area of North Carolina. 
   And for us to demean the notion of a perfect Christmas tree, which is the title to the book, a children's book, further convolutes this. I find myself kind of defending the Perfect Christmas Tree.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding time. 
   I rise in support of the bill. The bill deserves our support for two important reasons. First of all, it establishes a strong regulator in an area that has cried out for greater regulation, and I think we understand that looking back on what has happened at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the last several years. 
   Second of all, the bill establishes a trust fund that is very similar to the housing trust fund for which over 200 of the Republicans voted last year. So I really am surprised to find that this year all of the sudden there is all of this opposition to the trust fund. 
   So I want to spend a minute talking about the trust fund. First of all, it is a housing trust fund, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are designed to incentivize more housing for middle income and low income people. So it's absolutely consistent with the purposes for which they were founded. 
   Second, the ranking member of our committee made it sound like this is going to increase the cost of housing for middle income people and low income people. In fact, what we need to focus on is that this money will either go to the stockholders of Fannie and Freddie or it will go to the purpose for which Fannie and Freddie was originally formed. 
   So this is not a choice between raising taxes or not. This is fulfilling the purpose of these two entities.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am always reluctant to rise in opposition to my colleague from North Carolina, because he is my close colleague from North Carolina. He is right next door to my congressional district, well, one county removed, I guess. So it's burdensome when I have to rise in opposition to his amendments. 
   But this one I feel strongly about. First of all, I have heard this argument several times today that this imposes some kind of tax on middle-class and low-income homeowners. I think, if you look into this, you will find that this money is either going into a trust fund, which we all support to increase homeownership and affordable housing in this country, or, as has been the case throughout Fannie and Freddie's existence, it is going to the shareholders of Fannie and Freddie. 
   There is no passing along of savings, no enhancement of credit to additional home buyers. This is a choice between whether the shareholders get it or if we were going to finance affordable housing by the government, whether the taxpayers would be paying for it, which this trust fund really shields the taxpayers from having put up this money. That's my first argument. 
   The second concern I have is that this trust fund would sunset in 5 years, and we have, as a Congress, if we pass this bill and it survives through the whole process, we will have legislated this into existence. 
   The effect of this amendment would be to allow the director of this new agency with all these enhanced powers that we have given to him, to unlegislate what we have legislated, which I think is an inappropriate delegation of our authority. 
   Now, it may be that we make a bad decision to legislate it, but we recognize that by putting a 5-year sunset in the provision and allowing ourselves to come back and correct our own decision if we find that the decision was erroneous. 
   It is not good from my vantage point, to say to a director of any Federal agency, we passed this as a policy matter, and we are going to give you the authority to reverse it. 
   Now, if some independent body were making this determination, it were a study, as the gentleman indicated, we agreed to a study by the GAO and put it in the bill. That would be an appropriate mechanism for us to get feedback where we could undo this at the end of 5 years or renew it at the end of 5 years, but that's different than saying to the director, you can go if you determine that A, B or C exists, and you can unwind what the Congress of the United States told you is the law of the land. 
   So if the gentleman were inclined to offer this as part of this study, which we approve, I think it might be an appropriate way to proceed, because it would help to inform us. The GAO would do the study, they would tell us what their results were, and if we agreed with them that it was a big enough mistake, then we could, even before the 5 years, we could go back and correct it. But I don't want any director of some agency to be passing legislation either directly or indirectly. 
   For that reason, I think this is not a good amendment. I encourage my colleagues to defeat it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. I want to suggest the second step of the dance, from my perspective, is the money goes into the trust fund; housing is built; that generates economic activity and reduces the deficit. So the second step to this dance is a deficit reduction using the trust fund, not under the gentleman's amendment though.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I won't take 5 minutes. I just want to remind Members that we've just spent an awful lot of time arguing about something that has nothing to do with this bill, and that there are a number of other amendments. And I fear that at some point tonight, we will regret this detour on which we have engaged. 
   It illustrates, and the gentleman who is in his first term here will appreciate why the rules of the House are constructed as they are. You don't have a provision to transfer this to the debt because if there were a provision in your amendment to transfer it to the debt or to Social Security, this amendment would be non germane to this bill. And without germaneness rules, you can go off and talk about, for as long as you want, as they do in the Senate sometimes, about anything that they want to talk about. 
   But the amendment that you have offered is marginally germane because you didn't do what you say you wanted to do. And you've made the point that, Mr. Chairman, he's made the point that he wanted to make, I'm sure, to his constituents. 
   So I would hope that we could get back to the amendments that are germane and relevant to this bill, and maybe finish this bill tonight. It would be wonderful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   I have been reading the amendment. And the first part of the amendment really does exactly what the bill does, it tells the director to set up some guidelines, and that is what the director is authorized to do under this bill. So that's not troublesome. 
   But then you get to page 2 of the amendment, and then you have the requirement that there be a settlement procedure which is duplicative of the settlement procedure that already exists under law. You have the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act already in place. There is going to be a separate set of disclosures now related to this. And then the gentleman has the nerve to say that we are creating a bureaucracy and adding costs to the closing process.     
   I, for the life of me, can't understand why this would be a good idea. 
   The first part of the amendment is fine, because that is what the bill is all about. But it is already in the bill. Why would you have two disclosures, two sets of disclosures? We have had hearing after hearing after hearing about how to simplify the disclosure process at closings. Mr. McHenry from my own State offered an amendment to the bill in committee that tried to put forth a one-page disclosure statement, and here we are now with you all telling us we ought to have a second set of disclosures at a closing under this trust fund. It is inconsistent, and it is obvious what this is about, is to throw every stumbling block in the way that you can to discourage the trust fund. 
   We had an amendment earlier that was defeated in the last series of votes. Mr. Bachus offered the amendment, the ranking member of the full committee, that would have stripped the trust fund out of the bill. You lost that amendment. You lost that amendment. To go every other conceivable way to try to do identically what the overwhelming majority of this House has already said it is not willing to do seems to me to be counterproductive. 
   Let me just address one other issue. Mr. Price from Georgia raised this earlier. We have to at some point say, look, we have had more open rules out of committee under Chairman Frank's chairmanship this year than all of the last 8 years in this House, and at some point the notion that we can continue to bring bills to the floor under open rules when we have 15 different amendments that essentially say the same thing over and over again, and then  have one of your Members get up and say, well, because one of your Members was not allowed to amend his faulty amendment it is not an open rule, it is insulting to the Chair of this committee and it is insulting to this institution. 
   So this is yet another example to do what was failed to be done in the ranking member's amendment, and I ask my colleagues to defeat it once again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Davidson College, President Tom Ross, Coach Bob McKillop, and the Davidson College Wildcats men's basketball team, which had one remarkable basketball season. Davidson College is one of a number of outstanding colleges and universities in my congressional district. The Wildcats basketball team finished its regular season undefeated in the Southern Conference, won the Southern Conference tournament, and went on to their third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. 
   In the NCAA tournament, Davidson College delivered three stunning upsets, eliminating the Gonzaga Bulldogs, the Georgetown Hoyas, and the Wisconsin Badgers on their way to the Elite Eight. In the Midwest regional finals, the Wildcats gave a tremendous effort before ultimately falling to Kansas by 2 points. Kansas, of course, went on to win the National Championship. By any measure Davidson College was the Cinderella team of this year's NCAA tournament. 
   In a fitting tribute to his coaching and leadership, Coach Bob McKillop received the Coach Clair Bee Award on April 7, honoring the NCAA Division I men's basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contribution to the sport during the year. 
   I wish Coach McKillop and his Cinderella Davidson Wildcats continued success. I am fortunate to represent Davidson College and their outstanding scholars and athletes in Congress. We'll be back next year.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Madam Speaker, in October of 2002 I worked meticulously with Members of the Congressional Black Caucus to craft a statement of principles that has proven to be so absolutely prophetic. Listen to what our 2002 principle said, and it will put in context why I feel so strongly that this war has taken us in the wrong direction and why this resolution is so necessary and worthy of our support. 
   First principle: ``We oppose a unilateral first strike action by the United States without a clearly demonstrated and imminent threat of attack on the United States.'' 
   My colleagues, history will record that the President took first strike action, and that there was neither a clearly demonstrated nor an imminent threat of attack on the United States. 
   Second principle: ``Only Congress has the authority to declare war.'' 
   History will record that Congress delegated that authority to the President, but I say unapologetically that history will also record that I voted against that delegation of authority. I never believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; and, even if it did, I never believed that they posed any imminent threat to the United States. 
   Third principle: ``Every conceivable diplomatic option must be exhausted.'' 
   History will record that our President instead thumbed his nose at the United Nations and at almost all diplomatic options in his rush to lead us into this foolhardy war. 
   Fourth principle: ``A unilateral first strike would undermine the moral authority of the United States, destabilize the Middle East region, and undermine the ability of our Nation to address unmet domestic priorities.'' 
   The passage of time has demonstrated and history will record that every single one of these concerns was legitimate and warranted. 
   Fifth principle: ``Any post-strike plan for maintaining stability in the region would be costly and require a long-term commitment.'' 
   We haven't yet gotten to a level of stability that we are trying to maintain, but the cost of this war today exceeds $500 billion. That is costly and with no end in sight. If we continue to follow the President, the duration of our commitment has no end in sight and no plan to bring home or redeploy our troops. 
   Increasing the number of troops in Iraq does not make ending the war more foreseeable. Past troop increases in Iraq have paraded under different names than surge, but make no mistake about it, this is not the first time the United States will have increased troop levels, and each time they have been met with greater levels of violence. 
   From December of 2003 to April 2004, the troop increase paraded under the name ``troop rotation'' and resulted in an increase from 122,000 to 137,000 troops; yet April of 2004 was the second deadliest month for U.S. forces. 
   From November 2004 to March 2005, the increase paraded under the name ``improving counterinsurgency operations after the Fallujah offensive,'' or ``increasing security after January 2005.'' We increased our troop level to 150,000 troops; the result, no impact on violence increase. And again, September to December of 2005, we went to 160,000 troops, still no decrease in violence. 
   In most respects, what the President has proposed is business as usual, simply under a different name. It did not work before, and there is no prospect that it will work this time. Madam Speaker, this resolution is one that we should support and bring our troops home.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Resolution. Simply stated, as the Resolution says, I support the troops and I oppose the increase in the number of troops. Simply stated, I support a redeployment of the rest of our troops from Iraq as soon as possible. 
   But I can't go forward before I review how we got here in the first place. Looking back helps me to put a time perspective on this because this War is now approaching 5 years in duration, a period longer than the Second World War. And looking back also helps me to put a substantive perspective on this that I think is absolutely critical to an understanding of my vote. 
   It's gut wrenching for me to recall that as early as October 2002--several months before the President proceeded to war in Iraq and long before I was later elected to serve the 2-year term that I have now completed as Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus--I worked meticulously with every single member of the Congressional Black Caucus to craft a Statement of Principles that have proven to be so absolutely prophetic. Listen to what our 2002 Principles said and it will put in context why I feel so strongly that this War has taken us in the wrong direction and why this Resolution is so necessary and worthy of support: 
   First 2002 Congressional Black Caucus Principle: ``We oppose a unilateral, first-strike action by the United States without a clearly demonstrated and imminent threat of attack on the United States.'' My colleagues, history will record that the President took first strike action and that there was neither a clearly demonstrated nor an imminent threat of attack on the United States. 
   Second Principle: ``Only Congress has the authority to declare war.'' History will record that Congress delegated that authority to the President, but I say unapologetically that history will also record that I voted against that delegation of authority. I never believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and--perhaps more importantly--even if they did, I never believed that they posed any imminent threat to the United States. Saddam Hussein was a dastardly tyrant and bully toward his own people, but was a coward and no threat to the United States. 
   Third Principle: ``Every conceivable diplomatic option must be exhausted.'' History will record that our President, instead, thumbed his nose at the United Nations and at almost all diplomatic options in his rush to lead us into this foolhardy war. 
   Fourth Principle: ``A unilateral first strike would undermine the moral authority of the United States, destabilize the Middle East region and undermine the ability of our Nation to address unmet domestic priorities.'' The passage of time has demonstrated and history will record that every single one of those concerns was legitimate and warranted. 
   Fifth Principle: ``Any post-strike plan for maintaining stability in the region would be costly and require a long-term commitment.'' We haven't yet gotten to a level of stability that we're trying to maintain, but the cost of this War to date exceeds $500 billion. That's ``costly'' and with no end in sight. If we continue to follow the President, the duration of our commitment has no end in sight and no plan to bring home or redeploy our troops. 
   Increasing the number of troops in Iraq does not make ending the War more foreseeable. It will only escalate the number of troops and the prospects of casualties and will likely only increase the resolve of the enemy, the same thing that increases in troop levels have done in the past. Past troop increases in Iraq have paraded under different names than ``surge''. But, make no mistake about it, this is not the first time the United States will have increased troop levels. And each time they have been met with greater violence. 
   From December of 2003 to April of 2004, the troop increase paraded under the name ``troop rotation'' and resulted in an increase from 122,000 to 137,000 troops. Yet April of 2004 was the second deadliest month for U.S. forces. 
   From November 2004 to March 2005, the increase paraded under the name ``improving counterinsurgency operations after the Fallujah offensive'' or ``increasing security before the January 2005 constitutional elections'' and increased troops to 150,000. Result: short term positive impact, but longer term increase in violence and resistance. 
   Between September and December 2005, troop levels were increased again, taking the  number up to 160,000, around the constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections. The referendum and elections proceeded without major violence, but the increase had little long term impact on sectarian violence. 
   In most respects, what the President has proposed is business as usual, simply under a different name. It did not work before and there is little prospect that it will work this time. 
   Madam Speaker, this Resolution is our attempt to make it clear that we do not support a troop increase or an escalation of this War. I intend to vote for the Resolution. I just hope the President is listening.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. I thank the gentlelady for convening this Special Order for us to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   In the midst of all our sadness I think the one thing that keeps occurring over and over and over again is wonderful, uplifting, fun stories and memories of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. In fact, I was privileged to share a whole sequence of fun, funny, uplifting experiences with Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and I concur with my colleague, Emanuel Cleaver, who made a comment earlier that this life did not cheat our friend Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She lived and enjoyed every single minute of it. Even when she was working, she was having fun. So I suspect you're going to hear from this group that is coming for this Special Order more stories about our experiences with her because they were all a series of fun experiences. 
   Let me start with this experience. Probably 3 weeks before Stephanie Tubbs Jones' death, 7:30 a.m. in the morning the phone rings at my residence in Charlotte, North Carolina, and on the other end is Stephanie Tubbs Jones saying, Mel, I got into your city last night at about 10 o'clock in the morning. I was on my way from Memphis, Tennessee, where I had been campaigning for a person who was running for Congress, and I was on my way to give a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio, and there was bad weather in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I ended up spending the night at a motel in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I don't have any clothes and I am supposed to be giving a speech in Cincinnati later today. What can you do for me? 
   I said, Well, Stephanie, no problem. I will just have somebody pick you up, take you to the shopping center. You can do your shopping, buy a whole new wardrobe. So she went to all this excuse to go shopping. We will hook you up. 
   So that very morning, as soon as the stores opened in Charlotte, one of my staff members had Stephanie Tubbs Jones at the mall and she did her shopping and we got her to the airport by 11:30 that morning to catch her flight to Cincinnati. She went to Cincinnati and gave her speech. 
   Now I missed the opportunity to see the outfits--not one, but outfits--that Stephanie Tubbs Jones purchased that morning. She promised me she was going to show me the special outfit that she purchased, and I never got the opportunity to see it. 
   But as those kinds of stories that make Stephanie Tubbs Jones a real person to us, not just a colleague in Congress, but a friend, a peer, a confidante, a person that you knew that if she ever made a commitment to you, would be there come heck or high water. I am cleaning it up a little bit.     
   She was our friend, a delightful, wonderful person, always with a smile. She  never got cheated in this life, because she lived every moment of it. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding me time. I know there are so many other of my colleagues here to pay tribute. I could go on and on and on, but I won't. I thank you for doing this. My condolences to Barbara and Mervyn and the entire Stephanie Tubbs Jones family.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment not proudly, unfortunately, but because of circumstances that have arisen that I will describe briefly and create the context for the amendment. 
   In 1866, after the Cherokee Nation, which at that time also owned slaves, had gone through tremendous imposition by the United States and forced off of their land, including the people that they owned as slaves, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma entered into a treaty with the United States under which it agreed to make not only the Indians who were Cherokees, but their slaves, members of the Cherokee Nation. Unfortunately, in March of 2007, the Cherokee Nation decided that it would, in violation of the 1866 treaty, take action to, in effect, rescind the citizenship of the descendants of the African Americans who had been their slaves, the so-called ``Cherokee Freedmen.'' That has created a tension between the African American community and the Cherokee Nation, which can best be described as unfortunate because there is so much common heritage there between the Cherokee Nation and African Americans, and common experience. And this has created a divide which we hope will soon be repaired and restored. 
   I'm in the unique position of understanding both sides of this because I understand when the Cherokee Nation says that in order to be a Cherokee, one has to have some Cherokee blood. And that is a position that is not a racist position. It is a position of establishing their ancestry, their blood lineage; and I have respect for that. 
   And I'm in the unique position of having a great-great-grandmother who was a Cherokee. I'm also in the unique position of being an African American and understanding that the fact of what the Cherokee Nation has done would be exactly the same as if the United States of America, having imported black people from Africa and enslaved them, once slavery had ended, had taken the position that slaves could not be citizens of the United States. 
   So I understand both sides of this argument. And I have tried to walk down the middle of it, but there is no way to reconcile those two positions. And so I reluctantly offer this amendment that would have the effect of denying funds that may be appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this bill, to the authority that is given under this bill, it would deny those funds from the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma until such time that they recognize the Freedmen as citizens of the Cherokee Nation. 
   With that, that's the essence of the amendment, and I will yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to oppose the amendment to the amendment that I have offered. I do want to make a couple of points. First of all, some question has been raised about the timing of my offering of the underlying amendment. I did not choose the timing of this. This bill is on the floor today. And if my amendment is not on the bill, who knows when there will be another opportunity to deliver this message and to create an impediment pending the outcome of the litigation. 
   So I am perfectly content with the current status of the events in the sense that the court has said to the Cherokee Nation in a temporary injunction that you cannot exclude the Freedmen from the Cherokee Nation. As long as that court order stays in effect, I consider that we are at the result, which is the appropriate result. But if by chance 6 months down the road, 3 months down the road, 2 months down the road, a contrary set of circumstances exist, either the court withdraws its temporary restraining order or rules in a way that I don't think with any kind of justification it can rule against the Cherokee Freedmen, then this language will be in the bill and would appropriately have been put in the bill today. I can't come back 6 months from now and put it in the bill that is passed today. 
   So I didn't choose the timing of this. I am having to do this in the time frame that this bill is moving. So in a sense, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) has served a very useful purpose here to basically codify everyone's agreement that as long as the court retains the status quo, allows Cherokee Freedmen to be citizens of the Cherokee Nation, that is an appropriate outcome for the case. And if that ceases to be the case, then this language would then take effect in the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, for that I think we are indebted to Mr. Boren for clarifying that. I appreciate him and will not oppose the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1095, the resolution recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. 
   The Fair Housing Act, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in April of 1968, only 1 week after the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. 
   This landmark act, the primary purpose of which is to prohibit discrimination in housing, introduced meaningful Federal enforcement mechanisms for buyers and renters. The Federal Housing Act initially prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion and national origin. Sex was subsequently added to the list of protected classes in 1974, and disability and family status were added in 1988. 
   Forty years later, in 2008, effective and meaningful enforcement of these fair housing laws continues to be critically important. It is essential that we continue to combat housing discrimination, which still exists today, not just by enacting laws, but by enforcing those that we have on the books already. 
   This is a meaningful piece of legislation, and I'm honored to pay tribute to the importance of it, but more importantly, to pay tribute and to recognize that enforcement continues to be a problem, and that discrimination in housing continues to exist. 
   With that, I thank the gentleman for the time.

   Mr. WATT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an historic anniversary of the National Crittenton Foundation, which was the first charitable organization created under a congressional charter, and is celebrating 125 years of service. 
   People who recognize the Crittenton name often recall only the maternity homes that were usually hidden and welcomed girls and young women seeking support during their unplanned pregnancies. Much less is known about the influence of the national network of affiliated Crittenton agencies and their lasting impact on the social work profession. 
   The unique relationship between the National Crittenton Foundation and the Crittenton family of agencies is based on the belief that addressing compelling social issues in the United States is best done through a network of independent local agencies supported by a national body. 
   There are now over 23 Crittenton agencies across the country. Together they have provided over 2,200 years of continuous service to 5 million vulnerable girls, young women and their families. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in wishing the National Crittenton Foundation and its family of agencies across the country happy anniversary, and our best wishes for another 125 years of success.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3678 is an excellent example of what can occur when we work together on both sides of the aisle to deal with highly complex issues, and I am evidently not alone in this observation. 
   This bipartisan legislation is supported by industry groups such as the Don't Tax Our Web Coalition, government organizations such as the National Governors Association, the Federal Tax Administration, the National Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of State Legislatures, and supported by a wide range of labor and union groups. 
   In sum, H.R. 3678 temporarily bans State and local taxes on Internet access, while minimizing the effect on State and local government ability to raise needed revenue and treat businesses fairly. The bill is pro-consumer, pro-innovation and pro-technology. It amends the Internet Tax Freedom Act in four key respects. 
   First, it extends the moratorium on State and local taxes on Internet access for 4 years until November 1, 2011. The 4-year time frame will allow Congress to make any adjustments to the moratorium, if necessary, in light of development in the States or in technology, as Congress has done each time it has extended the original moratorium in 2001, in 2004, and in this bill. It will also allow sufficient time for business planning, while ensuring that everyone continues to have the benefit of access to the Internet tax free. 
   Second, the bill extends for 4 years the grandfather provisions to preserve the legality of taxes imposed prior to the 1998 act, consistent with passed extensions. The bill also phases out new grandfathers that some States claim were created in the 2004 extension, while allowing States that issued public rulings before July 1, 2007, that are inconsistent with the foregoing rules to be held harmless until November 1, 2007. 
   Third, the bill clarifies the treatment of gross receipts taxes which certain States have enacted in recent years in lieu of or as a supplement to general corporate income taxes. Like the general corporate income tax, these gross receipt taxes apply to nearly all large businesses, not just to Internet access providers. The bill clarifies that this form of general business tax is treated in the same fashion as a corporate income tax and is not covered by the moratorium as long as it is broadly imposed on businesses and is not discriminatory in its application to providers of communication services, Internet access, or telecommunications. 
   Finally, in response to a number of concerns regarding the definition of Internet access in the current law, the bill clarifies the term to mean a service that enables a user to connect to the Internet. This new definition will not only prevent all tax-exempt content bundling but will also include closely related Internet communication services, such as e-mail and instant messaging. In addition, the bill amends the definition of ``telecommunications'' to include unregulated, nonutility telecommunications, such as cable service. 
   I want to particularly thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, as well as Subcommittee Chairperson S&#225;nchez and Ranking Member Cannon for their cooperative efforts in helping us get to this point in the process. 
   H.R. 3678 is a good, strong bill that provides much-needed clarity to the communications and Internet industries, and strikes the right balance in addressing the needs of States and local governments, while helping keep Internet access affordable. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I hope my colleagues will stay around, since they want to know the rationale for the 4-year extension versus the permanent extension, and listen to the rationale, because there is both ``practical rationale'' and there is ``substantive rationale.'' 
   Let me deal with the practical reasons first. This moratorium that currently exists will expire the last day of this month if we do not act. The Senate has not done anything yet, and in many ways has made it clear that a permanent moratorium would be ``dead on arrival'' in the Senate. If the Senate is not going to act on a permanent moratorium, for the House to pass a permanent moratorium, send it to the Senate, have the Senate reject that permanent moratorium, runs the risk that time will run out before the month's end and the moratorium will run out before the month's end. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have heard the argument that we ought to make this permanent because this is stifling innovation. That strikes me as being like the argument that we ought to not tax anything because people are going to quit making money because there are taxes on the money that they make. I don't know anybody who, over all these years of threats that people have said to me people are going to quit making money if you don't quit taxing their money, I don't know anybody who has fallen prey to that kind of shortsighted attitude. I don't know anybody in the technology industry or in the innovation industry who has fallen prey to this notion that we are going to stop innovating just because there is a temporary moratorium on Internet access taxation as opposed to a permanent moratorium. 
   The last time I checked, the definition of ``politics'' was that politics is the art of compromise. We are doing what is necessary to move a bill. We can stand here and rail against the idea of a good bill on the idea that we want a perfect bill, or we can pass this bill, which I presume all these people who are railing against it not being permanent are planning to vote against the temporary extension when we get to a vote on it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have heard this referred to as partisan politics. This is not partisan politics. We heard two Democrats get up and say they support a permanent moratorium. You have heard a number of Republicans say they support a permanent moratorium. There are people who don't support a permanent moratorium. A bunch of them are over there on the Senate side, and they have already made it clear if we deliver a bill over there, it's not coming back over here. So this is not partisan politics; it is practical politics. Understand the difference between partisan politics and practical politics. 
   Now, I have told you the political reasons why this is a temporary moratorium. Let me tell you the substantive reasons that this is a temporary moratorium. I just want to go back and read what I said in my opening statement. Every time we have extended this moratorium, we have revised this moratorium. The last time we did it, we had left out a whole bunch of people in the telecommunications world who thought that they should have been included in the definition of the moratorium. If we had made it permanent, perhaps we would have just left it as faulty, not corrected it. The fact that this is not a permanent moratorium doesn't mean that we can't go back 2 years from now, 4 years from now, 1 year from now, next month, and do something different. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is really not the end of the world that this is a temporary moratorium. This is the beginning of the world. We changed the moratorium in 2001, in 2004, and we will probably change it again, because every time we think we know the outer limits of the Internet, somebody comes along with something else that they can do on the Internet. 
   If we made this permanent, as if we had all the answers about what the moratorium, what the Internet's capacity is going to be, presumably that would be the end of the discussion, because we would have made this permanent, gone on to other issues, and not  been thinking about revisiting this and addressing whatever shortcomings we might have 4 years from now, as opposed to sometime in infinity out in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, for one, am not on the permanent moratorium bill. I stand here with integrity telling you that I think it would be a serious mistake to make this a permanent moratorium on Internet taxation, because we don't have a clue standing here today what the capacity of the Internet is. Four years from now everything in life may be being done on the Internet. We might have a virtual world out there and then we may not be able to tax anything under the moratorium. So we need to continue to look at this on a regular, systematic basis. 
   This is not a cavalier decision that we have made. It is a practical, substantive, smart decision that we have made. I would request that my colleagues get off of this kind of ``letting the perfect be the enemy of the good'' notion, support this bill, and let's move on and extend this moratorium for 4 additional years. It is a good bill.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill, as currently constructed, caps damages at the amount of three times the broker or lender fees for steering. It's crucial to increase the remedies for steering so that a limited remedy does not simply get figured into the cost of doing business. A more effective way of changing broker behavior would be to provide a remedy that provides for the greater of actual damages, or three times the broker or lender fees, because it is unlikely that we will incentivize people not to steer unless we make the penalties sufficiently onerous. 
   We want to eliminate the possibility that a lender will simply treat the remedy in the bill as a cost of doing business, and we believe that making the damages alternatively three times the broker's fees or actual damages will have more impact on reducing this bad kind of conduct. That's what the amendment does. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I have listened to and acknowledged the concerns that are raised by the  other side and by Mr. Perlmutter from our side about this provision. 
   It is clear that certainty has value. But certainty when certainty is unfair and when you are trying to discourage a particular act such as steering a borrower to a higher priced loan, if you don't put in the bill the ability of people to get the actual damages that they incur as a result of being steered to a higher priced loan, then you are not going to deter the activity. Many unsavory people will treat this just as a cost of doing business because the reward for steering is so high that they can incur that risk for nine transactions and get rewarded and pay the cost of the risk on the one transaction that they might get caught on. 
   So if you really want to deter people from steering to the highest cost loan, you've got to provide an effective remedy that deters them from doing that. That's all I am trying to do. If people don't engage in this activity, there are no remedies. We don't even need any remedies. But where they engage in an activity that we have acknowledged under the bill is an undesirable activity, we have outlawed it. We have said thou shalt not steer to a higher cost loan. If you don't provide a remedy that is commensurate with that, then what you are saying to the market is you don't really care. 
   So I think this amendment is good, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the full committee for yielding time, and I thank the ranking member of the full committee who has worked with us and recognized that there is a serious problem that is going on in the real estate area, in the lending area, that must be addressed, and I want to applaud the efforts of the chairman for trying to address this issue in a comprehensive and fair way. And perhaps the greatest testament to the chair of our committee is that we have come up with a bill that perhaps not any single person I know is completely happy with, including me. 
   This bill started 4 years ago with an initiative by Congressman Miller from North Carolina and myself, and this was in advance of the escalating foreclosures, the kind of irrational exuberance that was taking place in the real estate market. We saw that this was coming down the road because lending was becoming more available, but it was also becoming more irresponsible because it was viewed as a no-lose proposition. So lenders were making riskier and riskier loans to people who had more and more marginal credit and on terms that were not beneficial to the borrower but were financially beneficial, at least until the foreclosures started, to the lenders. 
   So the predatory lending part of this bill, which is title III, started out as the base bill to address those concerns that were taking place that were predatory practices, taking advantage of vulnerable borrowers so that lenders could make money. Then the onset of the foreclosures started, and the crisis in the marketplace in general reflected itself, and that has resulted in the addition of titles I and II of this bill, which put a framework around brokers, which creates a framework for responsible secondary market participation around lenders who dealt in prime loans. 
   Interestingly enough, over time, it is actually titles I and II that have become more controversial than title III, which was the predatory lending part of the bill. We think that the predatory lending part of the bill certainly has struck the best balance, because it is clear that with predatory loans there will be a national standard, but we are not preempting State laws and the States' ability to continue to innovate. 
   In titles I and II, where we have created a framework for the secondary market, we have preempted some State laws, and we have had trouble finding the right language to do that. We want to do it to create a national secondary market, but we don't want to do it outside the specific requirements that are needed to control the secondary market and make credit available. So there is some angst among a number of us about the preemption language. 
   As I said at the beginning, maybe the best tribute to all of us is that we have a bill that nobody really is completely comfortable with, and all we can say to all of those people is that we will continue to work on this bill not only after it passes the House today, but throughout the process to reach the more delicate balance and a satisfactory balance that at the end of the day will solve the problems in the marketplace and be satisfactory to all concerned.

   Mr. WATT. Madam Chairman, this amendment, on its face, is very, very simple, although I expect there will be some controversy about it. The amendment simply changes one word. The word is ``or.'' We change the word to ``and'' in the bill instead. You would think that would be noncontroversial, but let me get into the effect of that. 
   Currently, if an assignee of a mortgage has policies and procedures not to buy subprime loans that do not meet safe harbor provisions that are in this bill, or if the assignee is willing to cure such loans, the assignee has no liability until you get to a foreclosure situation. That's very complicated, I understand; but that's what the bill provides. 
   The effect of the amendment would be to require the assignee to have policies and procedures in place and do certain things and be willing to cure the loan to avoid being liable for rescission. 
   That's important because if you give the option to an assignee of either curing or having policies and practices that are responsible in place, an assignee can then just treat the cure as a cost of doing business, and it becomes an ineffective choice. But if they are obligated to both have the policies and procedures and protections in place, and be willing to cure the loan, then they are not going to exercise the option to do the least onerous one of those things. 
   It is a simple provision, a simple change, although I understand the arguments against it. 
   And I will, having created the framework and explained what we are trying to do, reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. I yield myself the balance of the time, and I assure you, I won't use it. 
   The arguments that have been made are absolutely correct with respect to 99 \44/100\ percent of the people operating in the market. These are not bad people. But this bill was drawn to get at that small percentage of the market that is out of control. And if you give that small percentage of the market the option of either doing some paperwork or curing, as opposed to having to do both of those things, I guarantee you they will take the option that is most cost beneficial to them. And  that's what we've been trying to stop, those people in the marketplace who are out of control. And that's what this amendment is designed to do. 
   For the rest of the market, it really won't have any impact at all because they're going to put procedures in place and they are going to be willing to cure, if that's the last resort. 
   So, I think, unfortunately, there are players in this market that have been out of control. This bill is designed to deal with them, and this amendment would help disincentivize them being out of control without harming anybody else. I would encourage my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. Madam Chair, you may not have to recognize anybody in opposition to this amendment because I plan to offer it and then withdraw it. But I think I would be remiss not to discuss the issue because of two reasons: Number one, it needs to be discussed because of the very difficult, delicate balance that the Chair has been able to walk to get us to this point; and number two, to illustrate once again that when you allow good things to happen in the marketplace, some people in the marketplace will abuse them. And trying to get the right balance to encourage good things to happen in the marketplace and not discourage that from happening opens up, sometimes, the possibility that people who are not well intentioned will engage in activities that need to be prevented. And this is the classic case of that. 
   Basically, the bill now presumes that we meet the ability to repay a loan and provide net tangible benefit to a borrower if it is not a subprime loan. If it is a prime loan in the marketplace right now, that interest rate is 8.25 percent, so anything below that we presume to be a good loan. 
   The market now has done this. They've made available in the market a loan that defers interest and principal. And that is a good thing for about 90 percent of the people, maybe even more than that, who have the ability to do that. I'm the classic example of that. I have a loan in which I can defer for a period of time both the interest and the principal on the loan. But if you make that kind of loan available to somebody who doesn't have the income level that is sufficient  to pay it, under this bill, they can't even go back and offer proof that you shouldn't have done that, because we presumed, irrefutably presumed, that this is a good loan. And so the amendment that I was trying to craft and offer would have tried to close that. The problem is, if I close it for the bad people, then I also close it for the good people. 
   And so, as an alternative to proceeding with the amendment, I have convinced the Chair, I hope, that we will continue to work on this issue and find a way to stop the bad people from making these kinds of loans or abusing the process without penalizing the people who really deserve and should have these kinds of loans, which I acknowledged from the very beginning serve a useful place in the marketplace. 
   I yield to the chairman of the committee.

   Mr. WATT. And that's all I wish to have acknowledged, and to demonstrate to everybody who is listening, really, that this has been a difficult issue, because just about any kind of loan that can be made in the marketplace, somebody can benefit from.     
   But when you have a loan that is particularly subject to being abused, you have to have rules to constrain it. 
   Madam Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.

   Mr. WATT. Madam Chairman, my good friend Mr. Hensarling may be surprised to know that we actually agree very much with the spirit of what he is trying to do. And I am not sure that my amendment will absolutely cure all of the concerns we have with it, but it will certainly make it better, and we will continue to work on trying to really address the issue. 
   We don't want anybody to walk in and give false information on an application for a loan. One of the reasons we fought so hard to protect State laws  and not to preempt all State laws is because that would be fraud and we think it would be outrageous, it would be shyster. But as everything, there is another side to this, and I will illustrate it with a loan that I just recently closed myself, a loan that was made to me. 
   I submitted the application. I submitted the financial information. And what happened after that was that because the lender wanted their own form, they took my information that I had submitted to them and put it on their own form. They handed it back to me in a stack of forms that I needed to sign, and I signed them. 
   Now, what has happened in the marketplace much, much more than the gentleman would like to know is that when that second block of papers came back, somebody had put false information on that application because they knew this borrower was not going to qualify for the loan if they didn't fudge the borrower's income, if they didn't fudge the borrower's credit in some way. So it was not the borrower who gave the false information; it was somebody else in the chain. And that is what we have got to guard against. And that's what the basic bill is all about. 
   Now, we don't have any problem holding people personally accountable for the information that they knowingly provide; but if somebody just sticks some documents in front of me after I have given them the right information and they go back and change the information or put it on another form and I just happened to sign it because I presumed that the lender I am dealing with or the broker I am dealing with is honorable, I shouldn't be held accountable for that. And my second-degree amendment helps to make that clearer. And I hope by the time this bill gets passed, we can make it absolutely clear that what Mr. Hensarling is trying to accomplish and what I am trying to accomplish get taken into account. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, once again, Mr. Garrett has focused on an issue that we talked about earlier in the debate. I offered an amendment and withdrew it, and it related to this general section. Basically, what we have done is allowed the lenders to presume, if they meet certain conditions, that their loan will be considered a safe harbor loan and go into the secondary market without any complications. 
   In certain kinds of loans, we have made that presumption rebuttable because there is still tremendous opportunity for abuse even if they meet all of the safe harbor requirements. In other instances, we have made the presumption irrebuttable, and it was on the irrebuttable part of that that I offered the amendment and withdrew it. This is on the rebuttable part.  
   Now, the problem with Mr. Garrett's amendment is that if you take out this rebuttable presumption, then the presumption becomes irrebuttable for all kinds of loans, those that have risks, and those that don't have risks.     
   So what does that mean to the average lay person when you create a rebuttable or irrebuttable presumption? An irrebuttable presumption makes it impossible for you ever to rebut it. Because it is irrebuttable, you can't even raise it anymore. A rebuttable presumption makes it possible, even though it is presumed, that you can still go and offer evidence that what is generally a fair loan turned out to be, in your particular case, an unfair loan. 
   So the effect of Mr. Garrett's amendment would be to make it impossible ever for anybody to get into court and contest any of these loans. Because if you take out the rebuttable presumption, it becomes an irrebuttable presumption. We don't want that. I mean, that is where the marketplace is now. It is out of control. It has been out of control. 
   While we are setting up a construct to make the market better, we don't want to pass a law that then sanctions going right back to where we are now. That is how we got here in the first place, the market was out of control. And the construct that we have set up allows people to buy mortgages in the secondary market and presume that they will be okay. 
   But we don't want to set up a situation where it is impossible for anybody to go into the secondary market or against anybody and say under no circumstances will you be able to get liability. That is what Mr. Garrett would have you do. I think it would be very, very, very bad public policy. 
   With that, I encourage opposition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, when you practice law for 22 years, as I have before coming to Congress, and served on the Judiciary Committee for 15 years and never even in all that time dealt with patents, you are tempted to think of patent lawyers and the law of patents as a bunch of technocrats and elevate constitutional considerations and criminal law and other civil rights matters to a higher position. It has been an eye-opening experience for me, the first time to serve on this subcommittee and to see how important patent law is to stimulating, encouraging innovation, and to see how difficult and precise the law needs to be and how far behind the patent law has become in adapting to changes. 
   One of the changes that I think hasn't gotten much attention in this bill that I was surprised at as a member of the Financial Services Committee that has so many regulators of the various parts of our financial system which can promulgate rules, it seemed to me when I found out that the Patent and Trade Office really didn't have the authority to promulgate any meaningful rules, that that was contributing to the problem, because innovations and ideas and inventions and communications are traveling so fast that the law can't always keep up with them. It is in that context that meaningful regulation is important. So I wanted to point to that particular aspect.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I think we come to the floor not because we feel like Mr. Flake's amendment is likely to pass, but he provides a unique opportunity for us to talk to each other and the American people about some of the problems and stresses that are taking place in our country. There are three points that I want to make. 
   First of all, this is not a local issue for me. The appropriation, the consortium, is of eight leading textile research universities in Alabama, California, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Not one of those universities is located in my congressional district. This is not a local pork barrel request for those of us who are rising. 
   Second, I want to make the point that Mr. Coble and I, on a bipartisan basis, have been the co-Chairs of the furnishings caucus, which the textile industry provides a major base for in North Carolina and in other parts of the country. This is not something that's just about textiles. It is about a broader-based loss of jobs and employment opportunities and a severe impact on our economy and various economies in multiple States that goes well beyond just the textile industry. I hope Mr. Flake recognizes that.     
   The third point I want to make is a broader point, because it is raised by the gentleman from Arizona in a sequence of amendments. He has made the argument that somehow we are better off to let the Federal Government be making these decisions rather than trying to direct these appropriations through this process to local communities. 
   Now, that's an interesting argument for a person to be making who in most cases makes the counterargument that States rights are more important than Federal rights. If anybody knows what the priorities ought to be in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Alabama, South Carolina, it should be the people who are representing those areas, and I would have to say Presidents, administrations, Democrat and Republican, have not paid sufficient attention to the plight of the textile industry, the furnishings industry, the loss of manufacturing jobs that we pay in our local communities. 
   So for somebody to make the argument that we shouldn't be involved in the process when the decisions that are being made are impacting our local communities, I don't understand, especially a gentleman who has consistently and long term supported the notion of States rights. 
   So I think this is an appropriate thing for us to be doing, not only in this amendment context, but in most of the contexts, in essentially all of the contexts. I even supported his Republican colleague's Christmas tree amendment because I thought he knew more about the Christmas tree industry in his local community than anybody was ever going to know on a national basis about the importance of Christmas trees to his local economy. These are things that we are uniquely situated to understand and advocate for, and I would hope that our colleagues would strongly and resoundingly defeat this amendment, for those three purposes and others.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. I thank the Chair of the subcommittee for moving me up in the order so that I can address some of the misconceptions that we've just heard.  
   I'm holding in my hand a report that was authored, in fact one-third of the report that was authored, by HUD in 1996, about 4 or 5 years into the HOPE VI program. And if we thought that this program was only about demolishing distressed public housing, as my colleague who just spoke would have us believe, we should read the report. It did identify 86,000 severely distressed public housing units that needed to be demolished and replaced in a different kind of setting. It went on to say that we needed to address the needs of the residents. And the commission proposed providing increased funding for supportive services, creating a national system to coordinate social and supportive services to enable residents to become self-sufficient, and devising a system that requires public housing agencies to solicit resident input into the solutions. 
   And the things we have been complaining about, the gentleman is correct, we have been complaining about the HOPE VI program because it has only been about demolishing public housing and not doing any of the services that were originally contemplated by the program. And the amendments in this reauthorization bill are designed to attack those very shortcomings and the original objectives that HOPE VI was designed to accomplish. Number one, not only demolition, but one-for-one replacement is in this bill; input by residents is in this bill; supportive services, increased funding is in this bill. 
   So the gentleman is absolutely correct: those of us who have been complaining about the program acknowledge that it has not accomplished the objectives that were set for the programs by Republicans, not Democrats, to replace and eliminate severely distressed housing and to provide the kind of support that is necessary for residents of public housing to be successful. That's exactly what this bill does, and I encourage support for the bill.

   Mr. WATT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, listening to the gentleman, one would think that the demolition-only program is a harmless program in the Federal Government. It is absolutely true that the Bush administration has decided not to use the demolition-only authority that the statute gives them since 2003, but there are reasons that they have decided not to use the demolition-only authority. 
   Between 1996 and 2003, administrations made 285 demolition-only grants to 127 public housing authorities that resulted in demolishing, demolishing, 56,755 housing units, affordable housing units, in this country.     
   And the result was replacing less than half of those demolished housing units because we have had a net loss over that period of 30,000 affordable housing units. So the administration in its good wisdom decided that this was a program that was counterproductive, was contrary in fact to the original objective of the HOPE VI program, and discontinued the use of the authority that it had because it didn't think it was a good program. 
   Now, the case has been made well by a number of our committee members, Mr. Green from Texas in particular, that if there is anybody in America who thinks that there is an excess of affordable housing, they haven't read any statistics. If there is anybody in America who believes there is an excess of affordable public housing, or  public housing, period, in America, they haven't read the statistics. 
   So why the Federal Government would be giving money to local communities solely to tear down public housing, affordable housing in this country, given the dire shortage of housing in America and the massive existence of homelessness in America, I can't tell you. 
   Now, HOPE VI allows local communities to demolish distressed public housing; and one of the concerns that this bill addresses is that we have tried to have a program to replace those houses so that people won't be on the street. And that is exactly what HOPE VI does. That part of it we need to retain. The demolition grants need to be terminated. This bill terminates demolition-only grants, and we should support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WATT. I would just say the gentleman has made the exact point that I tried to make in my argument, probably even more cogently than I made it, that HOPE VI is about not only tearing down but rebuilding. And there is plenty of discretion in local communities inside the HOPE VI program to demolish public housing, as long as there is a plan to put housing back in place. And we have retained that authority to put housing back in place. The bill terminates the authority to just tear down rather than having the obligation to rebuild. 
   I oppose the gentleman's amendment and encourage my colleagues to vote against it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY GOLDEN BULLS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to the Johnson C. Smith University Golden Bulls men's basketball team which won the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament held in my congressional district this past weekend. The Lady Golden Bulls, unfortunately, lost to Shaw University in the women's championship game. 
   The CIAA basketball tournament is, of course, the premier basketball tournament in the country among Historically Black Colleges and Universities, dating back years before African American athletes were admitted to and allowed to compete in athletics at other universities throughout the United States. 
   While the tournament highlights the tops in athletic competition and is a source of much needed funding for academic and athletic scholarships, anyone who has ever attended the tournament will know, of course, that it is also an unrivaled social reunion and family event. 
   The outstanding athletic performances by Johnson C. Smith University's teams this weekend, especially the championship performance by the men's team, was one more tribute to Dr. Dorothy Yancey, who has announced that she will be retiring at the end of this school year after 14 years as president of Johnson C. Smith University. 
   Dr. Yancey made history when she became the first female president of Johnson C. Smith University in 1994. Her leadership and hands-on management has led Johnson C. Smith University to many outstanding accomplishments, including two successful accreditation reviews, getting Johnson C. Smith University fully wired, and making it one of the first institutions in the Nation to provide laptop computers to every student; construction, renovation, or restoration of state-of-the-art facilities; and recognition by the U.S. News and World Report magazine as a top tier institution among comprehensive colleges that offer bachelor's degrees for each of the last 6 years. 
   The recent success of Johnson C. Smith University's basketball teams, especially the CIAA's men's championship, is another tribute to Dr. Yancey's leadership as she prepares to retire from Johnson C. Smith. It couldn't have come at a more fitting time. Dr. Yancey's hard work and leadership will forever remain in the hearts of all Johnson C. Smith Golden Bulls and friends. We wish Dr. Yancey and Johnson C. Smith University continuing success. I am fortunate to be the representative of this fine university in Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATT. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time. 
   This is a big, big deal when it comes to housing, when it comes to responsible credit, when it comes to economic recovery in our Nation. This could perhaps be the most important bill that we have considered during the 16 years certainly that I've been a Member of Congress. 
   And to the extent that a lot of these reforms were already in the pipeline and well-thought-out and are now being implemented in response to a crisis, the fact that the crisis has occurred has forced us to do it. 
   And then there are some things in the bill that are being done solely in response to the crisis, and some of those things have been questioned by our colleagues on the other side as perhaps extending more responsibility to Fannie and Freddie, while at the same time increasing their risk, and there are concerns about that. 
   One of the most important things I think in this bill is a lot of these bad loans are having to be unwound, and borrowers need counseling to get them unwound. And we've given some funds in this bill to fund ongoing counseling, and we've added to it the ability to get some legal advice. 
   On the Senate side, they put in a provision. We had already said you can't use any of that money for class action litigation. On the Senate side, they put in a provision that said no civil litigation, and I think I'm satisfied that civil litigation is not broad enough to cover advice about foreclosures, that I've asked the Chair just to give me his opinion about whether the language in the bill is broad enough to foreclose any legal assistance with foreclosures.
