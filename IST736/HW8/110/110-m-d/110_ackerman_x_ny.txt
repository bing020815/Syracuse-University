<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Chairman, on September 11, in addition to the enormous loss of human life, the value of which cannot be measured, our Nation suffered catastrophic economic losses. The attacks of September 11 resulted in $30 billion worth of insured losses, the largest catastrophic insurance loss in the history of the United States, larger than any blizzard, tornado or hurricane. As a result, insurers and reinsurers began to worry about the likelihood and the cost of a future terrorist attack. 
   Worrying about risk and then monetizing that risk is the key to the insurance industry, which is an essential element in a modern dynamic economy. As happened, businesses with legitimate concerns about their solvency, insurance and reinsurance firms withdrew from the market where the attack took place. As the supply of terrorism insurance rapidly decreased, New York City developers, for whom terrorism insurance was essential to secure financing for their projects, were put in a precarious position. They needed terrorism insurance to continue building, but the market for insurance simply did not have enough supply to meet their demand. Similar shortages began occurring throughout the country. In simple terms, there was a market failure. 
   It was out of this dilemma that the critical need to address that original version of TRIA was born. TRIA increased the availability of terrorism insurance coverage by creating a Federal backstop that would share the burden of losses caused by any future attacks of terrorism with the insurance industry. 
   In the wake of 9/11, we had hoped that a temporary, 3-year program would provide enough of a shield to allow the market to fully recover. By late 2005, however, the Financial Services Committee and others in Congress realized that TRIA had not resulted in as quick or as robust a recovery of the market as was originally hoped. TRIA was extended for an additional 2 years, and is currently set to expire on December 31 of this year. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act is a major achievement. It eliminates the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terror. It incorporates group life insurance into the program. And, most importantly, this legislation extends TRIA for another 15 years. 
   Let us be clear: the enemy of business is uncertainty. This is particularly true for multi-million or multi-billion dollar real estate development projects, the kind that breathe life into our Nation. Designing, securing capital and then contracting for construction  is a multi-year process, and if we want these kinds of projects to go forward during these uncertain times, there is simply no alternative to providing a long-term terrorism insurance backstop. 
   Extending TRIA by 15 years is not a whim. It is not an arbitrary number. A 15-year extension would allow developers to secure 10- and 15-year bonds when financing their projects and would cover the life span of construction for our Nation's most innovative and remarkable development projects. 
   Equally as important to our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers is the inclusion of the so-called ``reset mechanism'' in this legislation. This language ensures that, in the aftermath of another catastrophic terrorist attack, the affected area or areas do not experience the same capacity problems that we experienced in New York following September 11. 
   To be clear, however, the reset mechanism included in H.R. 2761 is not a special favor extended to New York. Under the language I worked out with Mr. Baker, representing the minority side, in the event of a terrorist attack with losses of $1 billion or greater, the deductibles for any insurance company that pays out losses due to the event immediately would lower to 5 percent, while the nationwide trigger for any insurer for any future event drops to $5 million. 
   Mr. Baker and I also reached agreement on my proposal to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the total losses for two or more attacks that occur in the same geographic area in the same year, if the Secretary so chooses, so that if the total insured losses for those events are over $1 billion, the reset mechanism would be triggered. Permitting the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the losses of two or more attacks in the same year is absolutely essential to protect our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers from a scenario in which the same area suffers a loss of $1 billion in insured losses, either from two or more medium-scale attacks or from one large-scale attack. 
   The reset language is a true bipartisan compromise with the minority, accommodating a vast number of their concerns, and one in which I think Members of both sides should be very pleased. The new language simultaneously addresses the need to boost capacity in our Nation's highest risk areas, while recognizing that in case America suffers another catastrophic terrorist attack anywhere in this Nation, capacity shortages could be expected not only in the geographic area surrounding the site of the attack but also, quite possibly, throughout the Nation as a whole. 
   The chairman has asserted that he would accommodate the needs of those who have complained about the openness of the process, which I assure everybody is open. And as the leader of the conference, when the House goes into conference on this matter, Mr. Chairman, could you give us your assurance that this bill will come back in the kind of form that we will not have an issue?

   Mr. ACKERMAN. I thank the chairman. 
   My name was cited, along with a list of other New Yorkers having opposed the original TRIA when it came to the floor. The reason we did so is not because of TRIA, it was because the minority side, the Republican side at the time, tried to use this as a vehicle to move tort reform and added all sorts of tort reform provisions to the TRIA bill, which we absolutely opposed because it was a politically motivated move and not because of TRIA.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Chairman, our friends on the Republican side pride themselves on being tough on terror, and rightfully so. To be honest, it is evident when you listen to President Bush and he says things like ``You're either with us or against us.'' 
   But also the President said in the wake of 9/11, he said this here in this Chamber to the Congress and to the American people, and I quote our President, ``Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundations of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.'' Our President said that to us, Mr. Chairman. 
   After looking over the amendment, I realize the gentleman from New Mexico was not yet elected to be here and probably didn't get the memo about what the President said, because the effect of his amendment would allow terrorists to tell us where we can and where we cannot build after a catastrophic terrorist attack. 
   The bill would reset the deductible from 20 percent to 5 percent after a terrorist attack, which is good. The amendment that the gentleman proposes would increase the reset deductible to as high as 19 percent after a terrorist attack, which is almost the same as the original 20 percent. Small comfort. 
   Undermining the purpose and the intent of the reset mechanism by eliminating the incentives created by the reset would price insurers out of areas affected by terrorist attacks, prohibiting developers from rebuilding.  
   It would seem to me that to support this amendment is so blatantly to oppose the American resolve that President Bush claimed in the wake of September 11. Should we have left Ground Zero smoldering and not build the Freedom Tower? Should we concede defeat to Osama bin Laden? Should he dictate where we can and cannot build? 
   I say to the gentleman from New Mexico, if we cannot build and rebuild in the areas where terrorists attack, that is a major defeat for our country and a resounding retreat from the spirit of our Nation. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. I thank the other gentleman from New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are equities on both sides of this issue. 
   First of all, I think that we all have to and do understand that in order for any major development project to go forward, developers have to put together a plan, they have to put together their financing. Financing has to be secured in order for financing to be assured. Insurance has to be issued for any major project to go forward. There is no insurer that I can think of that would put $10 billion on the line without some backup in this day and age by the Federal Government, and I think that we're all pretty much in agreement to that. 
   In this argument of what to do on this rule and how to proceed, there are equities on both sides. It has been my view that the first thing that we should do is fix the rule so that in case this country is under a terrorist attack anywhere in the country, and this is not just New York City, we've been attacked, we've been attacked already, but anywhere in the country where a terrorist attack involving huge amounts of money, that the Federal Government would step in and we would not worry about the budget and the bottom line and balancing. Any city, any town, any State, any American community deserves to know that if America is attacked, and attacked in their city, in their neighborhood, in their community, that America stands behind them and will help make them whole and help put them back together again. 
   So it makes tremendous sense that the rule on PAYGO that was instituted and put into the rules of this House be made to accommodate the situation that says, in the case of war and in the case of a terrorist attack, nothing is going to stop us from moving forward, doing the business of America and assuring the American people. 
   My friends on the Republican side understand that, and they were helping to try to put this together. But the approach that we have taken up until this very moment, and, that is, putting the bill forward and then looking to find a fix later on down the road in my view was putting the horse in back of the cart. That has to be fixed, and that has to be addressed. 
   I originally came down here with the intent of opposing the rule, opposing the rule not because I oppose the bill, because I serve on the Financial Services Committee and worked very hard under the leadership and tutelage of Chairman Frank who has done an immense job together with our Republican colleagues on the committee to bring a great bill to the floor only to find that it was subject to PAYGO. 
   I've come to the conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that we should not be looking to sidestep PAYGO. We should not be looking to make an exception to PAYGO. We should not be looking to work around PAYGO. What we should be doing is bringing common sense to the process and amending the PAYGO rules so that in the case of a terrorist attack, PAYGO is not applicable, not that we make an end run around it. 
   In the last few moments, Mr. Speaker, I have, after consultation with the majority leader, received a letter from him, and he has been in meetings with the Speaker of the House on this up until this very moment. And those who have intended to oppose the rule have received in writing from the majority leader, after consultation with the Speaker, an assurance in writing in this letter to us that this process will not go forward in its final form for a second vote in the House until we not sidestep PAYGO, but address the issue of PAYGO and make it right so that it makes common sense to the House and to the American people. 
   I have that assurance, Mr. Speaker, that this process will be fixed and that we are engaged in an ongoing process, that this vote will not be the final step, that the vote after the rule on the bill will not be final, that this bill will not be brought before us in the conference, that we will reverse and put the horse in front of the cart.     
   I would urge those with whom I have conferred, New Yorkers and others who were very, very concerned about this process, that with the assurance of the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the House with whom I have worked for 25 years and whose word is gold, that we will bring common sense to this process and fix it before this process is through.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (OPPOSING ASSASSINATION OF LEBANESE PUBLIC FIGURES -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, what has been happening in Lebanon is extreme aggression in the classic sense of the word. Through a campaign of assassinations targeting Lebanese parliamentarians and political figures; bombings in public places; threats to establish an alternative extra-constitutional government; and the instigation of a jihadi insurgency by the Fatah al-Islam, Syria, Iran, their bootlegging proxies, Hezbollah, Amal, and Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, have brought Lebanon's government to a constitutional crisis. Yet again, outside actors have pushed Lebanon to the brink of civil war for their selfish interests. 
   Just 6 days ago, on September 19, a massive car bomb killed Antoine Ghanem along with five other civilians, and left many dozens of other bystanders wounded. Mr. Ghanem, a member of the Lebanese Parliament and a supporter of the Siniora government, was just the latest in a string of 11 political assassinations over the past 3 years. As a consequence of this pattern of violence, the March 14 alliance is two parliamentarians away from being murdered out of their majority. 
   Now is the time for this Congress to send a strong message of support for the democratically elected and fully legitimate government in Lebanon. Time, Mr. Speaker, is short. 
   The Syrian-backed campaign for murder is creeping ever closer to its goal of destroying the majority of the Lebanese Parliament, bringing down the government of Fuad Siniora, and imposing again a pro-Syrian president on Lebanon. 
   Fearing just this scenario months ago, I introduced H. Res. 548 with the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Pence, with Chairman Lantos and Representatives ISSA and BOUSTANY, two Members whose roots extend back to Lebanon. This bipartisan resolution expresses the strong support of the House of Representatives for Lebanon's elected government, and affirms our readiness to make that support tangible in order to help preserve and strengthen Lebanese sovereignty and independence. 
   The resolution condemns Syria and Iran for providing arms to Lebanese militias, particularly the terrorist group Hezbollah, and the Palestinian factions in Lebanon, in clear contravention of Security Council resolutions. 
   H. Res. 548 also endorses prompt action by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon established by the Security Council to investigate the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in February 2005. Syria must know with utter certainty that the United States will never sacrifice justice in Lebanon to allow Damascus to escape accountability for its crimes. 
   The current Lebanese Government, which is under siege, is both legitimate and representative of the majority of Lebanese. The attempts to undermine it are not some kind of retaliation. Lebanon's government is being systemically attacked only because it is unwilling to subordinate its authority and Lebanon's sovereignty to external and extra-legal demands. 
   Quite simply, Lebanon is being bullied. And in light of this fact, the United States and the entire international community must come to its aid. 
   I would urge all of our colleagues to support the resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me the time, as well as for your tireless efforts in support of the legislation that we are considering today. 
   There is no more imperative threat facing the world today than checking Iran's nuclear aspirations. Sometimes, in the midst of urgent debate over the right tactics to use to stop the mullahs' mad march towards the bomb, we lose sight of the big strategic picture. By focusing on the particular costs of each sanction, the monstrous reality of a world in which Iran possesses nuclear weapons can slip into the background. This loss of perspective is a terrible mistake. 
   Critics of H.R. 1400, both here and abroad, see only the cost and the irritants of American sanctions. Their concerns focus on economic liberty and their own bottom line, on their national sovereignty, but not their national security. 
   Protests are heard regarding our insensitivity to the Iranian regime and the likelihood of sanctions hurting the Iranian people. The critics are, unfortunately, missing the point. In a vacuum, sanctions always seem harsh unless you consider the nonpeaceful alternative. 
   To fully and fairly judge the proposals in a sanctions measure such as H.R. 1400, we have to consider what a future without it might look like. If you don't want to see the complete collapse of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the rapid nuclearization of the entire Middle East, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to see Iranian proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, taking over the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Lebanon, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to see Iran accelerating its supply of arms and training to terrorists around the world, then you're for the bill. If you don't want the supply and the price of oil to be set in Tehran, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to even imagine a nuclear device exploding somewhere, anywhere in the Middle East, then you're for the bill. And, finally, if you do abhor war, if you really don't want to see military force used to stop Iran's nuclear program, if you hate the very idea of America attacking Iran's nuclear program, then you're for this bill. 
   The official title is the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act. The proper title should be the Stop the Iranian Bomb by Every Peaceful Means Possible Act. This is the alternative. 
   We are running out of time. Nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran's mullahs are not inevitable; but to prevent such an international security catastrophe,  we need every tool at our disposal now while there is still time. The longer we wait, the greater the danger and difficulty of the challenge we face. Now is the time to apply the absolute maximum diplomatic, political and economic pressure that we can muster. 
   H.R. 1400 will crank up the pressure and help us avoid having to choose between military action and an Iranian atomic bomb. I urge all Members to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, on December 27, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi as she left a peaceful political rally. In addition, 20 of her supporters were killed in a suicide bomb blast and Pakistan was wracked by violence and instability in the immediate aftermath. 
   Former Prime Minister Bhutto had returned to Pakistan in October after several years in exile in an attempt to bring Pakistan back to the democratic fold and inject the voice of moderation into the Pakistani parliamentary elections. Her killers cut short that effort in an attack that was one of 40 suicide bombings that killed 700 people in Pakistan during 2007. 
   Ms. Bhutto's life was marked by tragedy that played out on Pakistan's public stage. Her father was hung after a questionable trial. Her brother was murdered. As Prime Minister, she was twice removed from office by the army amid allegations of corruption and wound up in self-imposed exile. Yet she  remained very popular with the people of Pakistan, especially those in her home province of Sindh, and as the awful events of December 27 demonstrate, she was perceived as a threat by someone. 
   The United States and the rest of the international community have a vital interest in supporting a free, stable, and secure Pakistan so as to stem the rise of extremism in South Asia, prevent global acts of terrorism from originating in Pakistan, and support the movement toward stable political institutions, democratic values, and the rule of law. 
   The fact that al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremist elements are using the federally administered tribal areas to regroup, retain and recruit for future attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a dangerous component of instability that, when added to Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons, conjures up the frightening possibility of terrorists with access to weapons of mass destruction. 
   All of this means that the United States and the rest of the international community need to do all that we can to promote and support Pakistan's economic, social and political development to prevent Pakistan from becoming a failed state.     
   The resolution before us today condemns Ms. Bhutto's assassination, expresses condolences to her family and the families of the other victims of the attacks, and reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the people of Pakistan as they combat terrorism and work to establish a free and democratic country. I urge all of our colleagues, Madam Speaker, to support the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to congratulate Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for producing an excellent bipartisan bill. The Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act demonstrates yet again the depth of support in the Congress for our efforts in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda and sends a clear message to the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan people that the United States is committed to the success of a stable, free and democratic Afghanistan. 
   As the bill also points out, we remain far from that goal, and it is not at all certain we will get there. The amendment I am offering today concerns a problem that if left unaddressed could undercut all of our efforts in Afghanistan, and that is the problem of corruption. 
   The Government Accountability Office in a recent report said the reform effort in the judicial sector is being ``undermined by systemic corruption at key national and provincial justice institutions.'' The most recent report in Afghanistan from the U.N. Secretary General noted that because corruption influences government appointments, Afghans don't trust local government officials and have turned to making deals with the Taliban for protection of their property. The same report goes on to describe the popular alienation that many Afghans feel towards local governments and asserts that this alienation is a key factor in support for the insurgency. 
   My amendment adds language to section 302 of the bill to ensure that the Presidential report required by that section includes an assessment of the quality of governments in each province in Afghanistan, focusing in particular on the implementation of the rule of law and its impact on the operation of Afghan society, security forces and the impact of any human rights abuses by Afghan government forces on overall counterinsurgency efforts and the ability of the courts and judicial system to provide an effective justice system in support of Afghan military and police efforts. 
   Mr. Chairman, the question of corruption in Afghanistan may seem like a small matter when compared with the resurgence of the Taliban and the explosion of narcotics trafficking. But I believe for the Taliban to be defeated and for the narcotics traffickers to be imprisoned, ordinary Afghans must have confidence that their government actually works for them. If the citizens  of Afghanistan believe otherwise, then they will turn to local warlords, drug traffickers and the Taliban for protection. Under that scenario, Afghans can look forward to another generation of civil conflict. 
   I would urge all of our colleagues to support the amendment as well as the underlying bill.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, there have been many justifications for why we went to war in Iraq. Take your pick: We invaded to capture Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, or we invaded to oppose a  dictator and bring democracy and human equal rights to the Iraqi people, or we invaded to fight al Qaeda and prevent them from attacking us here. 
   So many reasons have been offered that you can mix and match one from column A, two from column B. 
   Whatever your favorite reason for invading Iraq, the one reason that was never offered was that we are invading Iraq to occupy their land, establish permanent bases and control their oil. Yet, among Iraqis, this perception is that the establishment of permanent bases is precisely why we invaded. The insurgents use that perception to recruit fighters and incite attacks on our troops. 
   The bill before us today, introduced by our colleagues, BARBARA LEE and TOM ALLEN, along with JIM MORAN and DAVID PRICE, will help combat that perception. It states that it is the policy of the United States not to establish permanent bases in Iraq and not to control Iraq's oil resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time that the House has spoken on the issue. Six separate times the House has passed legislation prohibiting or expressing opposition to the establishment of permanent military bases in Iraq. Three of those bills have been signed into law. Yet, from the President, we continue to get mixed messages. 
   In May, the President's spokesman talked about a U.S. presence in Iraq that looked like our presence in South Korea. Last month, Secretary Gates suggested that the President was considering a long and enduring presence in Iraq. 
   Whatever your position on the war, I don't think anyone here in this House believes that we should be in Iraq for over 50 years. In case anyone needed any further convincing that pursuing a long-term presence in Iraq is unwise, the Iraq Study Group was unequivocal on the point of permanent bases. ``The President should state that the United States does not seek permanent military bases in Iraq''. But instead of standing down when the Iraqis stand up, the President seems intent on putting down roots. It is the wrong policy yet again. 
   The Lee-Allen bill will send an important message again that the United States has no interest in permanent bases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the coalition of the willing no longer is. If those who are no longer with us are against us, then we have lost the support and the admiration of the entire world. Those of us who came of age in the sixties believing that war is the ultimate breakdown of civilized process have done the unthinkable. We trusted our leadership when we should have questioned more. 
   We gave war a chance. We called upon our sons and daughters entering the prime of their young lives to step up, as had generations before them, to defend our freedom and our liberty against an Iraqi nuclear threat that did not exist. Our young people did not disappoint. They answered the call, have been fighting bravely and ferociously, putting their lives on the line every day for going on 4 1/2 years. 
   They followed the orders of their officers right up to the Commander in Chief, and a grateful Nation, indeed, can ask no more. They did not disappoint. But it is we who let them down, tragically. We are reminded that the President is the Commander in Chief, and, indeed, he is. He sent them to fight and die in a war based on a  faulty and tortuously shifting premise. That we, in our positions of great trust, were misled and then misplaced our trust, does not excuse us. 
   He sent them to fight in a war without equipping them properly, and, as many generals believe initially, in insufficient numbers. With an abundance of prayers but inadequate plans, he sent them to fight international terrorists; but, instead, they are mired down, enmeshed, and are being slaughtered in someone else's sectarian and deadly civil war while the real terrorists prepare to retake Afghanistan. 
   Six years ago I voted with the President. He is our President. I did not want him to fail. His failure is our country's failure, and that is not acceptable. But here is where we are. We have lost the support of even those in the region who wanted Saddam's demise. We have not found the real terrorist, Osama bin Laden. 
   We have lost the support of the coalition of the willing. We have lost the support of our major allies. We have lost the prestige and admiration of the world. We have lost our credibility. We have lost the confidence of the American people. And we have lost over 3,000 precious lives of our bravest patriotic and promising young citizens. I voted with the President, and I was wrong, but I know I was wrong. 
   Grown-ups know that not every story has a happy ending regardless of good intentions. I am afraid this is one such story. I am afraid we have been led into a dead-end chasm from which there is no easy escape. Under the administration's leadership, everything has gone wrong. So what do we do now? Do we compound the disaster? 
   Perhaps we can learn from the great Iraqi poet, Omar Kyayyam, who in the Runaiyat wrote: 
   ``The Moving Finger writes; and having writ, 
   Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit 
   Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, 
   Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, sending 20,000 additional troops is not a change of plans, it is merely an escalation. About one out of every 40 people we send to Iraq comes home in a casket. As an old math teacher, I can tell you by extrapolation that sending 20,000 more brings home 500 more dead. Little else changes. 
   This vote is, indeed, nonbinding. It is but the little boy in the crowd yelling, ``The emperor has no plan.'' Mr. Speaker, managing failure is unpleasant, but reinforcing it is criminal. Vote for the resolution so that we might help the President to avoid compounding this disaster.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 556, the National Security FIRST Act. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. FRANK, for his efforts in making this legislation one of the committee's first priorities. I would also like to commend my colleague from New York, Mrs. MALONEY, for sponsoring this important legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's been a year since the Bush administration thought it would be a good idea to hand over commercial operations of six of our nation's ports to the government of Dubai--a country that the 9/11 Commission report named as a source of terrorist financing and which two of the 9/11 hijackers called home. We have since learned that, during the review process undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, administration officials did not perform a required thorough investigation of the deal to a satisfactory level and chose not to require Dubai Ports World to follow certain security conditions at some of the busiest ports in the country--over 4 years after 9/11. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Dubai Ports World debacle was a paragon of bureaucratic ineptitude and the shining example of why this legislation is needed. Even those who believe that DPW should currently be administering our nation's ports must concede that the process is broken. 
   The CFIUS process needs more transparency, better oversight and increased fail-safes to ensure that the administration doesn't next absent-mindedly sell our nation's airports to Iran Airports World. 
   This bill mandates that any proposed deal that involves an entity owned by a foreign government trigger an automatic--and thorough--CFIUS review. To be clear, this legislation does not increase barriers for foreign governments interested in investing in the United States--H.R. 556 merely puts in place necessary safeguards to ensure that investments in the United States do not threaten our national security. 
   This legislation also requires that the Securities of Treasury and Homeland Security, or their Deputy Secretaries or Under Secretaries, sign off on all deals before they are completed. We now know that, during the review of the Dubai Ports World deal, low-level bureaucrats approved the transaction without the knowledge of the relevant Cabinet members. By mandating that the under-secretary level is the lowest level authorized to approve these transactions, we will build another fail-safe into the CFIUS process, and, perhaps more importantly, we will put in place a system of accountability, rather than one of finger-pointing. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a vitally important piece of legislation, which passed unanimously in the last Congress. I ask my colleagues to once again support this important national security measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I would like to extend thanks and appreciation for the effort and hard work of Mr. Bachus and Mr. Baker, as well as Mr. Kanjorski, Mrs. Maloney, the extraordinary efforts of my friend from New York, Pete King, and of course to Chairman Frank for his extraordinary leadership, as well as the entire New York legislative delegation, including our friends from New Jersey and Connecticut, who all know firsthand the anguish and the pain of regions suffering from a terrorist attack. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act, with Senate amendments, is not the outcome that most of us in the House on both sides of the aisle had wanted. In September, after a series of subcommittee and full committee hearings, a field hearing, and following both subcommittee and full committee markups, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2761 by a strong bipartisan margin of 3-1. H.R. 2761 would have extended TRIA for 15 years. It would have eliminated the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism. It would have included coverage for human beings by adding group life, and for nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological, the so-called NCBR attacks. Most importantly, H.R. 2761 included a reset mechanism, which would have addressed the types of increased capacity shortages that we have already seen following major terrorism attacks against our country. 
   I want to be clear about this. The reset mechanism is not a New York provision. In negotiations with Mr. Baker of the minority, we worked out the reset mechanism that would be triggered for any future catastrophic attack anyplace in America. Under the reset, if, heaven forbid, our country does suffer another catastrophic attack, the nationwide trigger would be reset and the nationwide deductible for any insurer that pays out losses related to that attack would be set at lower levels. 
   God willing, New York will never suffer a second time, and, God willing, your State will never suffer a catastrophic attack such as 9/11. But if it does, then you too would enjoy the so-called ``benefit'' of being attacked a second time by virtue of the existence of the reset mechanism. 
   Let's take, for example, Alabama; Alabama, that fought so hard and received $130.5 million in Homeland Security grants because it is at risk of an attack by terrorists. We know that for a fact because its Senators and others told us so. God forbid, terrorists blow up the Medical Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Under this legislation, you will be covered. Without a reset, however, after a catastrophic attack, the supply of terrorism insurance could be so scarce that you would not be able rebuild the medical center, which had been in Birmingham, and rebuild it in Birmingham, Alabama. I only pick Alabama, I think, because I went in alphabetical order. Sometimes bad things happen in alphabetical order. I don't read the obituaries because people die in alphabetical order. 
   In short, the House bill, which included the reset, would have met the needs of our country and prepared the Nation to better cope with some of the grave financial issues that would have arisen if there were another terrorist attack on our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the House passed H.R. 2761 in September, we presented the Senate with an historic opportunity to protect our homeland from some of the economic consequences of terrorism, and specifically to safeguard the developers and the insurers and the re-insurers, who will bear the highest financial burden if our Nation is attacked again. The financial stability of these industries is the cornerstone of our economy, and they are absolutely essential to our capacity to recover from an attack. 
   Sadly, the U.S. Senate didn't seize the opportunity to protect our Nation and our markets. Instead, our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol operated to amend our bill to extend the TRIA program by only 7 years, less than half of the extension period, and to strip out every beneficial provision in our bill, save one. The Senate did accept the House position that the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terror, in today's world, so often impossible to discern, would be included. Having passed the hollow shell of the bill and having done so only after the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, our Senate counterparts abandoned the legislative process and they have refused to go to conference. 
   Now, faced with the choice between accepting a bad bill and disrupting the  U.S. financial markets, the House went to work yet again, Democrats and Republicans, working together, to try to find a compromise with the Senate, and last week we passed a limited but still much-improved TRIA reauthorization over what they had done in the Senate. 
   The compromise legislation the House overwhelmingly passed last week by a vote of 303-116 acquiesced to the Senate's position on duration as well as coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological coverage. That compromise bill accepted the Senate's extension of TRIA, which was for only 7 years, and eliminated NCBR coverage. The House held firm, however, to the provisions we felt were absolutely necessary to allow for large-scale development to continue all across our country; the extension of a reset mechanism, group life insurance coverage, and lower program triggers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House overwhelmingly passed the compromise TRIA reauthorization last week, and the Senate, as has been so often the case this year, did nothing. And so, today, we are faced with a very difficult reality: We can either accept the Senate's shell of a bill and ensure that our Nation's economy is somewhat protected against terrorist attacks, or we can let the program expire altogether in less than 2 weeks from today. Maybe that is considered good government in some parts of the country, but entrusting our Nation's economy to the terrorist roulette wheel would not be acceptable to the American people and it is not acceptable to the House, and we must do the responsible thing. 
   The Senate amendments to H.R. 2761 are unhelpful, shortsighted, and represent an unrealistic pre-9/11 outlook. The Senate amendments come from a naive world where there is no risk of terrorism and another attack like 9/11 is impossible. In the Senate's mythical world, developers build stadiums and malls and national landmarks without funding, banks lend money without insurance, insurers underwrite policies regardless of risk, and reinsurers do the same thing on an even larger scale. 
   In the Senate's fantasy world, the $30 billion in insured losses from 9/11 can be easily underwritten and capitalized because unimaginable losses such as those that would come from an attack with weapons of mass destruction just can't happen, and the reason they can't happen is because the U.S. Senate said so. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Santa Claus is not going to give America terrorism risk insurance for Christmas, and we don't live with the Easter Bunny in the Senate's Candyland, where catastrophic risk can be comfortably ignored. Saying ``the market will provide'' just doesn't make it true. In the real world, it is critical to both our national security and to our economy that there is no gap in terrorism risk insurance. This House will not leave our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers out in the cold when we adjourn for the year. 
   I therefore urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation out of the necessity to extend the TRIA program past its expiration date, with the understanding that this fight is not over. 
   We will continue to advocate for those provisions we know are critical to securing our homeland against terrorist attacks; namely, the reset mechanism, group life coverage, lower program triggers and NCBR coverage. To that extent, I have just introduced legislation entitled the Terrorism Risk Insurance Improvement Act that will add the reset mechanism to the TRIA program we are about to authorize here today, and I invite all of our colleagues to join me as cosponsors. We will continue to fight for a fully effective TRIA program until the Senate and the White House get the memo that the war on terror is not only fought on the other side of the world, but on the homefront as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Mr. Bachus for the extraordinary cooperation between the majority and the minority on this particular issue. He led his caucus, along with Mr. Baker, in crafting what was a very open process led by the distinguished chairman, Mr. Frank, of the full committee, where everybody's voice was heard; everybody's opinion was allowed to be aired. We fought it out. Not everybody won every fight, but it was an extraordinary effort in goodwill. And the efforts of the Financial Services Committee should be something that set an example for the rest of the committees in the Congress, especially on this particular issue, everybody exercising goodwill and good judgment. 
   Let me thank my staff especially Steve Boms, who, unfortunately, became one of our Nation's leading experts on terrorism risk insurance. 
   Much has been said about the New York delegation, because, I think, of our high profile on this issue. But allow me to thank our colleagues and offer this: do not feel sorry for us. We do not make this case for your pity, because we think that our city, we think that our communities, we think that our State and our neighbors acted in an exemplary fashion at a moment of extraordinary terror and pressure, not just to us but to the entire Nation and to the world. What we faced was absolutely extraordinary, and we are so proud to be New Yorkers, and we make this fight not because of what we suffered as a city and a State, but because we already know the pain and the problems that each and every one of our colleagues and other communities across this country might face in the event of a terrorist attack. 
   Much has been said of the courage of New York. We do not end this fight here because this fight is not for us. 
   First, to those who have expressed concern about the cost of money as taxpayer money, let me say that the way this has been added up by CBO, the taxpayers would actually gain $200 million if there were a terrorist attack because of the scoring. Do this because it's the right thing.

   Do this because it's the right thing to do, not because of New York. Because your community could be next, and it could be next yet again. That's what the reset is for. 
   We pass this today to provide our country with ongoing insurance so that major development can continue to take place, not to allow the terrorists to dictate when and where and how construction might take place in America. 
   Pass this, vote for this stripped-down version, provide this protection at least as a minimum for the next 7 years; and I guarantee we will all be back here next year to fight more and again and harder to include those provisions that will protect us all. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, from time to time, I've heard some of our colleagues wondering why there are so many resolutions about Israel, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Why, they may wonder, do we have to take up these issues? Doesn't everyone already know that the Congress supports Israel? And it's true, American support for Israel is overwhelming, it is bi-partisan, and it is nearly universal in Congress. But sadly, we are the exception in the world. 
   Around the globe, there have been protests going on about the situation in Gaza. What may not be known is that these demonstrations are not about the rockets that have been falling on Israeli civilians. These protests are not against Hamas. These protests are not about the absurdity of expecting Israel to provide electricity and fuel to the people attacking them. 
   These protests are against Israel and its right of self-defense. They are against demanding that Hamas stop the terror. They are against putting responsibility on the shoulders of Hamas for the welfare of the people in Gaza. 
   To us, in the United States, such protests seem perverse. People who intentionally fire artillery rockets at civilians are properly called ``war criminals.'' People who deliberately seek the death of the innocent are not called ``militants,'' or ``activists,'' or ``guerillas.'' They are properly called ``terrorists,'' and it is hard for us to imagine that these are not universal beliefs. 
   But they're not. What we have seen in the past, and are seeing again is an offensive and deplorable double standard: Every nation is obliged to protect its citizens--except the Israelis; they should be patient and exercise restraint. Every nation is entitled to fight terrorism--except the Israelis; they should have a dialogue with the people who call for their extermination. Every nation is entitled to use force defend itself--except the Israelis; they should only use force if there won't be civilian casualties. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all mourn the loss of innocent life, and the sympathy of decent people is not limited by nationality. The American people are concerned about both Israeli and Palestinian lives. But that concern is not a excuse to dispense with judgement. There is guilt and there is innocence; and there is aggression and there is self-defense. Refusal to acknowledge, or to insist on these distinctions is not only immoral, but dangerous. 
   And that is why the business in Gaza is the business of this House. America, as a leader among the community of nations, has an obligation to stand up in defense of certain values. And it is never so essential to do so than when those values are under attack, and that is what is happening right now. 
   That is why we have to condemn Hamas. That is why we have to condemn the rockets that are still falling on Israeli towns and cities. That is why we have to stand with a democratic ally. That is why we have to declare again and again from this house that the people of Israel--no less than any other people--are entitled to live in peace and security. Certainly we Americans would accept nothing less for ourselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON UNDER PRIME MINISTER FOUAD SINIORA -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman Berman for his leadership in getting this vitally important resolution to the floor so quickly. It's extremely important that the House be on record telling the brave men and women who fought and died defending Lebanon's independence and sovereignty that America has not forgotten you and will not abandon you. 
   While many in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon, are trying to make sense of what has happened, I believe that it is critical that they know that the United States and the U.S. Congress still strongly support the democratically elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon, that we will stand behind its efforts to fully restore Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, and that the future of Lebanon is not with Iranian and Syrian sponsored thugs and bullies, but with the decent people of Lebanon of every sect and confession who only want the normal and peaceful life for themselves, for their children, and for their country. 
   Mr. Speaker, just as Hezbollah sucked Lebanon into its conflict with Israel in 2006 by hiding behind its women and children, they have now forced the Lebanese people to endure their war against the Lebanese state. The insurrection by Hezbollah was unjustified, illegitimate, and immoral. No conceivable Lebanese interest was served by it. Only the goals of Iran and Syria were advanced by Hezbollah and its allies' assault on the sovereignty of the Lebanese Government. 
   The pretense that Hezbollah is an authentic Lebanese political actor has fallen away, and in the arrogance of power they have declared their true allegiance. It is not to Lebanon, and it is not even to the Lebanese Shia. Their loyalty is to Iran and Syria, and to the needs and interests of Tehran and Damascus. In their Lebanese puppet state, Ayatollah Khamenei will be the true president and Bashar al-Assad the real prime minister. 
   We have seen this kind of fraud before in the 20th century. The culmination was called the Warsaw Pact. But what was true in Europe in the Cold War remains true today in the Middle East--a captive nation is no true ally of its captor, and no amount of power can make a lie become the truth. And no amount of thuggery, torture, intimidation and murder can make Hezbollah anything other than the terrorist arm of foreign powers and an enemy of Lebanese independence and sovereignty. 
   The United States and every other decent nation must continue to support the Government of Lebanon. The Lebanese Government was democratically elected, it is legitimate, and it deserves our aid. Justice must ultimately be done for those recently and unjustly killed, as well as all those Lebanese murdered for their support of Lebanese sovereignty going back to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. I have said many times before, and I will keep repeating it, there must be no deal or arrangement that undercuts the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. 
   Mr. Speaker, you either believe that Lebanon is a sovereign and independent state that is to be governed by and for the Lebanese people alone, or you don't. The overwhelming majority of Lebanese, whether they're Sunni, Shia, Maronite, Orthodox, Druse, or any other group, believe in this principle. The entire international community, with the reprehensible exceptions of Syria and Iran, believes in this principle. The United States certainly believes in it. Only Hezbollah, Amal, and the delusional Aounists do not. And that is why Lebanon has suffered and remains in pain today.  
   I'm very proud of the resolution before us today. I strongly urge its adoption by the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First let me express my appreciation for the gentleman from Ohio and for his good intentions and for his support of dialogue. Certainly nobody is against dialogue. 
   But we have a situation here where a democratic, freedom-loving, sovereign people are insisting on the results of their own self-determined election that they came to through democratic processes and are doing that in the face of outside interference in the form of armed opposition, murders, assassinations that are being sponsored by Hezbollah, financed by the Iranian and Syrian regimes. And the gentleman instead calls for dialogue. We call for nothing other than dialogue. 
   This is a nonbinding sense of the Congress resolution. And while other countries are running interference and murdering the people of Lebanon and preventing their democratic government from governing, we are sending them a message of hope, a message of support. And the gentleman's protestations say that we shouldn't interfere, let them have a dialogue. 
   What we are looking at, Mr. Speaker, is the equivalent of a rape, and I have just heard the argument that what we should do is not interfere and take sides between the victim and the raper and to say let them have a dialogue and work it out, while each and every day the rape continues. As a civilized, democratic society, we cannot sit idly by without saying a word. 
   I do appreciate the argument of those who are against violence, who are against arms, and who are against war. I stand with them on that. But we have no alternative than to act and at least send a message of support. There is no interference other than our best wishes while others are sending arms. There is nothing in the 17 whereases in this resolution that suggests that we're in favor of violence. And if the gentleman and those who argue his argument are truly opposed to raising an army, let them at least raise their voice. Let them speak out with us on this resolution. Let us reaffirm our dedication to the principles of democracy and self-determination of a people who have already made their choice in their election, and to stand by them, not by providing arms or violence, but by sending them the wishes of this Congress, of the American people, expressing our support for their determination to continue in their quest to effectuate the democracy to which they are entitled.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution pays homage to the lives lost on the 11th of September in 2001 and recognizes this anniversary as a time of solemn commemoration. It extends deepest condolences to the friends, families and loved ones of the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks; it expresses gratitude to the leaders and citizens of other countries who assisted, supported, and stood by the United States in the aftermath of the attacks; and it honors the Nation's first responders, Armed Forces and others whose valiant efforts are a credit to their country and who continue to keep us safe. 
   Each of us remembers exactly where we were on 9/11 when we heard the tragic news. We remember the days of unity that followed when we acted together to protect this country from those determined to harm us and undermine our way of life. 
   Last year, we took a major step in furtherance of that goal by enacting, with bipartisan support, legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, in both its domestic and foreign policy dimensions. By doing so, we addressed major security vulnerabilities and improved our homeland security across the board. I call on the President to continue his work to fully implement that act. 
   Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to the United States. In particular, the al Qaeda leadership that was responsible for ordering the attacks on September 11 has been reconstituted in the tribal areas of Pakistan. From that safe haven, they continue to pose danger to the world and increasingly threaten American troops in Afghanistan. 
   And this is more than just a military campaign. In the battle against extremists, ideas matter as much as ammunition, and this Nation must employ its soft power--its moral, economic, financial, diplomatic and cultural resources--to the very fullest. 
   The global realities of the 21st century require us to use the full range of nonmilitary tools as a fundamental pillar of our national security. We in Congress must support full funding for our international affairs programs. They bolster our national security by allowing us to work with foreign partners to track down terrorists overseas, to secure dangerous weapons wherever they are found, and to help stabilize fragile states. 
   Madam Speaker, this country is in the midst of a competitive election campaign. The stakes could not be higher. But today we set aside all of that to remember what unites us is greater than that which divides us. We all love our country and seek to keep it safe in these perilous times. 
   Madam Speaker, none of us will forget what happened 7 years ago today. We will always remember the victims of 9/11 and the loved ones who survived them. We still have unfinished work. Congress still needs to act, and hopefully soon, to provide the care to the people who rushed to Ground Zero to help others, as well as the thousands who worked on the ``pile'' in the aftermath to rebuild the site. 
   We owe those heroes of 9/11 the care and compensation they deserve. We will always honor the first responders who lost their lives that day--and those in uniform who risk their lives today and every day to defend America. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, a very thoughtful general once observed that the loss of 1,000 lives is a statistic, but the loss of one life was a tragedy. There were thousands of tragedies that occurred 7 years ago today. I want to talk about one of them. 
   It was a very long week here in Washington, that week of 9/11. It took three or four times the usual time for me to get back to New York. It was late at night. I was able to get a cab in New York to take me down to the World Trade Center, to the pier where they had set up all of the emergency work. I went there at that hour to find my wife, who was a mental health worker, one of those people who were asked to come down and volunteer. 
   As I waited for her to do the things that she and so many other people were doing, I walked around. There was a long, huge wall with pictures on 8 1/2 by 11, on napkins, on flyers that were drawn up, people who had pictures of their loved ones, their husbands, their wives, their children, if anybody saw them. 
   There were firemen walking around trying to console women who did not know yet if they were widows. 
   There were little dolls alongside the wall on the floor stretching for two blocks along this pier. They all had notes on them. They were from children who suffered the loss of parents in the Murrah Building disaster. And these notes all said things like, ``When I was in trouble and frightened, someone gave me this doll to make me feel better. I send it to you and hope that you feel better.'' 
   A fire chief came over to me and asked me if I would go over and just stand by this gentleman who was all alone at the wall. It was probably midnight. And this fellow in unique garb, he was a Hassidic Jew, dressed in the traditional big brim black hat, looking very much like the Amish do with the long black coat, he stood in front of one flyer without blinking. The only thing he did was move back and forth, back and forth, staring at this picture. 
   I just stood next to him. And after a minute he spoke to me, without even looking at me, just staring at the picture on this flyer that looked like a younger version of himself, and he said, ``That was my brother.'' He, I was told, was there every night doing this. ``He was my brother. He called me to say good-bye.'' 
   ``I told him,'' he said, ``that he had to get out of that building. He had to get out right away.'' And he said to me, ``I'm sitting holding hands with the young man who works in the cubicle next to mine, a young Puerto Rican kid who lives in a wheelchair, and there is no way for him to get out of this building. I told him he would not die alone, and I am just calling to say good-bye.'' 
   There is nothing anyone could say, nothing I could say. I just stood there. 
   There are thousands of stories, there are thousands of lives, there are tens of thousands of people who were immediately impacted by relatives who died that day, who are heroes as well, some of whom knowingly, some of whom unknowingly went to their deaths, in addition to all of those who rushed into the building to save those that they could. 
   As we remember the first responders, as we remember the people who dug in that pile for so many days and weeks and months, risking their own lives, putting their health at risk and danger, as we know today, an issue that still has to be addressed, we remember also those who caused all of that anguish and pain, all of those thousands of tragedies, who changed history in that one incident, and rededicate ourselves to not being only strong, but smart, as we confront those threats and honor the memory of all those who were lost and all those who tried to help on that day.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, in considering this bill, this package of sanctions and divestment authorities for states and localities, we should keep foremost in our minds we are in a race. I am not referring to our upcoming elections, but rather the race between the civilized world and the nuclear ambitions of Iran. 
   One of us will win, and one will lose. If the world wins, Iran will not become a nuclear weapons state, there will not be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will not collapse. If Iran wins, the chief sponsor of terrorism in the Middle East, the patron of Hamas and Hezbollah, a hegemonic nation led by fanatical religious zealots will be able to threaten the global economy and the security of the United States and the civilized world from behind a nuclear shield. 
   And we are just about to lose this race. Iran is not only ahead, it is sprinting to the finish. Its proliferation potential is now a simple math problem. Iran is now producing 2.5 kilograms of low-enriched uranium per day, and has produced an estimated 200 to 250 kilograms of LEU just since this past May. 
   For a crash bomb program, Iran could use the LEU as feedstock, dramatically shortening the time to produce nuclear weapons grade uranium. With 700 to 800 kilograms of LEU set into centrifuges, Iran could produce the 20 to 25 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium required for a crude atomic bomb. Other estimates suggest that 1,000 to 1,700 kilograms of LEU would be necessary. Regardless of whether it is 700 or 1,700 kilograms, Iranian proliferation is no longer a question of if, but when. 
   The President has known about this threat since day one. He has known, and done next to nothing. The Bush administration has adamantly refused to use existing U.S. sanction laws against foreign companies investing in Iran's oil sector. But far worse, the Bush administration has actively worked to stop Congress from adopting the tough and necessary legislation that we have before us today. 
   Why? Do they believe that the past 5 years of slow motion, U.S.-in-the-back-seat diplomacy is about to make a huge breakthrough? In the light of Russia's recent announcement that they have no intention of supporting additional UN Security Council sanctions in Iran, I would like someone to explain how this huge breakthrough is supposed to happen. 
   With our administration tied up in an ideological knot, opposed to U.S. sanctions and unwilling to engage effectively itself, the question for Congress is what can we do to stop Iran. With so little time, our thinking on this problem needs to change. Options that years ago may have seemed reckless, like sanctioning firms in allied countries and applying unilateral economic levers, now have been become essential if we are going to be successful in peacefully getting Iran to back down. 
   Likewise, continuing doggedly with the current take-no-chances, small-carrots-and-no-sticks diplomacy which the Bush administration has insisted on, today looks like a roadmap to disaster. 
   Iranian proliferation is mere months away. That fact makes what is feckless, by definition, reckless. I am not calling for another war. I do not want air strikes or a blockade. I want to avoid all that. But if we don't want war, and we really don't want a nuclear Iran, then we have an obligation to use every peaceful, diplomatic, political and economic weapon at our disposal. If you don't want bombs, then you have to have an alternative, and that is sanctions. Abjuring sanctions is a de facto call to those who want arms. 
   I am very grateful to Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their efforts in bringing this critical package of sanctions of legislation to the floor today. It deserves the enthusiastic support of every Member of the House, and there isn't a moment to lose.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill because it will give congressional approval to civil nuclear cooperation with India. Let me tell you what that means. It means that the IAEA will be able to inspect two-thirds of India's civilian nuclear facilities because those facilities will be under IAEA safeguards and all future nuclear facilities will also be under safeguards. 
   It means that India, for the first time ever, has committed to MTCR guidelines. It means that India, for the first time ever, will adhere to the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. It means that we can send a clear message to rogue states, nuclear rogue states, about how to behave because it shows that responsible nuclear powers are welcomed by the International Community and not sanctions. It means that we can finally achieve the broad, deep, and enduring strategic relationship with India that all of us in this House support. 
   So if you wanted all of these things when you voted overwhelmingly for it 2 years ago, then vote for it again tonight. 
   There are two options before us today. One is to throw away all of the work that's been done and just keep the status quo. India would then pursue its national interests, as it's been doing, outside of the nonproliferation mainstream and we get to inspect nothing. The other is to make a deal with India, and the United States and the International Community will get a window in perpetuity into two-thirds of India's nuclear facilities and all of its future nuclear facilities. 
   The choice is clear, Mr. Speaker. It's time for 21st century policy towards India, and it encourages India's emergence as a global nuclear power and solidifies our bilateral relationship for decades to come. 
   This bill is that new policy, and I urge everyone to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a bittersweet moment for me and for all of the members of the New York State delegation specifically and the Members of the House of Representatives in its entirety because our good friend, and my best friend in the Congress, Mike McNulty, after 20 years of laboring in the vineyards here in Washington, getting on a flight every single week, coming down to Washington, going back home, representing the people of his district so diligently, will be leaving us at the end of this, his tenth Congress. 
   He is going to be sorely missed. They said, people don't have friends in Washington. This is truly an outstanding misstatement in the case of Mike McNulty. He has friends galore on both sides of the aisle that he has met and kept and maintained close relationships with throughout his entire political career, which is not just the 20 years that he has spent here with us. 
   At the age of 22, Mike entered politics, one of the youngest mayors in the history of anyplace in America. He went from the supervisor of Green Island to the mayor thereof, represented those people for so many years before being elected to the New York State Assembly, and proudly served as their assemblyman before coming here. 
   We have many members of the delegation who wish to speak, some of whom are here tonight, Mr. Speaker. I will fill in and continue some of my remarks, but I want to get some of them up to the microphone at this late hour. I guess we will start with Mr. Hinchey, if you are prepared to start us off.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I can use some of the remaining time, this is a very fast-moving place. There are a lot of people who have been pretty hard-charging around here over the 26 years that I've been here and certainly over the history of the Congress, and we'll remember a lot of them because they're loud and boisterous, thundering; some people would say ``eloquent'' when referring to some, but all too often, we don't notice the quiet heroes who make all of the difference, who come here to our Nation's Capital, not for self-aggrandizement but unashamedly to full time represent only and exclusively the interests of the people who sent them here. Such a person is our friend Mike McNulty. 
   You'll forgive us, Mr. Speaker, for having the braggadocio as New Yorkers, as we're supposed to have, I'm told, to be ever so proud of Mike McNulty and of all that he represents and will always represent.     
   I was going to read a good part of his biography, much of which has been alluded to by some of our Members here, but I think I will bypass that, because those are all historical notes, and just talk about Mike for a couple of minutes. 
   Mike is truly one of the heroes to anybody who has ever met him. Much has been made of the fact that he was the youngest town supervisor, mayor, at the time of his election some 39 years ago, and has been in public service for his entire life. But it is not just being the youngest, but being one of the best, being one of the most humane, being one of the most compassionate. And I must say as a fellow Eagle Scout, I have always been in awe of Mike because he became an Eagle Scout at the age of 12, not something very easily accomplished. 
   If you know anything about Mike, you know that is even more extraordinary, because when Mike was born in 1947 to Mr. and Mrs. Jack McNulty of Green Island, they were so very, very proud of Mike, as they were of their other children, having great hopes and aspirations that he would be able to achieve and accomplish and make his mark on the world. And then when he was 2 years old they found out that he had the scourge of our time, of our generation, that he had polio, that he was not able to walk. 
   What a challenge that is for a family. What a challenge that is for a young man, not to be able to run around with his friends and grow up in the same way and do the same kinds of things with such ease that other people have. And yet Mike persevered and made a full recovery. 
   I daresay that there are probably not too many people in the House except those who are close to Mike that even knew that he had polio. And those accomplishments, not just the physical accomplishments of being able to get past that, but of being able to contribute to our society, to make a mark and to make a difference, without bringing any of the baggage that so many of us would probably bring to our careers and the rest of our lives. Not a note of bitterness, not a mark of anger, not a sign of why me, but always what can I do to help you, what can I do to contribute to society. 
   I try to think of words, as we all have, that would describe Mike . I go back to the time we were Boy Scouts, in very different places, and he is the embodiment of trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, at least with the taxpayers' money, brave, clean and reverent. He is all of the above. 
   He is a man of great integrity, respected in this House by everybody. I don't know a person of the 435 Members of this House who doesn't truly hold MIKE MCNULTY in the highest of esteem. And he is very different in his approach to his job than so many other people that we can think of, presently and historically, people to whom we subscribe sharp elbows, as the word is; people who would push other people out of the way to get in front of the cameras, to beat them to the microphone, to get out a press release, to claim credit for something. Mike has always been content just to get the job done, absent the big lights and the big crowds. 
   This is a place of show horses and showboats, and among this crowd, Mike is a workhorse and a work boat. People would be absolutely astonished to know that it has been MIKE MCNULTy for these years who has often fought on their behalf successfully to maintain Social Security, something that in a few years hopefully he is going to enjoy for many, many, many years to come, and the work he has done on so many other things without taking credit. Mike is about not taking credit. And in a place where there is very little of that going around, he is virtuous and a virtuoso. 
   One of the newspapers on Capitol Hill does this story every once in awhile about the Obscure Caucus. Well, Mike is the chairman, as they always call him, of the Obscure Caucus. Not because of lack of contribution, but because of lack of spotlight; because of diligent work; because of doing his homework; because of always being prepared, for always being effective, for always getting things done. He is the quiet man around here, a very quiet guy, very respectful. 
   He is very religious, loves his church and its values that he holds very dearly. He doesn't wear them on his sleeve, but it is something that is very important to him. But so is respect for everybody else and their beliefs. 
   I remember traveling up to Albany once to one of the major synagogues in that town to participate, and Mike being the Man of the Year. The Rabbi told me Mike goes to synagogue on the Jewish High Holidays. He is given a place of honor, a seat of his own. It doesn't violate the gift rule. 
   He is the kind of person that we all want our kids to grow up to be, somebody who is respectable and respectful. 
   I traveled with him to Ethiopia with our dear friend Mickey Leland. MIKE didn't flinch. It didn't concern him that it was a lot more strenuous a trip for the Sub-Sahara region of the dark continent than it would be for most anybody else. He didn't blink. We flew in small planes, in and out, up in the Gandhara region, participating in the saving and rescue of the Ethiopian Jewish community that fled to Israel.  
   His work for the Irish people is legendary. His work for all people is admired by each and every one of us. 
   His family loves him, and there is not a conversation that I have ever had with MIKE that he doesn't mention my kids by name. I mentioned his children, his wife, Nancy, their great marriage, his five grandchildren of whom he is so proud and who I always see winding up in the newspapers upstate, as we call it, in pictures. These are his grandchildren, pictures with presidents and VIPs and movie stars, and every once in awhile they let MIKE get into the picture. 
   MIKE is going to be leaving Congress, and we are going to miss him. But he is going to go home to Nancy and the kids and the grandchildren and Big Jack, as his father is called. MIKE has been in public life for I think four different decades. His dad, Big Jack, has been in public life for seven. He still gets around, so proud of MIKE, and MIKE is so proud of him. 
   You know, there is a song, and I won't sing it here because it is against the rules and we certainly have previous speakers that sing a lot better than I do, but this song, the words of which are ``climb every mountain, ford every stream; follow every rainbow, until you find your dream.'' 
   MIKE has shared his dream here with his friends and the American people, and now he follows his rainbow home, home in Albany, where he also served as speaker pro tem, chaired the New York State Assembly probably more than anybody in anyone's recent memory, as he did here during the early years when Democrats controlled the House; doing that not just because he knew the rules of the House better than anybody else, but because he thought it was his job to let other Members go home after putting in a full day's work, and he was willing to shoulder the responsibility, as you do tonight, Mr. Speaker, in keeping the House open while other Members prepare for tomorrow's day's work. 
   So, MIKE, as you follow that rainbow back to Nancy and the kids, knowing that you have a long career of some other kind, I hope, many offers I am sure, will come in, you are a quiet prize that the public will not allow to leave their midst. We are all going to miss you, buddy. I am going to miss you especially. Thank you for your service here, which ends this session, and thank you for your friendship, which will endure forever. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to coax the recalcitrant, reticent, quiet Mr. McNulty to the microphone.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4299, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York. 
   I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 4299, which would extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, for 7 years. 
   TRIA is a vital program that has made effective terrorism insurance coverage available across this Nation by creating a Federal backstop to share with the insurance industry the burdens of losses caused by catastrophic acts of terrorism upon our country. 
   The certainty and stability that TRIA has provided over the past 6 years has allowed large-scale developers to plan, to secure financing and insurance and, ultimately, to build the types of multimillion- or multibillion-dollar real estate development projects in our capitalistic system, projects that shape our cities and invigorate the American economy. 
   With TRIA set to expire at the end of the month, I am particularly grateful that our leadership and Chairman Frank and our friends on the minority side are insisting that Congress renew this vital program before we run out of time and insurers are forced, in an act of self-preservation, to abandon our Nation's largest projects. 
   This rule will allow the House to consider legislation to reauthorize TRIA for the second time in 3 months. My colleagues may recall passing H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act. H.R. 2761 was a triumph for bipartisanship, regular order, good-faith bargaining and effective government. It sought to extend TRIA for another 15 years, added group life insurance to the program, lowered the program trigger, provided for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological, the so-called NBCR coverage. 
   And most importantly, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2761 included the so-called ``reset mechanism,'' which, in the wake of a catastrophic terrorist attack, lowered the nationwide program trigger and decreased the deductibles for any insurer that paid out losses after an attack on our country. This provision was and is absolutely critical to meeting the demand for terrorism insurance across our Nation, and especially in our high-risk areas. 
   On September 19, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2761 with a bipartisan vote of 312-110. And with the clock ticking toward the program's expiration date, we waited for the Senate to act. And we kept waiting and we kept waiting, and we waited some more. Then, once the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, and only once the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, the Senate quickly passed, by unanimous consent, a shell of a bill that simply extended the program to 7 years, stripping out the key provisions that were vital and put in there on a bipartisan House-passed bill. 
   We believed that we would have had the opportunity to negotiate on many of the issues in a conference with the Senate, but the Senate unacceptably and irresponsibly has refused again and again to conference with the House on the Senate bill, leaving us with few, but not zero, options. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to consider a compromised bill that accepts the Senate's position on the extension period, as well as the Senate's opposition to protecting us with NBCR coverage. This compromised bill, however, does stand firm on the House's key priorities, the reset mechanism, group life insurance, and lower program triggers. 
   Passage of this rule will allow the House to reaffirm its equality in the legislative process and reject the Senate's take-it-or-leave-it attitude. I urge all of our colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost a year since the Committee on Financial Services began the process of reauthorizing the terrorism risk insurance program. It has been 9 months since our committee held a field hearing in New York at which we heard experts, insurers, developers and reinsurers testify about the private market for terrorism insurance which has not grown enough since 9/11 to sufficiently meet the demand in many of our Nation's so-called high-risk areas. 
   It has been over 4 months since we held a subcommittee and a full committee markup and almost 3 months since the House overwhelmingly approved H.R. 2761, a strong reauthorization that would have extended TRIA for 15 years, provided group life insurance as well as nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological coverage, and significantly lowered the program's trigger level. 
   Most importantly of all, and after constructive negotiations and compromise with the minority, the House bill included a reset mechanism to address increased capacity shortages following major terrorist attacks such as those that may occur anywhere in our country. 
   And yet despite a proactive bipartisan effort in the House spearheaded by Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus, we find ourselves in the 11th hour with TRIA set to expire at the end of the month, and we are faced with a weak Senate bill that was deliberately sent to us only after we had recessed for Thanksgiving, effectively stalling the negotiation process between the two Chambers. 
   The Senate bill, a 7-year reauthorization that only amends the TRIA program by eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism simply does not provide developers, insurers, and reinsurers with enough of the stability they need in our free-market economy to plan, finance, insure and build our Nation's major development projects. 
   Mr. Speaker, for TRIA to be truly effective in addressing the shortages in the terrorism insurance market, we must recognize that the market is dynamic. The terrorism insurance market behaves much differently in the wake of a terrorist attack than it does before an attack. The reset contained in this compromise bill is identical to the reset provision that was included in the House-passed TRIA extension in September, on which I and Mr. Baker of the minority came to a mutually acceptable agreement. Under those terms, which are in this compromise bill, in the event of a terrorist attack with losses of a billion dollars or greater, the deductibles for any insurance company that pays out losses due to the event immediately lower to 5 percent while the nationwide trigger for any insurer for future events drops to $5 million. 
   Mr. Baker and I also reached agreement on my proposal to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the total losses of two or more attacks that occur in the same geographic area in the same year so if the total insured losses of those events are over a billion dollars, the reset mechanism would be triggered. The inclusion of this language is absolutely vital to every high-risk area across the country, and many of us consider this to be the most essential, must-be-included aspect of the legislation. 
   My colleagues may recall that the TRIA extension passed by the House in September was subject to PAYGO concerns because the CBO had assessed its cost at roughly $10 billion over 10 years. With this CBO score, some of our friends on the other side of the aisle argued that even though no funds would have been appropriated unless the country was attacked, our bill would have been too much of a burden on the American taxpayer. Not knowing who else to bill for an attack on America, I disagreed with that view and with the CBO scoring; but I, too, am committed to a fiscally responsible bill.  
   I am pleased to say that my fiscally conservative friends on both sides of the aisle can now vote for this bill without any hesitation thanks to the inclusion of language from the Senate bill, and more significantly, because the reset language, this compromise legislation has been assessed to a positive CBO score of $200 million. Let me say that again. This compromise bill that we are debating today will result in a net gain of $200 million. Legislation that protects developers and the insurance industry from terrorist attacks and provides taxpayers with a return on their dime is something that I believe we should all support. 
   Mr. Speaker, the next terrorist attack against the United States, like the one on 9/11, is going to damage more than just buildings. We must acknowledge that the structural losses associated with a terrorist incident will be accompanied by the loss of human life. The legislation before the House today recognizes this fact and includes group life insurance coverage because this Congress is concerned not only with the value of buildings but the people inside of them as well. 
   Our bill lowers the program trigger in the Senate bill from $100 million to $50 million. Our lower trigger would prevent smaller insurance companies from being priced out of the terrorism insurance market. And, with a greater supply of insurance, we can expect a higher degree of stability for large-scale developers all over America. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the absence of a formal conference which most of us in this body would have preferred, we have taken it upon ourselves to consider this legislation in which we have compromised with the Senate on many of their issues but hold firm on those provisions that we believe must be included in TRIA: the reset mechanism, group life coverage, and lower triggers. 
   I urge all of our colleagues to support this important compromise legislation and, as the clock strikes 11:59, to place the burden of responsibility back on the broad shoulders of the United States Senate.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Last year, we witnessed a tragic conflict in Lebanon, instigated by Hezbollah's unprovoked cross-border raid into Israel. This Hezbollah action resulted in the killing of eight brave Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two others, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. 
   The suffering of the Lebanese people was immense as thousands fled their homes in the subsequent fighting. Many homes were damaged or destroyed, and lives were lost. 
   The key reason that civilian areas were destroyed was the cynical strategy of Hezbollah guerrillas to stage their attacks from the middle of towns and residential areas. 
   The use of civilians as human shields is reprehensible and is in direct violation of all the laws of warfare. Indeed, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that such conduct is a serious violation of the laws of war and should be prosecuted. 
   This resolution properly condemns the use of human shields and, in particular, the conduct of Hezbollah in this bloody conflict. Let us make no mistake. The loss of civilian life in Lebanon was due solely to Hezbollah's cruel and uncivilized use of civilian areas as military bases. Meanwhile, Hezbollah used rocket fire to murder Israeli civilians indiscriminately and to destroy Israeli civilian areas that were of no military value whatsoever. 
   This resolution calls on all responsible nations to condemn such heinous acts and to work to eliminate them. No nation that calls itself a member of the international community can engage in such barbaric practices. In conflicts all over the globe, human shields have been used for various purposes. None of them are acceptable. 
   Let us urge the President and our friends and allies to join us and do their utmost to stop the use of human shields once and for all. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERN OVER THE USE OF CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   To my good friend from California, as well as my good friend from Ohio, I would address the following observations and concerns. First, I would like to thank each of them for their support for this resolution condemning Hezbollah for their actions. 
   But I would like to note for the record that there is a tremendous difference between a perpetrator and a victim. A perpetrator is the one who initiates the act. The victim is the one who is victimized by the act. Very often, in an act of violence, murder, mayhem, the victim fights back. The victim has every single right in the world, legally and morally, to defend itself against violence. Some might argue sometimes that in defense of oneself, the victim goes too far. The woman being raped tries to scratch out the eyes of the rapist. Who is to blame her? 
   I thank my two friends for also pointing out that there is a difference in systems, that there is a difference in moral values between that which the Hezbollah does and the response of the Israelis. I appreciated the fact that the gentleman from Ohio brought in part of a weapon of destruction that was used in self-defense, but I am also happy that we did not bring in gory pictures of Israeli children and women on their way to school or working on farms or in their villages, who every day are subject to attacks and missiles fired by Hezbollah as they go about their daily, innocent lives. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for calling to the House's attention in so eloquent a way of what is rarely government and governance and society and what Israel is all about, who points out graphically and with the evidence he brought before us the fact that it was an Israeli human rights defender who called out to the Israeli soldiers whose conduct he properly called into question, that they have no right to do that and that there are laws against it. 
   Where were the Lebanese people calling out to the Hezbollah who invaded their homes and their neighborhoods and took over and used them, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, as human shields, and said to them, we forbid you to do this, it's against our human rights, and it's against our laws? Not once. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for pointing out the Israeli system of justice, which stands basically equal to ours. We, too, in the pursuit of terrorists and evildoers, as the President would call them, sometimes unfortunately commit acts in that pursuit and in defense of ourselves against the terrorists, where civilians are hurt and civilians do die. But that is not our purpose. When the Hezbollah does that, that is their intention for the civilians to die. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for pointing out that this went through the Israeli justice system because it is contrary to the laws of the democracy of the democratic State of Israel. It went to the Supreme Court of Israel, and that court found, in full view, because Israeli television shows showed their soldiers doing something wrong, and they were charged, and the court found them guilty, and the court banned it. 
   People were held responsible in a responsible society. That did not happen with the Hezbollah. That did not happen in Lebanon. It happened in Israel where people paid the price, where the military officers who were in charge of the operation were found guilty. 
   That is the difference between a democratic, humane society, where there are innocent victims of self-defense, who unfortunately, as individuals within the military, sometimes get carried away. That happens in every army in the history of the world. But holding people responsible for those individual actions is a sign of a true democracy. 
   That did not happen with the Hezbollah. That did not happen with Lebanon. That is the difference between democratic, humane societies and terrorist organizations.     
   I thank our two colleagues for bringing this to the attention of the House so that we might highlight the differences between two societies, Hezbollah, governed by terror, whose only purpose is to wreak havoc upon civilian populations, and a democracy like Israel, who responds to terrorism and sometimes have unfortunate incidents for which they hold individuals responsible and who pay the price.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (CALLING ON THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me first thank the sponsor of this resolution, our friend and colleague from the Bay Area, BARBARA LEE, for introducing this important measure. Let me also acknowledge the leadership on the Darfur issue of our distinguished majority leader, our friend and colleague, STENY HOYER, who recently returned from a very important and timely mission to the region. 
   Madam Speaker, we are still haunted by the echoes of the Holocaust, which Congress commemorated last week in the Capitol rotunda. The message from that horrific time is fresh in our minds as we consider another terrible genocide, the slaughter in the Darfur region of the Sudan. 
   Despite that profound message, the international community has allowed as many as 450,000 people to be killed, by some estimates, in Darfur. The Sudanese Government has been allowed to perpetuate a shocking campaign of terror for too long. And complacent governments around the world have stood on the side lines for too long. 
   So today, the question faces us, will we again fail to heed the message of the Holocaust? Will we allow Khartoum to keep terrorizing the impoverished and desperate minority there into extinction? 
   Slight signs of progress have emerged over the past few weeks, even if it has come too late for the dead. The Sudanese Government agreed to let a 3,000 person strong United Nations peacekeeping force to enter the country and join the African Union troops already there. This is meant to be a stepping stone to a larger and more robust force. 
   But the Sudanese Government made the decision under pressure and only after months of excruciating backtracking and delay. But the Sudanese Government has resisted the U.N.'s efforts to send 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur. The U.N. has deemed this larger force necessary to protect civilians and to enforce a peace. 
   I have no doubt that Khartoum will continue to play games until they once again feel the pain of international pressure. As we speak, the government there is deliberately intimidating aid workers in Darfur. Let me be clear: The difference between a small, targeted force and a very substantial deployment is no mere sticking point. It is absolutely essential. 
   It is essential to stopping the Arab militias from continuing to carry out the government's dirty deeds. It is essential to clearing the path for crucial food and water and health supplies to reach the refugee camps. And it is essential because injustice is only really addressed when it is obliterated, not when it is slowed to a painful trickle of  displacement, harassment and disrupted lives. We must have that bigger U.N. force in the Sudan. 
   Now, finally, the international community has spoken with one voice. But more pressure needs to be applied. They cannot be allowed to slide backward this time. 
   The resolution before the House today urges those who may have the most influence, the Arab League and its member states, to take dramatic steps to help bring peace to Darfur. 
   The resolution urges the Arab states to declare the systematic torture, rape and displacement of Darfurians a genocide, and to support and accept U.N. peacekeepers. It also urges the Arab League to work with the United Nations, the African Union and the United States Presidential Special Envoy for the Sudan, Andrew Natsios, to bring about peace and stability to Darfur, the refugee camps, and along the Chadian border. 
   I believe it is the solemn duty of all who have said ``never again'' to speak out about genocide, especially this brutal one in Darfur. More importantly, I believe it is our duty in this Congress to do something about it without any delay. 
   I ask all of our colleagues to vote for this important and timely resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (URGING ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRACING SERVICE TO EXPEDITE RATIFICATION PROCESS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a distinct honor to introduce H. Res. 240, a resolution urging the immediate ratification of the amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords. This treaty would open the immense records of the Holocaust to Nazi war crime victims in Bad Arolsen, Germany. I would like to thank my good friend from Florida, Representative ALCEE HASTINGS, who introduced this important resolution of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
   Mr. Speaker, the horror of Nazi crimes perpetrated on Jews and others across Europe were accompanied by meticulous recordkeeping that was maintained by the Third Reich throughout the reign of its terrible regime. These accounts include listings of victims, medical records, transport notes and other details that often provide the only history of millions of innocent people who perished at the hands of the Nazis. 
   An abandoned S.S. barracks at Bad Arolsen became the repository for many of these records, where they remained under the control the Allied Forces, and then under a consortium of 11 nations since the end of World War II, some 62 years ago. 
   Throughout those years, these records have been closed to the public. Most survivors' requests have been met with reluctance or disappointing bureaucratic neglect, resulting in some 500,000 legitimate requests for information that were outstanding by the year 2000, some of them made by people who are no longer with us today. 
   Bad Arolsen contains the records of 17.5 million individuals, and I have been told by experts at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington that almost every person to have known to have been a part of that terrible time can be found in those records, victims including Anne Frank, marks of saviors such as Oskar Schindler's famous list, and my octogenarian friend and constituent, Jacob Rosenthal of Long Island, and probably information on my own family members. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a picture that hangs in my den. It used to hang in my mother's house. The color of the picture is completely in sepia, as was traditional for the time in which it was taken in Poland. It is a picture of the wedding party of my grandfather and grandmother, the grandmother whom I am named after and never met. It is a very old picture. The corners are turned down. It is starting to fade. 
   In front of the entire wedding party sits a whole group of young children sitting on the ground. My mother would point to this picture and point to the little children and say, ``This is my Uncle Chaim, and this one is my Aunt Rachel.'' I would ask, ``Mom, they are only children. How can they be your aunt and your uncle?'' And her response was, ``They will always be children.'' 
   My mother never knew what happened to them. She would have liked to have known. Maybe those records will tell us what happened to them. 
   For survivors of the Holocaust, such as our good friend and colleague and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, TOM LANTOS, time for answers, for truth, for recognition that our loved ones existed and mattered is running out. We need these archives opened now, not next year, not a decade from now when fewer survivors will be here to find peace and possibly a strong degree of closure in the material in these archives. And perhaps opening these archives of over 17 million people will in part answer those evil people like the President of Iran, Mr. Ahmadinejad, who claims that the Holocaust never existed. 
   Our good friend from Kansas spoke on another bill and he cited scripture from Isaiah saying ``you be my witness.'' The Nazis were their own witnesses and documented in tremendous detail the lives of all of these people, as well as their deaths. 
   The 1955 Bonn Accords Treaty governs these records. The 11 countries that signed that treaty agreed in 1998 to open these records to the public, but it did not happen. Last year, these nations agreed to ensure not only the opening of the records, but also the sharing of digitized copies and access for researchers. 
   Diplomatically, substantial progress has been made in recent years in achieving international agreement. Four countries have ratified the 2006 amendments: the United States, Israel, Poland and the Netherlands. With this resolution, Congress urgently encourages the remaining seven countries to ratify the amendments by May of 2007. Next month is the deadline, and we insist we make the digital archives records available as soon as they are ready this summer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and urge all of our colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (TORTURE VICTIMS RELIEF REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first thank the distinguished ranking member of the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, my very good friend, CHRIS SMITH, for his long-standing leadership in the fight against torture. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this very important piece of legislation before us today. 
   The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 is a landmark piece of legislation that enshrines the fundamental commitment of this Nation to assist all survivors of torture, wherever and whoever they might be. 
   The programs supported by the TVRA combat the effects of the most despicable of all human rights violations: The increasing use of torture around the world. 
   Although exact figures are difficult to ascertain, according to Amnesty International, a well-respected defender of human rights, more than 150 countries worldwide still engage in torture. 
   An estimated 400,000 to 500,000 foreign torture victims reside in the United States, and over 100 million may exist worldwide. More than 250 treatment centers operate internationally with the sole purpose of providing medical, psychological and social services to torture survivors. These crucial facilities provide a distinctive type of treatment to those victims. 
   In the U.S., the Center for Victims of Torture, located in Minnesota, was the first of its kind in the United States and the third torture victims treatment center in the world. 
   The personal ramifications of torture are beyond the comprehension of those who have not gone through it. Torture leaves no victim unscarred. It shapes the remainder of their lives. While physical wounds may ultimately heal, torture survivors need ongoing psychological services and therapy to cope with post-traumatic stress that afflicts them daily. Recovering from torture is a long-term process. It can take years before torture survivors can once again feel emotionally stable and comfortable in society. 
   The bill before the House today funds our very important fight against torture, both nationally and internationally. For international programs, this legislation authorizes $12 million per  year for centers and programs administered through USAID's Victims of Torture Fund. It also authorizes an additional $12 million a year for centers and programs administered through the U.N. Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture. 
   Domestically, our legislation authorizes $25 million annually for the Department of Health and Human Services so that HHS can assist domestic treatment centers fully and sufficiently. 
   The sad truth is that torture is not waning; if anything, it is on the rise. As a moral force and a Nation that exhibits empathy to those in most need, it is our firm responsibility to help the victims of torture with these comprehensive programs. The funds authorized are urgently needed to achieve this goal. I strongly support this legislation, and encourage every Member of the House to do so as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (CONGRATULATING THE STATE OF ISRAEL ON CHAIRING A UNITED NATIONS COMMITTEE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to thank Mr. Hastings and Mr. Green for their work on this important resolution congratulating the democratic State of Israel for achieving a significant victory in its long and tedious campaign to gain fair treatment at the U.N. 
   In June, an Israeli diplomat, Mr. Ron Adam, was chosen to chair a critical U.N. committee, the Committee on Policy and Coordination, which is responsible for approving the work plan for all U.N. agencies and bodies. Incredibly, in the entire history of the U.N., this is the first time an Israeli has been granted such a role. 
   For almost 60 years, since it became a member of the United Nations, Israel has been treated as a second-class citizen among the nations at the U.N. The greatest barrier to fair treatment for Israel has been its inability to achieve normal standing in one of the U.N.'s regional groupings. These groupings control committee assignments and leadership positions throughout the U.N. system. 
   Though geographically Israel should be a member of the Asia group, a cabal of anti-democratic and anti-Semitic states in that region, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has conspired to exclude Israel from its rightful membership in that group. Only recently has Israel been granted qualified membership in another U.N. group known as the Western European and Others regional group.     
   This new status has allowed Israel to begin to obtain U.N. leadership positions. We must build on this momentum. H. Res. 624 does so by demanding that the Western European and Others Group, with which Israel now caucuses at the U.N., remove all remaining restrictions and qualifications on Israel's status as a member of that group. The resolution also expresses support for Israel's campaign to gain a rotational seat on U.N. Security Council. 
   Once again, Madam Speaker, I congratulate Israel for its election to serve as Chair of the Committee on Policy and Coordination. I also urge our good friend, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to use this positive step towards further increasing normalization of Israel's status at the United Nations. We must continue to work with the U.N. Secretary General who has made pressing normalization an important goal of his tenure. The unfair treatment of Israel at the U.N. undermines the very principles the United Nations is meant to embody. The spectacle of repressive regimes conspiring to deny Israel, the only democratic state in the Middle East, normal status at the U.N. undermines the broader fight on behalf of the human rights and democracy. 
   Madam Speaker, I would urge all of our colleagues to support this very important resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, when the House last discussed Lebanon on September 25, I said that Lebanon was being bullied. That statement, though true, is insufficient. Lebanon is not being harassed by invisible unworldly forces. Lebanon is not a victim of fate or destiny or bad luck. Lebanese politicians and public figures, beginning with Rafiq Hariri and continuing to this day, are not being assassinated and blown away by falling meteors or volcanic eruptions. Arms do not appear in Lebanon by magic. Hezbollah's billions do not fall from the sky like rain. Palestinian terrorist groups don't find rifles falling out of trees or by the side of the road. The Fatah al-Islam and its war against the Lebanese state were not the product of spontaneous auto-genesis. Like maggots, their origin can escape the casual observer, but their birth was no accident or mystery. 
   Madam Speaker, Syria and Iran are responsible for these crimes. Syria and Iran are responsible for the chaos. Syria and Iran are to blame for the shadow of civil war that hangs over Lebanon. Lebanese politics are complex, and the interaction within and among confessions is daunting for the outside observer to contemplate. Where interest and principle merge and depart is hard to judge. But we know some things about Lebanon for certain, and they are spelled out clearly in the resolution at hand. 
   Despite Lebanon's Constitution, Syria demanded the extension of President Emile Lahoud's term in 2004, and Damascus got its way. The principal opponent of this grotesque intrusion into Lebanon's affairs was Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. There is credible evidence uncovered by U.N. investigators showing that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad first threatened and then ordered the assassination of Rafiq Hariri for his defiance of Syrian diktat. 
   Madam Speaker, in response to the murder of Hariri, and, let us remember, 22 other civilians, the Lebanese rose up against their Syrian overlords and demanded, with the full support of the international community, the expulsion of Syria's occupational forces. A new government was formed through a free and fair election led by Lebanese not in the service of Syria and not in the debt of Iran. 
   This development, both surprising and hopeful, of a Lebanon free to chart its own course, was one that Syria and Iran couldn't tolerate. In their minds, Lebanon is a fiefdom, a toy. Lebanon is a playground for their ambitions and a canvas on which to splash their rage and hatred for the United States and Israel in the modern world. 
   Madam Speaker, Lebanon, in the minds of Syria's overlords and Iran's ayatollahs, is not for the Lebanese. This intolerance, this greedy self-interest, this bitter contempt for the rights of others is why we are speaking of Lebanon in the U.S. House of Representatives again today.  
   Lebanon is in grave peril. Lebanon's independence and sovereignty are under attack by Syria and Iran and their bootlicking Lebanese proxies, Hezbollah, Amal and the Aounist bloc. Extralegally demanding control of the presidency, and threatening civil war, this coalition of the wicked and the selfish have again brought chaos, violence and terror to Lebanon. It need not be so. It should not be so. 
   Syria and Lebanon are responsible for the crisis in Lebanon. Syria and Iran are responsible for the crisis in Lebanon. They have trampled on Lebanon's sovereignty and clearly violated U.N. Security Council resolutions protective of Lebanon. They are the puppet masters pulling on the strings of Hezbollah, Amal and Aoun. The assassinations of Lebanese members of Parliament are their work. The bombings are their work. The threats to establish an extra-legal second government are their work. 
   Madam Speaker, there is no mystery here. There is evil, there is greed, there is indecency, and, were I Lebanese, I might say treason as well. But there is no mystery. Syria and Iran are attacking Lebanon's sovereignty no less than if they sent a fleet of bombers, or a wave of tanks, or a swarm of infantry. That this aggression, this naked aggression is being done by proxies, and by terrorists, by car bombs, by telephone threats does not make it any less aggression, or any less a crime. 
   Many vital interests of the United States are at stake. If we want every nation to be secure in its own borders, we cannot tolerate cross-border aggression. If we want to see the Middle East at peace, we cannot tolerate the resumption of Syrian and Iranian control of Lebanon. If we want to encourage self-governance around the world, we cannot tolerate Lebanon's democracy being subverted by thugs and fanatics. If we want to see people rising up against tyranny, as they are today in Burma, we cannot tolerate the reversal of Lebanon's glorious Cedar Revolution. If we want to see the United Nations become a true guardian of peace, we cannot tolerate the will of the international community being scorned by rogue states. 
   Madam Speaker, America must lead. Even today, even with Iraq, there is still no other state that can mobilize the international community as can the United States, and the hour is desperate. Only if they are convinced that the world will not tolerate their aggression against Lebanon, will Syria and Iran back down. This outcome is not impossible. 
   The stakes are exceedingly high. It is my hope that the Lebanese Government and the Bush administration will see this debate in the House as proof that Congress is watching closely and that we stand ready to help secure Lebanon's future as an independent and sovereign state. If we want to end the bloodshed in Lebanon and foreclose the prospect of still greater violence, we must act now and in concert with the community of nations. 
   There is wide support for Lebanon both in Europe and the Arab and Muslim world, just waiting for a catalyst to give it expression. America must be that catalyst. We are here today to sound the wake-up call. A brighter future for Lebanon, for the Middle East, and for ourselves awaits our clarion call. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to commend my friend and colleague  MARK KIRK from Illinois as well as that of Mrs. Lowey of New York for their leadership on this important human rights case. 
   With passage of this resolution, Congress will firmly indicate its view that the government of Bangladesh should immediately release a Bangladeshi journalist whose only apparent crime is to attempt to visit the democratic nation of Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, Bangladesh has undergone great political turmoil in recent months, and the nation is now being ruled by a caretaker government. As Bangladesh moves towards a new round of elections, it is imperative that the rule of law and freedom of the press be preserved. 
   The current government has set out an agenda to reform Bangladesh's political system and to stem corruption. We have seen lately the arrest of many previously high-ranking government officials. It is my sincere wish that the standards of responsible governance survive under the caretaker government until free and fair elections take place, elections that I hope will happen in the near term. 
   In this time of great political turmoil in Bangladesh, it is truly inexplicable that the government would focus its scarce resources on prosecuting a journalist. 
   Mr. Choudhury believes in interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims as an alternative to religious extremism, and has been commended by the international community for such bravery of thought. 
   Gaining the respect and concern of organizations like the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Mr. Choudhury has shown immense resiliency after facing numerous political and physical threats. 
   Mr. Choudhury's actions are courageous, not criminal, and it is time for the government of Bangladesh to take decisive action and drop all pending charges. The political leadership of Bangladesh should focus on getting its own house in order instead of mindlessly prosecuting someone for trying to promote international peace and stability. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (CALLING FOR RELEASE OF ISRAELI SOLDIERS HELD CAPTIVE BY HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank Chairman Tom Lantos and ranking minority member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well as the ranking minority member on the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mike Pence. These Members joined with me at the very outset of the Congress to introduce H. Res. 107. The resolution is an exercise in compassion and it expresses the sense of the House regarding the three Israeli soldiers who were kidnapped last summer. 
   As of today, Gilad Shalit has been a captive for 261 days, roughly 8 1/2 months; Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev have been captives for 244 days. That is a day more than 8 months. To date, there has been no access to these men by medical personnel or the Red Cross or Red Crescent. 
   They have not been permitted to send mail to their loved ones. We don't know if they are ill, we don't know if  they are wounded, we don't know for certain that they are still alive. 
   Mr. Speaker, their captors have sought to turn these three men into something they are not: Bargaining chips, pawns, a kind of political chattel, things that can be swapped for favors or sacrificed at whim. These three men are not things. They are human beings. They have names and families. They have rights as captured soldiers, and they have rights as individuals. And they also have rights under international law. 
   The organizations that have taken these men captive have shown their true character. Withholding doctors and medicine, withholding the Red Cross and Red Crescent visits, withholding basic communications with their families, even just the information that they are still alive, these choices and these acts show what kind of men run Hamas and Hezbollah: They are religious, but they are deeply immoral. They are self-righteous, but they are profoundly cruel. They are blustery and proud, but they are sneaky and manipulative. Decent human beings do not behave this way. 
   Mr. Speaker, decency doesn't depend on international law or multilateral agreements, nor does it depend on nationality. And I am not aware that withholding medical care or basic contact with the outside world is a requirement of either Shia or Sunni Islam, or any of the world's great religions. 
   This kind of brutality and malice is, unfortunately, typical of these organizations and their state sponsors, Syria and Iran. Syria is a thuggish dictatorship which believes its appetite for the Golan Heights legitimizes any crime or cruelty. 
   And Iran's repressive theocracy is both the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and its most dangerous proliferation threat. Viciousness is standard operating procedure for both regimes. 
   We cannot compel such parties to release Gilad, Ehud, and Eldad any more than we can force them to understand the difference between right and wrong. You cannot disgrace someone who is incapable of shame. 
   But we can and we must stand by our ally, the State of Israel. America has had painfully similar experiences at the hands of the same culprits. 
   Out of our own bitter experience, we can express our sympathy and our concern for the captives and for their families. We can let the perpetrators of this barbarism know that we have not forgotten what they have done, and what they are continuing to do. We can bear witness, and we can add our voices to all those who are saying, ``Enough, enough. Let these men go home.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (REQUIRING REPORT ON EFFORTS TO BRING TO JUSTICE PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS WHO KILLED JOHN BRANCHIZIO, MARK PARSON, AND JOHN MARIN LINDE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2293, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The legislation the House is considering today will ensure that three brave Americans are not forgotten. I want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and my friend, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Pence, for their support and cosponsorship of the bill. 
   Though my belief in the necessity of this legislation is complete, my feelings about the bill are mixed. I am proud that this House will today insist that justice be done for three Americans who died in the service of their country. But I am deeply troubled and saddened that this legislation is even necessary. 
   On October 15, 2003, John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde  were killed due to the detonation of a roadside car bomb in Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip. These young Americans were providing security to a mission of American diplomats on their way to Gaza to conduct interviews for Fulbright scholars to come to the United States. But they never made it. 
   Despite the easily recognized vehicles and the diplomatic plates marking them clearly as Americans, despite coordination with the Palestinian security authorities, despite the fact that they were on a mission of kindness and generosity, their lives were ended by a brutal and cowardly act. And ever since then, United States Government employees have been barred from entering Gaza. 
   Their deaths were tragic. But what followed, however, was a farce. 
   The attack took place near a manned Palestinian checkpoint; and immediately following the attack, journalists photographed Palestinian police officers standing by as onlookers cheered the attack and roamed the crime scene destroying critical evidence. But within 24 hours, the Palestinian Authority, quite literally, ``rounded up the usual suspects,'' four members of the so-called Popular Resistance Committee, or PRC. 
   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, however, never presented a case against them. Held over for a month, the Palestinian court finally announced that the defendants would be released since ``no evidence was offered against'' them. They remained in jail despite the judge's order, however, pending Yasser Arafat's approval of their release. When that approval never came, a mob of PRC members stormed the jail the next month, without resistance, and freed the suspects. 
   A year later, on September 22, 2004, Arafat's cousin, the head of military intelligence in Gaza, told the Associated Press that though the identity of the killers was known, the United States would have to forgo justice in this case. Speaking of our Nation, he said, ``They know that we are in a very critical position and clashing with any Palestinian party under the presence of the occupation is an issue that will present many problems for us.'' 
   ``The Americans,'' he added, ``have started recently to understand our position and I expect that this crisis will also be resolved.'' 
   Six months later, Secretary Condoleezza Rice raised the matter directly with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. I don't know that Abu Mazen, as Abbas is known, told our Secretary of State, but she publicly announced on February 7, 2006, ``We have been assured by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority's intention to bring justice to those who murdered three American personnel in Gaza in 2003.'' 
   Obviously, we are still waiting and with the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip, we may never know the truth, and justice may never be done. 
   I have been outspoken in my criticism of the administration's failure to use the fresh mandate Abbas had in 2006 to make real progress toward peace. We failed him, as did the Israelis, and we are now confronting the consequences of our shortsightedness. But in this case, in this small but meaningful case, Abu Mazen has failed us. 
   The case presented an opportunity to establish the Palestinian Authority's writ, to demonstrate that the PA was capable of handling the duties of a state, which above all is obliged to maintain law and order, for visitor and citizen alike. 
   There is still a $5 million bounty pending, through the Rewards for Justice program, but I doubt it will ever be paid. The Bush administration has been so lack in dealing with this case, so lackadaisical in the pursuit of justice for three Americans who died in the service of this Nation that I believe Congress must step in. 
   It is not in our power to compel justice, nor can we instill drive, initiative, or energy. But we can maintain accountability, and that is what this bill would do. Thirty days after passage, and every 120 days thereafter, the Secretary of State will have to present Congress with a progress report, and not a short one either. This report would require details, the kinds of sticky uncomfortable deals, the kind of sticky uncomfortable details that will show whether the Department is insisting on the pursuit of justice, or just waiting for it to show up on its own. We are not asking for the impossible. The most important requirement of the report is a specific assessment of whether the Palestinians are making their best effort and possible resolution. 
   Today, it is hard to say what that would look like. But very deliberately, this report will be prepared every 120 days in perpetuity until the Secretary can certify that the Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde have been identified, arrested, and brought to justice. 
   I regret saying it, but justice for these three men was never as great a priority for the Bush administration as it ought to have been. 
   The vital national security interests of the United States require us to safeguard to the greatest extent possible consistent with their mission United States diploma tics and all embassy and consulate personnel, and to use the full power of the United States to bring justice to any individual or entity that threatens, jeopardizes, or harms them. 
   Every man and woman working for the United States abroad deserves this commitment. And so many months after their deaths, John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde deserve this much at the very least. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the Chairs, particularly my friend, the distinguished gentleman from California, for their hard work on this legislation. This bill was not easy in getting ready, given its size and scope, and the House owes all its thanks. 
   It is entirely proper that the first bill of this 110th Congress, H.R. 1, be focused on the implementation of the 9/11 Commission Report. Under the previous majority and under the leadership of the current administration, America's common defense has been shortsighted, irresponsible, poorly conceived and incompetently executed. There can scarcely be any argument that our Nation's reputation is in tatters; our finances are in disarray; our alliances are in poor repair; our deterrent posture has been weakened; and our Armed Forces have been overextended and are nearing exhaustion. 
   The Bush administration and the Republican Congress of the past have combined, through a posture of belligerence and torpor, arrogance and ineptitude, to make America less free, less strong and less safe. From the party that has claimed ``peace through strength'' as its guiding principle, we have unfortunately come to discover that ``war with weakness'' has been their governing practice. 
   But a new day has dawned, and I am proud, Mr. Speaker, that we have turned our attention so readily in this new Congress to cleaning up the mess that has been made of our national security. 
   We all know that hindsight offers almost perfect vision. But the great and bitter irony, indeed the great tragedy of the past 2 years, is that, in contrast to the confused and inept policy the Bush administration has pursued and that the previous Congress rubber stamped, there was and there is a readily available, easily implemented strategy waiting on the shelf. 
   From July 22, 2004, onward, a clear and compelling strategy for the struggle against the radical Islamic terrorists who attacked our Nation on September 11th has been waiting for us, shamefully gathering dust. It is a bipartisan strategy. It is a thoughtful and insightful strategy. And most significantly, it actually is a strategy. It is an actual and realistic plan for applying all the tools of national power  to achieve our national interests and protect our Nation from further attack. 
   It does not depend on the metaphysical power of the word ``freedom'' to transform cultures or dissolve ancient hatreds. It does not assume that elections are great sociological Band-Aids that will make everything all better; and it is not faith-based. It is not a policy which we simply announce and then hope and pray that it works. 
   It is a strategy that recognizes that our enemies are dangerous, but they are also vulnerable. It is a strategy that sees the difference between great nations with powerful industrial economies, and a league of violent religious zealots living in caves and on the margins of society. Our enemies are not all powerful, and it is about time that we stop trying to terrify the public in order to justify and excuse bad policy and infringements upon our civil rights. 
   We need to remember that whatever chaos, murder and destruction al Qaeda's leadership and the global jihadi movement have perpetrated, in truth they are not great leaders and theirs is not a great movement. They are dangerous, for sure, but they are also failures. Virtually every success the jihadist have celebrated since 9/11 have actually been the work of our own badly guided hands. 
   What have they marked as signs of progress? Is the civil war in Iraq the result of their unstoppable juggernaut of chaos or our recklessness in tearing down the structures of law and order and our incomprehensible unwillingness to match forces to the mission? Is the collapse of security in Afghanistan the outcome of their mighty offensive or our unconscionable passivity and penny-pinching? Is the rise in violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict the product of their clever tactics or our idiotic disengagement? And is the decline of our reputation and prestige a consequence of their brilliant public relations strategy or our fixed determination to treat Arab and Muslim public opinion as irrelevant? 
   The truth is that our enemies face enormous handicaps. Their goals and methods are broadly considered illegitimate, even in the countries we have most alienated. Our enemies can destroy, but they cannot create. They can impose, but they cannot inspire. Their vision of the future is, in fact, utterly unpalatable to the great mass of their own desired audience. Indeed, the grandiosity of their vision for a revived caliphate generally inspires mockery and scorn, not support or adherence. 
   Our enemies are a few thousand lunatics who want to put the entire world in a straitjacket of 12th century Islamic law who shouldn't be hard to defeat in a public relations war. If our situation wasn't so tragic and dire, it would be hysterically funny. If it were a movie, it would be ``The Jihadi Mouse that Roared.'' 
   More than 5 years after 9/11, it is about time we put in place a strategy that takes the threat as seriously as it deserves but doesn't wrap our Nation around the twin axles of fear and ignorance. And just because our military is readily available and highly effective doesn't make it the right tool for every job. 
   The 9/11 Commission Report was explicit about the significance of the foreign policy components of an effective national counter terrorism strategy. Sadly, the Bush administration and previous Congress thought little of this advice. Public diplomacy was equated with campaign-style spin and flavor-of-the-month diplomatic initiatives designed to address American critics but not Arab or Muslim public opinion. 
   This bill takes a different tact. Instead of broadcasting our inability to steer events, this legislation will strengthen our ability to create like-minded allies. Instead of alternately yelling at Arab governments and giving them cash anyway, this legislation sets in motion efforts to strengthen our allies at the roots of their societies. Instead of sweeping bad behavior by allies under the carpet, this bill demands that the administration come clean about what has been happening in the key regions and what the United States has done in response. 
   There is more that must be done to right our policy in the Arab and Muslim world, and as a member of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee, I am looking forward to getting to work. 
   This legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission is an appropriate starting point and hopefully marks a welcome change of course. The fact that we have not been attacked since September 11th should give us no more solace than the 8 years of quiet between the first attack on the Twin Towers and the day that they were destroyed. 
   We may only hope that our continuing efforts will hold the next attack in abeyance indefinitely. As the President likes to remind us, we are safer but not yet safe. Today's legislation implementing the 9/11 Commission Report is not a panacea, but it will make us safer still. I strongly encourage all Members of the House on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (TO AWARD POSTHUMOUSLY A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO CONSTANTINO BRUMIDI -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 254 which would posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to Constantino Brumidi and would authorize the striking of duplicate medals for sale to the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, for those of us who work here in the Capitol, we are very fortunate to be surrounded by Constantino Brumidi's genius every day. Brumidi's awesome, inspiring murals and frescos are remarkable as they are ubiquitous. Constantino Brumidi's works can be found in three Senate Appropriations Committee rooms, the House Appropriations Committee room, the Senate Democratic Policy Committee room, the Brumidi corridors, the Senate reception area, the Office of the Vice President and, of course, the Rotunda. Like his masterful works throughout the Capitol, Constantino Brumidi's story is uniquely American. 
   Brumidi was born in Rome in 1805 to an Italian mother and a Greek father. His artistic ability was cultivated at an early age. In his early years, he was commissioned to paint frescos and murals in various Roman palaces. And then in 1849, as did so many of our ancestors, Brumidi, who was already an established artist in Italy and who spent 3 years working for Pope Gregory XVI in the Vatican, migrated to the United States and began a new life in New York City. There he proudly became a naturalized American citizen in 1852. 
   It was on a return trip from Mexico that Constantino Brumidi first saw the U.S. Capitol. It was a fortuitous twist of fate: at a time when Congress and President Franklin Pierce were preparing to expand the Capitol, a word-class Italian American artist, who just happened to be passing through Washington, inspired by both the freedoms and liberties represented by the seat of Congress and the vast open spaces in the Capitol that seemed to invite frescos and murals, offered his services to Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs. Wisely, Meigs commissioned Brumidi to become the artist of the Capitol. 
   Brumidi's first work was in the Agricultural Committee room. This masterpiece received such favorable attention that he was given a raise and tasked with painting other larger works culminating with the works in the Capitol Rotunda.     
   There is no work in the Capitol more impressive or more renowned than ``The Apotheosis of Washington.'' Brumidi completed the fresco in 11 months at the end of the Civil War, soon after the new dome was completed. This absolutely stunning work soars 180 feet above the Rotunda floor. To compensate for the distance from the floor to the ceiling, Brumidi, who spent years mastering depth and scale, painted 15-foot tall figures so that the work could be appreciated from the Rotunda floor. 
   Another Brumidi masterpiece, ``The Frieze of American History,'' appears just underneath the dome and spans the entire 360 degrees of the Capitol Rotunda. The frieze, which initially looks to be carved or sculpted, as all who view it believe it to be three dimensional, was, in actuality, meticulously painted with the use of scaffolding. While Brumidi first sketched a design of the frieze in 1859, Congress did not authorize work to begin on this piece until 18 years later, in 1877. 
   The work masterfully displays America's history, beginning with the landing of Christopher Columbus and continuing to the discovery of gold in California. While many visitors to the Capitol have seen Brumidi's genius in the frieze over the years, they may not realize that he nearly lost his life while painting it. While working on a figure of William Penn, 76-year-old Brumidi fell from the scaffolding, but saved himself by clinging to the rung of a ladder for 15 long minutes before he was rescued. While he subsequently ascended the scaffolding once more to continue his work, he died a few months later in 1880. It took two additional artists and 73 years to finish the masterpiece that Constantino Brumidi first began. 
   Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi's service to the Capitol, and our country, span the administration of six, six Presidents: Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes. On and on, Brumidi worked. All of us here in the Capitol that have the privilege of working in this living museum, as well as the millions of visitors that tour our building each year, who admire and relish Brumidi's works, but precious few know the story of the artist of the Capitol. 
   In addition to awarding Constantino Brumidi with the Congressional Gold Medal, S. 254 directs the Architect of the Capitol to display the gold medal as an exhibition in the new visitor's center dedicated to Brumidi's life and work. I believe such an exhibit is long past due and would be to the benefit of future generations of Americans who come to see the Capitol and admire the brilliant works of Constantino Brumidi, reminding us yet again that we are a Nation built by immigrants. 
   Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi was a great son of Italy and a great American. His achievements are a  great source of pride for Italian Americans, and S. 254 would bestow Brumidi, and the Italian American community, with the recognition the artist's great contributions so rightly deserve. 
   Special thanks are due to Representative Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, the main sponsor of this bill that we have before us in the House today. 
   And I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of somebody who visits us here in the gallery today, Mr. Speaker, Joseph Grano, who's the president of the Constantino Brumidi Society, for his long and tireless efforts on this behalf. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for those who love fine art, creativity, American history, and who appreciate the contributions of Italian American immigrants and all immigrants for the culture and history of our country. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ACKERMAN. (CONDEMNING RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND WIDESPREAD PRESENCE OF ANTI-SEMITIC MATERIAL IN ARAB MEDIA AND PRESS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, in January of this year, the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia held a hearing entitled ``That Which Is Not Obligatory Is Prohibited: Censorship and Incitement in the Arab World.'' We received testimony from three witnesses, one each from Freedom House, the Committee To Protect Journalists, and the Anti-Defamation League. What we heard was not a surprise, but was still shocking. As a result of that hearing, I drafted this resolution and would like to ask all of my colleagues to give it their utmost consideration. 
   It is sad to note that in the 21st century, there is still not one Arab country that can be described as ``free'' by the metrics used by Freedom House, and frankly, by anyone actually familiar with the concept. While there are very significant differences throughout the region in the latitude given to public debate, political argument and press and media freedom, with the notable exception of Israel, not one Arab country can argue that its public square is truly open to all and that their government protects, rather than restricts, that freedom. 
   The ugly and typically stupid hand of the censor is unfortunately not a rare sight in the Middle East. It is not only ubiquitous, it is, in fact, often attached to the arm of the editor, the producer, the copy-writer, or the publisher. According to the United Nations' Arab Human Development reports, while Arab societies have, in general, failed to keep up with other developing nations, in the mechanisms of censorship in the Arab world, they have shown a remarkable degree of institutional adaptation and technological savvy. Their success in stifling debate and narrowing acceptable opinion is all the more remarkable given the frequent failures of Arab bureaucracies in meeting the basic needs of their people for things like education, infrastructure, economic opportunity and clean governance. 
   Countries that can't ensure that their citizens are literate or have clean drinking water still find the resources necessary to operate the red pen of the censor, or the self-serving manipulation of the truth endemic to government-owned, government-controlled and government-operated media. It would be nice if these ugly and ultimately self-defeating practices were merely the problem of other people in faraway places. We could pity them, think gravely about the words of Thomas Jefferson, and bless the wisdom of our Founders who, in a world of despots and danger, saw that a free press and free speech were the indispensable safeguards of our Republic and our liberty. 
   But we don't live in a world that gives us immunity from the troubles of others. Three thousand Americans paid the price for that lesson on September 11, 2001. If we don't visit the world's bad neighborhoods, they will visit us. The fact is, the world has grown smaller, and fair or not, the grievances between the peoples of the Middle East and their governments can be, and often are, attributed to the United States. We saw this phenomena metastasize in Iran in the late 1970s. And  we've heard the same complaints explicitly from al Qaeda's leaders. As a nation with vital national interests in that region, we have wisely built strong ties with the governments of almost all of the Arab States. 
   Unfortunately, while these ties have brought greater stability to the region, they have also aligned us with governments that don't share our values when it comes to political and civil human rights. Don't think for a moment that the people of these countries have not noticed. The United States speaks constantly of freedom, but is the ally of authoritarians. The United States prizes and celebrates the first amendment to our Constitution, but is in league with nations that abuse and imprison journalists. The United States uses taxpayer money to train others in the rule of law, but also works hand in glove with security forces of other governments that not only sniff out and destroy terrorists, but often do likewise to their own civil leaders and political reformers. 
   Like it or not, we are entangled in the conflicts between Arab publics and their governments. It is not our role nor our duty to choose the form of government for any people but ourselves. 
   But that does not forbid or restrict our right, and I would say our obligation, to speak out for the values that we believe are universal, including speaking out to our friends who sometimes believe that their extensive cooperation entitles them not only to our understanding and support, but our silence. I don't agree, and I don't accept such a formulation. In the end, such an approach will produce neither stability for them nor security for ourselves. 
   As a nation that has strayed badly over the past several years from our own ideals, we have an obligation to be humble and circumspect in condemning others. Much of the credibility America used to enjoy when speaking out on human rights has been squandered by short-sighted and morally debilitated agents of fear. But we are still a nation of ideas and a people dedicated to certain universal values, that all people are created equal, that the rule of law and due process are not luxuries but fundamental human rights, and that the freedom of speech, conscience, association and the press are not gifts from governments or rulers, but the shared inheritance of all humanity. 
   Moreover, for purely selfish reasons, we have ample cause to be concerned. Many of the same Arab governments which we are turning to help stabilize the region, and in particular, to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are the very same governments that, with a wink and a nod, are helping stir the pot of bitterness and discontent among their own citizens. 
   For example, Arab governments that say small steps toward normalizing relations with Israel are too hard because of public opinion often use government-owned, government-sanctioned or government-controlled press and media to disseminate stories of imaginary Israeli massacres, Jewish blood-libels, alleged Israeli medical experiments on Palestinian children, and for bigots with a taste for history, cheap Arabic-language translations of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Mein Kempf. 
   Moreover, in many Arab countries while there is ruthless and effective censorship, especially concerning political expression, somehow publication of vicious anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and even incitement to violence against Jews is allowed. 
   These things are bad enough, but in a place where the press is not free and where there are rules for what you can and cannot say, the fact that these forms of hatred-speech are not prohibited indicates an obvious and dangerous form of state endorsement. In the end, the outcome is a public that is not only less open to peace, but is less ready to engage with the modern world. 
   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a violent one, and the news about it inevitably reflects that fact. Likewise, revolving the core issues of that conflict does not depend on a free and honest press in the Arab world. And no state and no government is or should be above correction, criticism and complaint, not the United States, not Israel, not anyone. And to state the blindly obvious, criticism of Israeli policy is not, by definition, anti-Semitic. 
   But there is also no question that the cumulative weight of unreasoned and incendiary hatred toward Israel or the Jewish people which has not only been allowed but in some cases inserted into the press and media by Arab governments or their proxies has made the Middle East more violent and more dangerous. 
   The resolution before us will not solve these problems. But it will send a message. We are not a nation capable of indifference to either hate or oppression. We have interests in the Middle East beyond oil, and expanding the scope of human freedom is one of them. We may have strayed from our ideals, but we are trying to come home. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their support in bringing this resolution before the House, and I urge all of our Members to support the motion and the underlying resolution. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call the House's attention to a very sad anniversary. One year ago today, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel to attack Israeli troops patrolling the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon. They killed three Israeli soldiers, wounded two others and kidnaped Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. Only a few days earlier, on June 25, 2006, Hamas terrorists likewise crossed into Israel and attacked an IDF position, killing two soldiers, wounding a third and kidnapping Gildad Shalit. 
   Both of these vicious terrorist organizations, which constantly proclaim their adherence to religion and morality, have denied these three Israeli soldiers contact with the Red Cross or Red Crescent, or direct contact with their families. Despite the recent release of an audio tape, it is not in fact known if these three men are currently alive, if they are injured or if they are well. Not content merely to hold these men as hostages, Hamas and Hezbollah insist on torturing their families with the agony of not knowing about the true condition of their loved ones. 
   This is true measure of the faith and morality of these terrorists. In the name of religion they inflict agony. In the name of the sacred they perpetrate barbarism. In the name of their faith they degrade other human beings. 
   Thus they show the true content of their beliefs. Thus they show the world what their vainglorious proclamations amount to: cynical cruelty and cold calculation. 
   These terrorist groups have sought to transform Gilad, Ehud and Eldad into something they are not: bargaining chips or pawns, a kind of political chattel. Things that can be swapped for favors or sacrificed on a whim. These three men are not things. They are human beings. They have names and they have families. They have rights as captured soldiers and they have rights as human beings. 
   The House has expressed itself clearly on this matter on March 13th, when it passed H. Res. 107, the bipartisan resolution I introduced demanding the release of these three captives and condemning both the terrorists and their Syrian and Iranian sponsors for their criminal and indecent behavior. 
   We can not compel Hamas and Hezbollah to release Gilad, Ehud and Eldad any more than we can force them to understand the difference between right and wrong. You can not disgrace someone incapable of shame. But we can stand by our ally, the State of Israel. We can express our sympathy and our concern for the captives and for their families. 
   We can let the perpetrators of this barbarism know that we have not forgotten what they have done, and what they are continuing to do. We can bear witness. And we can add our voices to all those saying ``Enough. Enough. Let these men go home.''
