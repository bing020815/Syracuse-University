<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (THE NEED TO INSURE MORE OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, the news about health care in our Nation continues to get more discouraging, especially when it comes to health insurance for children. New Census data shows that the number of children without health insurance in the United States has grown over the last year by 700,000, to nearly 8.7 million children. This means that now one in nine American kids do not have health insurance. 
   To try and reverse these unacceptable trends, the Democratic Congress voted last month to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. Our legislation will provide an additional 5 million low-income children with the health insurance they need to live healthier lives. These kids are already eligible but not enrolled. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation, despite bipartisan support it received in Congress and from our Governors. In the face of these discouraging new Census numbers, it is time for the President to end his veto threat and pledge his support for this legislation that will provide 11 million children with the health care coverage they need and deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 977, which is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Representative Bruce Braley of the State of Iowa. This important resolution encourages Americans to spend their rebate checks on goods and services produced by American-owned companies. 
   I would note that Representative Braley cannot speak on behalf of his resolution today because he has returned to his district due to the widespread flooding there in the State of Iowa. I know that my colleagues join me in wishing Representative Braley and his constituents a swift recovery from this disaster. 
   The economic stimulus package signed into law this past February by the President will put money back into the pockets of many hard-working Americans. If they spend their rebates on American-made goods and services, as this resolution would encourage them to do, they will inject an estimated $10 billion back into the U.S. economy at a time when it needs it the most. Moreover, by spending their money on domestic products, Americans will also help reduce our country's skyrocketing trade deficit. 
   H. Res. 977, which has the support of more than 100 Members of this body, would augment the Federal economic stimulus package by reminding Americans of the importance of purchasing American-produced goods and services to help our flagging national economy. I urge the House to support passage of this noteworthy resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, last month during his State of the Union message, President Bush said that it is possible to balance the budget without raising taxes, but that is not the case. The President's health care proposal would increase taxes on more than 30 million Americans. 
   You didn't hear that during the State of the Union address, but the President wants to tax Americans who have what he calls gold-plated health coverage. The overwhelming majority of these Americans are middle class workers who oftentimes accepted better health care coverage over pay increases during negotiations with their employers. Many of these workers either need the substantial coverage for themselves or a sick family member. 
   The President's tax increase proposal is the latest assault on employer-provided health care. Employers with older and sicker workers pay higher insurance premiums, not because they have gold-plated insurance, but because their insurance companies charge them for more coverage. At a time when 1 million more Americans are becoming uninsured every year, the administration should not provide employers another reason to drop their health care coverage for their workers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I also want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey, my friend Congressman DONALD PAYNE, for his tireless efforts on behalf of the continent of Africa and other related issues. I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her work on this resolution. And, hopefully, we will pass this resolution and move forward with greater work of this Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, this Nation has yet to fully come to terms with and recognize the institution of slavery that existed in this country for so long. Slavery is perhaps the most underrecognized crime against humanity in the history of the world. 
   Madam Speaker, I am often asked about my light complexion. Some people do it out of curiosity and it does not offend me, but I am often asked about my complexion. It is a fact that I am indeed an African American. My great-grandmother was a slave.     
   And my great grandfather was the slave master. And my situation is not unique. The enslavement of millions of people who were taken from the west coast of Africa still affects millions of Americans today. 
   I represent the First Congressional District of North Carolina. My area of the country was one of the destinations of the slave trade. My congressional district today suffers from the effects from slavery. My constituents, half of whom are African American, suffer from disparities across the spectrum. I can trace directly these conditions to the fact that their foreparents were legally denied citizenship and the benefits of citizenship. Even after slavery ended, the United States continued to disrespect black citizens and forced them to endure inferior schools, health care, income and the like. 
   In my hometown of Wilson, North Carolina, my mother did not have access to a public education beyond the sixth grade. Had she lived in the rural area of my county, she would not have had the benefit of any education, save only a token opportunity offered by black churches. When my mother left the sixth grade, she was given an opportunity to move to another city to get an education, and it made a difference. She returned to our home community and became a teacher for 48 years and instilled in my generation the importance of education. There were hundreds of thousands who were denied educational opportunities, and their descendants today continue to suffer. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a tremendous responsibility as a Nation to remedy past wrongs. This resolution commemorating the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade is a step in the right direction. We must do more. Poverty is pervasive. This Congress must set the tone and begin the process of healing and remedy the cruelty of slavery and racial discrimination.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Etheridge, for yielding me this time. This is a very important issue for North Carolina, and I want to thank him for allowing me to come to this floor tonight to add my comments to this subject. Also I want to thank my good friend Mike McIntyre. He spoke just a few minutes ago. Mike and Congressman Etheridge both are dynamic leaders of the Agriculture Committee. They both serve as chairmen of subcommittees on the Committee on Agriculture, and they are leading the way. I want to thank them publicly for their extraordinary leadership. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor tonight to, again, talk about this serious drought. My colleagues are absolutely correct. North Carolina is experiencing its worst drought in 50 long years. In fact, nearly three-quarters of North Carolina's 100 counties, that is 75 or more counties, are experiencing an exceptional drought, the most severe category listed by the Drought Management Advisory Council. The council also lists the remaining counties as experiencing extreme drought or severe drought conditions. This is very serious for North Carolina. 
   The conditions have been so severe that several of our communities have as little as 3 months of water left remaining. If North Carolina does not see significant rain, some areas face prospects of water rationing. Yes, water rationing, or potentially running out of water entirely. The climate data shows that this spring and summer was the area's driest period since 1948.  
   North Carolina, Mr. Speaker, is taking this problem seriously. Currently, 106 public water systems have already adopted mandatory water restrictions, while 118 have enacted voluntary restrictions. I was on a program a few nights ago with the Speaker of our House of Representatives in North Carolina, Speaker Joe Hackney, and I told Speaker Hackney that I would be on the House floor tonight with our friend Bob Etheridge and we will be talking about the drought. The Speaker of my House told me, ``Congressman, with all due respect, you need to talk about more than the drought. You need to provide resources for the farmers and others who are affected by the drought.'' 
   This is very serious. As anyone can imagine, the effects on agriculture have been brutal. Congressman Etheridge talked about it a few minutes ago and Congressman McIntyre and my friend Congressman Spratt, they all talked about it. The effects have been absolutely brutal. It is estimated that peanut production is down about 20 percent from this time last year. Hay production has been cut nearly in half, and soybean production is down by more than a third. My colleagues, that is serious. In many parts of my district, and Congressman Etheridge has the map there with him in the well of the Chamber, these conditions are so dry that the soil at the bottom of drainage ditches has started to crack, and water in streams and creeks has ceased to even move. For many, the water table has also dropped to the point where there is virtually no water in the ground. The drought also means that there is less water available for our cattle and horses and other uses. At this point, some farmers will likely have to abandon their crops, particularly our peanut farmers. The consequences will be even more serious if there is no significant rainfall between now and February. 
   Our U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 85 North Carolina counties disaster areas last month, making farmers eligible for low-interest emergency loans. And we are certainly thankful for that. But our farmers still need more help, and that is what Congressman Etheridge was talking about a few minutes ago. We are facing the kind of disaster that could push many of our farmers out of business and off of their farms. Congress must move quickly to avoid worsening this natural disaster. 
   So, I am confident, I am extremely confident that the Democratic majority will rise to the occasion. We will certainly encourage the leadership to do that. We will make the resources available for our citizens. And I pray, Mr. Speaker, that the President of the United States would not veto that legislation, that he will sign it into law. 
   Thank you, Mr. Etheridge, for your extraordinary leadership, and thank you for what you mean to North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, in just a few minutes, we will begin to debate House Concurrent Resolution 63. The American people are ready for this debate, and finally the time has now come, and we will decide and recommend whether or not the President should escalate our troop strength in Iraq. I look forward to this debate. 
   But this morning, Mr. Speaker, I want to use my time to talk about the fiscal crisis that we have in America. You know, Mr. Speaker, in my speeches to constituents throughout the First District of North Carolina, I always make a point to talk about the fiscal crisis that we are facing in this country, the fiscal crisis that the Republicans have created over the last 5 years. You know, Mr. Speaker, when I tell them that we have unprecedented deficits that have resulted in $8.6 trillion in debt, and when I tell them that we spend $2 billion a week in Iraq, $8 billion per month, and yes, $100 billion per year, but only spend $90 billion in funding education in this country, they are absolutely shocked. 
   And now, Mr. Speaker, the President's 2008 budget will raise our debt by more than $1 trillion over the next 5 years. This proposed budget that we received last week from President Bush would make tax cuts for the wealthy permanent while cutting vital programs that are important to middle-class families. 
   To help pay for the nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, the budget substantially cuts Medicare and Medicaid, creating uncertainty for millions of seniors and low-income families who get their health insurance through these programs. The President's budget also shortchanges veterans' programs, cutting veterans' health care by $3.5 billion over 5 years and providing less than veterans service organizations say is needed to meet the growing needs of our veterans, including those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats have repeatedly, repeatedly expressed the desire to work constructively with the administration to restore fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget consistent with our Nation's priorities. However, this budget that we received last week is marked by a disappointing dedication to the failed policies of the past rather than a commitment to a new course. Fortunately for the American people, Democrats will now produce an alternative that will be fiscally responsible and meet the demands of our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DO-NOT-CALL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill that we now consider on the floor is related to the previous bill that we just adopted. H.R. 3541, the Do-not-call Improvement Act of 2007, ensures that Americans who signed up to be on the do-not-call list remain on the do-not-call list. As the law currently stands, consumers are automatically purged from the registry after a 5-year period and they are forced to re-register their phone numbers with the FTC. Consequently, if we do nothing, of the 132 million telephone numbers that are currently listed on the do-not-call registry, almost 52 million of those numbers will expire and once again be fair game for telemarketers. 
   I guarantee you, Mr. Speaker, that the vast majority of these consumers are unaware that they must relist their phone numbers. As was the case with the previous bill, I don't think Members of Congress want to incur the wrath of millions of angry constituents and family members who thought they were safe from the nuisance of telemarketers, but are once again getting their pestering phone calls every evening. I might also add that September 28, the date in which 52 million numbers will expire, is right before election day. Need I say more? 
   The authors of the bill, my good friend Mr. Doyle, who will speak in just a few moments, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and my friend Mr. Pickering from Mississippi, are both valued members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and they are to be commended for their bipartisan cooperation. On October 30 the bill was amended at the full committee markup to require the FTC to periodically scrub the do-not-call registry to remove phone numbers that have been disconnected or reassigned and further requires the commission to report to Congress on the accuracy of the registry. As such, H.R. 3541 ensures that the do-not-call list is fair and accurate and that only those American consumers who do not wish to be called by telemarketers are on the registry. 
   This is a thoughtful, bipartisan piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY FEE EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which we refer to as H.R. 2601, was introduced by the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, my good friend Mr. Stearns from the State of Florida. This bill is to extend the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to collect the fees that administer and enforce the provisions relating to the national do-not-call registry. 
   In 2003, Mr. Speaker, Congress passed the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, which authorized the FTC to establish fees sufficient to implement the national do-not-call registry as originally authorized by the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994. I don't think it's hyperbole, Mr. Speaker, to say that this may quite possibly be one of the most popular laws and government initiatives in our Nation's history. Consumers have registered more than 146 million telephone numbers since the registry became operational in 2003. 
   The FTC's authority to annually establish the appropriate level of fees to charge telemarketers for access to the registry expires, yes, it expires in 2007, and Mr. Stearns's bill, as amended, in the Energy and Commerce Committee renders that authority permanent. If Members of Congress wish to avoid the wrath of millions of angry constituents who are being called by telemarketers during dinner time, it is in our best interest to facilitate the continuing operation of the do-not-call registry and vote for this bill. 
   As is the case with the vast majority of the legislation passed out of the subcommittee of which I am a member, this is a bipartisan bill. I'm proud to say that, Mr. Speaker. We worked on this measure together. This is a bipartisan bill that was crafted in consultation with the appropriate agency of expertise, in this case the Federal Trade Commission. The bill passed my subcommittee by a voice vote on October 23; and a week later, on October 30, it was unanimously approved by the full Energy and Commerce Committee. It is fully deserving of quick passage on the floor of the House today. 
   As usual, Mr. Speaker, the staff on both sides of the aisle worked together on this bill, and with Ranking Member Stearns as well as Ranking Member Barton of the full committee, they should all be commended for their ongoing cooperation with the chairman, the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), and the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), who chairs the subcommittee. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, with that said, I am going to urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, just how many people need to tell the President that his troop escalation plan is a terrible idea before he actually begins to listen? The American people sent the President a strong message last November that they no longer want our troops involved in what has become a civil war in Iraq. 
   The President's own generals have told him that they didn't need more troops in Iraq; but rather than listening to his generals, as he has always suggested that he has done, he has now turned around and replaced them with generals who are more friendly to the idea of sending more troops. 
   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group told the President that more troops were not needed. Instead, they concluded that a strategic redeployment should be initiated in the coming months and that the administration should reach out to the neighbors in the region, ideas the administration has rejected. If this were not enough, an overwhelming number of Democrats, and Republicans I might say, here on Capitol Hill have expressed opposition to the plan.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, today, many American families will finally receive a long overdue pay raise when phase one of the Federal minimum wage increase takes effect. 
   It has been 10 long years since American workers have seen an increase in the Federal minimum wage, the longest gap in the history of the law. Over that decade, inflation has all but erased the effect of the last increase, leaving millions of families, including military families, struggling to survive. 
   Currently, Madam Speaker, 10 percent of military spouses earn between $5.15 and $7.25 an hour. These 50,000 military families are part of the nearly 13 million Americans who will benefit from the Federal minimum wage increase that takes effect today. 
   Madam Speaker, increasing the minimum wage is just one part of a broader American agenda to strengthen the economy and help working families. Democrats believe that all Americans, not just the privileged few, deserve to make a living wage. 
   I am proud that we passed this legislation, and especially glad that it will help so many of our military families.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (FEDERAL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DONATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding the time and thank her for her leadership on this committee, and certainly thank her for her work on this bill. I also would like to thank Chairman Towns, in his absence, for allowing this matter to come to the committee and for his hard work not only on the committee, but here in the Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, in short, H.R. 752 codifies Executive Order 12999, making many of the provisions permanent law, but also adds provisions making this much-needed equipment far more accessible to poor and underserved regions of our country. 
   The FEED Act, as we refer to it, would streamline the process for donating excess and surplus electronic equipment to small cities and towns and counties and school districts and libraries and community-based educational nonprofit organizations. 
   This legislation gives preference to poorer communities, which often have the greatest needs. This act would direct Federal agencies to transfer excess equipment to the GSA for transfer to the qualifying recipient at little or no cost. 
   The current system, Mr. Speaker, of acquiring Federal surplus equipment is flawed. It is riddled with governmental redtape. Many times it can take months or even years to receive requested equipment. There was one such case in my district, which was actually the impetus for the introduction of this bill, where GSA only began working on fulfilling the request after direct congressional action. Citizens in need of technology should be able to get it without bureaucratic redtape, which only serves to discourage the applicant from pursuing their goals. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, you and I both represent poor districts. I represent the 15th poorest district in the Nation. If my recollection is correct, you represent the poorest district in the Nation. And so we certainly understand. 
   My constituents do not have access to the technology afforded to so many. A small county, like Washington County in my district, which is the fifth poorest county in my State, are home to towns like Roper, North Carolina. With the county unemployment rate reaching nearly 8 percent, the visionary leadership of Mayor Estelle ``Bunny'' Sanders has transformed Roper into a technology oasis with job creation and training. 
   Roper, North Carolina, houses a technology center where citizens are put to work refurbishing and updating and repairing electronic equipment acquired through the process. They also receive training in Web development, server management and computer maintenance. Without the necessary excess and surplus electronic equipment with which to work, the technology center and its trainees stand the risk of losing years of hard work. Mayor Sanders has the patience and determination required to navigate the murky waters of Federal excess and surplus equipment, but most would not be that resilient. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends an enormous amount of the taxpayers' money on technology. Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's budget included about $110 million in annual technology-related costs. Once equipment becomes slightly outdated, it shouldn't just sit idle while there are so many needy small communities and schools and libraries that can still put it to good use. 
   Throughout the United States, many of our small towns and rural areas lack the very basic technology that many of us take for granted. This important legislation grants underprivileged communities across America access to Federal excess and surplus computers, printers and audio/visual and other technological equipment. 
   The bill, Mr. Speaker, is particularly important to communities in my district, and will be an important tool in building the electronic infrastructure for local governments, schools, libraries and nonprofits. Many of the communities that I represent need every bit of help they can get from this government, and hopefully this will free up some resources that can be used to address other pressing needs. 
   I am proud to have offered this legislation that will directly impact the lives of the underserved in this country. I would particularly like to thank Mayor Sanders for her work and dedication, and Mr. John Rosenthall, who has worked so hard with my staff for nearly 2 years in seeing this bill to fruition. 
   Mr. Speaker, the current system is hurting the very people that it was set up to help. This is a good bill. It is a good piece of legislation that will help not only the people in Roper or in my district, but help people all across the country, and we will all benefit from it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 752.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the H.R. 1424--Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. This legislation is a great step in ensuring that group health plans are discouraged from charging higher co-payments, coinsurance, deductibles, and imposing the maximum out-of-pocket limits on mental health and addiction care than those imposed for medical and surgical benefits. 
   Although I fully support the intent of this measure, Mr. Speaker, I have slight reservation over one of the offsets used to pay for the legislation, specifically the large increase in the Medical prescription drug rebate. 
   Innovative drug companies already provide deep discounts to Federal and state governments for prescription drugs covered by the Medicaid program. H.R. 1424 calls for a 33 percent increase in the rebate that brand pharmaceutical companies pay to the Medicaid program at a time when many drug companies are facing big financial challenges. 
   As a member of the North Carolina delegation, I realize the economic impact that this innovative industry has on my State, employing over 25,000 North Carolinians with many coming from my congressional district. I also understand the threat that this rebate poses to research, development, and access to drugs for the Medicaid beneficiaries of my poverty stricken district. We need these companies to continue investing in the United States, creating good jobs, and developing the new drugs our patients need. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the House will come together and support this progressive piece of legislation. I am pleased that we did not give up on this bill and have moved forward despite the President's veto of the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007. Further, I would also like to encourage my colleagues who will be engaged in the conference negotiations to bring to us a final product that will not deter innovation of new treatments for the diseases and ailments that affect American families.

   Unfortunately, the President has been a stubborn opponent of progress for the American people. He has threatened to veto much of the House's work this year. This House voted to implement the unfulfilled recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, but the Bush administration opposes the bill in its current form. 
   This House overwhelmingly supported a 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops who are serving in combat, but the President has threatened a veto saying a 3 percent pay raise would be sufficient. 
   We passed strong price-gouging legislation that sets tough criminal penalties for wholesalers and retailers who attempt to gouge the public. The President's response? Another veto threat. 
   More often than not, the President is obstructing our efforts to move this Nation in a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL INTERNET SAFETY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, June is National Internet Safety Month, and the resolution before us today highlights this designation. As a member of the Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I want to commend the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Bean) for introducing this resolution and for her efforts to protect our children from the lurking dangers on the Internet.  
   It is not hyperbole to say that the Internet is the most powerful tool ever developed for disseminating information to as many people as possible. Not since the invention of radio or, perhaps, since even the printing press, has a technological development so radically altered the means by which we spread information to the general public. 
   Moreover, the Internet has completely revolutionized the way in which we communicate with each other on an individualized basis. Not since the invention of the telephone has a technology revolutionized the way in which we interact with each other, one on one, regardless of distance or geography. 
   But, of course, with such great revolutions, there are always drawbacks. There will always be some who take advantage of the profound benefits provided by technology and use it for nefarious purposes. As marvelous as the Internet and the World Wide Web have become as a means of empowering ordinary people to communicate ideas in a manner that was once unimaginable, the Internet has also becoming a breeding ground, yes, a breeding ground for poisonous messages and images. It has become the modern, virtual wild, wild west where cyberbandits and thieves roam to prey on unsuspecting consumers by deception and by extracting from them sensitive private information. 
   And at its very worst, the Internet and the World Wide Web can be a complete snakepit, full of predators and scum who would prey on the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society, our children. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 455 supports the goals and ideals of National Internet Safety Month. The resolution before us recognizes the many national and community organizations that exist to educate parents and children on what steps they can take to protect their families from unsuitable content and from online predators. 
   The Federal Trade Commission is the crown jewel of the Federal Government's mission to protect consumers, and has played a critical role in this regard. In addition to its ongoing efforts to crack down on cybercrime, the Commission has engaged in a public relations campaign to promote awareness and online safety habits. 
   The FTC has established a 1-800 number which serves as a help line and as the designee where consumers can file complaints. Moreover, the Commission has set up a special Web site, www.OnGuardOnline.gov--that is www.OnGuardOnline.gov--to provide tips to consumers in protecting themselves and their children from Internet fraud. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the FTC is engaged in a public awareness campaign to promote Internet safety through a child-friendly mascot named ``Dewie the Turtle,'' much the same way Smokey the Bear successfully promoted the prevention of forest fires. 
   In addition to the FTC's efforts, numerous private and community-based organizations exist to educate and empower parents, young children and teenagers to have a safe, wholesome Internet experience.     
   They all provide a commendable service that parents and consumers should use to help empower themselves against Internet dangers. These organizations are listed on the FTC's Web site, and I will include the list into the Record at this point.

   Again, I want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Congresswoman Bean. She's such a champion on this issue. I want to thank her for this resolution, and I hope the House will see fit to pass this measure in expeditious fashion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (CONGRATULATING BARTON COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2007 NCAA DIVISION II CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Illinois for giving me this time to speak on this resolution today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my friend, Congressman Walter Jones, and me in recognizing and congratulating this year's NCAA Division II men's college basketball champions from my hometown of Wilson, North Carolina, Barton College. 
   As Congressman Jones said a moment ago, he and I share Wilson County. And the campus is technically in my district, even though we both legitimately hold claim to that great institution. 
   In one of the most exciting basketball games that I have ever seen in my life, Mr. Speaker, the Barton College Bulldogs captured its first national title after senior guard Anthony Atkinson scored his team's final 10 points, including a layup at the buzzer, to rally Barton from a 74-67 deficit with just 45 seconds remaining. The improbable come-from-behind 77-75 victory was against a previously undefeated and defending national champion, Winona State University. 
   Mr. Speaker, the game capped a tournament full of last-second heroics for Barton College, as they won the semifinal game by one point on a last-second freethrow, and the quarterfinal  game on a buzzer-beating overtime three-pointer. 
   The tournament followed an equally exciting 31-5 season in which Barton College became the first team in the history of the NCAA basketball to win four consecutive overtime games. Throughout the tournament and the season, the team showed heart, toughness and tenacity and determination by finding ways to win no matter what the circumstances were. They have had tremendous and deserved support from a community that is so proud of this college and this team. As I was leaving Wilson yesterday, I stopped by the BB&T branch on West 9th Street and there was a large banner in front of the bank congratulating the Bulldogs. We are so proud of this team, and we want our Nation to know of our proud feeling for this team. 
   It is a great honor, therefore, Mr. Speaker, for me to recognize the success, efforts and achievements of these outstanding young student athletes, and their head coach, a great individual, Ron Lievense, and his staff. Their hard work and dedication to team work is something that we are all proud of in Wilson County and northeastern North Carolina. 
   I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in paying tribute to the Barton College basketball team.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (HONORING GOVERNOR JAMES HUNT -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise today with Congressmen JONES, PRICE, WATT, ETHERIDGE, MCINTYRE, MILLER and SHULER, all of North Carolina, to honor and observe the 70th birthday of our four-term Governor of North Carolina, the Honorable James B. Hunt, Jr. 
   Over the years my long-time and dear friend, Governor Hunt, has successfully dedicated so much of himself to public service. He is a man of immense vision with an extraordinary ability to implement his vision with great results. That vision has often been focused on education. 
   Governor Hunt's list of accomplishments is long and highly distinguished in the area of education. He led efforts to establish the State's primary reading program. He also spearheaded the efforts to reduce class sizes and prevent students from dropping out of school. Governor Hunt assumed the lead role in establishing the State's school of science and mathematics, the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. 
   Smart Start, which was established under Governor Hunt's leadership, has become a nationally recognized and award-winning public-private partnership that ensures that children enter school healthy and ready to succeed. The program helps provide quality child care, health care and family support for every child in need, and there are now 14 States using this model. 
   Governor Hunt also assisted with establishing one of the most rigorous approaches to measuring student performance, requiring mastery before promotion and graduation, and providing assistance to turn around failing schools. 
   He did not allow these initiatives, or any of the many others he headed, to stand alone after he signed them into law. Instead, he demanded follow-through and results, and he got them. A study by the RAND Corporation found that our public schools raised their test scores more than any other State in the 1990s. 
   Governor Hunt's strong-held belief that the key to a quality education is great teaching has benefited students well beyond North Carolina's borders. In fact, it has benefited students and teachers throughout our Nation. 
   As the founding Chair for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, Governor Hunt was a driving force in fulfilling the promise of improving student achievement by raising the standards. Today, virtually every State and more than 25 percent of all school districts offer financial rewards or incentives for teachers seeking certification. 
   Madam Speaker, the economic value of an education and knowledge was well understood by Governor Hunt long before people started talking about its central role in the global economy. 
   Madam Speaker, Governor Hunt has also led the way in opening up the Democratic Party of our State to full participation by minority citizens. As Governor, Governor Jim Hunt appointed many African American lawyers to the trial bench and appellate court benches to hold positions that had been virtually impossible for them to otherwise obtain. Many of them now serve as judges with distinction, and it was Governor Hunt who made that happen. 
   In closing, we are honored today to recognize this great man of conviction, principle, and exceptional character on such a joyous occasion. I ask you to join us in congratulating the ``Education Governor,'' the Honorable James B. Hunt, Jr., on his 70th birthday, and in wishing him and his wife, Carolyn, many more years of happiness and accomplishment.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, there was great cause for celebration in eastern North Carolina over this past weekend, as Wilson, North Carolina's Barton College captured the NCAA Division II men's college basketball championship. What a game. 
   Barton College, Madam Speaker, is a small but proud college with a rich academic history. With a student body of about 1,000 students, it is located not only in my congressional district but located in my community. I am so proud of them. 
   Barton College captured the national championship Saturday afternoon, scoring an amazing come-from-behind 77-75 victory over previously undefeated and defending national champion Winona State University. Barton won the title game at the buzzer, with one-tenth of a second remaining. They won their semifinal game by one point on a last-second free throw. And it won its quarterfinal game on a three-pointer at the buzzer in overtime. This will be a game that will long be remembered. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a great honor for me to recognize the success, efforts and achievements of these outstanding young student athletes. It is my pleasure to recognize their head coach, Ron Lievense, and his staff. Their hard work and dedication to teamwork is something that we are all proud of in Wilson, North Carolina and throughout the First Congressional District. 
   I ask my colleagues today to rise and join me in paying tribute to Barton College's basketball team of 2007 and to recognize their extraordinary championship.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (J. HERBERT W. SMALL FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding the time to me to speak to this very important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding jurist and community leader by seeking to name the Federal building in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, as the J. Herbert Small Federal Building and United States Courthouse. 
   I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Oberstar, and Ranking Member Mica for their outstanding leadership in quickly moving this legislation through their committee. I would also like to thank each member of the entire North Carolina delegation, Democrat and Republican, for their collective support of this important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, J. Herbert Small is a lifelong resident of Elizabeth City, North Carolina. He has devoted 52 long years of his professional life to the practice of law and to the administration of justice in eastern North Carolina. 
   Herb Small began his law practice in Elizabeth City in 1949 after graduating from the School of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He served as Special Counsel to the Congressional Committee on Intergovernmental Relations and later served 8 years as county attorney for the County of Pasquotank. 
   He was elected as district attorney for the First Judicial District of North Carolina for three consecutive terms. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the District Attorneys Advisory Committee, was President of the District Attorneys Association and was appointed by the Governor to the Jail Study Commission. 
   It was when Mr. Small was a district attorney that our paths first met. As a young lawyer, I opposed him in the courtroom on several occasions. He was a strong and effective district attorney. 
   In 1979, Herb Small was elected as Resident Superior Court Judge for the First Judicial District of North Carolina. He served in this capacity for 17 years. He was honored by his peers when he was elected President of the North Carolina Conference of Superior Court Judges. During this time, he represented the conference on the North Carolina Policy and Sentencing Commission. 
   In the early days of Judge Small's service as a trial judge, I appeared before him as a lawyer, representing both civil and criminal clients. He was a firm but fair judge, treating everyone who came before his court with respect. 
   And then Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of being able to call Judge Small my judicial colleague. When I was elected as a Superior Court Judge in 1988, Judge Small had preceded me to the bench by several years. He welcomed me among the ranks of Superior Court Judges, and our friendship continued to evolve. 
   Mr. Speaker, Herb Small is a legal scholar; and our courts benefited in so many ways because of his intellect. 
   Now, I am very proud to call Judge Small a constituent. He is retired. He is happily retired, living in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is one of my 23 communities in my congressional district. Herb Small is a trusted friend and a good adviser. 
   Judge Small served as chairman of the Albemarle Hospital Board of Directors and as Chairman of the American Red Cross Chapter. He has been actively engaged in other civic and charitable and service organizations, including the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts and Volunteer Firemen, Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club and the Elks Club and the Red Men and so on. He was given the Distinguished Service Award by the Jaycees, the Volunteer of the Year Award by the Chamber of Commerce, and the Order of the Long Leaf Pine by the State of North Carolina for outstanding community involvement. 
   Very importantly, Mr. Speaker, during World War II, Judge Small served 3 years in the United States Navy; and our country is proud of and thanks him for his service. 
   Judge Small has been married to a wonderful individual, Mrs. Annette Ward Small, for many years. They have four children, Elizabeth, John Herbert, Fran and Carol; and they have nine grandchildren, Rachel, Matthew, John, Mary, Margaret, Ruth, Allison Katie, and Chris.     
   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no finer individual and no person who is more deserving of this high honor than Judge J. Herbert Small. I can assure you that Judge Small is humbled and honored by this recognition. The people of Elizabeth City and the First Congressional District of North Carolina are grateful for his community service, for his dedication, and his great and extraordinary leadership. 
   I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding me time, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work on this matter. 
   I urge my colleagues today to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1138.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, today President Bush will sign our bipartisan economic stimulus legislation into law. Getting this bill done quickly is a victory for the American people that will inject confidence and consumer demands, promote economic growth and create jobs. 
   130 million low- and middle-income Americans will receive tax rebates in the coming months. These rebates are welcome relief to many families who are struggling in this economy. Family incomes and home prices are down as health care and energy, food and education costs and mortgage foreclosures have climbed. Economists estimate that every dollar included in these rebate checks will lead to $1.26 in economic growth. The new law should also  help create 500,000 new jobs by year's end. 
   Mr. Speaker, this economic stimulus package is a good first start, but this Congress will take additional action to help American workers and help our economy recover. We will also develop a plan for additional assistance, which could include extension of unemployment benefits, food stamps, State and local assistance, and Medicaid.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Mr. Clay from Missouri, for yielding this time to me to speak to this very important legislation. I also want to thank Mr. Westmoreland for his leadership on the committee. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that I hope this body will pass unanimously. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 3382 and to urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I am the primary sponsor of H.R. 3382, and I'm proud to say that I am joined by the entire North Carolina delegation, both Democrat and Republican. I am seeking to name the post office located in the downtown area of Goldsboro, North Carolina, which incidentally is the home of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. We're seeking to name this post office as the Philip A. Baddour, Sr. Post Office. 
   Madam Speaker, Mr. Baddour was my friend. He was also a well-respected member of the Goldsboro City Council for 16 long years. After his service on the council was complete, Mr. Baddour continued to be involved in the civic life of his community, and he leaves a legacy of service in the perfect sense of the word. 
   Madam Speaker, Philip Baddour, Sr.'s occupation was that of a downtown merchant for more than 30 years. His service on the city council was his second calling, and he served in that capacity from 1979 until 1995. During his tenure on the council, he served as mayor pro tempore and was instrumental in improving the lives of the citizens of Goldsboro, of all races and backgrounds. He was known as the people's representative because of his ability to listen and understand the concerns of his constituents and because he always stood up for those who did not have a voice. 
   Upon his retirement from the council, Mr. Baddour was honored with a key to the City of Goldsboro and a resolution from the North Carolina League of Municipalities for his many years of public service. Former North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., honored Mr. Baddour as a recipient of the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, for individuals who have a proven record of extraordinary service to our State. It is the highest civilian honor that can be granted in the State of North Carolina. 
   Mr. Baddour dedicated his time and was very compassionate about his community, a community that had given him so much in his youth. He served as director of Wayside Fellowship and was the recipient of the Cancer Society's Outstanding Crusade Volunteer Award. He was also active in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts of America. He was a lifelong member of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and served as chairman of the parish council. He was also a member of the Knights of Columbus. 
   Nothing was more important to Philip Baddour, Sr. than his family. He was married to Louise Farfour for 60 years. Together, they reared four sons who have followed in their father's footsteps by themselves being community leaders and outstanding citizens. Philip, Jr., his son, my dear friend, is an attorney and former majority leader of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Richard is the athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Stephen is a retired public schoolteacher. And Neil is a real estate broker. Philip Baddour also had eight grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. 
   Sadly, Madam Speaker, Mr. Baddour, Sr. passed away in April of 2002 after giving so much to his community, to his State and his country. 
   Madam Speaker, I can think of no finer individual in Wayne County, North Carolina, and no person who is more deserving of this honor than Philip A. Baddour, Sr. The people of Goldsboro and Wayne County and the First Congressional District of North Carolina are grateful for his commitment to community and his great leadership. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring this great public servant by passing H.R. 3382. 
   Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri and the gentleman from Georgia, my friends, for yielding this time. I thank them for their service.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS REPORT ON THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I want to first of all thank the gentlelady from Ohio for her leadership here in the Congress. One of the first Members that I met when I came to Washington 3 years ago was STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES. She is engaged all the time and is certainly representing the constituents of her district. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share a few thoughts with you this evening. 
   We have just finished the 37th Annual Legislative Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. 
   I want to delineate between the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Those are two separate entities. So often people confuse those entities, but the Congressional Black Caucus proper is simply an unofficial organization of the 43 CBC members, African American Members who are serving in the Congress who meet from time to time to discuss public policy issues. It is not a foundation; it is simply an informal gathering of Members of Congress. 
   By contrast, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation is a very formal organization. It is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt foundation that has been in existence for many years. I want to start off by making that point abundantly clear. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus is composed of 43 members. We hear that number from time to time. That's a very important number. It has not always been 43 members. The African American representation here in Congress has evolved over the years, and now it is at its highest point in its history; 42 African Americans serve in the House. Of those 42, 40 are full voting Members of the House of Representatives. The other two have the right to vote in committees and in the Committee of the Whole, but not in the full House, because they represent the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. Hopefully one day in the not too distant future even those two Members will have a right to full participation here in the Congress. 
   But having 42 African Americans in the House of Representatives is significant. That is 17 percent of the House of Representatives, at least the Democrats in the House of Representatives come from the Congressional Black Caucus, and so that is very important. 
   So over the years, the Congressional Black Caucus has seen fit to annually produce an annual legislative conference whereby African American leaders from all across the country can come to Washington in fellowship and interact and network with other people across the country, and then we conclude the week by having a gala or an annual dinner. We have just completed the 37th annual conference this past week, and it was a smashing success. 
   I want to thank all of those persons who had a hand in making it happen. KENDRICK MEEK from Miami, Dade County, Florida, is the leader of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. We used to call him a part of the 30-something club, but he has now passed that great 40-year-old mark, but he is still young and energetic and dynamic.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. No, ma'am, I am not. I am a member of the 60-something. 
   But KENDRICK MEEK has led our organization, and we had a very, very good conference last week. I am not going to go into all the details, I am sure my colleague, DONNA CHRISTENSEN, who was also my cochair last week may give you details about it, but it was a wonderful week. 
   We had brain trust on just about every topic that you can imagine. We had a gospel extravaganza, and one of my choirs from North Carolina came to Washington and really, really had a magnificent showing in that extravaganza. Then we had a prayer breakfast. We are very close to prayer in the Congressional Black Caucus, because we know it has been our faith that has brought us thus far along the way. Then we concluded on Saturday night with our gala. I don't know how many thousand people were at that dinner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Yes. There were more, more like 4, 5,000 people in attendance at the dinner, and it was a great success. 
   I want to thank all of those persons who had a hand in making the week the success that it was, particularly Dr. Elsie Scott and the staff of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. 
   You know, Congresswoman, I say in speeches all the time and I will say here on the House floor today, you know, we get credit for a lot of things that we really don't deserve, Members of Congress. We cut the ribbons and take pictures and sit in meetings and engage in unnecessary debate sometimes, but it is the staff that does the heavy lifting and gets the job done. So kudos to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation staff. 
   Let me conclude by saying that since 1868 there has only been 122 African Americans who have served in the United States Congress. That is an actual statistic. Our research shows that 19 African Americans served in the House of Representatives during the Reconstruction. Four of those were  from my district that I now represent, which is the northeastern corner of North Carolina. Eight of those were from South Carolina, which is the district that my good friend, the majority whip of this House, Congressman JIM CLYBURN, represents. But we have only had 122 African Americans to serve in this body. We have come a long way to have 42 African Americans serving in the House and one in the Senate. 
   We have a lot of work to do, and I am going to close by simply saying that we had a good week and a very successful week. I know it's self-serving for me to say this, Congresswoman, but I think it's the best conference that we have had in our 37 years. So many people deserve the credit.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. We had a southern missionary Baptist preacher who came to Washington and delivered a powerful sermon. When I first suggested Dr. Jones' name a few months ago, a few people were skeptical because they had not heard of him before. When they came up with their name, I had not heard of their name before. 
   So I thought it was time to have a southern minister. Dr. Clifford Jones did a wonderful job, as did Rev. William Barber from Goldsboro, North Carolina, who delivered the prayer for the Nation. Dr. Barber is also the State president of the NAACP in North Carolina, and it was just a wonderful occasion. You would have had to have been there to really appreciate it, and hopefully persons who didn't come this year may see fit to come next year.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, three members of the Army National Guard's 1132nd Military Police Company based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, were recently killed in support of our Operation Iraqi Freedom after an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle. 
   Twenty-seven-year old Sergeant David B. ``Blake'' Williams, of Tarboro, North Carolina, was from my district. He was serving a second tour of duty in Iraq, and was recently awarded a second Army Commendation Medal for his exceptional service during combat duty. 
   A few moments ago, Madam Speaker, I spoke to Susan Legett Williams, the mother, and Mary Beth Williams, the sister, to express not only sympathy from the Congress of the United States of America but to express appreciation from a grateful Nation. 
   May God bless the entire Williams family during this difficult time in their lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (JOHN HENRY WOOTEN, SR. POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois, my friend, Danny K. Davis, for yielding this time to me and thank him for his leadership on this great subcommittee. I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, for her leadership and thank her for the kind words that she had to say a few moments ago about Mr. John Henry Wooten. 
   But Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor this great American, John Henry Wooten, Sr. by naming the post office at 3100 Cashwell Drive in Goldsboro, North Carolina, as the John Henry Wooten, Sr. Post Office Building. John Wooten was a dedicated civic leader. He was a county commissioner in the County of Wayne. It is a fitting tribute to name this post office in his honor. 
   John Henry Wooten, Sr. was born and reared in Goldsboro, North Carolina, many years ago. The place that he saw grow from a small farming town to a small city. Mr. Wooten attended Goldsboro public schools, a school system to which he later dedicated his professional life. He received both his bachelor's of science and master's degrees from North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, and he was a doctoral candidate at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. 
   John Henry Wooten, Sr. served the Goldsboro city school system as a science teacher and as a principal at historic Dillard High School. He was a supervisor of instruction and later an assistant superintendent for the entire school system. As a result of his leadership, the lives of countless students were positively impacted. His accomplished career in education also included teaching at Wayne County Community College. During his entire career as an educator, Mr. Wooten was selected by President Lyndon Baines Johnson to serve on the White House Commission for Education. 
   John Henry Wooten served on the Wayne County Board of County Commissioners for 12 years. First elected in 1986, he became the commission's first African American chairman. While serving as commissioner, Mr. Wooten was instrumental in helping Wayne County become the great city that it is today. 
   A lifelong member the First African Missionary Baptist Church in Goldsboro, where incidentally my grandfather was pastor some 90 years ago, he served as chairman of the deacon board, vice chairman of the finance committee, and was also a weekly Sunday school teacher. Additionally, Mr. Wooten served on the board of trustees for North Carolina A&T State University where he served as its secretary and later as vice chairman. He was also president of the university's vast alumni association. 
   Mr. Wooten was married to Ernestine Whitted who, herself, was the product of a substantial Wayne County family. The Wootens were married many years ago in 1946 and were together for more than 60 years. Together, Mr. Speaker, they raised two children, John Henry, Jr. and Pamela. Mr. And Mrs. Wooten have one granddaughter, Nancy Wooten Coor, and two great granddaughters, Alysse and Abrianne. Sadly, Mr. Wooten passed away in January of 2007 after giving his life to his community. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation, including Ms. Foxx, who is managing the time for the minority, for their full and unanimous bipartisan support of this legislation. John Henry Wooten, Sr. was a great man. He was my friend. He was a civic leader. This tribute is long overdue. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 3803.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), for yielding me this time and thank him for his leadership as chairman of the Health Subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, the subject of public health remains a top priority for rural America, including my home district of eastern North Carolina, the First Congressional District. Health has been an issue that has not always included the topic of disparities and the lack of access for minority communities and low-income communities. But under the leadership of this chairman, I am confident that we are now going in another direction and we are going to confront head on the issue of disparities. I want to thank the chairman and the committee for making the decision to go in that direction. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor today to address the subject of medications that are intended to combat tropical diseases and their access to the developing world. My desire, Mr. Speaker, is for the House to further cooperate and work with the other Chamber in search of a solution to the tropical disease epidemic facing the developing world. These diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria and tuberculosis, continue to inflict millions of impoverished people because of the lack of medicines. In addition to perpetuating extreme poverty, these diseases also prevent millions of people from working and participating in family or community life. So as we discuss  this very important issue, I would like for us to also consider the issue of tropical disease-combating medications in developing countries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, JOHN LEWIS, for introducing this resolution. I thank the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for allowing time for me to speak today. 
   Madam Speaker, Dr. King was a visionary leader. He understood that America could never be a moral leader in the world when citizens within its own borders were treated legally as second-class citizens. I recall so vividly attending a standing-room only speech that Dr. King gave at the Booker T. Washington High School gymnasium in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, on November 27, 1962. 
   Dr. King's speech included the ``I Have a Dream'' passage that he used in the historic march-on-Washington speech the following year. After the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we were having difficulty in the south persuading black voters that it was really uncomplicated to register the vote. The act had removed the literacy test, and the process was easier. But black citizens were reluctant to step forward to register to vote for fear of intimidation and reprisal. At the urging of local leaders in my community, Dr. King accepted our invitation to lead a voter registration march on April 4, 1968. 
   But as fate would have it, he canceled his promised trip to our community so that he could go to Memphis to assist the garbage workers of that city, and we know the rest. Despite the absence of Dr. King from the registration march, we launched a massive voter registration drive and later filed and won a voting rights lawsuit in my district resulting in electoral opportunities. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, we have 301 elected black officials in my congressional district. In addition to having an African American Member of this body in the first district, African Americans hold the following office: 48 county commissioners, 7 sheriffs, 20 mayors, 129 municipal officials, 5 at our General Assembly, 6 superior court judges, 9 district court judges, 69 on boards of education, 4 registrars of deeds and 3 clerks of court. 
   Madam Speaker, much of this electoral progress that we have made in the South can be directly attributable to the life and work of Martin Luther King, Jr.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I am proud of the Democratic majority for its boldness in bringing this Energy Bill to the House floor on this Saturday morning. 
   You know, 20 years ago it was the academics that were talking about energy independence and climate change. Today, it is a  conversation all across America and the American people are expecting us to do something about it. 
   This Energy Bill is not a perfect bill but it is a responsible piece of legislation. It represents the views of competing interests and it begins us on that long road to energy independence. 
   My State of North Carolina is eager to be part of developing solutions. We have lost over 100,000 textile jobs since 1997. This legislation will usher in significant job creation that will replace some of the lost jobs. Microcell Corporation is a hydrogen fuel cell company in my district that's made a giant leap and is now ready to produce their cells on a large scale. With this breakthrough, over 1,000 good paying jobs will be created in this rural district. 
   I am proud to tell you that our State legislature has enacted an ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard that is reasonably related to our ability to reach energy independence. Other states have done the same thing and others will do so as we move in this new direction. 
   Finally, I am proud to be a part of an effort to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the research and development of Cellulosic Ethanol for transportation fuels. These institutions have wanted to be part of developing ethanol from biomass but they have not had the opportunity. 
   This bill makes $50 million available for minority serving institutions to engage in this research on a competitive basis. I introduced this concept to the Energy and Commerce Committee and I am proud that we finally reached a bipartisan agreement to include this language in the final bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will consider a Democratic budget that will strengthen our economy and make America safer. After years of devastating cuts by the Bush administration, our budget is fiscally responsible, while also ensuring that we invest in the American people's priorities. 
   At a time of economic uncertainty, the Democratic budget rejects President Bush's cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, while also adding $4.9 billion for veterans health care. 
   Despite the President's repeated vetoes of our legislation to ensure that 10 million children have access to health care, our budget accommodates the $50 billion that would be needed over the next 5 years to make this goal a reality. We're still hopeful that enough Republicans will join us in overriding the President's ill-advised and noncompassionate veto. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget is able to address all of the health care needs while balancing the budget by 2012 without raising taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY FEE EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill we are considering on the House floor today, which is Senate 781, the Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act, is identical to H.R. 2601, which was introduced by my friend Mr. Stearns, the former ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. 
   On December 11 of last year, the House passed H.R. 2601 by voice vote, and I urge similar swift passage of S. 781 today. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill extends the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to collect the fees that administer and enforce the provisions relating to the national do-not-call registry. In 2003, Congress passed the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, which authorized the FTC to establish feessufficient to implement the national do-not-call registry as originally authorized by the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994. As has been said on numerous occasions, this initiative has proven to be one of the most popular laws in history. Consumers have registered more than 145 million telephone numbers since the registry became operational in 2003. The FTC's authority to annually establish the appropriate level of fees to charge telemarketers for access to the registry expired several months ago, in 2007, and S. 781 restores that authority and renders it permanent. I will restate what I said back in December when we considered this legislation on the House floor. As Members of Congress, it is in our best interest to swiftly pass this bill in order to avoid the wrath of millions of angry constituents who are being called by telemarketers during dinner time. We need to facilitate the continuing operation of the do-not-call registry and vote for this bill. 
   As a result of an agreement reached with the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, we are sending to the President's desk for his signature the Senate-passed version of the bill introduced by Senator Pryor. However, Senator Pryor's bill is identical to Mr. Stearns' bill, and my friend from Florida deserves all the credit for this fine piece of legislation. As is the case with the vast majority of bills passed out of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, of which I serve, this is a bipartisan measure that was crafted in consultation with the appropriate agency of expertise, in this case, the Federal Trade Commission. The original House bill passed the subcommittee by voice vote on October 23, and a week later on October 30 was unanimously approved in the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Majority and minority committee staff worked together on this bill. I am so proud of how they worked together. Mr. Stearns, as well as the ranking member, Mr. Barton of Texas, who is the ranking member of the full committee, should both be commended for their cooperation with Chairman JOHN DINGELL and Chairman BOBBY RUSH. I also would like to congratulate and welcome the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) as the new ranking member of the subcommittee on which we serve. I am positive that the track record of bipartisan cooperation will continue under Mr. Whitfield's leadership. Unfortunately, it is my understanding that Mr. Whitfield, I looked forward to seeing him on the floor today, but he is currently in Kentucky dealing with the frightening devastation wrought by last night's tornadoes. Our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his constituents and all those who were adversely affected by this tragedy, not only in that State but in other States as well.  
   With that, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (VOTING RIGHTS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the delegate from the District of Columbia for giving me this time this evening to speak on this most important subject. I have watched Eleanor Holmes Norton since I have been in the Congress, and she has worked so tirelessly on behalf of the people of the District of Columbia to get full voting rights, and I want to thank her for her passion and thank her for her work in this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, many people who now call the District of Columbia home have established themselves here by way of my home State of North Carolina and by way of our neighboring State of South Carolina. As the delegate said a few minutes ago, even her family originated in Halifax County, North Carolina, which is in my Congressional District. 
   Many DC residents are my schoolmates from eastern North Carolina. In coming to Washington, DC, they left parents, and they left grandparents behind who had endured blatant discrimination in public accommodations and discrimination at the ballot box. Many of them could not vote because of the literacy test, and others refused to register to vote because of voter intimidation. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the descendants of these individuals living in Washington, DC, are again denied the right to vote and the right to have voting representation in Congress. 
   What a disgrace. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights, but it is one that has been systematically denied for as long as it has been assured. Until 1919, women did not have the right to vote. African Americans gained the right to vote for the first time in 1868, and then lost that right in 1900. It was the Voting Rights Act that restored the effective right to vote in 1965. 
   Mr. Speaker, each time the right to vote has been oppressed, good people, good people, have stood up and stood strong to ensure that right, because it forms the foundation of our ideals of governance. 
   Today, we again have the opportunity to expand the right to vote and to ensure that the people being governed in the District of Columbia, who pay taxes and who fight in our wars, have a voice in their government. 
   Rarely does an issue come before this body which goes right to the heart of our values as Americans. The right to vote is a simple and straightforward idea that embodies some of our most beloved founding principles, the idea that all men, all people, are created equal, and that we establish our government by the consent of the governed. When we fail to address inequalities such as these, we fail ourselves as a people and as a nation and we fail to honor the sacrifices of the many people before us who wanted to ensure basic rights to all Americans. 
   As the Delegate so ably said a few moments ago, this is not a Democratic issue nor a Republican issue. This is an American problem that must be resolved and resolved in this session of the Congress. 
   The strength of our great Nation lies within its citizens, and the power of its citizens relies upon the equal access to the franchise. These opportunities include our many freedoms, especially the right to have a strong and clear voice in choosing elected leaders. As the Constitution commands, we must extend the rights of citizenship to every, every, citizen of this land, including the citizens of Washington, DC. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation that has been introduced by the Delegate, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairmen DINGELL, RANGEL, PALLONE and STARK for their bold leadership in bringing this legislation to the House floor. As Congressman for the 15th poorest district in the Nation, a district where 50 percent of the children qualify for SCHIP, I enthusiastically support passage. 
   The CHAMP Act of 2007 reflects what should be our Nation's priorities. It is the duty of Congress to keep the promise of our Constitution, to provide for the general welfare of our people. What better way, Mr. Speaker, to keep that promise than to guarantee that our children are afforded adequate health insurance. 
   The sad fact is that a majority of uninsured children are minority, including 1.4 million black children and 3.4 million Hispanic children. In my State of North Carolina, 195,000 children are eligible but not enrolled in the program. We have a moral obligation to ensure all children who are unable to afford insurance have that insurance. To do less would be shameful. 
   Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by thanking the gentleman for giving me this time and also expressing disappointment with my Republican friends who have engaged in nothing but obstructionism and filibuster as we have struggled to bring this legislation to the floor. 
   You insisted on reading a 495-page bill, consuming 18 hours of our committee time. You have made your adjournment motions this week, and you have wrongfully suggested that we want to insure illegal aliens. That's wrong. And then you accuse us of taking Medicare benefits from our seniors; and then you use that worn out phrase, ``tax increase''. 
   The American people have figured it out. You are doing every conceivable thing to prevent giving insurance coverage to 5 million children of the working poor. 
   My friends, you are wrong.

   Madam Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to express my unconditional support for H. Con. Res. 63. I also come to the floor this evening to thank the leadership, to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and the majority leader, and Chairman IKE SKELTON for their leadership on this issue, and thank them very much for scheduling this debate. I am confident that the American people are also appreciative of this debate. 
   Madam Speaker, 4 years ago, shortly before I was elected to this body, the President of the United States convinced this Congress that dictator Saddam Hussein had in his possession weapons of mass destruction, and that he was prepared to use those weapons against our country. The world now knows that he was wrong, and history will decide whether that intelligence was manipulated or whether it was an honest mistake. 
   But this evening, Madam Speaker, the invasion we all know, happened. We captured Baghdad, and we arrested Saddam Hussein, and he has now been convicted and executed. But the search for weapons of mass destruction revealed that there were no weapons whatsoever. 
   Our aim then turned to helping the Iraqi people create a democratic government with free and fair elections, a constitution was ratified, and elected representatives are now making decisions on what is best for their country. The Iraqi Government has a security force in place, and we are assisting in training them to defend their country. 
   In 4 years of fighting the brave men and women of our Armed Forces have accomplished every mission put before them. They have performed admirably and completed all that is possible militarily possible in Iraq. There is an intractable problem on the ground in Iraq. The tensions between the sectarian groups are centuries old. We all know that, and our continued presence is exacerbating those tensions. It is no longer a military problem, but a political problem best resolved through diplomacy. 
   It is clear, Madam Speaker, that a continued open-ended military action is not in the best interest of our country. It is not in the best interest of the Iraqi people or the citizens of the Persian Gulf region. We have reached the point where we need to turn Iraq over to the Iraqis. Iraqis know that, so that the Iraqis will know that the U.S. is not an occupying force. 
   Since the invasion we have lost 3,000 lives. We have heard that for the last 2 days. And so many of those injuries are permanent. The financial cost of this war exceeds $400 billion. The President is now seeking another $245 billion to finance the war over the next 18 months. 
   Madam Speaker, if those funds were invested in rural America, there is no question that we would improve thousands of lives in our own country. 
   Our military and their families are tremendously strained. Some troops are on their fourth and fifth deployments. Military personnel costs are skyrocketing. Further strains on our Armed Forces will leave this country unprepared for a wide range of threats that now exist. At a cost to the American taxpayer of nearly $2 billion a week, we simply will not have the resources needed to prepare for the wide variety of future threats that our country may have to face and for our domestic needs at home. 
   America has a problem and we must fix it. This debate this evening is the first step in a new direction. Our goals in Iraq have been accomplished, and it is now time to begin bringing our troops home. Now is not the time for escalation. Surges have not helped before, and they will not help now. 
   The time has come to redeploy and reset our force to begin addressing our other challenges around the world and give us an opportunity to repair our relationships with our allies and refocus on the war on terror.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3461, the Safeguarding America's Families by Enhancing and Reorganizing New and Efficient Technologies Act of 2007, or the SAFER NET Act as we refer to it, was introduced by Congresswoman MELISSA BEAN from Illinois. The bill, Mr. Speaker, has 41 cosponsors, and it was reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee with unanimous, bipartisan support just 2 weeks ago, I believe it was, on October 30. As a member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, I want to thank the gentlelady for her ongoing and tireless efforts to protect children from the lurking dangers on the Internet. 
   Earlier this year, the distinguished gentlewoman (Ms. Bean) introduced H. Res. 455, which was a resolution supporting the goals of National Internet Safety Month, which passed the House on June 12. As such, the bill on the floor today is a quality legislative extension of her previous work on Internet safety. 
   H.R. 3461, the SAFER NET Act, directs the Federal Trade Commission to carry out a nationwide public awareness campaign about Internet safety and directs the Commission to annually report to Congress on its activity to promote Internet safety. The bill, as amended, authorizes $5 million for 1 year to carry out this public awareness campaign. 
   Currently, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Trade Commission is engaged in numerous activities to promote awareness and on-line safety habits. The Commission has established a toll-free number which serves as a help line where consumers can file their complaints. Moreover, the FTC has set up a very special Web site, www.OnGuardOnline.gov, that is all one word, to provide tips to consumers in protecting themselves and their children from Internet fraud. 
   Lastly, the Federal Trade Commission is engaged in a public awareness campaign to promote Internet safety through a child friendly mascot named Dewie the Turtle, much the same way that Smokey the Bear successfully promoted the prevention of forest fires many years ago. The office responsible for managing these initiatives is the Division of Consumer and Business Education. And Congresswoman Bean's bill will aid the FTC in its laudable efforts to protect children from inappropriate content and from the predators that would do them harm. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Internet is one of the most significant technological developments in the history of humankind, and my friend, Mr. Markey, who spoke just moments before me, made that point in a profound way. The way people obtain information and communicate with each other has been completely revolutionized in a manner unthinkable just 20 years ago. However, with this great revolution comes a price. Our children are now more vulnerable to the despicable creatures that would prey on them by exploiting the powers of the Internet. It is, therefore, imperative that we in Congress do everything we can to fulfill our duties to promote healthy and safe environments for our children. The SAFER NET Act is a quality step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation and pass the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I retain the balance of my time.

Earlier this year when this Democratic Congress and the American  people voiced their overwhelming opposition to President Bush's troop escalation plan, our Republican colleagues said, ``Give the President time.'' 
   The problem is, both the Republican Congress and the Bush administration have been moving the time frame for success on the troop escalation plan. First it was June. Then it was August. Finally, a couple of months ago, Republican leaders agreed that September would be the defining month. 
   It is clear that President Bush has no intention of ending the troop escalation in Iraq, even though the Iraqi Government has failed to meet the benchmarks that he himself outlined earlier this year. President Bush is determined to leave as many troops in Iraq as possible, no matter what the facts suggest. 
   The question now is, will Congressional Republicans finally break away from the President and do what is right for this Nation and for the military? Congressional Republicans must realize that the time has come to change course.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DOCK M. BROWN POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia for her friendship  and thank her for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to very briefly comment on H.R. 4210. This is a bill that I introduced to name the post office located at 401 Washington Avenue in Weldon, North Carolina, after a very dear friend of many, many years, Mr. Dock M. Brown. 
   We are seeking to name this post office as the Dock M. Brown Post Office Building. Dock Brown, Mr. Speaker, has been a friend and supporter for many years. He is a pillar of leadership in the Halifax County community and throughout our congressional district. And I might say parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, that the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia also has roots in Halifax County, North Carolina, and it is just ironic that she happens to be on the floor at this very moment. 
   Mr. Speaker, Dock Brown was born on January 30, 1929, in Halifax County to a wonderful couple, Nelson and Vilvie Brown. Dock Brown's father, as was my father, was a veteran of World War I. Dock would soon follow in his father's footsteps by also serving our country as a sergeant in the United States Army. 
   Mr. Brown graduated from J.A. Chaloner High School in 1948 and entered historic Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, that fall. In 1951, just 1 year before he was to graduate from that institution, Dock Brown was drafted into the United States Army and was given orders to fight in the Korean War. 
   Dock Brown served 12 long months in Korea before returning to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, his native home State, to serve out the remainder of his tour. Immediately after his discharge, Dock Brown resumed his education at Shaw University, where he received his undergraduate degree in history. 
   To fulfill his dream of becoming a school teacher, Dock attended another great institution, which was my alma mater, North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina, where he received a master's degree in sociology and school administration. 
   Dock Brown is an extraordinary educator. He taught history at Weldon High School and Eastman High School for 24 years and served as principal of Pittman High School for 10 years. His positive impact on the youth in Halifax County cannot be measured. He touched so many young lives, and it was Dock Brown's encouragement that has served as a catalyst and foundation that propelled many of those young people to grow into well-established, productive, progressive citizens. 
   Dock Brown also served as an appointed official in Halifax County. He served on the County Board of Health. And for 19 years he served on the Board of Mental Health, where he served as chairman for the last 4 years of his tenure. He was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the State Mental Health Association for his tireless dedication to the issue of mental health. 
   He served 7 years as a trustee at Elizabeth City State University and 2 years as an appointee to the Governor's Commission to evaluate superior court judges. 
   Mr. Speaker, Dock Brown has also served, as we do, as an elected official. For 8 years he served as a county commissioner in Halifax County; 2 years in the North Carolina House of Representatives, representing District 7; 8 years as a commissioner on the Weldon Town Board. 
   For his untiring service to the State of North Carolina, Dock Brown was awarded the Order of the Long Leaf Pine by then Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. This is the highest civilian honor granted to a citizen in North Carolina. 
   Religion has played a major part in the life of Dock Brown. He has been an active member of the First Baptist Church in Roanoke Rapids since the age of 11, where he served in many capacities including that of ordained deacon for more than 50 years. 
   He has been married to his devoted wife, Helen Brooks Brown, for 54 years. Together they have reared two children: Dock Brown, Jr. and Ivy Brown Singlton. Ivy is married to Lieutenant Colonel Terance Singlton, II, who proudly serves us in the United States Army. 
   I am so proud, Mr. Speaker, to have authored this legislation to honor this individual. Dock Brown has dedicated his entire life to serving others and has touched entire generations of young people. 
   This legislation has the entire support, bipartisan support, of my delegation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4210.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to express my strong support for S. 2484, a bill to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. I am proud to lend my support to a bill aimed at honoring such a compassionate and wonderful human being. 
   Often we miss out on the opportunity to honor people while they are with us. Today, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join with me in seizing the moment and commemorating Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless advocate for children. While Eunice Kennedy Shriver is perhaps best known for her efforts on behalf of those affected by mental retardation and for the creation of the Special Olympics, she has also been a leader on many other fronts. In particular, it is wholly appropriate that we name the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development after Eunice Kennedy Shriver, as she was instrumental in establishing the institute just over 45 years ago during the administration of her brother, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
   In the nearly half a century since its founding, the institute has helped make great strides in the advancement of child health and human development, including dramatically reducing sudden infant death syndrome and infant mortality. 
   One of the goals of the institute is to ensure that children have the opportunity to reach their full potential and live healthy and productive lives. Her commitment and dedication to helping children meet these goals has been unwavering. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is important that we, before it is too late, that we honor this great American, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, today by renaming the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development after her. I support this good bill and urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, this week Congress will vote on an emergency war spending conference report that fully funds the war and our troops, and yet the President is still threatening a veto. The President's problem with the bill is Congress' strong message that we are not going to allow the war to go on indefinitely. 
   In years past, the President has dealt with Republican-controlled Congresses, which simply rubber-stamped his requests, despite countless mistakes in Iraq. Last November, the American people demanded a change. 
   Last month the Congress acted and brought a serious change to our policy in Iraq. We demanded that the Iraqi Government meet the political and economic benchmarks that the President himself outlined earlier this year and set timelines for withdrawal if those benchmarks are not met. 
   Defense Secretary Gates himself, last week, said that the timelines we passed here in Congress and the pressure that our legislation exerts on the Iraqi Government is having a positive impact. Our legislation is already impacting the events in Iraq. The President should allow this to continue by reconsidering his threat to veto the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, last week, congressional Democrats accomplished something the Republican ``do-nothing'' Congress could not do. We passed a final budget through both the House and Senate. 
   Over 3 of the last 5 years, the Republican-led Congress failed to reach agreement on a final budget resolution, leading to unparalleled deficit spending. Unlike our Republican predecessors, this new Democratic Congress has produced a fiscally responsible budget that serves as a blueprint for investing in America's priorities, providing tax cuts to middle-class families, and balances the budget in just 5 years without raising taxes. Not even the President's proposed budget comes out of the red after 5 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, budgets serve as a blueprint of a Congress' priorities. Our final budget strengthens our military readiness and invests in our troops and veterans. It also spurs innovation to boost our economy and expands investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce global warming and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. 
   Democrats vowed to run this Congress differently, and we have, by producing a final budget agreement.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress was elected to take our Nation in a new direction. We have worked to make meaningful changes for American families by passing fiscally responsible appropriations bills that fund priorities here at home, priorities neglected by the President and the previous Congresses. But every step of the way, President Bush has stood as a roadblock to the progress Americans demanded. 
   For example, House Democrats worked in a bipartisan way to pass legislation authorizing the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, but the President used his veto pen to say ``no'' to providing health care to 10 million children. We passed the vital infrastructure bill, known as WRDA, which authorizes critical projects to protect communities across the country from natural disasters. The President again said ``no.'' But, fortunately, our Republican colleagues joined us in overriding the veto. 
   Mr. Speaker, now President ``No'' has vetoed yet another important bill that invests in labor, health, and education priorities for our country. It is again time for House Republicans to stand with us in supporting this bipartisan legislation opposing yet another veto.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I too rise this evening to honor the life and work of my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, who has passed from labor to reward. 
   Juanita was a warm and caring individual. She worked very hard in this body to improve quality of life for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 and I congratulate the Committee on providing a bill that includes needed and critical reforms that improve access to food and nutrition, provide more equitable access to research funding and renew America's commitment to conservation. 
   This bill correctly focuses on the people who need the most help. In fact, nearly three-quarters of the bill will be directed to nutrition programs that will assist 38 million American families afford healthy food. It updates that Food Stamp program and increases funding for food banks, food pantries and soup kitchens. 
   I am particularly encouraged that the bill increases agricultural research funding for Historically Black Colleges. This is important because minority institutions are usually left out when it comes to Federal research funding. As an example, I point to a Government Accountability Office study conducted in 2003 which indicated that 1890 Land Grant institutions received less than 2 percent of the competitive funding available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This bill represents a step in the right direction. 
   The bill also provides for mandatory funding of the 2501 Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Outreach Program. This should  help to slow the troubling trend of significant land loss by African American and other socially disadvantaged producers. 
   Additionally, the bill significantly boosts spending for conservation programs to reduce soil erosion, enhance water supplies, improve water and air quality, increase wildlife habitat and reduce damage caused by floods and other natural disasters. 
   Of particular interest to my home State of North Carolina, fruit and vegetable producers will have their own place in the Farm Bill for the first time. The bill includes more than $1.3 billion to support research, pest management, trade promotion and nutrition for the industry. 
   Also of interest to North Carolina, this bill takes another important step in moving biofuels beyond focusing on corn. It reduces the current tax credit for corn-based ethanol by 6 cents per gallon and creates a new tax credit to promote the production of cellulosic biofuels. 
   While the Farm Bill may not be perfect, the good far outweighs any shortcomings.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, for years, President Bush has prioritized the needs of the wealthiest few while taking us deep into debt and into an economic recession. In the meantime, most Americans have been forgotten. That is, until the Democrats took control of Congress last year. 
   We were the first to recognize that our economy was headed for a recession and pushed the President to join us in passing the economic stimulus package that provided assistance to middle-income Americans. While that was a good start, we know that more needs to be done to help those who are not prospering under this Bush economy. That is why we extended unemployment insurance for the growing number of Americans looking for work and why we tackled the housing foreclosure crisis, so that millions of Americans can keep their homes. We also support a second economic stimulus plan that invests in America, rather than in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are serious about working in a bipartisan fashion to turn this economy around, and the best way to do that is to prioritize the needs of hardworking, middle-class Americans.

   I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Mahoney. Mr. Chairman, I represent the First District of North Carolina, which is the 15th poorest district in our country. One of the towns in my district is called Henderson, North Carolina. Last year, this town was one of three, one of three towns across the country, to receive the HOPE VI Main Street grant that this bill attempts to remove. 
   As we all know, HOPE VI Main Street grants seek to revitalize and rejuvenate older downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character. The purpose of this program is to provide assistance to smaller communities in the development of affordable housing and the revitalization and reconfiguration of obsolete commercial offices or buildings into sustainable and affordable housing. 
   Mr. Chairman, towns like Henderson need these grants. We need these grants to reinvigorate the communities and to spur outside commercial investment. The point is, in closing, that HOPE VI Main Street grants are needed for rural America. 
   I want to thank Mr. Mahoney for his leadership and passion and thank him for bringing forth this amendment.

   For 6 years under Republican leadership, Congress has failed to enact a comprehensive energy strategy needed to help stabilize the price of gas and make America more energy independent. Under the Republican leadership, energy policy was little more than corporate welfare, handing over billions of dollars in tax breaks to oil companies and gas companies experiencing record profits. As a result of those policies, American families are paying a higher price every time they go to the pump. 
   Under the new leadership, this House has already supported a rollback of those multi-billion dollar taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies so that we can invest in efficiency and renewable forms of energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to help the working families struggle to pay the prices at the pump. We must bring down prices and make America energy independent. With a comprehensive energy policy we can and should and will accomplish this goal.

Maugans, the first soldier from Kansas to lose his life in Operation Enduring Freedom. That's the war in Afghanistan. 
   H.R. 5135 enjoys the support of the entire congressional delegation from the State of Kansas and was introduced by my colleague, Representative TODD TIAHRT, on January 23, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, and was passed by voice vote. 
   H.R. 5135 calls for honoring Sergeant Maugans' service to our country by designating the post office in his home town of Derby, Kansas, as the Sergeant Maugans Post Office Building. 
   A graduate of Derby High School and a former student of the University of Kansas and Cowley County Community College, Sergeant Maugans served diligently as a member of the armed services since 1997. 
   Sergeant Maugans was an ordnance disposal specialist and stationed in San Diego, California, before being deployed to Afghanistan in the fall of 2001. On April 15, 2002, while deposing of ordnances near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans was killed along with three other soldiers in his unit when rockets which he was attempting to dismantle exploded.

   Super Bowl XLII and the perseverance of the New York Giants to become only the second team in football history to go from NFC wild card contender to NFL champion will undoubtedly go down in the record books. 
   For this accomplishment, we stand to commend the New York Giants franchise, players, coaches, and all of the supportive fans from across the world on a job well done. I urge the passage of this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to join my colleagues today in the consideration of H.R. 3468, which seeks to name a postal facility on the campus of Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, after a great American, Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr. Mr. Speaker, this bill has the support of the entire North Carolina delegation. 
   Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr., was born in Washington County, North Carolina, a very rural part of my congressional district. He and his family relocated to Virginia, and Dr. Jones spent his formative years in Hampton. Later he attended Lutheran College in Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1923, Dr. Jones received a Bachelor of Science degree from the great Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Dr. Jones earned a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1927 from the historic Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after being awarded his dental degree, Dr. Jones began his professional life in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where he practiced general dentistry for 66 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud to sponsor this legislation because my father and Dr. Jones were very close friends. They were classmates at Shaw. They were classmates at Meharry, and they fought together in World War I and spent their lifetimes in service to their community. 
   Dr. Jones participated in many local and community activities in Elizabeth City. He was one of the first African Americans to run for the city council in Elizabeth City in 1957 and was defeated by only 28 votes. Later, in the 1960s, Dr. Jones was appointed to serve on the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County School Board. He served as a deacon at the Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church in Elizabeth City, and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of the Albemarle. He was a proud trustee emeritus of Elizabeth City State University. 
   As I said a moment ago, a veteran of World War I, he was a member of American Legion Post 223. 
   Dr. Jones was a member, as was my father, of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, and was a 32-degree Mason. 
   Dr. Jones was a member of numerous professional organizations that included the Eastern North Carolina Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Society, and the North Carolina Dental Society, among others. 
   Dr. Jones was the recipient of several awards and honors throughout his professional career. He received the Meharry Medical College President's Award for Service to Mankind. I accompanied Dr. Jones and my father back to Meharry for their 50th reunion in 1977. It was a great occasion. 
   Twice Dr. Jones was awarded the Delta Iota Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity's Certificate of Honor, and I'm sure the Speaker would take great pride in that, as the Speaker of the House today, the acting Speaker, is an Omega, for exceptional service to the citizens of northeastern North Carolina in the field of dentistry. 
   He was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the City Council of Elizabeth City for his invaluable services on the city's human relations committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (JAMAL RASHARD ADDISON POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4203, as amended, which names a postal facility in Lithonia, Georgia, after Army Specialist Jamaal Addison, the first soldier from Georgia to lose his life while serving in Iraq. 
   H.R. 4203, which has the support of the entire congressional delegation from the State of Georgia, was introduced by my friend, Representative Henry ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr., of the State of Georgia on November 15, 2007, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee by voice vote on January 29, 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, the measure before us pays tribute to the life and service of Army Specialist Jamaal RaShard Addison by renaming the post office in his hometown of Lithonia, Georgia, after him. 
   A brave member of the 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company in Fort Bliss, Texas, Army Specialist Jamaal Addison died, unfortunately, on March 23, 2003, as a result of an enemy ambush near Nasiriyah, Iraq. Army Specialist Jamaal Addison was born on October 7, 1980, in the very town of Lithonia and spent his entire childhood there until enlisting in the United States Army in March of 2000. 
   As we pay tribute to this heroic American citizen, let's also take a moment and recollect on the thousands of men and women in uniform currently serving abroad in order to protect us here at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all proudly commemorate both the life and unfortunate death of Army Specialist Jamaal Addison by passing H.R. 4203. I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) for bringing forth this legislation and getting the entire delegation to support it. 
   At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in consideration of H. Con. Res. 281, which celebrates the birth of Abraham Lincoln and recognizes the prominence the Declaration  of Independence played in the development of Lincoln's beliefs. 
   H. Con. Res. 281 enjoys the support and cosponsorship of 54 Members of Congress and was introduced by Representative DONALD MANZULLO of Illinois on January 23, 2008. A similar measure, Mr. Speaker, S. Con. Res. 65, has been sponsored by our friend, Senator RICHARD DURBIN. 
   As we honor Abraham Lincoln, it is important to note that the United States Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission was established by this Congress in 2000 to plan the national observance of the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth in 2009. 
   The mission of the commission is to commemorate the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln, emphasizing the contribution of his thoughts and his ideals to America and to the world and serving as a catalyst for strengthening freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity for all. 
   The commission, which is co-chaired by Senator RICHARD DURBIN and Representative RAY LAHOOD, is focused on informing the public about the impact Abraham Lincoln had on the development of our Nation and finding the best possible ways to honor his accomplishments. 
   The commission states: ``During the gravest crisis in American history, Lincoln preserved the Union, led the effort to eradicate slavery, and articulated the best aspirations of American democracy. We propose recalling these accomplishments in ways that will enlighten and inspire us both today and tomorrow. Remembering our past, we can better light the way to our future.'' 
   For the next 2 years, there are numerous events scheduled to commemorate Abraham Lincoln. They include a rededication of the Lincoln Memorial here in Washington, DC, in 2009, citizenship ceremonies at Lincoln sites throughout that year, a redesigned 2009 penny series and $5 bill series, a 2009 bicentennial commemorative dollar coin and commemorative stamps. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me and also thank him for his leadership as the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   I also want to thank the Democratic leadership for bringing this bold and visionary legislation to the House floor today. I also want to thank my Republican friends who are willing to vote with us on this important measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I represent the 15th poorest district in the United States of America. Thirty percent of the children in my congressional district live below the poverty level. So this is not an academic discussion; that is real serious business for the people of my district in North Carolina. 
   So I ask my friends and colleagues today to listen to this debate. Don't let it just go over your head. But if you would please listen to this debate, listen to the plea of the children of America, and please consider voting for this very important legislation. The children of my district, the children of America need you.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUTTERFIELD. (DEMOCRATS TRIED TO CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ BUT PRESIDENT BUSH REJECTED THAT CHANGE OF COURSE -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush had a chance to change the direction of the war in Iraq, but he rejected it. He rejected a plan that would finally hold the Iraqi Government accountable for meeting the benchmarks that he laid out earlier this year. 
   According to the nonpartisan Brookings Institute, the Iraqi Government is failing to meet the political benchmarks they were supposed to make. By vetoing the bill, the President was condoning such inaction. 
   The President claims the situation is getting better in Iraq. Wrong. April was the deadliest month of the year and one of the deadliest of the entire war. 
   Retired General William Odom said last week, and I'm quoting, ``No effective strategy can be devised for the United States until it begins withdrawing its forces from Iraq. Only that step will break the paralysis that now confronts us.'' 
   General Odom is correct. Today our troops are serving as referees in a deadly civil war that shows no end in sight. This Congress offered the President a dramatic change, and he rejected it. We're not going to give up, because ending this war is simply too important.
