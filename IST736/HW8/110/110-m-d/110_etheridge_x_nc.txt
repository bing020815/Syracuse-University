<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support for this needed economic stimulus legislation. This bipartisan bill will provide timely, targeted and temporary relief to American families suffering from the national economic downturn and provide a shot in the arm to boost growth and avert a recession. 
   I commend Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader John Boehner, Treasury Secretary Harry Paulson for working together across party lines to find common ground. As North Carolina's only member of the Democratic Majority on the House Budget Committee, I have been working on a bipartisan basis to pass responsible legislation to respond to worsening economic conditions. High energy prices, mounting national debt, the crisis in the Nation's housing market and rising unemployment levels have prompted calls for emergency legislation to arrest the decline in the  economy and put us back on a path of sustainable growth. 
   First, this economic trouble serves as a reminder of the importance of putting our Nation's fiscal house in order to free America's future generations from the crushing debt burden they now face. Unfortunately, the record of this current Administration is the transformation of record budget surplus projections into record national debt and massive annual deficits without end. Although short-term deficits can be useful to correct hurtful economic downswings, the current structural budget problems featuring perpetual debt and deficits hamstring our ability to invest in the future and build broad-based prosperity for hard-working Americans. 
   This economic stimulus package will be effective because it is targeted, timely and temporary. It will be targeted to families that need the money and can be expected to spend it quickly on necessities like food and clothing. It will be timely to yield the economic benefits within the timeframe of the anticipated problem. And it will be temporary to prevent exacerbation of the fiscal imbalance and make our economic problems worse. 
   Specifically, H.R. 5140 will provide tax rebate checks to working people of up to $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for families, as well as a $300 tax credit per dependent child. This immediate infusion of cash will provide real relief to North Carolinians struggling to pay their bills. Economic experts tell us this action will help stimulate consumer spending and spur economic growth across the board to mitigate the slowdown we are otherwise experiencing in the economy. Tax incentives to encourage business investment and help small business weather this economic storm should also be included in a responsible package. I understand Governor Easley and others have raised concerns about the impact of some of the business tax provisions in this bill. At today's Budget Committee hearing, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers suggested slight revisions to these provisions to minimize any negative impact, and I support modifications that will achieve that goal as the process moves forward. I am hopeful the House will pass this bill today and Congress can get a final version to the President to sign into law within the next few weeks. 
   Over the longer term, Congress must invest in neglected priorities like school construction to put workers back on the job and improve our communities with better schools and healthier learning environments. We must take better care of our military families and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must expand quality health care so working families no longer face economic ruin when a loved one gets sick. And we must continue to support our first responders to keep our communities safe and secure. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support for this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte in bringing the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act to the House floor for consideration. 
   During 3 days of hearings this month, expert after expert told the Ag Committee that at least part of the spike in energy prices could be caused by excessive speculation in energy futures trading. We owe it to the American consumer to ensure that gas prices are reflective of true market value and are not being artificially inflated by investors trying to make an easy quick buck. We cannot allow excessive speculation on Wall Street to cause folks to suffer on Main Street. That is why, as the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I worked with Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte to write today's bill. 
   This legislation will give the CFTC additional tools and authority to keep our markets free of manipulation and  excessive speculation. We wrote the bill very carefully to ensure that it would not affect proper market activity. We are simply giving the CFTC the tools to do the job the American consumers entrusted it to do, to weed out improper or illegal market activity. 
   Since 2000, volume on commodity markets has increased six-fold; but staffing levels at the CFTC have fallen to the lowest level in the agency's 33-year history. Right now we need more cops on the beat. The bill will require CFTC to hire the 100 additional staff people it needs to effectively monitor the futures industry, including our energy markets. 
   Currently the CFTC is investigating whether market manipulation has occurred in energy markets. One firm has already been charged, but the commission needs additional staff to carry out this investigation, and the rest of its duties. 
   Additionally, the bill will require greater transparency and disclosure from investors. A little sunshine goes a long way to scaring off bad actors. We also close the London loophole, and toughen position limits and the hedge exemption. 
   Today's bill is not a cure-all for our energy crisis but is one important step that could provide some relief to families who are struggling. I urge all of my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 800, Employee Free Choice Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it. 
   I support the Employee Free Choice Act because I believe in protecting America's workers and their rights in the workplace. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 was landmark legislation that allowed workers to organize and bargain collectively. These rights need to be safeguarded for the benefit of our working men and women who make up America's middle class. However, in a time of economic growth and high corporate profits, these middle class families have actually lost ground. Ensuring their freedom to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions is crucial to improving their plight in today's economy. 
   H.R. 800, Employee Free Choice Act protects workers in several ways. The bill increases penalties for employers who violate the National Labor Relations Act while employees are attempting to organize. It enables both the employer and the union to seek arbitration and mediation during talks for their first contract. Finally, H.R. 800 allows workers to form a union if the National Labor Relations Board finds that a majority of workers have signed authorizations to designate the union as their bargaining representative. This ``card check'' process means workers can still choose to unionize through the current secret ballot method if they wish, but they also would have an avenue that is more protected from intimidation and manipulation from employers who act in bad faith. 
   In addition, I oppose any amendments designed to weaken this bill. The substitute amendment presented by Representative MCKEON would strip the Employee Free Choice Act of its original intent. The amendment would prohibit employers from recognizing a union despite a majority of workers signing authorization cards. The amendment introduced by Representative STEVE KING would outlaw the organizing tactic known as ``salting.'' The Supreme Court has expressly upheld this practice under the National Labor Relations Act. In addition, the amendment presented by Representative FOXX concerning ``Do Not Call List'' would have the effect of cutting off communication between organizers and workers. It could be too easily used as a tool by unscrupulous companies to pressure employees. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 800, Employee Free Choice Act and protecting the rights of our working men and women.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. I, like many of us, come to the floor -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, as the only former state schools' chief serving in Congress, I rise today in appreciation of the lasting impact that teachers make on the lives of all Americans. 
   Each of us in the House have benefited from the care and guidance of a talented educator. Each of us knows, from personal experience and reports from our district, many of the amazing success stories in our schools today. These successes would not be possible without our dedicated teachers who lend their skills, experience, and passion to the task of educating our children. 
   I am profoundly thankful to all of my teachers, who pushed me to succeed and taught me valuable lessons. Ms. Flossie Barber, who taught me at the Cleveland School, was the personification of teaching. Stern and tough, but always caring with each and every student, her early lessons enabled me to achieve my goals and more. Coach Bruce Coats taught me what it meant to be a member of a team and how to contribute to the greater good. I hope that everyone has the privilege of great teachers like these, and remembers to give them thanks for their hard work and inspiration. 
   Too often, we do not give our teachers the respect and esteem that they deserve. This day, and really this whole week, is an opportunity to stop and remember the professional educators who work every day to build a bright future for our children and our Nation. Their efforts shape the world of tomorrow, and they deserve our support every day throughout the year. 
   Mr. Speaker, with your leadership, the New Direction Congress is ensuring that our teachers get the support they need to continue their work to educate our children. We have committed to fully funding No Child Left Behind and other federal mandates that have been shortchanged by the current administration. We also must pass new teacher training and staff development initiatives to help our educators hone and maintain the skills they need to teach our children well. We have made great strides in recent years to improve our schools, and, on this National Teacher Day should recommit to build on that record of success. 
   Improving education in this country is about creating a classroom environment where children can learn. My colleagues and I have crafted bipartisan legislation to provide critical investments in school construction and modernization across the country. The RANGEL-RAMSTAD-ETHERIDGE America's Better Classrooms Act will provide $25 billion in interest-free bonds for local schools. This bill will make a real difference for our communities, our children, and their teachers. I have also introduced legislation to ensure that students and teachers have a safe place to learn that is equipped to respond to any disaster. The Schools Empowered to Respond Act will support schools in their efforts to keep children safe and implement robust emergency management plans. On this National Teacher Day, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation. 
   The work of our dedicated teachers inspires our students every day, and I have been inspired by so many educators who give much to our communities. I thank them for their work, and do so every day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing a lot of talk this week about high energy prices. The Republican talking point for the week is that Democrats are causing high gas prices because we won't allow drilling. That is false rhetoric. 
   It is the oil companies that are choosing not to drill on 80 percent of the leases already available for drilling in Alaska. It is the oil companies that are choosing not to increase drilling in the Naval Petroleum Reserve, one of the largest petroleum reserves in the Nation and one that President Clinton made available for drilling. 
   Meanwhile, it is the Democrats who have put 70,000 more barrels of oil per day on to the market by halting shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is the Democrats that have passed legislation that would allow OPEC to be investigated for price fixing, legislation that the President has threatened to veto. 
   It is time to stop the rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. I challenge the President to demand fair play from OPEC and the Republican Party to stand up for the American people and not Big Oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to provide emergency supplemental appropriations for Fiscal Years 2008. This legislation contains funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the summer of 2009, expands education benefits for veterans, and extends unemployment benefits for workers. While this final bill is not perfect, I will vote for it to provide necessary funds for our troops in the field as well as fund some of our most pressing domestic priorities. 
   As a veteran of the U.S. Army myself, I strongly support our troops, our veterans and their families. Our troops have done everything they have been asked to do and done it exceptionally well. I am tremendously proud of all the troops from North Carolina and across America who have done their duty so admirably. This legislation includes $162.5 billion for our troops to fight the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also includes provisions to make sure that our troops meet the Pentagon's definition of ``combat ready'' before they are deployed to Iraq and prevents them from being deployed longer than Pentagon guidelines recommend. 
   As the representative of Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, I am a proud cosponsor of the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act and am pleased that it is included in the Supplemental Appropriations bill. The original Montgomery G.I. Bill was a hugely successful initiative that provided hundreds of thousands of soldiers with new opportunities in education and business following World War II. We owe those same opportunities to the men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and currently serving around the globe. This initiative would give returning service members who have served on active duty in the Armed Forces or reserves after September 11, 2001, to receive educational assistance for up to 4 years, and can be used at any time within 15 years of discharge or release from active duty. The new GI bill is also fiscally responsible as it is paid for with an income tax surcharge of one-half of one percent on individuals with incomes above $500,000 and couples with incomes above $1 million. Education is the key to the American dream, and our troops who have sacrificed for our country should be given every opportunity to access a higher education when they leave the service. 
   With our economy hurting, this bill extends unemployment benefits for workers who have exhausted their benefits by up to 13 weeks in every state and an additional 13 weeks in states with high unemployment. With the number of Americans looking for work growing, and the number of American jobs decreasing, this bill will help those Americans suffering in this economy. 
   I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress as well as the President and the Administration, to provide a new direction in Iraq and to meet the critical needs of the people of North Carolina's Second Congressional District.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with my colleague, Mr. Reichert of Washington State, to force the administration to really do right by the widows and orphans of fallen public safety officers. 
   For nearly 4 years, the U.S. Department of Justice has been dragging its  feet on providing benefits to the families of brave men and women who have died in the line of duty protecting their communities. 
   There are more than 200 claims, some of which have been waiting for decisions since 2003, languishing in the Public Safety Officers' Benefits office at the Office of Justice Programs. 
   This is in clear conflict with the intent of Congress, which unanimously passed the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act to expedite cases and streamline the process. Instead, there has been delay after delay from the Department of Justice, and the PSOB office has created an incredibly complicated system that even personnel at the PSOB office have been confused by. 
   My amendment would simply ensure that there are enough benefits personnel to deal with this backlog, enough appeals officers to address the concerns of families who are wrongfully denied, and additional managers or ombudsmen to help streamline claims and interact with claimants to make an emotional and difficult process easier. 
   We owe our first responders no less than to be sure that their loved ones are taken care of if they fall while working to ensure that our communities are safe. These families should not have to jump through hoop after hoop to receive what they justly deserve. 
   JoAnn Tilton of Katy, Texas, whose husband, Fire Chief Gary Tilton, died of a heart attack after responding to a traffic accident, has waited 2 1/2 years to hear from the PSOB office.     
   In that time she has been asked for volumes of information, been given conflicting information. She had basically been given the runaround in a bureaucratic marathon. She is one of the lucky ones, because at least she has gotten information from the PSOB office, even though that information includes having been told that a decision would be made earlier this month, before going forward with the claim. Now she is going to have to go through a second round of medical information reviews. 
   Shelly Hardin of Hope Mills, North Carolina, whose husband, Sergeant James Heath Hardin, died of a heart attack while working to apprehend a criminal, did not even receive notice from the PSOB office that their claim was being processed. The PSOB office still cannot say when they will begin the processing. 
   They are but two of the hundreds of individuals whose lives have been tragically disrupted, once by the death of the loved ones, and whose lives continue to be disrupted by the Department's delays. These additional funds will make sure that they wait no longer. 
   The brave men and women who serve our communities every day, many of whom volunteer their time, don't ask when they get a call from someone in distress. They act immediately, and the Justice Department should do the same. 
   The history of the Hometown Heroes Act is riddled with delays. The first delay came when they proposed regulations that were in direct conflict with the legislation. Then came more delays when they quibbled over wording and phrases and claims that they were waiting for approval from the OMB. 
   It took 3 years to finalize the process. Since the law went into effect, only 10 families have been approved for the Hometown Heroes benefit out of 264 that have applied. Forty-seven claims have been denied, and more than 200 families still await a verdict.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation. 
   This supplemental appropriations bill contains vitally important funding for critical priorities and unmet needs. For example, this bill includes $1.7 billion more than the President requested for military health care, including funds to correct the scandalous conditions at Walter Reed and other military hospitals. It includes another $1.7 billion for veterans' health care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness of our stateside troops and $1.4 billion for military housing allowances. A nation at war simply must provide necessary funds to support our troops. 
   In addition, this legislation includes $3.1 billion for military construction to implement the BRAC mandates that impact Fort Bragg in my Congressional District and military communities all across the country. It is important to note that the former Republican Congressional Majority failed to pass the military construction appropriations and imperiled these priority projects. This legislation corrects that failure. 
   Mr. Speaker, the standards and benchmarks in this legislation will assert some measure of oversight and accountability to a war policy that has been tragically mismanaged by this administration for too long. I have resisted supporting date certain language for troop redeployment because it is preferable that the executive branch have the lead in foreign policy in partnership with the legislature. Unfortunately, this Administration has mistakenly interpreted that deference as a blank check for its go-it-alone approach. No more. 
   The President's speech this week calling for ``courage and resolve'' demonstrated a continued state of denial. The American people do not need more lectures from this President about resolve. Our troops do not need more lectures about courage. What we need is a new direction to rebuild our military and refocus on the true threat to America from al Qaeda and the Islamic jihadists who attacked us on 9/11. We must deploy our military might to Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere to eliminate Osama bin Laden and the true ``grave and gathering threat'' to America. 
   We must pass this legislation to send a wake-up call to the President that ``Stay The Course'' is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable policy. I urge my colleagues to support a new direction and vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to begin this hour to put a great spotlight on what is occurring in the southeastern region of the United States. 
   You know, when you look at the statistics and you look at the effects, there is only one word that can describe the drought that has gripped the southeastern United States, and that is ``tragic.'' 
   If you look at this map to my right, you see that the Southeast is this large red area. And you also have some of the same effects in some parts of the west coast, and we've seen the effects of what's happening there with the terrible fires that are now taking place out in California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a disaster, not like a tornado or a hurricane or even any major catastrophic event. When you have a big storm or you have an earthquake, it's over, you come in and put things back together, you're able to start sorting people's lives out. But a drought of the magnitude of the one that is now gripping the Southeast is sort of a continual process. It started well over a year ago. We had a dry winter, we had a dry fall, last year a dry winter, this past year, and now this year. And I will talk about it more as the evening goes on. 
   We have places in my home State and in other places of the Southeast where we are 20 inches of rain below normal. And I will talk about that and will have more to say about it as the evening goes on. But this impact adds up over time. It impacts every person in the Southeast. It impacts animals, it impacts vegetation, and it certainly has an impact on the land. 
   This drought, frankly, is the worst one that people who are now living can remember. And in some places in my State, people who are approaching 100 years of age say they have never seen anything this bad. We know that this entire region has had, in some places, 10 inches less rain, others plus-20. And I was on the phone just today with one of our small towns working with the Governor's office. They will be out of water in 60 days. We are struggling to get water lines to them just to help them out. 
   But tonight I'm going to talk about a broader issue of it is impacting the people who live on the land, who provide our food and fiber in this country. This area has been the hardest hit. And it's a broad area, as you can see here. It's in the State of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and even parts of Maryland. 
   In North Carolina, Governor Easley has issued a state-wide ban on burning, and he has asked citizens to halt all nonessential water use. Just this week he took another step, and he asked our citizens to reduce their water use by 50 percent by Halloween. And this drought has affected our farmers to an extent so great that it is now affecting rural communities across North Carolina. And I'm sure, as my colleagues come this evening, they will share with you what's happening in their State across the Southeast. 
   I don't know if my colleagues can see here, but certainly North Carolina is predominantly red because now, and I will talk about it in a few minutes, almost every county, almost all 100 counties are in what's called the ``extreme drought,'' and I will talk about that; but my congressional district falls 100 percent in the extreme drought area. 
   And it does have an effect on rural communities, but it also affects suburban and urban communities. Plants are having their production levels cut to save water. Several communities have only a few months of water supply remaining. And I just talked about one that has no more than 60 days. It has now cut production in one of the plants that employs roughly 2,000 people; it has cut their production back to 3 and 4 days. They're hauling water in water tankers just to keep operating. I know that this is the case in several of these other States as well, and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues. 
   What we really need is a good rain. Members of Congress think they can do a lot of things, but they can't do a whole lot about rain. We can talk about it, we can pray for it, we can wish we were able to get it; but the truth is we can't do anything about it. And when we can't do that, what we can do is help in ways we can help. 
   In my district, the Second District of North Carolina, as I've said, the entire district is virtually in the exceptional drought area. That is the most serious category of drought you can have. Farmers have had to struggle all year in this very difficult situation. 
   The crisis that this drought is is underlined by the two critical variables that seem to be working against us. First is the self-sustaining cycle that a drought of this magnitude can trigger. For this region to recover any time soon, we will need at least an additional foot of precipitation. We're not likely to get that. This late in the  year, we normally get the ocean tropical storms out of the Caribbean. There was a time when we worried about hurricanes. We have people in North Carolina now saying we wish we could get one because they would get rain. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm working in Congress to provide some relief. The House Agriculture Committee is holding a hearing on Thursday to help shine the spotlight on this growing disaster, and it really is a disaster of large proportion. 
   I wrote a letter to the President asking for assistance. This letter was signed by 54 of my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican. I assume it takes a long time for a letter to get to Pennsylvania Avenue. I haven't heard anything from him. I assume that Pony Express will show up one day, maybe it went with Turtle Express, but I do hope to hear. We have asked that some money be included in the supplemental that the President requests. And I understand he sent a supplemental down, but there was no request in it. I hope he will reconsider because these farm families may not be able to make it another year. 
   They pay taxes when they have money. They're God-fearing people. They help in their communities. And they deserve, when they have tough times, for their government to help them because they've helped others when they've had tough times. 
   Farmers are some of the most resourceful, ingenious, productive people around; but there is not much you can do to grow crops or raise livestock or produce poultry and pork without some of the essential things you need, and rain is one of those things. And you need feed. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is why we're here tonight, and this is why we all work together. And we're going to work to create an awareness to this problem. And we're going to put a fire under our colleagues, if necessary, and we're going to do the same at the White House if it takes that because our farmers and rural communities desperately need assistance. It is my hope that we can pass a relief package and that the President will sign it 
   into law. 
   These are good Americans. They don't live someplace around the world; they live here in the United States of America. As I said earlier, they're tax-paying citizens when they have money. 
   Now, let me yield to my good friend from North Carolina, Mike McIntyre, who also understands this problem. His district is caught in the red area also. So I yield to him for whatever time he may consume.

   I have just changed the map here for my good friend, Mr. Spratt from South Carolina, to give a little bit better view of the South Carolina area that his district falls in. And it reaches, of course, into North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, as I said earlier, Tennessee, Kentucky, all the way down to Alabama.  
   As my colleague, Mr. McIntyre, said, and I think my friend from South Carolina will confirm, you know, these are the things, it sort of starts to weigh on you as the drought gets worse and worse. You know, not being able to water our lawn, wash your car, take a long shower is an inconvenience; but if you're a farmer and you don't have the water for your crops, it's catastrophic. Because you not only have an opportunity to lose your livelihood; you could lose your means of future livelihood if you ultimately lose your land and the equipment that you till it with. 
   So I would yield such time as he may consume to my good friend from South Carolina, the gentleman, Mr. Spratt.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman, and he is absolutely correct. Let me share some numbers, and I think the same could be said for South Carolina as in North Carolina. This is from the National Government, and this map here was actually from the U.S. Department of Drought Monitoring and it is dated October 16. It is worse today than it was on the 16th because we have had no rain. 
   Let me just share some numbers, and it will be the same that is true in South Carolina, Georgia and all these regions that we see in red. For instance, as a State as a whole in North Carolina, just talking about topsoil moisture, 73 percent short, very short, 21 percent short. Translated, what that really means Statewide is you can't plant grain for the fall. The ground is so dry it will not germinate. In the mountains, 81 percent, very short, 16 short. In the piedmont, 87 percent short, 13 percent very, and even in the coastal plains 53, 34. From the mountains to the coast in North Carolina. South Carolina probably faces some of the same challenges in terms, and if you look at the crop conditions, and this was over a month ago, cotton, very poor and poor to fair, 80-some percent; pastures, 99 percent either fair, poor or very poor. I share that on pastures because there are a lot of cattle in South Carolina as there are in North Carolina. The price of cattle at the auction market has dropped $15 a pound since early summer. Now farmers are being forced to sell because of no hay, no grazing for the winter, and guess what is happening? They are getting hit twice. They are buying hay to feed the cattle that they have left, and the ones they are selling they get less money. 
   Now, the people in the Midwest faced this several years ago. This is something we haven't faced before. I will go through the others later. But at this time, my colleague from eastern North Carolina, where he is facing some of the same drought areas, one of the heaviest agricultural areas in North Carolina, my good friend, G.K. Butterfield, I yield to you such time as you may consume.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman, and I couldn't agree more that, you know, when you look at our State, really, all this whole region is suffering, but according to the numbers by the Drought Monitoring Council in the Department of Agriculture, if you look at North Carolina specifically, North Carolina is still reporting more drought impact than any other State from the mountains to the coast. Now, all these in the Southeast are hurting. But in North Carolina, as one farmer said to me the other day, and I mentioned this earlier, he said, ``You know, if you can't water your lawn, that is an inconvenience. If you can't wash your car, you can drive it a little dirty. You can cut back on the shower. But my ponds are empty, so I can't irrigate my fields. So I am facing the forces of nature, and I could lose everything I have got.'' That's a sad situation to be in. But it is a reality. When that happens, you know, farmers are the last ones to sort of stand up and say, ``We want the government to help us.'' They usually want to say, as you well know, ``If you just leave us alone, we can get our jobs done.'' But this is one of those times that many of them won't make it without help. And it is certainly true in your area as it is in mine.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I am. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do. And it is one of those things where, as I said earlier, it didn't start this year. It really started last year, as you remember. We had a dry winter, then a late frost that hurt the spring crops, and then we had a dry summer that led into the fall, and now they can't plant the fall crops because there is no ground moisture. So there is a level of desperation that I can't remember having seen in my lifetime. Certainly we are hearing from farmers on a daily basis just saying, ``What can we do? What kind of help can we get to get through this?'' because they know they have no ability to make it rain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. That's exactly right. If we don't get it done, it won't get done. I appreciate you being here tonight. Thank you for coming and joining us. 
   According to the National Drought Monitor Center, North Carolina is still reporting, as I said, the largest drought impact in the United States at this time. The crop conditions are devastating. 
   Let me just share with you an example of a farmer from Autryville, North Carolina. He grows watermelons. He said, We have suffered at least 25 percent for our early summer crop and an 80 percent loss of the later plantings in August and September. We had over 500 acres of watermelons. 
   Now for the people who go to the grocery store, they are going to feel that impact because not having products produced close to home, that they don't have a lot of transportation in, that they know where it comes from, they get a good, fresh product at a reasonable price. That won't be there. He said, All of our ponds ran out of water in both the watermelon and the cantaloupe fields even though we only used drip irrigation. You say, Why would the water run out? Because we had the hottest summer on record. When you have a hot summer, you get a lot of evaporation. If you get no rain, you get no opportunity to replenish it. 
   He said, Our cantaloupe crop wasn't hurt much more than 25 percent totally. However, a 25 percent loss starts to eat up our profit when you have over 300 acres of cantaloupes that were early. Pumpkins. We experienced 100 percent loss on our 100 acres of pumpkins. Even though we were able to irrigate some of them, we ran out of water. The excessive heat caused very poor pollination, which resulted in no fruit set. 
   Now, for those who are listening this evening here in the Chamber and those who may be watching on C-SPAN, what they are really talking about is you have to pollinate those flowers, and if they don't get pollinated and don't set, you get no fruit. So all of a sudden, after all the work he put in, the expensive inputs, there's no money at the end of the year. 
   He said his wheat crop was about a 65 percent loss due to the drought conditions as far back as February and March. Remember, I said earlier we had a dry fall last year, it went into the winter, and then we had the early frost that hit the wheat and the oats and a lot of our late grains. So he winds up with a 65 percent loss there. 
   Then his other crops, and this is just one farmer, and I will share with you in a minute what these products mean in terms of dollars just in North Carolina. I could use other States, but since North Carolina is my home, I am going to use that State. It has an impact because roughly 25 percent of North Carolina's gross domestic product is really tied up in agriculture. Peanuts. Our loss ranged anywhere from 30 percent to 75 percent below normal yields due to drought. That was just a plain lack of rainfall. 
   Now, some of you might say, Well, why would the rains be so great between 30 percent and 75 percent for a farmer who had peanuts. You have got to understand, the rain, what little rain we got this year, and, remember, I said earlier it rains, depending on where you were in the State, 10 inches below normal, to as much as 20. If you happened to be in one of those 20-plus  inch areas, then your peanuts didn't do much of anything, or anything else. So that was part of the problem. It could happen within any given county. This is one of those unusual drought years. 
   He said, I planted soybeans. Even though we haven't started harvesting soybeans yet, there is nothing there to harvest. We have 500 acres of soybeans. So those of you who don't have an idea how much 500 acres is, I will just share with you that if you had a good yield on 500 acres, and you yielded say 40 bushels an acre, you can figure it up right quick if soybeans are $7 a bushel. You can see how much prospective income you have just lost. You have already got all the expenses of getting your land ready, buying the seed, putting the chemicals on it if you had to spray it for pesticides or something. This year they probably wouldn't because it was so dry. Any time you have a dry year, you're more likely to have pests eat it. That is a real problem. 
   Just this past Monday I was in the field with a gentleman who actually farms in Johnston in Wake County. Mr. Jordan carried us into one of his grain fields of soybeans, showed us his sweet potatoes. Let me just read to you what he said when I visited him. He is a hardworking guy. He has farmed all of his life. His dad farmed the land; his son is now with him. 
   He said, I just had a third of a crop of sweet potatoes come in, and the ones we harvested, and for those of you who know what I'm talking about, number one potatoes are the ones you get your money for, and the others don't turn out too good. They're good potatoes, but people go to the grocery shelf and they may not buy them. Most of them were not number ones. 
   Then we went to his soybean field, and in that field, and I grew up on a farm, my son still farms, I participate in it a little, and I would venture to say we opened some pods on some of the soybeans, and those of you who ever had a BB gun know how big a BB is, and a soybean is supposed to be a lot bigger, like a pea. And they were like BBs. 
   Of course, when they go through and harvest, they will go right through the harvest and wind up back on the ground. They are great to help the birds a little bit, but it's going to be devastating for Mr. Jordan and farmers like him. He said, The heat has been as big a factor as the drought. Of course, all of you know the heat contributes to the drought, because it was the hottest summer on record in the State of North Carolina and in the Southeast. 
   He went on to say he has cattle. He said there is not enough hay to cut to justify running the machinery, so we are to spend a lot of money for feed to help these cows get through the winter. We have farmers in North Carolina hauling hay great distances, others that cannot even buy it, hay that was $20 and $25 for a big bale has now gone from $40 to $50, and in some cases they can't even get it. This is why they are asking for help. This is why this Democratic Congress, and I hope my Republican colleagues, and I pray the President, will do the right thing and sign legislation to help. 
   Mr. Jordan has estimated that his gross loss will be somewhere between $115,000 and $200,000 on his fall harvest. He is a large operator. He might weather it. But it will take him years to recover, because the machinery he uses has got a year's use on it and it is getting worn out and he has no money to make it happen. He said, I hope we can salvage some of it. We will try to save what we can. And I just say thank God for people like him and other farmers who are willing to continue to get up early in the morning, work in the hot sun, and take the huge risk that it takes to provide food and fiber for all of us in America. 
   Let me share with you something about what is happening with what we call the ``green industry.'' The green industry, of course, is our nursery industry and a host of those things tied to it. These numbers are for North Carolina. 
   The green industry contributes more than $8.6 
   billion to the economy of North Carolina. The green industry alone employs roughly 151,000 people. Due to the drought thus far this year, the green industry has laid off 30 percent of their labor force and revenues are down 40 percent. Let me repeat that again: 40 percent. 
   Now, that will be felt not just this year. That is going to be felt for a number of years, because that means, number one, you can't expand. Number two, you can't buy new equipment, and all of those people that they buy trucks, tractors and equipment from, they are going to feel it. 
   As you can see from the map here, as I said earlier, the situation in North Carolina and the entire region is dire. Fifteen more counties were just moved into the worst category of drought, exceptional, this week. We talked about 85 already. Fifteen more have been moved into it. We hope to get some rain this weekend. Every time we get promised rain, it tends to split and get away. We hope we do. But more is needed to make it. When you have as much area having drought as we do, it just seems that it gets tougher and tougher. 
   Let me share with you one other thing. I think it was my good friend Mr. Butterfield was talking about how he saw streams that were cracking. I was up toward Siler City about a month ago in the Upper Piedmont, western part of my district. It was the first time in my lifetime I have seen trees along streams that were dead. Not the leaves falling off, trees were dead, because the streams had long since dried up. And anyone who knows anything about forestry, a tree near a stream tends to have its roots fairly shallow and in the water or close to it. These streams had been dry so long, the trees didn't have deep roots so whole trees were dying. You could see long strips of trees along streams that were dead. Farmers had been feeding hay since late July. 
   I keep repeating this because this is a critical situation. You know, you can be in Washington and you can come into this nice building and you can have plenty of food every day, but one of these days, if we don't take care of the people who provide food and fiber, we might face that challenge too. 
   So I hope my colleagues understand how serious this situation is, and I hope the people at the White House understand. I pray that the President will send a request to help not only our folks in the Southeast that are going to take a long time to recover, but also those on the west coast that we see on TV tonight, and it looks like it is going to be awhile, who have lost a great deal as well. 
   These things, if they do not deserve an emergency appropriation, I pray ask, what does? If we can't help the people in this country, who can we help? When can we help them, if we can't help them when they are hurting? 
   Mr. Speaker, almost 85 percent of the land area of my State is now designated as being either extreme or exceptional drought. To my knowledge, that has never happened in my lifetime. I have talked with people who are almost 100 years old, and they never remember it. 
   Fifty-four percent of the land area is in the exceptional category. That is up from 38 percent just last week. And, as I said, all of the State is in at least severe drought, with the last three counties in the moderate category now moving into severe. 
   On October 18, the North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council Web site listed the number of North Carolina counties in each category as follows: D-4, that is exceptional, 71; D-3, extreme, 18; and D-2, severe, 11.     
   We talked earlier about the challenge we face with water. And water is important to sustain life. I mentioned earlier about Siler City. I want to talk about that again because that county has probably suffered as much or more as any county in the district, agriculturally as well as the city of Siler City. They are down to 60 days of water. Tonight I want to thank the Governor of our State, Mike Easley, and his staff and some of the folks from USDA who have worked together to try to make sure that the town has water. They have been hauling water with trucks to keep roughly 1,500 to 2,000 people working. As I said when I began to speak, they are now down to 3 or 4 days a week. It looks like they are going to break ground, because of the hard work of the Governor's staff, on a waterline that will hopefully get them over the hump. But we still need rain and we need help. 
   These two plants, Pilgrim's Pride and Townsend, provide a lot of jobs, but  they also provide an opportunity for our farmers to have income who produce a lot of poultry in our State. They provide a lot of food for the table of a lot of Americans who don't want to think about it, who don't want to know about it, who really aren't interested in it. They just want to go to the meat counter and have good, safe, plentiful, affordable food supply. 
   Mr. Speaker, to do that it is incumbent upon every Member who took the oath of office in this Chamber and the other body across the hall and the President of the United States, if we can get together a bill, pass it, and we should, for him to sign it, to make sure that these folks continue to make it. 
   I saw on Monday the sad commentary of what a major drought can do. I was on our farm with our son Saturday. We spent an hour or two and were going to put a cover crop in. We actually put some in last Saturday. He said to me I probably made a mistake; it might not come up. He is probably right. This Saturday we decided not to plant anything because the ground was so dry it wouldn't germinate. 
   I happen to believe our food supply is part of our national defense. It is part of our homeland defense, and Members of Congress I think will rally. Farmers face some of the toughest perils that I can imagine when they invest their money in the spring and depend on weather to make it. Make no mistake about it, somewhere in America almost every year there is some catastrophic event tied to agriculture. Some of it is tied to our beaches with hurricanes. It is tied to tornadoes in the Midwest. It is tied to earthquakes. It is tied to a lot of things. We have always responded. We have always helped, and we should. Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to help the people in the Southeast at a time when we have the toughest drought that we have ever faced. 
   And I am pleased that we are now joined by my colleague from Wake County who understands this. He represents some of the agricultural area, but we are very fortunate to have him chairing the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and he certainly understands that our agricultural production is part of our national security as much as protecting our homeland. If we can't have cotton and corn and soybeans and those things we enjoy having on our table, then we are challenged. And I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). He can see from the map as well how North Carolina is the worst of all of the southeastern States by the drought monitor.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Let me thank the gentleman and thank you for your leadership not just on this, but other issues as well. North Carolina is one of those States, I couldn't help but think as you were going through the list, as you talk about the drought, and over the years being here talking about floods and hurricanes because North Carolina, as folks can see on this map, we sort of stick out in the Atlantic and we get whacked by hurricanes and we have had floods. I thank the gentleman for his leadership over the years. He has taken the leadership on the Appropriations Committee, and we will lean on your broad shoulders again as we work through this because it is important. 
   Let me share with my colleagues in the little time we have remaining what Brian Long, who is a spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services had to say. He said, ``We cringe a little more each month because it is going from bad to worse.'' 
   And I say that because every day that it doesn't rain it gets drier, and every day that it gets drier, it means that more and more farmers move closer to the edge. Don Nicholson, a State regional agronomist, said: ``It's the worst I've ever seen. My mother is 76. She talks about how bad it was in the early fifties. That is the only reference point that I have.'' And what he was saying was fifties were bad, but 2007 is worse. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I close out tonight, I want to thank my colleagues for coming and joining me to talk about this issue, to call attention at the national level because truly this is a problem of national proportion. As the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) said, it may now only affect the Southeast, but it really is a national issue. It is national in that we are all in this together, and it is national in that this will ultimately affect the table of families across this country in one way or another, because if cotton production is down, it will have an impact. And for all of the fruits and vegetables, it will have an impact. And soybeans and corn over the long haul, because if you have to pay more for feed for pigs and poultry, it is reflected on the tables of American consumers and people around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I trust we can get a bill through and I trust that ultimately the President will send us a request in one of the supplementals where he is asking for additional money from this Congress. And if not, that we will put  it in and that he will sign it. That's the least that we can do for the people in this country who work hard every day, who play by the rules, who are good folks and deserve an opportunity to continue to do the things not only that they love, but provide food and fiber for our tables.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I remember when we went out to South Dakota and through Iowa and how tough it was when it was dry. I will always remember with my good friend, Jerry Moran, we flew into Kansas last year to do a hearing on the ag bill. Lo and behold, when we flew in, it was raining like the dickens. I said, ``Jerry, you have been talking about how dry it has been for so long.'' 
   He said, ``Yes, and all of a sudden we got plenty of water.'' Hopefully we will get back there, but you do understand. Thank you for your help. I think this is an issue where we have to pull together and help. I thank you for your leadership and help on the Agriculture Committee, too. I appreciate that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate Speaker Pelosi and the House Democratic leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor for a new direction for America's energy independence. Last Congress, I had the honor of serving with Congresswoman STEPHANIE HERSETH as co-chairs of the Speaker's Rural Working Group. Working with leaders like Chairman COLLIN PETERSON, we identified biofuels as a win-win for America's energy needs. 
   Over the past few years, as gas prices have steadily risen higher and higher, there has been no significant legislation passed in this body to gain our energy independence. Anyone who has filled up his or her gas tank in the past year knows that gas prices are highly volatile and really too high for the average American. 
   Yet while Americans are struggling to make ends meet, oil companies are making record profits. As a former small businessman in North Carolina and as a part-time farmer, I believe it is our duty to find alternatives for what can become a dangerous reliance on foreign oil. 
   And let me be clear, our Nation has the capacity to gain its energy independence. H.R. 6 will promote this by creating a renewable fuel standard requiring that, by 2015, 15 percent of our fuels be renewable. This legislation will also extend and expand tax credits for ethanol and biodiesel. It will extend loan guarantees to farmers to produce renewable energy, and it will increase and expand tax credits to promote the use of flex fuel vehicles. 
   Today we have the technology to solve our energy crisis growing in our fields. We have the ability to turn soybeans and peanuts, both grown in large amounts, I should say, in my home State of North Carolina, into biodiesel, and the technology to turn sugar cane and corn into ethanol. What we haven't had up to this point is the leadership to develop the infrastructure needed to facilitate the use of these fuels. 
   This legislation before us today will begin to do just that. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6599, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Act, 2009. This legislation builds upon last year's needed increases in military construction and veterans affairs funding, and continues to make our veterans a top priority. 
   As a veteran, I am pleased that H.R. 6599 provides more support for our veterans. H.R. 6599 includes a total of $47.7 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs. $40.8 billion supports the Veterans Health Administration, VHA, and Veterans Medical Services, which expects to serve over 5.8 million patients next year. To improve access to care for our veterans, H.R. 6599 provides $200 million for fee-based providers where VHA services are not available. The bill also raises the travel reimbursement rate from 28.5 cents per mile to 41.5 cents per mile to help thousands of rural veterans get care. A continuing backlog at the VA forces our veterans to wait far too long to receive the benefits that they have earned. This bill will enable the VA to hire 1,400 new casework processors. Our veterans are men and women who have answered the call of duty to serve our country, and we have a duty to provide them with the best possible care when they return. 
   This bill addresses the specific issues that we see affecting our soldiers returning today from Iraq and Afghanistan. H.R. 6599 provides a $250 million increase to support prosthetics and new prosthetic technology, as well as $3.8 billion for specialty mental health services and $584 million for substance abuse programs. This is funding that can help address the growing incidence of post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury cases among our returning soldiers. 
   As the Representative of Fort Bragg, one of the largest United States Army bases in the country, I am pleased that this bill addresses the needs of our military installations. This bill includes $24 billion for military construction, including an increase of $300 million for replacing inadequate military housing. Fort Bragg is expanding rapidly, and there are crucial funds in this bill to meet new demands. H.R. 6559 includes over $21 million for road construction and $78 million for on-base school constructions, to meet the needs of the influx of people at Fort Bragg. In addition, this bill includes $1,300,000 that I requested to construct a new mass casualty facility at Womack Army Medical Center for triage and decontamination purposes for the surrounding area. H.R. 6599 provides $5.6 billion for new military construction and family housing, in line with the ``Growing the Force'' initiative to increase the size of the Army, Marine Corps and National Guard and Reserve. Finally, I am pleased that there is an increase of $1.8 billion for the Base Realignment and Closure Act, BRAC, to continue these efforts. 
   I support H.R. 6599, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Act, 2009, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, as a veteran, as you have heard, of the United States Army, myself, I strongly support our troops, our veterans and their families. Let me state at the outset that our troops have done everything that has been asked of them to do. They have done it well. Exceptionally well, I might say. 
   More than 34,000 from North Carolina have been deployed on Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. And more than 5,000 are currently over there now. More are preparing to go back to the desert once again. 
   I am tremendously proud of all the troops from North Carolina and across America who have laced up their boots, followed their orders, and done their duty. They are our heroes, and we salute them. 
   Regardless if one terms the President's announced change in policy a surge or an escalation or an augmentation, the so-called new plan can be summed up in four words: more of the same. 
   I myself have traveled to Iraq twice. And after I returned last year I said the administration must change from this failed policy. Specifically, I said that we need more burden-sharing support from other countries, more communities and countries in the region, because the whole world has a tremendous stake in a stable Iraq and a peaceful Middle East. 
   This administration's arrogant disregard for our international partners has destroyed U.S. alliances that were decades in the making. Those alliances saw us through the darkest days of the cold war when the very existence of our country hung in the balance. Yet, this administration tossed them aside like yesterday's news. 
   It is a sad tragedy to witness the forfeiture of America's moral standing in the world and the abandonment of diplomacy as an effective asset for America's interests. 
   We need to bring all the parties to the table and discuss cooperative action to secure Iraq's long-term stability and a peaceful Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, I voted to give the President the authority to topple Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq because he said it presented a ``grave and gathering threat to America.'' 
   The President said Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and intended to use them against America. 
   The President said Saddam was in cahoots with Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorists. I took the President of the United States of America at his word. We have learned, to our great regret, what that was worth. 
   Now the President wants to send 21,000 more troops to Baghdad. Republican Senator Arlen Specter called the new deployment ``a snowball in July.'' An outgoing commander of the Central Command, with responsibility for Iraq, told the Senate last November, and I quote, ``I do not believe that more American troops right now is the solution to the problem. I believe the troop levels need to stay about where they are.'' 
   And the former Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, a decorated marine and former Secretary of the Navy, said last month, ``I feel very strongly that the American GI was not trained, not sent over there, certainly not by resolution of this institution, to be placed in the middle of a fight between Sunni and Shiia and the wanton and just incomprehensible killing that is going on at this time.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I have voted for every defense bill and war funding legislation that Congress has passed for Iraq. I am very concerned about the state of readiness of our American Armed Forces. 
   As the Representative for Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, I know that America's military and our military communities have many unmet needs, while the war in Iraq continues to consume more and more public dollars, with no end in sight. 
   In conclusion, I rise in support of this resolution with no joy in my heart, but with solid conviction in my soul. The failure of this administration has gone unchecked and unchallenged by the Congress of the United States for far  too long. We need a new direction in Iraq. 
   The question before Congress is this: Is more of the same in Iraq an acceptable policy? The answer is no.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the chairman. 
   I am pleased today to join Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte in bringing this legislation, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008, to the floor for consideration by the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, since our bill was considered by the full House this past July, much has happened. For one thing, oil prices have dropped, and they have dropped considerably. They have gone up in the last day or so. Additionally, the CFTC has released a report providing the most detailed and accurate look at data on index trading and swap dealers participating in the over-the-counter market. 
   While all of us are glad to see the prices of oil decline and other commodities in recent months, it does not relieve the Commission or this Congress of our responsibility to make sure that commodity markets are operating effectively, efficiently and fairly. And  while the CFTC report indicates that index funds and swap dealers have less influence on our markets than had otherwise been reported, the report does not tell us the whole story or provide us with all the answers to our questions regarding these markets. 
   The CFTC report fails to include the time period of this July and August and recent weeks when oil prices fell fairly rapidly. Do we have a clear understanding of why prices fell? No. Passing H.R. 6604 will provide the CFTC with the authority and the tools to examine the entire marketplace to ensure no individual group or groups of market participants is having an undue influence on the market. 
   Months ago, the CFTC was telling Congress that it needed no additional changes to the Commodity Exchange Act and that markets were functioning properly. Now the CFTC's report contains a host of proposals very similar to the provisions in the Commodities Market Transparency and Accountability Act. 
   The report recommends measures designed to enhance transparency and data accuracy for commodity markets. Our bill provides the commission with the tools to make that happen. 
   The report suggests revising the hedge exemption rules that allow traders to exceed speculation position limits. Our bill accomplishes that too. 
   The report highlights the desperate need for additional staff and resources at the CFTC, not only to accomplish its current mission, but also to implement its recommendations to bring greater transparency and accountability to the commodity markets. We happen to agree. 
   Since 2000, volume on the commodity markets has increased sixfold, but currently staffing levels at the CFTC have fallen to their lowest level in the 33-year history of the Commodities Exchange. Through this legislation, we acknowledge the need for 100 additional full-time positions at CFTC that they need to effectively regulate the futures industry, including our energy markets. But we should not kid ourselves. The CFTC needs far more resources to do the job that we expect them to do.     
   Earlier this year the chairman of the CFTC testified at a hearing that the agency needed 100 additional staff right now just to meet the growing surveillance needs. 
   In testimony presented to the House Agriculture Committee a week ago today, the chairman of the commission testified the CFTC would need still another 138 full-time staff and $38 million just in 2009 to implement the provisions of H.R. 6604. Given the light of what is happening in the markets, I think we understand why the need is there. 
   I have said this before, but it bears repeating, if Congress places additional responsibility upon the Commission, without providing the resources necessary to meet those responsibilities, then what we pass here today is simply a farce. Through its report, CFTC views on effective oversight of commodity markets have changed dramatically from where the commission was previously. 
   I know some of my colleagues will say let's wait and give the commission time to implement these recommendations administratively. I say why wait for the commission to implement changes that we as a Congress can do right now with H.R. 6604.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. We can all agree that no one factor is responsible for the movement we have seen in agriculture and energy prices, but this legislation is an important measure to provide the CFTC with additional tools and authority to keep our markets free of manipulation and excess speculation and help restore confidence to these markets. We cannot allow excess speculation by Wall Street to cause folks on Main Street to suffer.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. We have just a couple more speakers we are waiting on, but in the meantime I would take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to just share with my colleagues that this bill has substantial support from the Air Transportation Association, the Air Line Pilots Association, Tyson Foods, Sierra Club, Environmental America, League of Conservation Voters, the Wilderness Society, National Chicken Council, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, National Farmer Unions, National Grains, National Milk Producers Federation, National Sorghum Producers, Southern Cotton Shippers Association, Southern Peanut Farmers Association, Southwest Council of Agriculture, Texas Cotton Association, United Egg Producers, United States Cattlemen Association, U.S. Rice Producers Association, U.S. Rice Federation, Western Cotton Shippers, Western Peanut Growers Association, Women Involved in Farm Economics, the American Agriculture Movement, American Association of Crop Insurance, American Corn Growers, American Cotton Shippers, the Atlantic Cotton Association, the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and I think at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the American people.     
   The American people only ask of us in this body to do what's right and be fair. I think they want markets to work. They want them to work fairly because they don't want them working against us. Today we have an opportunity to make these markets, once again, work for the American people. 
   We heard testimony in our committee of grain elevators who were caught in the wedge. When the prices ran so high, they were unable to get financing to be able to assist farmers. When you're looking at finding a real price through the futures, that's what they're supposed to do. But you can't do it when the markets aren't working the way they should work. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Virginia has any other speakers, I would be willing for him to call his speakers while I wait for a couple of folks here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of the Energy Market Emergency Act of 2008. 
   I don't have to tell anyone that gas prices have skyrocketed over the last several months. We can all remember when we thought $2 a gallon gas was high. Now we would like to return to that. Now it is on average over $4. 
   On June 6, the price of crude oil hit an all-time record of $139 per barrel. American families are paying an average of $4.07 for gasoline, double the price from 2001 when President Bush took over. Truckers and farmers are paying an average of $4.77 per gallon for diesel, triple the price from 2001 when the President took office. 
   There is clearly not just one factor leading to these outrageous prices. However, there is a growing concern that excessive speculation by investors could be a significant cause of the prices we are experiencing. North Carolina families are struggling to make ends meet, as are families all across the country. Congress must act to ensure speculators are not artificially raising energy prices for their own gain while hardworking Americans are suffering. 
   This legislation tells the CFTC, which is responsible for overseeing our energy markets, to use all other authority to ensure that excessive speculation is not occurring. 
   I can't blame them. When the price of crude oil spikes $10, folks really believe something is wrong. The House Ag Committee will conduct hearings in July to examine all of the various pieces of legislation to address this issue, including legislation that I have introduced called the Increasing Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008. 
   I believe after a careful review we can craft responsible legislation that can improve the price discovery function of these commodity markets. But no amount of CFTC authority will make a difference if the agency doesn't have the resources to do their job. 
   Since 2002, trading on the commodity markets has increased six times.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. While trading has increased six times, under the Bush administration, staff levels have fallen to the lowest level in the 33-year history of the exchange. 
   My legislation and others will increase it by 100 people. These are investigators. Let me just say for those who are listening, that means if you have a speed limit of 55 or 60 miles an hour, we are going to put more cops on the beat. That's what we need.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support the Energy Market Emergency Act of 2008. 
   I don't have to tell anyone here that gas prices have sky rocketed over the last several months. I remember a few years ago when two-dollar-a-gallon gas seemed outrageous. Now the national average is four dollars. 
   On June 6th, the price of crude oil hit an all time record of $139.12 per barrel. 
   American families are paying an average of $4.07 per gallon for regular gasoline, double the price from 2001 when President Bush took office. 
   Truckers and farmers are paying an average of $4.77 per gallon for diesel fuel; triple the price from 2001, again when the President took office. 
   There is clearly not just one factor leading to these outrageous prices. However, there is a growing concern that excessive speculation by investors could be a significant cause of the prices we are experiencing. 
   North Carolina's families are struggling to make ends meet while the cost of energy soars. Congress must ensure that investors are not artificially raising energy costs for their own gain while hard-working Americans are suffering. 
   This legislation tells the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is responsible for overseeing our energy markets, to use all of its authority to ensure that excessive speculation is not occurring. 
   I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management, which has jurisdiction over the CFTC, and I'm here to tell you that people think something is not right. 
   And I cannot blame them. When the price of crude oil spikes $10.00 in one day, people think somebody is making some money, and it isn't them. 
   The House Agriculture Committee will conduct hearings in July to examine all of the various legislative proposals to address this issue, including legislation I have introduced, H.R. 6334, the Increasing Transparency and Accountability in Oil Prices Act of 2008. 
   I believe after a careful review, we can craft responsible legislation that can improve the price discovery function of these commodity markets. 
   No amount of additional CFTC authority will make a difference if the agency doesn't have the resources to do their job. Since 2000, trading on commodity markets has increased six-fold. 
   However, during that time, the Bush administration let staffing levels at the CFTC fall to their lowest level in the agency's 33-year history. 
   My legislation calls for 100 additional full-time positions at the CFTC, mostly for enforcement because they need the talent to keep an eye on these markets. 
   And I want to applaud Representative Rosa DeLauro for knowing this simple truth and providing more funding for the CFTC than the President requested in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. 
   Commodity markets are like highways in that both have limits. If drivers don't think there are any cops watching on the road, they are going to push past the speed limits. If the CFTC doesn't have enough staff to monitor an ever growing and changing marketplace, investors will push the limits there as well. 
   Today's directive to the CFTC will send a message to the administration that they must get serious about these sky rocketing costs  and will pave the way for more comprehensive legislation in the future. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, as a veteran of the United States, I rise in support of the House bill on veterans funding. 
   Over the last 5 years, hundreds of thousands of Americans, military personnel, have bravely served this country in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I am proud that North Carolina is home to many of these soldiers and also has one of the highest veteran populations in the country. Unfortunately, VA health care is still not adequately prepared to care for those who are returning from combat. Today, nearly 400,000 veterans are faced with unreasonable delays for their claims to be processed. 
   Yesterday, this Democratic House once again fulfilled its commitment to our veterans by passing a conference report that is $3.7 billion over President Bush's request for veterans medical care, claims processing personnel and for facility improvements. The conference report includes the largest increase in funding in the 77-year history of the VA to fund these health care needs, as well as funds for 1,800 new processors to alleviate the claims backlog. 
   Despite a veto threat from this President, who is spending millions of dollars on roads, schools and health care in Iraq and Afghanistan, this House passed the VA funding bill on a vote of 269-142. The Senate should follow our lead, and the President should reverse his course and sign this vital bill into law.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, on Friday of last week, the House took up 26 sequential votes on amendments to the 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, H.R. 2638. The fourth of these votes was on an amendment by the gentlelady from Virginia, Representative Drake, which increased funding for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's 287(g) program. This program funds training and activity of State and local law enforcement personnel to carry out Federal immigration law. I believe that immigration law is and should be the responsibility of Federal border and Customs officials, and not delegated to the States and local authorities who are already burdened with protecting their communities. I, therefore, do not support the Drake amendment. 
   On roll number 469 when I cast my vote on this amendment, however, an ``aye'' vote was recorded when a ``no'' vote should have been recorded.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the Senate. Today, the United States faces the most significant financial crisis since the Great Depression. Homeowners, small businesses, retirement savings plans, and community banks--American people from every walk of life--are put at risk by the turbulence in our financial sector. This bill puts us on the right path to recovery for our economy. 
   If there was any question whether action is necessary, one needs to look no further than  the stock market reaction to Congress' inaction on Monday. Leading up to that vote, I spoke with the leaders of some of North Carolina's local and state banks and credit unions about the effect of this crisis on the communities they serve. While I wish that this action was unnecessary, the financial system's problems call for strong steps. If lending does not resume, Americans will be unable to grow their small business, buy a car, pay for college, or buy a home. Without action, this financial crisis will threaten the entire American economy. 
   Like the bill we voted on earlier this week, H.R. 1424 is a vast improvement over the blank check that the Bush Administration originally proposed. This bill contains key provisions, negotiated by Democratic leaders in Congress, to ensure this bill benefits Main Street. As I demanded when an economic recovery plan was first proposed, this bill protects taxpayer money, provides help for struggling homeowners, prevents Wall Street CEOs from gaining a windfall at taxpayer expense, and provides the accountability and oversight that have been missing. While it contains strict oversight provisions, the plan also contains the flexibility needed to address a problem of this magnitude. 
   First and foremost, this plan protects taxpayer money. Democratic leaders made sure that the public will share in the benefit of the economic relief provided by adding provisions that allow taxpayers to share in profits if a financial institution we invest in grows healthy in the future. To ensure Main Street is not left with the bill for Wall Street's problems, H.R. 1424 calls for a plan to require financial institutions to repay any losses to the government in the future. I am also pleased that this bill now temporarily increases the amount of money insured by the Federal Insurance Corporation 
   from $100,000 to $250,000 for one year. This provision insures taxpayers' savings and boosts public confidence in our banks. Finally, H.R. 1424 looks after the taxpayers bottom line by requiring that any profit resulting from this plan be used to reduce the growing national debt. 
   In order to further ensure that assistance benefits Main Street, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will help ensure those who have been hurt by the economic downturn and predatory lending practices can remain in their homes when possible. The bill authorizes new loan guarantees and credit enhancement to prevent foreclosures, and requires a plan to encourage mortgage servicers to modify loans through the Federal Housing Administration's Hope for Homeowners and other initiatives. 
   H.R. 1424 makes sure that Wall Street executives do not profit excessively from the government assistance provided. It includes limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes not only for institutions that the government buys, but also for those holding loans that are supported by this bill. It holds executives accountable for statements they have made about their company's financial strength, forcing those promise gains that later turn out to be false or inaccurate to repay the taxpayer. 
   Congress has also increased oversight and transparency in this bill. Rather than providing $700 billion in one lump sum, H.R. 1424 authorizes an initial $250 billion so that we can see how the plan works. Another $100 billion is available with Presidential notification, and the remaining $350 billion requires Congressional action to be released. H.R. 1424 requires public disclosure, within two days, of purchases made by the Secretary, and provides a strong oversight board with authority over the Treasury Secretary's actions. Additionally, H.R. 1424 establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Secretary's actions. Additionally, H.R. 1424 establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Secretary's authority. Given the extent and range of the problems in our financial markets, it is critical that the Treasury Secretary have a variety of tools to address these problems. H.R. 1424 includes a Republican proposal that gives the Treasury Department the option to guarantee companies' troubled assets, including mortgage-backed securities, purchased before March 18, 2008, with insurance that is paid for through risk-based premiums paid by the financial industry. 
   The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 also provides tax relief for millions of Americans while spurring business investment and innovation in renewable energy. While we support the financial system that enables our families and businesses to grow, we should also address the tax burden they face. 
   H.R. 1424 includes critical tax relief for families facing the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. The AMT was originally intended to ensure that the nation's wealthiest taxpayers were not able to avoid paying taxes altogether. However, because the AMT is not indexed for inflation, today millions of middle income Americans who pay their taxes as required would see a huge tax increase. H.R. 1424 raises the exemption limits and protects 25 million middle-class families across the country, including more than 30,000 taxpayers in my district, from this extra tax. 
   The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will benefit the families of millions of children by expanding the child tax credit to those earning $8,500 a year in 2009. This bill also helps families by extending the state and local sales tax deduction, and will help over 4 million families better afford college by providing a tuition deduction. As a former superintendent of schools, I am pleased that this legislation includes a tax deduction that will save money for more than 3 million teachers when they pay for classroom supplies and expenses. The bill also includes an additional $400 million for Quality Zone Academy Bonds to help states and localities address school construction and renovation needs. 
   This bill provides critical support in the form of tax breaks and incentives to the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. This bill extends the Research and Development Tax Credit for two years to spur American innovation and business investment as well as a two year extension of the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant improvements. 
   Developing alternative energy sources and reducing our dependence on foreign oil is one the most critical challenges facing our country. H.R. 1424 will increase the production of renewable fuels and renewable electricity, and encourage greater energy efficiency. This bill features an eight-year extension of the investment tax credit for solar energy and a multi-year extension of the production tax credit for other sources of alternative energy like biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solid waste. With millions of Americans struggling to afford rising gas prices, H.R. 1424 includes tax incentives for the installation of E-85 pumps for flex-fuel vehicles, and a $3,000 tax credit toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. There are also incentives for incorporating energy conservation in commercial buildings and residential structures. The energy provisions in H.R. 1424 will help create and preserve more than 500,000 good-paying green collar jobs at a time when our economy is struggling and unemployment is at a five-year high. 
   Finally, H.R. 1424 contains language I have supported to expand access to mental health care for all Americans. My home state of North Carolina was one of the first states to adopt a mental health parity law back in 1991, and last year the State Legislature expanded and strengthened its mental health parity provisions. I support the efforts of North Carolina's mental health professionals in bringing this issue to the forefront of our State's agenda, and I am pleased that we are following suit today in passing this bill. H.R. 1424 simply requires those insurers or group health plans who do chose to cover mental health to do so on an equal basis with other covered health needs. This will ensure that those in need can get the treatment that is medically necessary, without creating an undue hardship on employers or insurers. As health care consumes an increasing percentage of America's income, it is critical that we provide support for all medical needs. 
   I support H.R. 1424, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 as amended by the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. As a cosponsor of this important legislation, I applaud your leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and addressing the issue of mental health panty. 
   According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older--about one in four adults--suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. Unfortunately, the U.S. Surgeon General reports that only one in three of these people receive treatment for their disabilities. A significant reason that people fail to seek medical help for debilitating mental health issues is the lack of insurance. 
   The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act would help address this problem. By requiring health plans to consider mental health issues on an equal basis with other health problems, this bill ensures that those in need can get the treatment that is medically necessary. We must expand access to mental health to ensure a strong and productive America that provides for its most vulnerable citizens. 
   Untreated and mistreated mental illness costs the United States $105 billion in lost productivity, a figure that has been increasing every year. According to a study funded by NIMH, treating mental health in the workplace significantly improves employee health and productivity, likely leading to overall lower costs for the employer. Mental health also has a high cost to society--for example, 20 percent of youths in juvenile justice facilities have a serious emotional disturbance and most have a diagnosable mental disorder. This bill will improve our economy and ensure those in need get the help they need before their illness turns into something worse. 
   My home state of North Carolina was one of the first states to adopt a mental health parity law back in 1991, and last year the State Legislature expanded and strengthened its mental health parity provisions. I support the efforts of North Carolina's mental health professionals in bringing this issue to the forefront of our State's agenda. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I strongly support this bill, I disagree with part of the bill's funding mechanism. We must be fiscally responsible, but we should not allow cost offsets to undermine the basic goals of this bill. I am concerned that the large increase in the Medicaid prescription drug rebate will reduce the ability of patients, including those with mental health conditions, to get the prescription medicines they need. 
   H.R. 1424 calls for a 33 percent increase in the rebate that brand pharmaceutical companies pay to the Medicaid program. Innovator drug companies already provide deep discounts to Federal and State Governments for  the prescription drugs covered by the Medicaid program. I am concerned that a huge increase in costs will have a chilling effect on pharmaceutical research and development for the next generation of treatments, including those that aid the very patients with mental health conditions that we are attempting to help today. Mr. Speaker, I hope that you and the House conferees will work to address this issue in conference negotiations with the Senate. 
   After careful consideration, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1424.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1420, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the terrorist attacks launched against the United States on September 11, 2001. Many of us were here in Washington on that fateful day and knew that our lives had changed forever. 
   House Resolution 1420 recognizes September 11 as a day of solemn commemoration. This resolution extends our deepest condolences again to the friends, families, and loved ones of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. H. Res. 420 also honors the heroic service, actions and sacrifices of the first responders, officials and volunteers who came to the aid of the victims of these attacks. On this day, we remember the selfless valor that so many Americans displayed. This resolution also expresses our gratitude to the foreign leaders and citizens of all nations who have joined with the United States in fighting terrorism. H. Res. 1420 recognizes the service and sacrifices of the United States Armed Forces and their families who remain in the front lines of this fight. 
   Although we pause on September 11th to reflect and say thanks, on this day we should also remember that the forces that divide us from one another can never overcome the transcendent unity we have as Americans. As H. Res. 1420 states, this unspeakable act of terrorism ``was designed to intimidate the Nation and its allies, and to weaken the national resolve.'' However, seven years ago in the face of this tragedy, Members of Congress stood united, shoulder to shoulder on the steps on this Capitol and pledged to work together to remember this day and honor the sacrifice of the fallen. Today we remember that pledge. 
   In appreciation of that spirit, in memory of the valor of the heroes and the fallen of that day, I urge colleagues to join me in voting for House Resolution 1420.

   Mr. Speaker, it has been over two decades since there has been any meaningful updating of this important legislation. Effective job training gives workers the tools they need to make the most of their employment and economic opportunities. 
   When the first Trade Adjustment Assistance Act was passed in 1962 the job losses addressed by this law were mainly manufacturing jobs; today our economy faces the threat of job losses in the service industry as well. 
   H.R. 3920 makes important updates to this initiative, including provisions that close outdated loopholes to make anyone who loses a job as a result of a factory moving overseas to be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The bill doubles the training fund cap to re-train displaced workers from $220 to $440 million dollars, makes more service industry workers such as customer service workers eligible for assistance, and finally, increases the Health Care Tax Credit subsidy for displaced workers who have lost their healthcare coverage to 85 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is timely and needed legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote yes on H.R. 3920.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3997. Today, the United States faces the most significant financial crisis since the Great Depression. While we wish this action was unnecessary, this emergency requires bold steps to protect homeowners, small businesses, retirement savings plans, and community banks and to ensure that our economy can weather this storm. This bill should put us on the right path to recovery for our financial system. 
   Over the last several months we have seen the collapse of some our largest financial institutions, throwing our nation's financial system into turmoil. As one collapse has followed another, a dangerous lack of liquidity has beset the entire system. This freeze in the flow of capital means that remaining banks have ceased lending to one another, and loans for businesses and individuals are starting to become almost as scarce. If lending does not resume, Americans will be unable to grow their small business, buy a car, pay for college, or buy a home. Without action, this financial crisis will threaten the entire American economy. 
   I have spoken with the leaders of some of North Carolina's local and state banks and credit unions about the effect of this crisis on the communities they serve. They told me clearly: if we do not take action now, these problems could overtake the entire economy, affecting jobs, the vibrancy of our communities, and harming North Carolinians. 
   This bill is not the blank check that the Bush Administration originally proposed. H.R. 3997 contains key provisions, negotiated by Democratic leaders in Congress, to ensure this bill benefits Main Street. As I demanded when this plan was first proposed, this bill protects taxpayer money, provides help for struggling homeowners, prevents Wall Street CEOs from gaining a windfall at taxpayer expense, and provides the accountability and oversight that have been missing. While it contains strict oversight provisions, the plan also contains the flexibility needed to address a problem of this magnitude. 
   First and foremost, this plan protects taxpayer money. In taking action authorized by H.R. 3997, the Treasury Secretary must consider the interests of taxpayers, preserving home ownership, the needs of all financial institutions including small institutions and credit unions, and the needs of local communities. To ensure that the public shares in the benefit of the economic relief provided, Democratic leaders fought to add provisions that allow taxpayers, to share in profits if a financial institution we invest in grows healthy in the future. At the same time, H.R. 3997 requires any losses to the government to be recouped from financial institutions in the future. Additionally, this bill includes a fiscally responsible requirement that any profit resulting from this plan be used to reduce the growing national debt. 
   In order to further ensure that assistance benefits Main Street, H.R. 3997 includes provisions to coordinate and increase efforts to modify mortgages for homeowners. The bill provides authorization for loan guarantees and credit enhancement to prevent foreclosures, and requires a plan to encourage mortgage servicers to modify loans through the Federal Housing Administration's Hope for Homeowners and other initiatives. We will work to ensure people can remain in their homes when possible. 
   H.R. 3977 makes sure that the people who made this mess do not unduly profit at the public's expense. There are limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes for the financial institutions that receive this government assistance. It also allows taxpayers to recover bonuses paid to executives who promise gains that later turn out to be false or inaccurate.  
   Congress has also increased oversight and transparency in H.R. 3997. The final bill includes $250 billion as an initial effort to stabilize the markets, and authorizes the rest of the $700 billion request only after Presidential notification and Congressional oversight of the Treasury Department's actions. Any purchase by the Secretary must be publicly disclosed within two business days of the action. A strong oversight board has authority over the Treasury Secretary's actions, and the bill mandates detailed reports to Congress at regular intervals. Additionally, H.R. 3997 establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Secretary's authority. 
   Given the extent and range of the problems in our financial markets, it is critical that the Treasury Secretary have a variety of tools to address these problems. H.R. 3997 includes a Republican proposal that gives the Treasury Department the option to guarantee companies' troubled assets, including mortgage-backed securities, purchased before March 18, 2008, with insurance that is paid for through risk-based premiums paid by the financial industry. 
   H.R. 3997 provides liquidity to the market so that our banks have the confidence to make loans again. It is our hope that this will enable our financial markets to recover, but we cannot be certain that it will do so. The oversight provisions in H.R. 3997 will ensure that we can react to any further developments and take further action as necessary. 
   Madam Speaker, this crisis is wide-spread and threatens the financial security of this generation and the well-being of our children and grandchildren. I fervently wish that this action was not necessary, and that the markets could correct themselves. However, in order to protect Main Street from the impact of Wall Street's problems, I support H.R. 3997, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H.R. 6899, a comprehensive plan to use our Nation's resources and Americans' know-how to reduce prices and to free our Nation from the grips of foreign oil. 
   This legislation invests in renewable energy sources such as cellulosic ethanol, biomass and soybean diesel, creating good-paying jobs here at home and growing our rural economies. This legislation has opened up the Outer Continental Shelf. It has renewed drilling while demanding that oil companies use the leases they already have that have been issued or lose the leases to other oil companies that will actually produce oil and gas. It is time to end the giveaway to big oil companies that are reaping record profits while my folks in North Carolina and their families are struggling to afford to fill their own gas tanks. Today's bill does just that. 
   This legislation puts our Nation on a path toward a sustainable energy future through greater energy efficiency and conservation. This legislation is for the people of North Carolina and for America who would rather grow their own fuel instead of sending billions of dollars to the Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this progressive, futuristic piece of legislation to free America.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. 
   H.R. 6899 will increase American oil production, invest in renewable energy sources and new efficiency technology, end giveaways to big oil companies, and create jobs here at home. This legislation puts our Nation on a path toward energy independence through greater energy efficiency and conservation, and lowers the price average Americans consumers pay for the energy they need. 
   For too long, this administration and the Republicans in Congress have relied on a single approach to our Nation's energy policy, allowing big oil companies to decide when and where to drill, while failing to ensure that they pay their fair share to the American people for the use of our federal lands. For too long the major oil companies have enjoyed the highest profits ever recorded at the expense of the American consumer, all while utilizing only a fraction of the Federal land available to them for drilling. This has only served to increase our reliance on foreign oil. 
   The bill Democrats are proposing today represents a change in the direction for our Nation's energy policy. H.R 6899 puts our Nation on a path towards a sustainable renewable energy future by eliminating unnecessary tax breaks to oil companies and using these funds for research into alternative fuels and renewable energy and efficiency tax incentives. We can put American know-how to work, strengthening our economy and creating good-paying jobs here at home instead of $700 billion each year to the Middle East. We can use the resources of rural America to grow energy right here at home and strengthen our communities. 
   Finally Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6899 has shown that the Democratic Congress has listened to the American people and not the big oil companies. This is comprehensive legislation that includes a compromise that will responsibly open the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, for drilling, while demanding that oil companies use the leases they have already been issued or lose these leases to oil companies that actually want to produce oil. 
   This legislation gives States the authority to allow drilling from 50 to 100 miles offshore and makes all OCS waters beyond 100 miles immediately available for oil exploration. This puts our resources to work to meet our Nation's needs while at the same time protecting our coasts. 
   I know how high energy prices are hurting American families. This bill makes important changes to improve our energy supply and reduce costs. This is a bill that we can all support on behalf of the American people. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 6899.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7060, Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act. This legislation provides tax relief for millions of Americans while spurring business investment and innovation in renewable energy. 
   H.R. 7060 will benefit the families of millions of children by expanding the child tax credit to those earning $8,500 a year in 2009. This bill also helps families by extending the state and local sales tax deduction, and will help over 4 million families better afford college by providing a tuition deduction. As a former superintendent of schools, I am pleased that this legislation includes a tax deduction that will save money for more than 3 million teachers when they pay for classroom supplies and expenses. The bill also includes an additional $400 million for Quality Zone Academy Bonds to help states and localities address school construction and renovation needs. While I am a supporter of funding for local counties and municipalities, and I am disappointed that this bill does not include the four-year county payments extension for secure rural schools, I believe this bill contributes significantly to the needs of our families. 
   This bill provides critical support in the form tax breaks and incentives to the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. This bill extends the Research and Development Tax Credit for two years to spur American innovation and business investment as well as a two year extension of the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant improvements. 
   Developing alternative energy sources and reducing our dependence on foreign oil is one the most critical challenges facing our country. H.R. 7060 will increase the production of renewable fuels and renewable electricity, and encourage greater energy efficiency. This bill features an eight-year extension of the investment tax credit for solar energy and a multi-year extension of the production tax credit for other sources of alternative energy like biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solid waste. With millions of Americans struggling to afford rising gas prices, H.R. 7060 includes tax incentives for the installation of E-85 pumps for flex-fuel vehicles, and a $3,000 tax credit toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. There are also incentives for incorporating energy conservation in commercial buildings and residential structures. The energy provisions in H.R. 7060 will help create and preserve more than 500,000 good-paying green collar jobs at a time when our economy is struggling and unemployment is at a five-year high. 
   Finally, as a member of the House Budget Committee, I am pleased that this bill includes offsets that minimize its impact on the federal budget. H.R. 7060 is paid for by including provisions that close offshore tax loopholes and tighten taxes deductions for oil and gas companies. This attention to fiscal responsibility is even more important today as we face an uncertain economy and a growing deficit. 
   The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act is a crucial step towards getting our economy back on track and making our nation energy independent. I support H.R. 7060 and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7110, the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act of 2008. This bill will give economic support to Main Streets across the Nation, providing $60.8 billion to help families who are struggling and creating jobs that can put our economy back on track. 
   H.R. 7110 makes strategic investments to repair our Nation's aging infrastructure, improving our communities while also creating jobs and stimulating local economies. This bill provides $12.8 billion for bridge and highway improvements that will address longstanding needs, improving safety and reducing traffic congestion. H.R. 7110 includes a $5 billion investment in the Nation's water resource infrastructure to improve flood protection and hydropower capability. In addition, this stimulus package provides $3.6 billion to expand public transportation and meet growing demand as Americans face rising fuel costs. H.R. 7110 also includes $1 billion for repair and construction of public housing projects. This kind of funding produces $2.12 in economic return for every dollar invested. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill includes $3 billion for school construction and modernization funding to repair aging and unsafe schools, provide students with better technology in the classrooms, and improve energy efficiency. As the only former school superintendent serving in Congress, I am very concerned about the dire need for school infrastructure improvements, as quality education cannot take place in crumbling schools. Nearly every school district in this country has a list of repair projects that need funding, so investments in school construction and renovation can quickly make their way to the local economy, providing jobs and stimulating economic activity. Given the desperate need for school modernization and construction across the Nation, I am disappointed that H.R. 7110 does not leverage this funding through tax credits to support more activity, as in the bill that I have introduced with my friend Ways and Means Chairman CHARLIE RANGEL. I am hopeful that the House of Representatives will consider H.R. 2470, the America's Better Classrooms Act, at some future date. However, I am pleased that H.R. 7110 provides a starting point with this $3 billion investment. 
   As our Nation faces a struggling economy and we face the highest rate of unemployment since 1992, this bill will provide relief to struggling families across our country. This bill provides an additional 7 weeks of extended benefits for workers who have exhausted regular unemployment compensation, and an additional 13 weeks for workers in certain high-unemployment states. These are benefits that are directed to the folks who need them the most, and this funding will boost the overall economy because the dollars awarded will be spent quickly. H.R. 7110 also provides Medicaid increases that will prevent cuts to health insurance and health care services for low-income children and families; $2.6 billion to address rising food costs for seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income families; and $500 million for job training programs that will help Americans find and prepare for good jobs. 
   I support H.R. 7110, Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. 
   As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to quality higher education is the key to the American dream for working families. Unfortunately, college costs have skyrocketed in recent years even as many fine colleges and universities, like those in North Carolina, have gone to great lengths to keep higher education affordable. The Federal Government has an obligation to step up to the plate and provide more assistance, and H.R. 2669 makes several important changes to the Federal student financial assistance effort. 
   Specifically, H.R. 2669 would provide nearly $18 billion in college financial aid at no new cost to the taxpayers. The bill would increase the maximum Pell grant scholarship for low-income and moderate-income students by $500 over the next 5 years. It would cut in half the interest rate on need-based Federal student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years. This will save the typical borrower some $4,400 over the life of the loan. This provision alone could benefit more than 162,000 students in North Carolina. 
   H.R. 2669 would make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities--HBCUs--with $170 million in new grants for HBCUs, such as Shaw University and Fayetteville State University, in my congressional district. H.R. 2669 also would create a new designation of Predominantly Black Institutions, which are defined as schools that enroll students in financial need and have at least 40 percent African-American student enrollment. These schools would be eligible to receive $30 million in grant aid over 5 years for academic programs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, health education, and teacher education. This legislation would provide $228 million in funding over 4 years for Upward Bound that increases high school completion, college participation, and graduation rates among low-income and first-generation college students. 
   I enthusiastically support the bill's tuition assistance for excellent undergraduate students who agree to teach in the Nation's public schools and its loan forgiveness for college graduates that go into public service professions. In addition, H.R. 2669 would make important new investments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics--STEM--education that is so critical to our prosperity in the global economy. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller and his outstanding professional staff, especially Gaby Gomez, Denise Forte, and Mark Zuckerman, for working with me to help nonprofit lenders, like we have in North Carolina. Specifically, this bill provides non-profit and small lenders a significant boost to their bottom line earnings and their ability to compete with for-profit lenders. These lenders will save $85 million in the first year to re-invest in their college aid financing and nearly $500 million over 5 years to serve students even better. 
   As the legislative process moves forward, I want to continue to work with Chairman Miller to ensure that cuts to lender subsidies do not result in North Carolina students paying more for their loans than they do today. I am confident the final product will achieve that result, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 2669.

   Let me say, as the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to higher education is the key to the American dream for working families. The cost of attending college continues to skyrocket and puts it out of reach, as we have already heard and I won't state the numbers, for many working families and students. 
   In our State of North Carolina, Mr. Chairman, we have a unique situation where our State nonprofits provide significant benefits to students. I am concerned that this legislation could have the unintended consequences of reducing the benefits that our students will receive through our nonprofit lenders.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman, and look forward to working with you as the bill moves along to make sure that this takes care of our students.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this important first step toward making college more affordable. 
   As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to quality higher education is the key to the American Dream for working families. The costs of attending college continue to skyrocket and putting college out-of-reach for middle class families. Since 2001, tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation, and tuition and fees at private universities have jumped by 17 percent after inflation. According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial barriers will prevent 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a four-year public college over the next decade, and prevent another two million high school graduates from attending any college at all. 
   Unfortunately, recent Congresses and this Administration have failed to take action to help our working families and college students. In fact, the 109th Congress raided billions of dollars from federal support for college aid to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest few. And even yesterday, the Administration announced its opposition to H.R. 5 by stating college students do not need more help because college graduates ``have higher lifetime earnings.'' Sadly, this Administration just doesn't get it. 
   H.R. 5 is designed to make college more affordable and accessible by cutting the interest rate on subsidized student loans for undergraduates in half over the next five years. H.R. 5 will cut the interest rate from the current 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. As a strong supporter of education, I support H.R. 5 and also want this Congress to increase investments in Pell Grants for low-income families and other federal financial aid for college. Education is the great equalizer in our society because it gives each citizen the opportunity to make the most of his or her God-given abilities. The new Democratic Majority must reverse the failed priorities of the past and invest in education for greater opportunities for all Americans. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support budget discipline, and I am pleased the Democratic Leadership has made good on our promise of no new deficit spending. 
   I urge all my colleagues in joining with me to pass H.R. 5.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (SOUTHEASTERN DROUGHT -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call to the attention of Congress what is occurring in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. When you look at the statistics and look at the effects, there is only one word that can describe this drought--it is a total disaster. 
   This isn't a disaster like a tornado or a hurricane, where you have one big storm and it's over, or a big fire. This drought is a continuous process, and the impact adds up over time. The drought is the worst one on record in the Southeast and in my home State of North Carolina. 
   We know that this entire Southeast region has had about 19 inches less rainfall than we should have had this year, and some areas have received even less. You can see from this map what a large area of severe drought we now have. 
   The States that have been the hardest hit include Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Virginia. 
   In North Carolina, our Governor has ordered citizens to halt all nonessential water use. This drought has affected our farmers to an extent so great that it is now affecting our rural communities. Plants are having their production levels cut to save water. Some communities have only a few months of water supply remaining. In my district, the Second District of North Carolina, nearly the entire area has been afflicted by what is called an exceptional drought, and this is the most severe level. Farmers have been struggling all year from this truly epic weather condition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am working in Congress to provide some relief. Last month, the House Agriculture Committee held a hearing to shine a spotlight on this growing disaster, and the Governor of our State, Governor Easley, testified himself as to the magnitude of this crisis. 
   Many of my colleagues may have seen this week that in my neighboring State of Georgia, the Governor has even called a meeting and asked for prayer. I am all for praying for rain, but, my friends, it is going to take more than prayer. 
   I have written a letter to the President asking for assistance. This letter was signed by 54 of my fellow colleagues here in Congress from both sides of the aisle. 
   Farmers are some of the most resourceful and ingeniously productive people around, but there is just so much that you can do to grow crops, raise livestock or poultry without one of the essentials of life, and that is water. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight to raise a greater awareness, because we all need to work together to help solve this problem. People need to realize how serious it really is. 
   I am concerned that some folks may think the crisis might be solved if we get just a little rain. Unfortunately, our farmers tell me the damage has already been done, and I can agree, having visited a lot of farms. Even if we had a nice soaking rain this week and next week and the week after that and the week after that, it has been said that we will need 25 inches of rain in the next 6 months just to get the water level back to where it was. We've lost our cotton, our beans, our corn, and many of the other crops, and they won't be able to grow this winter unless we get more ground water. The crop this year is now lost. 
   The problem today is that too many Americans think that the food that they eat comes from the grocery store. I want them to understand, that's just where they go to pick it up. That food comes from a farm. They forget that it's the farmer out in the field working every day of the year to make sure that Americans have the most bountiful and least expensive food supply in the world. It's hard work, it's a huge gamble, and for the farmers in the Southeast this year, they lost. 
   It's time that this Congress, Mr. Speaker, joined hands and helped these folks. They have always been there for us, and now we need to be there for them. 
   Our farmers in rural communities desperately need assistance. It is my hope that we can pass the relief package before this year ends and that the President will sign it and will help these farmers and their families in rural communities across the whole Southeast be back in the fields next year providing food and fiber for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, as the only former State superintendent of schools serving in Congress, I have devoted my life to the well-being and development of children, and I strongly support Head Start. I rise in support of H.R. 1429, the Head Start for School Readiness Act. 
   In the global economy of the 21st century, lifelong learning is the pathway to the American Dream, and for many of our Nation's children, learning begins with Head Start. Over 20,000 children in North Carolina get prepared for school in Head Start or Early Head Start. 
   This act takes and builds on the success of Head Start, expanding and enhancing this fundamental initiative that has served over 20 million children and families nationwide since 1965. H.R. 1429 extends the benefits of Head Start to more of our Nation's low-income children, and raises the bar so that we can attract highly qualified Head Start providers through performance accountability, greater compensation, and higher standards. 
   Research continues to show that the first few years of a child's life are critical to a child's mental development: their brains grow exponentially and learning patterns are set. We must invest in these youngsters so that they may take full advantage of one of the premier education systems in the world by ensuring their school-readiness by age 5. Head Start successfully provides the stepping stones to lifelong learning. 
   This act provides the parents and children of our country an additional 4 years of this vital service, guaranteeing a 20 percent increase in funding by 2012. Education is the best investment we can make for our children, grandchildren, country, and world. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1429 updates, improves, and expands the successful services of Head Start. I commend Chairman MILLER for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to note that this budget resolution rejects the many proposed cuts in public education  by the President. The President proposes in his budget to eliminate a total of 47 programs. They are vocational education programs. They are programs for people who repair our plumbing in our homes, who build our houses, who build our roads, who supply the electrical work that gets done, programs like the Perkins Loan cancellations, Even Start, mentoring efforts, and the Reading is Fundamental initiative. 
   The Spratt budget would also restore initiatives designed to improve teacher quality like Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, Advanced Credentialing, and the Teacher Quality Enhancement initiative. If we are going to teach our children, let's have qualified people in the classroom. And it doesn't just automatically happen. It takes money. Industry will tell you that for every person they have, they spend a lot of money in investing in those people. And as the only former State school chief serving in this body, I am particularly pleased about the provision for education initiatives and innovations that have been included in the Spratt resolution. 
   I thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   This resolution provides greater investment in our Nation's schools, including school construction bonds. I have been working on this with Congressman Rangel for almost 10 years. We need quality places for our children to go to school. And there's important investments in things like Head Start, special education for those who really have needs, and to provide more money to fully fund secondary education. 
   The chairman's mark also provides for funding for America COMPETES Act. What is this? It expands math and science education at the secondary level. That is in high school. We can't get them in the universities if we can't them get them through high school. And Lord knows that in this economy, we need them. Education is the single most important investment that we can make in our future. 
   I support this budget resolution. I urge my colleagues to vote for it and support it. 
   I thank the gentlelady for this opportunity to speak.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (KIDS IN DISASTERS WELL-BEING, SAFETY, AND HEALTH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3495, ``Kids in Disasters Well-Being, Safety, and Health Act of 2007.'' My life's work has been to provide for a better future for the next generation, and H.R. 3495 is in keeping with this purpose. 
   This bill ensures that children will be protected and prepared to respond to a disaster or other emergency by establishing a National Commission on Children and Disasters. This commission will provide a vital assessment of the needs of children before, during, and after all hazards, disasters, and emergencies. This bill addresses many--but not all--of the enhancements to preparedness for children that I have championed on the Committee on Homeland Security. Specifically, I have been exploring how to improve preparedness for children and schools since the committee's inception. I look forward to continuing the committee's work on school preparedness and working with my colleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on this critical homeland security issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, in August 2005, my colleagues and I on the Committee on Homeland Security requested that the Government Accountability Office, GAO, examine the programs at the Departments of Homeland Security, Education, and Health and Human Services that are designed to increase the emergency preparedness of primary and secondary public school officials, teachers, and students. In 2005, I released a report entitled ``Reading, Writing, and Readiness: A Survey of School Emergency Plans in the 2nd Congressional District of North Carolina.'' The report highlighted the following three assessments: first, Federal efforts in school preparedness are uncoordinated and create confusion in the school community; secondly, there is a desire among schools for the Department of Homeland Security to take a leadership role in school preparedness; and  finally, school administrators are feeling the squeeze of Federal budget cuts in emergency preparedness. 
   Although schools are among the safest places for our children, and school administrators do a great job of preparing for emergencies, we have evidence, both objective and anecdotal, suggesting that schools need more assistance to be fully prepared to respond to any serious crisis, including terrorism. 
   As the only Member of Congress that served as a school superintendent, I understand the burdens faced by administrators when implementing emergency preparedness plans with limited resources. We need to continue to work to ensure that the Federal Government engages our communities in an effective and efficient manner to mitigate such burden. 
   Earlier this year, I included language in H.R. 1684, the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act, that addresses this critical issue. Specifically, it tasks the DHS Under Secretary for Policy to ensure that all policies, programs and activities developed by the Department and its components appropriately take into consideration the needs of and impact on children. Additionally, the Assistant Secretary would then work with the Office of Grants and Training in FEMA to support emergency preparedness activities for schools. Like the current bill, my provision raises awareness in Congress and within Federal agencies to ensure that the needs of children, schools, and other child-centered facilities are sufficiently understood and incorporated into Federal, State, local, and tribal preparedness, response, and recovery plans and activities for natural disasters as well as acts of terrorism. 
   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 3495 establishes a National Resource Center on Children and Disasters, similar to the ``one-stop'' shop clearinghouse that Homeland Security Chairman Thompson and I requested from DHS Secretary Chertoff and Education Secretary Spellings. This resource center will be invaluable to school administrators as a single source for Federal grants and training available to develop emergency management plans at their schools and throughout their districts. 
   I commend my colleague, CORINNE BROWN, for introducing this bill and I am looking forward to working with her to ensure that the needs of children are properly assessed and addressed by the Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to join me in this cause, and in voting in favor of this legislation.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 2272, the Americn Competes Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. 
   I am pleased that the new Democratic Majority in Congress is providing a new direction for our country through common sense legislation. As an active Member of the New Democrats' Coalition, I support this bill that will help ensure our nation's global economic competitiveness through investment in math, science, engineering, and technology education and a renewed commitment to basic research. 
   The conference report on H.R. 2272 is a bipartisan measure to implement an Innovation Agenda boldly responds to the global economic challenges identified in the 2005 National Academy of Science report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' As a former member of the House Committee on Science, I have worked for many years to pass legislation to encourage innovators and develop the most valuable workforce in the world. I want to congratulate Chairman BART GORDON and Ranking Member RALPH HALL and the staff of the Science Committee for their hard work in producing this outstanding product. 
   As the only former state schools chief serving in Congress, I am pleased that this bill will invest in 25,000 new teachers through professional development, summer training institutes, graduate education assistance, and National Science Foundation scholarships. It ensures more highly qualified teachers in the classroom, in the fields of mathematics, science, engineering, technology and critical foreign languages. 
   H.R. 2272 establishes a public-private partnership with the business community and institutions of higher education to develop efforts to educate and train mathematicians, scientists and engineers to meet the workforce demands of the business community. The bill expands access to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes and increases the number of qualified AP/IB teachers. The conference report enhances the ability of states to build more competitive workforces to meet the challenges of recruiting and retaining students in innovative fields. 
   The bill also broadens the participation of minorities and women in science and engineering fields at all levels from kindergarten students to advanced researchers. The bill focuses on small business innovation by doubling funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and creates a new Technology Innovation Program for small and medium-sized companies. Finally, this legislation creates a ground-breaking initiative, the Advanced Research Projects for Energy (ARPA-E), modeled after DARPA that has brought us such innovations as the Internet, to provide talent and resources for high-risk, high-reward energy and research and technology development, and to help attract investment for the next generation of revolutionary technologies.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, my friend from Arizona has already made a statement why this earmark ought to stay in here. It really is making a difference for the industry, and it's employing people. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. 
   The funding for this wood utilization grant helps fund the Wood Machining and Tooling Research Program, as you have just heard. Part of it is really on the campus of NC State University, a land grant university. It has been matched more than dollar for dollar, every Federal dollar by private dollar. 
   This is not a giveaway program but, rather, one that has been designed to work to make the Southeastern furniture industry more competitive, as you have heard, in the global economy. This research program investigates and solves problems related to manufacturing tools used in the wood machining and manufacturing operations. 
   Other than Wood Machining and Tooling Research Program, there is no other Federal research program to support U.S. wood manufacturing and tooling companies who are competing with low-wage jobs on the other side of the world with other countries. It is only right to invest in the industries we have remaining in our rural parts of this country when outsourcing these industries overseas has hurt States all across America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6275, Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. 
   H.R. 6275 is critical to easing the burden on middle-class taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, was originally intended to make sure that the Nation's wealthiest citizens did not avoid paying taxes altogether. However, it was not indexed for inflation and the AMT now affects millions of middle income tax payers across the country. H.R. 6275 would extend for 1 year AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits and increases the AMT exemption amount to $69,950 for joint filers and $46,200 for individuals. At a time of economic uncertainty and rising gas and food prices, H.R. 6275 would provide over 25 million families with tax relief. In my district alone, over 33,000 families would be affected by the AMT this year. 
   As a member of the Budget Committee, I am also pleased that this bill includes offsets and is budget-neutral. Instead of adding to our national debt, H.R. 6275 responsibly pays for itself by closing a loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay less taxes, encouraging tax compliance, repealing subsidies for the five biggest oil companies, and tightening tax laws on foreign-owned companies. I support H.R. 6275, Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3, the bipartisan DeGette-Castle bill on stem cell research that is identical to legislation passed by the Republican 109th Congress and vetoed last year by President Bush. 
   This bill allows federal funding for stem cell research that gives hope to 100 million Americans and their families afflicted by debilitating or life-threatening diseases. This research is critical to find new treatments and possible cures to terrible diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. 
   It is important to note this bill's ethical safeguards, including requirements that forbid financial inducements for donations, mandate informed and written consent for donation, and requires HHS and the National Institutes of Health to produce ethical guidelines. DeGette-Castle promotes the most ethical use of discarded fertility clinic products because rather than flushing them down the drain, ethically-monitored scientists can utilize them to promote life-saving research. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is important policy matter, but for me, it's personal. My college basketball coach, a friend and mentor for several decades is a victim of Alzheimer's disease. Others I am close to suffer from Lou Gehrig's disease. After prayerful consideration, I have arrived at the strong conclusion that we must allow the ethical advance of research to relieve human suffering.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3221, American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and amendments to the bill. This bill is a critical step towards stabilizing our housing market, and providing assistance to thousands of Americans facing foreclosure. 
   There are grave problems facing our current housing market and economy. Decreasing home values and lack of available credit are damaging the market, and skyrocketing mortgages have led thousands of families to face the frightening prospect of foreclosure. In my state of North Carolina alone, PEW Charity Trusts and the Center for Responsible Lending estimate there will be 53,254 foreclosures in 2008 and 2009. Not only does foreclosure strike at the heart of these families' financial stability, but unfortunately the damage spreads across all of our communities. The same study shows that over 330,000 homes in North Carolina will be devalued by the spillover impact of the foreclosures, and North Carolina stands to lose over $860 million in property values. 
   However, H.R. 3221 is a comprehensive package that can provide relief to these families and our communities in a variety of ways. Provisions in this bill reform and modernize the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as government sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These programs allow for stability in the housing market and by strengthening their loan limits and regulations, they can serve as a safer alternative to the riskier subprime loans we have recently seen. The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 also includes a tax benefit for first-time homebuyers as well as an additional credit on property taxes for existing homeowners who claim the standard deduction. These measures will help revive the housing market and get our sluggish economy moving in the right direction. 
   This bill also creates a voluntary FHA initiative that provides mortgage refinancing assistance to allow families to stay in their homes while also strengthening the housing market. This voluntary plan would require lenders to write-down some of the existing mortgage in order to qualify for FHA backing, and would require borrowers to return portions of any future profits on the house to the government in order to prevent foreclosure. It is important to note that under H.R. 3221, only owner-occupied homes facing foreclosure can qualify for this mortgage assistance, and speculators, investors, and second-homeowners are not eligible. This provision represents a compromise by all participating parties and can keep people in their homes and improve surrounding communities. 
   I support the passage of H.R. 3221, American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3773, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This bill will help protect our Nation's security from terrorist threats while also protecting the civil rights and freedoms of our citizens. 
   On November 15, 2007, I voted in favor of the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective (RESTORE) Act that passed the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 227 to 189. The FISA Amendments Act includes and enhances the provisions from the RESTORE Act that form a strong framework for how our intelligence agencies operate. This bill requires the FISA court to approve targeting and minimization procedures to ensure that Americans are not targeted and their communications are not disseminated. These procedures would have to be approved prior to any surveillance, with the exception of emergency cases that would allow the government to begin surveillance immediately, provided that they obtain approval from the FISA court within 30 days. Under the FISA Amendments Act, this requirement would extend to American citizens at home and as well as those traveling abroad. To further enhance accountability, this legislation would create a Congressional commission that would conduct hearings and investigation into the President's recent warrantless wiretapping program. This bill grants new authorities for conducting surveillance and collecting intelligence against terrorist organizations, while preserving the requirement that the government obtain a FISA court order, based on probable cause, when targeting Americans. 
   While the FISA Amendments Act does not include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies, it does ensure the ability of these companies to fully defend themselves if they are sued in a court of law. This bill provides these telecommunications companies a way to present their defenses in secure proceedings and gives them access to any documents relating to their case that the government could otherwise withhold as ``state secrets.'' 
   We owe our intelligence agencies clear rules and guidelines in order to perform their duties to the fullest, just as we owe it to every American to protect their rights and freedoms. I support the passage of H.R. 3773, The FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to the Children's Health and Medicare Preservation Act. I fully support the goals of this legislation--to provide healthcare to millions of uninsured children, to improve Medicare benefits for our seniors, and to help rural areas provide healthcare. Unfortunately, however, I cannot support legislation that unfairly impacts the second district and all of North Carolina with the burdens of this cost. 
   I have been a long-time supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, and I am proud that the Budget Committee on which I serve authorized the increase reflected in this bill. I support reauthorizing and strengthening SCHIP, without which nearly six million children will lose access to healthcare. In North Carolina, NC Health Choice provides cost-effective and high-quality health services to 250,000 at-risk children. An additional 180,000 uninsured children in North Carolina are eligible for coverage, and the $50 billion in the budget I helped write would enable more of these children to be covered. 
   It is also vital that we enable physicians to provide health services, in SCHIP, Medicaid, .and in Medicare. This legislation implements a 2-year fix that enables doctors to continue their participation in the program without going bankrupt. Without this fix, North Carolina physicians will lose $460 million for the care of elderly and disabled patients over the next 2 years, and face a 1.6 percent geographic cut above the baseline reductions in other parts of the country. I appreciate Medicare physicians who have made many sacrifices to continue to cover the Medicare population, and without a fix this year doctors may start dropping out and refuse to see Medicare patients. We must maintain our commitment to universal coverage for our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities. This legislation takes a positive step in that direction. 
   There are many other positive provisions in this legislation: fixes that strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund, provide more access to preventative care, and provide lower premiums for many seniors; extensions for important rural health care initiatives that ensure access to care for people across the country, especially in the second district of North Carolina; support for the Special Diabetes Programs, which provide essential 
   funding for research and innovative diabetes prevention activities for thousands of children in communities throughout the country; provides parity for  mental health coverage under Medicare; the list goes on and on. I understand what these improvements mean to the people of North Carolina, and I wholeheartedly support them. 
   These provisions have a cost, however, and as important as these priorities are we also must value the principle of fairness. I do not support smoking, and I have never smoked, but this bill is not fair to those who grow or use tobacco. The cigarette tax is regressive; falling hardest on those who can least afford it. Although it is a national tax, it also unevenly impacts the country, with North Carolina and a few other states footing the bill for the benefits the CHAMP Act seeks to deliver. North Carolina's citizens pay over four percent of the costs of this legislation while receiving about two percent of the benefit. 
   Researchers at North Carolina State University estimate that North Carolina's economy would lose at least $540 million a year through the tax's indirect impact as well. North Carolina's tobacco farmers grow a legal crop. These hard working farm families have suffered greatly from transformations in the global economy. Because my district is the second largest tobacco producing district in the country, H.R. 3162 disproportionately affects my constituents who work hard to be able to pay their bills and provide a better life for their children. This just doesn't pass the fairness test. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could support this bill for all of its laudable goals. I join with my colleagues in my desire to provide healthcare for children, strengthen Medicare and protect it from privatization, and improve health services for rural communities, diabetes patients, and others. When we are able to do so without placing undue burden on North Carolina's farmers and low-income families, I will gladly vote in favor of doing so. With the current funding mechanism, however, I cannot support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the President's misguided veto of H.R. 1591, U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. We need a new direction in Iraq. 
   This legislation contains every penny the President has requested for our troops in Iraq and adds $4 billion more. The bill includes additional funding for military health care and military housing and provides $1.8 billion not requested by the President to begin meeting the unmet health care needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   As the Representative for Fort Bragg, I strongly support our troops, their families and their communities. Our superb military men and women have done everything that has been asked of them and done it well. America's military victory in Iraq was achieved when Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled. But the Administration went to war without a plan to win the peace, and our military victory has been bogged down in a mindless occupation led by bitterly stubborn politicians here at home. 
   Just last month, Vice President Cheney insisted that Saddam Hussein had been allied with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network despite all evidence to the contrary. Last night, the President vetoed this legislation in favor of his failed strategy of stay the course. The leadership of this Administration continues to be in a state of denial, and Congress must assert its rightful role in our nation's policymaking. I will vote to override this veto for a new direction in Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of House Joint Resolution 20 to fund the essential services of the Federal Government through September 20 of this year. 
   On November 7, the American people voted to fire the former Republican majority for gross  mismanagement of the Nation's finances and woeful neglect of the priorities of the American people. This imperfect legislation is necessary to clean up the mess the former majority left behind. 
   Mr. Speaker, the former Republican majority passed only 2 of the 11 bills necessary to fund the discretionary accounts of the Federal Government. Failing to pass their obligatory legislation by October 1, 2006, the former majority passed a stopgap measure to keep the Government functioning when they adjourned the 109th Congress. Our new Democratic majority was left with the unfinished business of the fiscal year 2007 appropriations legislation. Today marks the 123rd day since the start of fiscal year 2007, and the President's 2008 budget request is scheduled to be delivered to this Congress on Monday. Now is the time to finish last year's work, so we can move on to the essential work at hand to deliver a new direction for the American people. 
   Although I am disappointed that funding priorities for our districts were left out of this bill, it is important to note several important improvements this bill makes over previous year's appropriations. For example, H.J. Res. 20 will raise the maximum Pell grant award from $4,050 to $4,310, the first increase in 4 years of this critical effort to make college more affordable for working families. The bill increases special education funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, by $200 million. This Continuing Resolution will increase low-income public schools' Title I funding by $125 million and thereby reverse the decline in Title I education funding. Even with these increases, Federal investment in education continues to lag far behind the levels needed to create a first-class school system for the 21st century, and I look forward to working to address these shortfalls in the fiscal year 2008 appropriations legislation. 
   I am concerned about the military construction projects left out of this legislation, and I want Congress to work on a bipartisan basis to address this problem in the fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations legislation. This bill includes an important increase of $3.6 billion for veterans health care to meet the needs of an additional 325,000 patients, and it increases funding for health care services at the Department of Defense by $1.2 billion, including treating soldiers wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. The CR also increases funding for the basic allowance for military housing by $500 million. Finally, the bill increases funding for intelligence analysts at the FBI that are critical to protect the American people from the terrorist threat as well as increasing funding for COPS local law enforcement. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a new member of the House Budget Committee, I have learned over the past several weeks that the budget mess created by the former majority is far worse than the American people know. It will take a lot of hard work to restore order to our Nation's books. H.J. Res. 20 is the first necessary if unpleasant step in that vital effort. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference agreement. This is the first time in ten years that we will reauthorize the Higher Education Act, landmark legislation that has strengthened our colleges and universities and made the dream of higher education possible for countless Americans. I commend the bipartisan, bicameral work of Education and Labor Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member Buck McKeon, and Senators Kennedy, Mikulski and Enzi who crafted this compromise, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it. 
   Our Nation's competitiveness depends on a vigorous college and university system and on ample opportunities for Americans to pursue their educational goals. As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to higher education is the key to the American Dream for working families. H.R. 4137 is an important step to make sure our schools remain strong and that students from all walks of life can go to college. 
   H.R. 4137 keeps costs down for students and provides additional support through Pell Grants and education loans. It strengthens successful college-readiness initiatives and bolsters cooperation between school districts and teacher-preparation faculties. It improves access to emergency notification services for students. And it makes the process of applying to and planning for school easier: streamlining the federal student financial aid application; creating the ``College Navigator'' to provide cost and aid data to prospective students; and ensuring professors and students know the costs of course textbooks before the semester starts. 
   I am pleased that this bill includes support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities in my district and across North Carolina, recognizing schools that have added master's degree programs with a new source of grant funding. It also provides new funding for Predominately Black Institutions. These schools, which include Fayetteville State University, Shaw University and North Carolina Wesleyan in my Congressional district, have an important ongoing role in improving educational opportunities for African Americans. I am also pleased that the conference agreement recognizes the situation of military families, like so many families of soldiers at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, who move frequently or are deployed abroad. H.R. 4137 requires states to offer in-state tuition rates to soldiers and their dependents when the soldier is deployed for more than 30 days. We must not allow service to our country to prevent the education of a soldier or his or her family. 
   Mr. Speaker, education is the key to better lives and a brighter future for individuals and our Nation. H.R. 4137 improves educational opportunities for all Americans. I am pleased to support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important legislation, and I commend my friend, Chairman IKE SKELTON for his leadership in crafting this bipartisan product. 
   I support this conference report because it focuses on the readiness crisis of the United States military and puts our men and women in uniform first and foremost. It will provide our soldiers in harm's way with the best gear and force protection possible. As a veteran of the U.S. Army and as the Representative for Fort Bragg, I support this bill that will provide our troops better health care, better pay, and the benefits they have earned. 
   America has the finest military in the world. Unfortunately, the current Administration's policies in Iraq have depleted our great military and put tremendous strain on our troops. Army readiness has dropped to unprecedented levels, and Army National Guard units have, on average, only 40 percent of the required equipment. And many stateside units are not fully equipped and would not be considered ready if called upon to respond during an emergency such as a hurricane. 
   This conference report helps restore our nation's military readiness by creating a $1 billion Strategic Readiness Fund to address equipment shortfalls, fully funding the Army's and Marine Corps' equipment reset requirements and authorizing $980 million to provide the National Guard and Reserve critically needed equipment. 
   This bill protects our troops in harm's way by authorizing $17.6 billion, an increase of $865 million, for additional MRAPs vehicle armor, $4.8 billion for anti-IED road-side bomb efforts, $3.3 billion for up-armored Humvees, $1.5 billion for add-on armor for other vehicles and $1.2 billion for body armor. 
   The measure supports our troops and their families, by giving the military a pay raise larger than requested by the President, prohibiting fee increases in TRICARE and the TRICARE pharmacy program, and strengthening benefits for the troops and their families, as promised in the GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century. 
   It includes the Wounded Warrior Act, which responds to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center scandal by improving the care of injured soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan--addressing many of the issues raised by the Dole-Shalala Commission and implementing several of its recommendations. 
   It improves accountability and cracks down on waste, fraud and abuse in contracting including requiring new steps to manage and oversee contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan and requiring detailed new regulations for private security contractors, such as Blackwater employees, mandating the appropriate use of force. 
   The bill also includes new bipartisan reporting requirements under which DOD will regularly brief Congress on the planning taking place to responsibly redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq. It incorporates the National Guard Empowerment Act, which gives the National Guard enhanced authorities to fulfill its expanded role in the Nation's defense, including authorizing a fourth star for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, requiring at least one deputy of the Northern Command to be a National Guard Officer, and making the National Guard Bureau a joint activity of the DOD. And it requires the Pentagon to include in its quarterly readiness reports the state-by-state capability of the National Guard to achieve its homeland and civil support missions, such as disaster response. The bill increases end strength by authorizing 13,000 additional soldiers for the Army and 9,000 additional Marines in FY 2008. 
   Significantly, this legislation provides all service members a pay raise of 3.5 percent, which is 0.5 percent more than the President's budget request, and increases monthly hardship duty pay to a maximum of $1,500 (up from $150 per month), and provides special pays and bonuses. 
   The bill will also upgrade military health care for our troops, veterans and military retirees. It preserves health benefits by prohibiting fee increases in TRICARE and the TRICARE pharmacy services for military personnel and retirees. It prohibits cuts in military medical personnel and fully funds the Defense Health program facility maintenance, particularly at Walter Reed. It extends VA health insurance for service members who served in combat in the Persian Gulf War or future hostilities for five years instead of two years. And the conference report enhances benefits specifically for reservists. 
   I commend my North Carolina colleague Congressman DAVID PRICE for his work on contractor accountability, and I support the inclusion in this conference report of his legislation to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse in contracting. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many more provisions of this important legislation worthy of support, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference Report to accompany S. Con. Res. 70, Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009. This Budget Resolution strengthens our economy, restores fiscal discipline, and makes America safer. 
   A budget is a statement of our priorities. As the only former State schools chief serving in Congress, I am particularly pleased about this measure's provisions for education and innovation. This resolution rejects the President's proposed education cuts and instead provides greater investment in our Nation's schools, including the school construction bonds Chairman Rangel and I have been working on for nearly a decade and increased Impact Aid for federally impacted local public schools. 
   As a Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am pleased that after 7 years of this administration failing to address fully some of our most pressing security needs, this budget provides the necessary resources to meet critical threats to the Nation. Specifically, this budget resolution rejects the President's proposed cuts to critical State and local law enforcement initiatives, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Byrne Grants, and the COPS initiative. I strongly believe that homeland security starts with hometown security and I am pleased that this resolution rejects the President's misguided cuts. 
   I am also pleased to report that the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution also makes our Nation's veterans a top priority. This budget is strongly supported by all the major veterans organizations because it provides $3.3 billion more than the President's proposed budget for 2009 and $39 billion more over 5 years. This budget continues our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care by providing an 11 percent increase from last year. This resolution also rejects health care fees and TRICARE enrollment fee increases and includes additional funding to speed the veterans' disability claims process. I am proud to represent thousands of veterans in North Carolina's Second Congressional District, and they deserve a budget that reflects the importance of the sacrifice they have made in serving our country. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have become increasingly concerned about the legacy of debt this administration is passing on to future generations. The $5.6 trillion projected surplus that the administration inherited when it took office has been transformed into a $3.2 trillion deficit. More than 80 cents of every dollar of new debt since 2001 is owed to foreign investors, including foreign governments. The high level of indebtedness to foreign investors heightens the American economy's exposure to potential instability or even from financial threat from unfriendly foreign governments, and places additional burdens on our children and grandchildren. It is a massively irresponsibe tax on posterity. 
   However, this Budget Resolution is a positive step in restoring fiscal responsibility. Using realistic Congressional Budget Office estimates, this budget reaches balance in 2012, remains in balance in 2013, and posts smaller deficits than the President's proposed budget for the next 3 years. In addition, this budget continues the House of Representatives' emphasis on fiscal discipline by following the pay-as-you-go rule. 
   On behalf of North Carolina's children and working families, I support the Budget Conference Report for Fiscal Year 2009 and urge my colleagues to join me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the omnibus appropriations bill. 
   This is good news from Washington. We can always find problems with things if we look for them. For education, for veterans, for health care for children, many other programs, these are things people have been waiting for. 
   And I'm very pleased that the House is scheduled to vote on a disaster assistance package to provide relief to our farmers suffering from record droughts in the Southeast. My farmers are hurting, and this omnibus appropriations bill will provide some $600 million for disaster assistance. 
   My congressional district in North Carolina has been afflicted by what's called ``Exceptional Drought.'' This is the most serious category in America. Every county in the State is experiencing drought conditions. The whole Southeast is experiencing record drought. This aid will bring real relief to rural communities. 
   I have been proud to lead this effort. In September I wrote a bipartisan letter to the President signed by 54 of my colleagues from both political parties to make the case for disaster relief. I've been very pleased to work with Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, Agriculture Committee Chairman Peterson, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Obey to get this done, and I want to thank them for their leadership, and our farmers thank them. 
   I grew up on a Johnston County farm, and I have lived in a farm community all my life. And as a senior member of the House Ag Committee, I am pleased that we have finally gotten this football into the end zone. Now we will do the clincher. This disaster assistance is a major achievement and an important step forward for America's farmers. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this rule and then voting for the underlying omnibus bill that will make a difference not only for rural America but for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on America. 
   Though it has been six years since that fateful day, time cannot diminish the memories of those lost. Six years ago tomorrow, America was struck by an unspeakable tragedy that shook the foundations of our society and changed our Nation forever. On September 11, 2001, we saw the very face of evil. And on that day and every day since, we have felt the heartbeat of America. 
   The people of this country responded as never before, and our government also responded. We have been reminded of the service and sacrifice of Americans who are ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. Americans from all comers of our country and in North Carolina have given of themselves to help the victims' families. Our neighbors and friends have been deployed to Afghanistan and elsewhere to fight for our freedom. Our police officers, firefighters, EMS and other first responders have shown selfless devotion every day on our streets and in our communities. 
   I applaud all of those who are serving or who have served in defense of America and our interests. They have responded with professionalism, precision and when needed, force, to root out the cowardly perpetrators and protect Americans and our interests both here and abroad. Let us continue to pray for the safe return of those who are still in harm's way and honor and thank those who have given their lives. 
   We also must honor those thousands of innocent people who lost their lives that day and remember the bravery and sacrifice of the fire fighters, law enforcement officers and rescue worked who worked feverishly to save them, some of whom still suffer ill effects from that effort. Though somewhat eased by the passage of time, the grief of a nation still smolders. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation. This supplemental appropriations conference report contains vitally important funding for critical priorities and unmet needs. For example, this bill includes $1.7 billion more than the President requested for military health care, including funds to correct the scandalous conditions at Walter Reed and other military hospitals. It includes another $1.7 billion for veterans' health care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness of our stateside troops and $1.4 billion for military housing allowances. A nation at war simply must provide necessary funds to support our troops. 
   In addition, this legislation includes $3.1 billion for military construction to implement the BRAC mandates that impact Fort Bragg in my Congressional District and military communities all across the country. It is important to note that the former Republican Congressional Majority failed to pass the military construction appropriations and imperiled these priority projects. This legislation corrects that failure. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will assert some measure of oversight and accountability to a war policy that has been tragically mismanaged by this administration for too long. We need a new direction to rebuild our military and refocus on the true threat to America from al Qaeda and the Islamist jihadists who attacked us on 9/11. We must deploy our military might to eliminate Osama bin Laden and the true ``grave and gathering threat'' to America. 
   We must pass this legislation to send a wake-up call to the President that ``Stay The Course'' is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable policy. I urge my colleagues to support a new direction and vote for the conference report. 
   Should the President veto this bill, as he has indicated, I believe he should then meet with Congressional Leadership to work together and forge a consensus on these vitally important matters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of our brave men and women in uniform, the police officers, firefighters and other public service officers who protect our communities. 
   As yesterday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day, there is no better time to call on the Department of Justice to award the benefits due to our law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our Nation. 
   For 30 years now we have made a strong statement about the value our Nation places on the contribution for those who serve our community through the Public Safety Officers Benefit plan. About 4 years ago, however, I learned the PSOB was routinely rejecting claims or requiring burdensome documentation from these officers and first responders who died from a heart attack or stroke while serving our communities. I felt that this was wrong, and so did most of my colleagues here in Congress. In a strong bipartisan effort, Congress unanimously passed and the President signed it and the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act became law. 
   Since 2003, when the law was enacted, only two claims have been awarded out of the more than 240 received, while nearly 40 claims have been rejected. The rest languish in a bureaucratic mess. 
   I urge the Department of Justice to act swiftly and fairly on the remaining claims and pay these claims to provide this much needed and much deserved benefit as we observe National Police Week.

This legislation contains funding for our troops, expands education benefits for veterans, extends unemployment benefits for workers and provides assistance for the victims of the floods in the MidWest. 
   This bill contains $161.8 billion for DOD funding for our troops to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the representative of Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, I'm pleased that this bill provides $2.2 billion over the President's request to fully fund military quality of life initiatives--including funding for military child care centers, military hospitals and VA hospitals. For our returning troops, it includes a new GI bill that restores full, 4-year college scholarships to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to help make them part of an economic recovery like the veterans of World War II. This legislation also provides up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every state to workers exhausting the 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits, and provides $2.65 billion for urgent disaster relief in response to Midwestern floods and tornadoes. 
   I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress as well as the President and the Administration, to provide a new direction in Iraq and to meet the critical needs of the people of North Carolina's Second Congressional District.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Chairman Skelton, let me thank you for your friendship and for your extraordinary leadership on the Committee on Armed Services. I appreciate your willingness to engage me in the important topic of suicide prevention in our military forces. 
   As you know, earlier this year, my constituent, Master Sergeant (retired) Christopher Scheuerman, testified before the Subcommittee on Military Personnel about the tragic circumstances surrounding the suicide of his son, Private First Class Jason Drew Scheuerman. Jason was deployed with the 3rd Infantry Division at Forward Operating Base Normandy in Iraq, and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from his M16 rifle. Jason showed clear signs of mental distress, but the system failed Jason. 
   Recent reports indicate the Army suicide rate is the highest in 26 years of record keeping. While there are many outstanding mental health professionals in the Army system, the command structure creates an inherent conflict of interest and a lack of independent objectivity. 
   Servicemembers are currently allowed a second civilian opinion, but often find it nearly impossible to access an outside mental health provider. I appreciate the fact that this bill addresses the issue of suicide prevention by directing the Secretary to consider how the military can make a second opinion more accessible, including the possibility of providing a second medical evaluation in combat theater by  telephonic evaluation. I know that that is a somewhat controversial suggestion, but we must find a way to stop preventable suicides like Jason Scheuerman. We owe our servicemen and women no less. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue to work with you, Chairwoman Davis and Ranking Member McHugh on this important issue, and I hope that the Secretary will undertake this study immediately so that it is possible for our troubled servicemembers to obtain a second civilian health opinion.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5658, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. This legislation authorizes $601.4 billion for defense programs in FY 2009, including $70 billion in emergency funds authorized specifically to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is funding that is critical to our nation's defense, as well as to the troops serving so valiantly in the wars being waged on two fronts. 
   Thanks in a large part to the leadership of Chairman Skelton, this legislation provides greater funding than had been requested by the President for equipment depleted by the war in Iraq, including new combat vehicles, new battle gear for the Army National Guard and reserves, military pay raises, and shipbuilding. 
   H.R. 5658 authorizes $25.4 billion for defense health-care programs, and blocks the president's plan to raise user fees for programs such as Tricare and deductibles for service members and military retirees. This legislation will also authorize an increase of 7,000 active-duty Army personnel, and provide for 5,000 more Marine Corps personnel than current levels. 
   This legislation also provides for a 3.5 percent pay raise for active duty military, rolls back proposed benefit reductions to spousal benefits, and increases funding for military housing upgraded for bases like Fort Bragg, North Carolina, located in my district. 
   Mr. Chairman this is a good bill for our troops. It is our duty, our charge as members of this body, to ensure that those who protect and defend our nation in this all-volunteer army receive the best health care, pay, and living conditions that we can provide for them. We owe this to them. 
   I support this legislation and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.

   I am pleased to note that H.R. 6049 will benefit the families of millions of children by expanding the child tax credit to those earning $8,500 a year. This bill will also provide tax relief by extending the State and local sales tax deduction, provide property tax relief for 30 million homeowners, and help families afford college with the tuition deduction. As the only former school superintendent serving in Congress, I am especially pleased to note that this bill is supported by the National Education Association because it includes an extension of the tax deduction for educators who help supply their classrooms, and an extension of the Quality Zone Academy Bonds school modernization program that helps school districts address renovation and repair needs. 
   H.R. 6049 includes important tax relief provisions for businesses as well as individuals  and families. This bill extends the Research and Development Tax Credit for over 27,000 businesses, the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant improvements, and the tax credit for the environmental remediation of brownfields areas. We need to strengthen our economy by helping to spur American innovation with investment in American businesses. 
   Developing alternative energy sources and ending our dependence on foreign oil is one of the most critical challenges facing our nation. H.R. 6049 includes several provisions that will spur innovation in this area such as an extension of investment and production tax credits for solar energy, wind energy, and energy derived from biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solid waste. In addition, H.R. 6049 includes incentives that promote the production of homegrown renewable fuels, like biodiesel, for the installation of more E-85 pumps, and a $3,000 tax credit for the purchase of fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicles. These provisions will create and preserve thousands of ``green collar jobs'' as well as provide relief for Americans who continue to see gas prices rise to historic records across the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for this vote to override the President's veto of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' We cannot abandon Medicare's promise to America's seniors and disabled citizens that they would have access to high quality health care in their time of need. 
   As of July 1, physicians face a 10.6 percent cut in their payments from Medicare. As of July 1, patients undergoing a variety of medical treatments, from radiology to oxygen treatments, face a cutoff in services. As of July 1, the relationship between medical suppliers and the beneficiaries they serve is at risk. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill fixes all of these threats to Medicare and improves access in many other ways. Instead of a cut, it provides a slight increase in payment for physicians, ensuring doctors can continue providing Medicare services. Instead of cutting beneficiaries off from their medical services, it allows exceptions to current caps on medical therapy. It also ensures access to community pharmacies, by providing for fair and prompt payment for prescriptions. 
   Additionally, H.R. 6331 improves access to health services for all Medicare beneficiaries. It extends grants that rural health care providers can use to improve the quality of care facilities provide and to strengthen health care networks. It supports telehealth services in rural communities, improves access to ambulance services for small hospitals, and increases Medicare payments for community health centers. 
   By overriding the President's veto, Congress is standing with seniors and their ability to continue to see the doctors they know and trust. By overriding the veto, we are standing for better health care for all Medicare beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to join me in continued support of this bill.

This bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue up to 350,000 $1 silver coins in 2010 to commemorate the centennial of the founding of the Boy Scouts of America. The $10 surcharge required for each coin will be paid to the National Boy Scouts of America Foundation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have long been honored to be associated with the Boy Scouts of America. I am the proud father of an Eagle Scout and I have been proud to support the Occoneechee Council of the Boy Scouts in North Carolina through volunteer work and vital fundraising. I have been honored to receive the Silver Beaver, the Scouts' highest award for volunteering, and I received a new award for my congressional support for Scouting. 
   Scouting has contributed to the fabric of American life for nearly 100 years. The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, and chartered by Congress in 1916. The Boy Scouts of America's original mission was to provide an educational program for boys and young men to build character, to train in the responsibilities of participating in citizenship, and to develop personal fitness. 
   You know, North Carolina and America and indeed the entire world have changed a great deal since 1910. Yet the Boy Scouts endure. The Boy Scouts remain a mainstay of American life because the message of this organization is timeless: developing American citizens who are physically, mentally and emotionally fit. 
   The leadership and service skills learned as a Boy Scout have enabled men to become leaders in all walks of life: government, business, sports, science and the arts. These include such distinguished individuals as: President Gerald R. Ford, our first Eagle Scout to become President; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; and my friend, Richard Gephardt, the former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Closer to my home, former North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford was an Eagle Scout. 
   The Boy Scouts of America is an institution that contributes so much to the strength of our social fabric. The activities of the Boy Scouts reinforce our moral core and help sustain our American values, generation after generation. 
   I support the issuance of this commemorative Centennial Coin, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, this week gas prices have hit yet another new high. Today, gas prices are higher than they have ever been in the history of our country, and rural Americans are getting hit particularly hard. 
   Yet while most Americans are struggling to make ends meet, oil companies are making record profits. H.R. 6022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act, will suspend the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide relief to the American consumer. 
   Mr. Speaker, everyone from farmers, commuters, employers, and senior citizens have been hit hard by the rise in gas prices. This is affecting the rural economy of the people of the Second District of North Carolina, and indeed rural areas across the country where people must travel long distances to make sure they have the basic necessities of life, from school and jobs, to church and the grocery store. 
   This legislation will suspend the purchase of as much as 70,000 barrels of oil per day, and could have the effect of lowering our gas prices. While I believe that it is our duty to find alternatives to our reliance on foreign oil, right now we need to take this step to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I commend him and the ranking member for their hard work on this piece of legislation. 
   For too long, the Department of Homeland Security has ignored threats to rail and public transportation and buses; and I am pleased to help cosponsor this legislation to correct this problem. 
   In the face of recent attacks in London and Madrid and with our own subways and buses still vulnerable, I am hopeful that this legislation will make sure that the Department addresses this critical work. 
   In addition to closing security gaps in rail and mass transit safety efforts and providing support and guidance for training, security planning and research and development, this bill contains language that I proposed requiring the Department of Homeland Security to assess threats to our Nation's children posed by security risks to school bus transportation. 
   School buses have been targets of terrorists throughout the world, including here in the United States. Just last month, the FBI said that members of extremist groups have purchased school buses and obtained licenses to operate them, while adding that ``parents and children have nothing to fear.'' I do not believe we can take these assessments at face value without a comprehensive threat assessment of school bus transportation.  
   School transportation is a patchwork of systems including public entities, privately owned school bus companies, contractors who provide school transportation, individual owner-operators of school buses who contract with school districts or school systems. The risks are poorly understood, as the FBI's muddled message indicates. 
   An attack on our school buses would be devastating not only in the lives harmed but also in the psychological and symbolic impact. As a former superintendent of schools for the State of North Carolina, I know that children, parents, and schools deserve our school buses to get children to school as safely and as securely as possible. We owe our children no less than to be able to confidently say that our transportation system is secure. 
   The bill requires DHS to perform a comprehensive threat assessment for school transportation and make recommendations on how to respond to these threats. The bill requires vulnerability assessments and security plans for other modes of transportation in the public trust, and it should be the same for our children. 
   I urge everyone to vote for it. 
   I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding the time and to the ranking member for all your hard work.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this vitally important legislation to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. 
   Keeping all Americans safe should be the top priority of the government. Congress cannot wait for another attack to take steps to protect our nation from terrorism. I have worked on the Homeland Security Committee to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, and I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join me in supporting these critical reforms. 
   The bill includes a number of steps to improve homeland security, including: 
   Requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; 
   Requiring 100 percent inspection of cargo at ports and on passenger aircraft; 
   Providing first responders the equipment and training they need including the critical issue of communications interoperability; 
   Increasing efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; 
   Significantly expanding diplomatic, economic and educational strategies designed to counter Islamic terrorism; 
   Strengthening privacy and civil liberties protections; and 
   Restoring America's moral leaderships throughout the world. 
   As North Carolina's only Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I worked with my colleagues in the 109th session of Congress to implement many of the reforms included in today's legislation. In particular, I joined my colleagues on the committee in supporting legislation to screen 100 percent of all containers entering U.S. ports, and to provide first responders with interoperable communications equipment. 
   The bipartisan 9/11 Commission was created by Congress to provide recommendations on preventing another terrorist attack. The recommendations were released in 2004. Congress implemented several of the recommendations in December 2004, however the Republican-controlled Congress did not implement many, and only partially implemented others. In its final report card, the 9/11 Commissioners gave the Administration and Congress many poor grades on implementing the recommendations, and this legislation will make America safer by putting these new policies into place. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want bipartisan action to provide real solutions for a safe and secure country, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation to reduce the costs of college for low-income and middle class families. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.  
   As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to higher education is the key to the American Dream for working families. My life's work has been to improve educational opportunities for all because education is the key to the future. Education levels the playing field and empowers every individual willing to work hard the ability to make the most of his or her God-given talents. This legislation will make a real difference to make college more affordable without raising taxes while maintaining budget discipline. 
   Specifically, this bill will cut in half the interest rate on federally subsidized Stafford Loans over the next five years, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. Under this conference report, the average North Carolina student starting school in 2007 will save $2,200 throughout the life of the loan, and the average N.C. student starting school in 2001 will save $4,270. This legislation also will raise the maximum value of the Pell Grant scholarship by $1,090 by 2012. 
   The bill will help ensure a highly qualified teacher in every classroom by providing upfront tuition assistance to qualified undergraduate students who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities or high-need subject areas. It will encourage public service by providing public servants loan forgiveness after ten years of public service for military servicemembers, first responders, nurses, educators, and others. Finally, this legislation will make historic new investments in minority-serving institutions and encourage state and philanthropic participation in college retention and financing to increase the number of first generation and low-income college students. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman MILLER for this accomplishment and thank him and his great staff, including Gabriella Gomez, Denise Forte and Mark Zuckerman, for working with me to ensure that the bill does not unintentionally harm North Carolina's nonprofit lending agency. I am pleased the President has committed to signing this bill into law, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1908, Patent Reform Act of 2007. 
   While I recognize the need for some reform of the United States' patent process, I believe we must proceed carefully and with the goal of improvement for the many stakeholders affected by the patent system. We should continue to work towards an efficient system that issues high-quality patents and places reasonable limits on patent challenges. Although there are some provisions in H.R. 1908 that could prove beneficial, this far-reaching bill could do serious harm to many of the important employers in my district. 
   North Carolina benefits greatly from its strong university system. Institutions including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in my district serve as engines for research and innovation that help to drive the state's economy. In addition, the 2nd Congressional District of North Carolina contains a number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that provide thousands of jobs and are helping to transform our economy. Along with many of the traditional manufacturing companies in North Carolina, the lifeblood of these institutions is the value of the patents they hold. These entities have expressed opposition to any measure that would weaken their patent portfolios. H.R. 1908 in its current form would endanger the value of their patents and harm their ability to continue fueling our economy. 
   Our patent system has long been a wonderful tool that has helped to foster innovation and reward American ingenuity. Patents, and their value and validity, serve as the backbone for thousands of companies and help form the basis of our economy. Congress should continue to work to reform the system in a way that benefits all of the varied interests that keep our economy strong. I hope the conference committee on H.R. 1908 can correct its shortcomings so I can support and Congress can enact comprehensive reform of our patent process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3996, Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage. 
   This bill provides tax relief for millions of Americans by raising the exemption amounts on the Alternative Minimum Tax, and ensuring that no new taxpayers would be subject to this higher rate. H.R. 3996 would prevent a tax increase on 21 million taxpayers when they file their 2007 tax returns. The Alternative Minimum Tax was originally enacted to prevent only the very wealthiest of Americans from avoiding income tax payment. However, over the years its reach has grown to affect more and more middle income taxpayers, and estimates show that as many as 30 million taxpayers would be ensnared by this higher tax rate by 2010. This bill will spare over 15,000 people in my district alone, from paying the Alternative Minimum Tax. As a part-time farmer and a former small business owner, I know the crucial importance of this sector to the economy as a whole. I support tax relief for the middle class workers and families who help drive our economy. 
   However, I am concerned that this bill does not include an offset and is not budget-neutral. I am strongly in favor of providing tax relief to millions of Americans, but we need to address this problem in a responsible way that maintains the integrity of our budget, and avoids adding to the budget deficit and our national debt. As a member of the House Budget Committee, I am hopeful that we can address the Alternative Minimum Tax issue further when Congress returns in the new year.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and the critical services provided by Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). This legislation ensures continued access to our nation's health care system for our most vulnerable citizens--children, seniors, the poor, and the disabled. It also extends incentives that allow health care providers to maintain practices in rural areas. These federal efforts are critical to maintaining healthy and productive communities across the country, and particularly in North Carolina's 2nd District. 
   North Carolina's citizens are at risk when reimbursements to physicians fall below the cost of providing care, and doctors must shut their doors or turn away patients because they cannot afford to attend to them. North Carolina's citizens are at risk when children go without care, and untreated illnesses or foregone preventative care reduces the health and productivity of those who will build our future. North Carolina's citizens are at risk when Congress fails to act to preserve benefits that they depend on. 
   The health of Americans and the future health of America depend upon the availability of and access to health care. I applaud our leaders in the House and Senate for working in a bicameral, bipartisan manner to craft this legislation so that our doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers can continue their service to keep our citizens healthy. 
   This legislation improves physician quality and access by averting the planned 10 percent cut in physician payments and extending the Medicare physician quality reporting system. It continues Medicare policy that provides a measure of fairness to the payment system for rural providers so that they can continue providing valuable services to individuals in rural parts of the 2nd District and across the country. I am hopeful that when Congress returns in 2008, we make extending these provisions on a long-term basis a priority so that providers can plan to remain in our communities for the long-term. 
   As the only former State schools chief serving in Congress, my life's work has been to provide for a better future for the next generation, and health care is critically important to that effort. This legislation averts the threat that States will run out of funds for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. North Carolina's Health Choice, which serves over 250,000 needy children, will now be able to plan enrollment for the next year, whereas without this legislation it would have run out of money next March. While I am disappointed that this legislation does not enable the coverage of additional children, we owe it to the children currently served by SCHIP to ensure that they are continuously covered and can get the health care they need when they need it. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to fulfill the vision of health access for all children. 
   Madam Speaker, a lack of access to health care has impact beyond the individual who suffers a sickness without treatment. Untreated illnesses have long-term consequences, and ensuring access to health care contributes to a healthy and productive society and heads off expensive treatments down the road. This legislation is necessary to keep providers in our communities, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. It has been a long process, and this bill is far trom perfect, but I enthusiastically support this measure as an important first step in a long-overdue effort to provide for the needs of our most vulnerable citizens and begin to invest in priority items here at home to build a brighter future for America. 
   As a member of the House Budget Committee, I believe that budget-making is about more than just numbers on a ledger or a spreadsheet. Budgets reflect our Nation's priorities, and Congress has a solemn duty to pass a funding that honors the values of the American people. I have worked with the leadership of this new Democratic Congress to reverse the misguided budget course of the current administration that has neglected America's domestic needs and created massive annual deficits and record national debt. I am pleased that the New Direction Congress has rejected the President's misguided budget cuts for critical American priorities like education, medical research and energy independence. This responsible legislation fulfills Congress's obligation to govern and charts a better course for the American people. 
   I especially want to thank the House Democratic Leadership for including $600 million for disaster assistance for victims of the record drought in North Carolina and throughout the southeastern United States. My farmers are hurting, and this disaster assistance will provide real relief and some measure of hope for the future. I have been proud to lead the fight for this funding, and I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, Appropriations Committee Chairman Obey and Agriculture Committee Chairman Peterson for their leadership on this priority item. 
   Beyond disaster assistance, I support this omnibus appropriations bill because it invests in: 
   K-12 Education: $767 million above the President's request with targeted increases to Title I, Special Education, Teacher Quality Grants, After-School Initiatives and Head Start. 
   Student Aid: $1.7 billion above the President's request for Pell Grants and other student aid. 
   Vocational Education: $575 million above the President's request for technical training at high schools and community colleges. 
   State and Local Law Enforcement: $1.2 billion above the President's request to help local communities across the country. 
   Homeland Security Grants: $1.8 billion above the President's request, recognizing that homeland security begins with hometown security. 
   Medical Research: $607 million above the President's request to study diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes. 
   Health Care Access: $1 billion above the President's request, making targeted increases to efforts like Community Health Centers to provide 280,000 more uninsured Americans with access to health care and High Risk Insurance Pools to help 200,000 more people afford health insurance. 
   Rural Health Care: $147 million above the President's request to help 1,200 small rural hospitals. 
   Veterans: $3.7 billion more than the President's request for VA health care, medical and prosthetic research, medical services for injured and ill veterans, and the construction of new VA medical facilities. 
   Highway Infrastructure: Meets the guaranteed levels set in the authorization bill and provides a $1 billion initiative to repair our bridges. 
   Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency: $486 million above the President's request for critical investments in Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biofuels, and Energy Efficiency, with a careful blend of new scientific investments and conservation efforts. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill contains funding the President requested for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, to support our troops and avoid any risk that Defense Department employees could be subject to furlough notices this holiday season. I regret that the stubborn opposition of the President and his allies in Congress to investing more in America's priorities prevent us from making more progress. But I strongly support this compromise legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the omnibus appropriations bill. Finally, some good news from Washington. I am very pleased that the House has scheduled to vote on the disaster assistance package to provide relief to our farmers suffering from a record drought and record heat in the Southeast. My farmers are hurting. This omnibus appropriations bill will provide some $600 million for disaster assistance. 
   My congressional district in North Carolina has been affected by what is called ``exceptional drought.'' That is the most serious category that you can have. This aid will bring real relief to our rural communities. I have been proud to lead the charge on this effort. In September, I wrote a bipartisan letter to the President, signed by 54 of my colleagues from both political parties, to make the case for drought relief. 
   I have been very pleased to be able to work with Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, Ag Chair Peterson, and Appropriations Chairman Obey to get this done. I want to thank them for their critical help. This is important to rural America. I also want to thank the Governor of North Carolina, Mike Easley, for his leadership. 
   Madam Speaker, I grew up in Johnston County and lived in farm country all my life. As a senior member of the House Ag Committee, I am also pleased that we have finally gotten this football to the end zone. This disaster assistance and the other things in this bill are a major achievement, and it's an important step forward, especially for America's farmers and the consumers of this country. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of North Carolina's children and our working families, I rise in support of this budget resolution and I congratulate you, Chairman John Spratt for your visionary leadership in crafting this important document. 
   With this budget resolution, the Democratic majority will succeed where our Republican predecessors failed. To budget is to govern, and this resolution will produce a balanced budget with balanced priorities. 
   As the only former State schools chief serving in Congress, I am particularly pleased about this measure's provisions for education and innovation. Specifically, rather than continue the Republicans' record of passing a crushing debt burden on to future generations, the Spratt resolution contains tough budget discipline for a new direction for the Federal budget. The Spratt resolution rejects the President's proposed education cuts and instead provides greater investment in our Nation's schools, including the school construction bonds Chairman Rangel and I have been working on for nearly a decade and increased Impact Aid for federally impacted local public schools. It provides $50 billion for children's health insurance. And it protects millions of middle income families from the onslaught of the alternative minimum tax. 
   As a Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am pleased that after 7 years of this Administration failing to address fully some of our most pressing security needs, the Chairman's mark provides the necessary resources to meet critical threats to the Nation. Specifically, the Chairman's mark places high priority on rejecting the President's cuts to first responder support. This includes the State Homeland Security Grant Program through which States may direct grants to local law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical services, and other preparedness officials to address a wide array of public safety needs. The Administration proposed cutting this proven security initiative by $705 million, and the Spratt budget rejects that misguided cut. The Chairman's mark also rejects these other mistaken budget cuts: $463 million from firefighter assistance grants that give local firefighters the tools they need to do their dangerous jobs protecting the public; $173 million from Byrne Justice Assistance Grants flexible funding for local criminal justice efforts; $599 million from the Community Congress Oriented Policing Services COPS funds that help local communities hire, train and retain police officers and to improve law enforcement technology. I strongly believe the homeland security starts with hometown security, and I strongly support the Chairman's mark as it provides essential services for local first responders. Unbelievably, for the sixth year in a row, the President's budget proposes to eliminate the State Criminal Alien Assistance fund of $417 million which helps States cope with the costs of incarcerating undocumented aliens who commit crimes. I am pleased the Chairman's mark rejects this misguided budget cut. 
   I was disappointed to see the President's proposed budget contains the failed Social Security privatization plan, and the leading Republican Presidential candidate just this week embraced this risky plan. When the President first proposed privatizing Social Security, I toured the country to oppose this risky gamble with Social Security. The American people have spoken loud and clear that they want their Social Security benefits to be an ironclad guarantee instead of a risky gamble like the Republicans continue to propose. The Bush/McCain plan is a bad idea. I am pleased the Chairman's mark rejects this risky Social Security privatization scheme. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I have become increasingly concerned about the legacy of debt this Administration is passing on to future generations. The $5.6 trillion projected surplus that the Administration inherited when it took office has been transformed into a $3.2 trillion deficit. More than 80 cents of every dollar of new debt since 2001 is owed to foreign investors, including foreign governments. The high level of indebtedness to foreign investors heightens the American economy's exposure to potential instability or even from financial threat from unfriendly foreign governments, and places additional burdens on our children and grandchildren. It is a massively irresponsibly tax on posterity. 
   There are many reasons to support this resolution, but in my brief allotment of time, I want to say that I support this resolution on behalf of my grandchildren and all the children of this country and their families who deserve a budget that puts their needs first. That's the definition of a budget that's truly balanced.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMMENDING HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1429 was introduced by Congresswoman Clarke of New York to recognize September as National Preparedness Month. 
   Just a couple of weeks ago, the Nation observed the somber anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and we watched Hurricane Gustav and Ike batter the gulf coast. Therefore, September is an appropriate month to commend the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security and the State and local first responders who form the first line of defense against these and other threats. I have always said that you can't have homeland security unless you are prepared to have hometown security, and that preparedness starts a community at a time. 
   This month is a good opportunity for every American to learn about how they can prepare for all types of emergencies, whether it be a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. We can start by taking four little steps: Get an emergency kit; two, develop and communicate with your family a plan for evacuation and shelter; three, be informed about the types of emergencies that you are likely to face; and four; get yourself and your community involved to be better prepared. Better knowledge is power. We must all do our part to ensure that we learn what to do before an emergency occurs. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this House Resolution because I know firsthand that it is best to be prepared, and not scared. 
   Let us be clear that the dedicated employees of the Department of Homeland Security and other Federal agencies, together with State and local officials and first responders, will do all they can to prepare for, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disaster, and other emergencies. But the American people can play a significant role by understanding the simple steps they can take to provide for themselves and their family. 
   Together, a prepared public and a resourceful and dedicated Department of Homeland Security can truly anticipate how to respond to different types of emergencies. In doing so, we will become a more resilient Nation. 
   Before I close my remarks, though, I would like to thank Congresswoman Clarke for introducing the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, H.R. 1429 encourages citizens to prepare themselves and their families on how to respond to emergencies, whether it be an act of terror, a natural disaster or other crisis. This is the fifth year the Department of Homeland Security has partnered with over 1,700 organizations, including the American Red Cross, to promote September as National Preparedness Month. With continuing threats of terrorism and increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, Americans should prepare themselves, their families and their communities. 
   Everyone should do the four things we talked about. Get an emergency kit. Prepare and communicate to family and friends their evacuation and shelter plans. Be informed about the type of emergencies, and get the family and community involved. 
   Constituents should be encouraged to visit the following website. You have heard it twice already, www.ready.gov or www.redcross.org.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2816. 
   This measure seeks to change how the Chief Human Capital Officer is appointed by the Department of Homeland Security. It will bring DHS in line with other Federal agencies who are able to choose whether they have a Chief Human Capital Officer that is a career employee or a political appointee. Granting this authority now is important to transition to the next administration.     
   The Chief Human Capital Officer serves as the Department's lead executive for all matters relating to workforce management. Among the responsibilities of the Chief Human Capital Officer are strategic planning, training and development, recruitment, compensation, benefits, and employee relations. 
   The task of serving as the CHCO at DHS is particularly challenging when you consider that since DHS' inception, it has faced a series of personnel challenges, including; merging 22 separate agencies into one cabinet-level agency with a combined workforce of over 200,000 people; promoting integration among employees and an appreciation of their role within DHS; and confronting ongoing recruitment and retention challenges. 
   Low employee morale has been a chronic issue for DHS since it was established in 2003. In fact, in both its 2004 and 2006 workforce surveys, the Office of Personnel Management found that DHS' employee morale ranked among the lowest of any cabinet-level department. 
   In the 2006 OPM survey, the Department was rated ``dead last'' in job satisfaction among its peers and received very low marks on leadership and management capabilities. 
   Just last year, the Department's own internal Employee Survey revealed that poor morale remained a major problem. Workers cited pay, performance, and promotion practices as some of the sources of their discontent. 
   Moreover, documented incidents reveal that the management within some of the most prominent DHS components do not value diversity in their operations. This, too, contributes to low morale. These results are clearly unacceptable in our government. The next CHCO has to make it ``job-one'' to tackle the underlying causes of the discontent. 
   With the change in administration, the next CHCO has an enormous opportunity to turn things around. The Department must properly address employee dissatisfaction by focusing and implementing career development for its employees. DHS should also ensure that its employees receive proper training and adequate resources necessary to get their jobs done. 
   DHS must recruit the best and the brightest because we're asking them to do one of the most important jobs in the Federal Government, protect this country. These efforts can only be achieved through an effective Chief Human Capital Officer. Unfortunately, over the past 5 1/2 years, six people have held this office at DHS. That is a tremendous turnover. Stable leadership will help DHS address the magnitude and multitude of its workforce management challenges. This legislation will help provide that stable leadership. 
   I stand in support of this legislation, and urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank my friend, Congressman Donnelly, for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H. Res. 1010, recognizing the importance of manufactured housing in the United States. 
   Unfortunately, far too many homeowners are facing difficulties during this current National Homeownership Month. Housing prices are dropping, home sales are stagnating, and thousands of families are facing the prospect of foreclosure. 
   Manufactured housing can provide a sustainable and affordable housing alternative. Instead of being trapped in exotic mortgages with high interest rates, many Americans can choose cost-effective manufactured housing. This sector of the housing market has also experienced an evolution in the types and quality of homes that they build, offering a wide array of designs that can fit the needs of more families. 
   In addition, Congress has passed legislation that provides tax credits for the builders of these homes to meet energy efficiency standards. These Energy Star labeled homes are more energy efficient and can provide savings in the face of rising energy costs. 
   Manufactured housing can be a critical component in achieving two of HUD's most important priorities, providing increased affordable housing, and reducing dependencies on subsidized housing. 
   In addition, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I also recognize the importance that manufactured housing can play in the wake of a natural disaster. Manufactured housing can provide a quick, safe, and efficient way to house these victims and provide families with shelters as they put their lives back together. 
   Owning a home is a large part of the American Dream. I support this resolution as well as the goals and ideals of Manufactured Housing Week. I urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of H.R. 1010.

   This truly is a bipartisan piece of legislation that the House Agriculture Committee has produced and one that affects every citizen in this country. 
   Agriculture is the number one industry in my home State of North Carolina. It is responsible for $66 billion in income and employs almost one-fifth of the State's workforce. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we have a stable farm policy in this country, not just for North Carolina, but for every child that participates in the nutrition program, for every food bank and for every school lunch program. 
   The bill increases the funding for the Nation's nutrition programs by over $10 billion, provides over $1.1 billion for renewable energy, and increases funding for conservation efforts by $6.6 billion. 
   And for new and growing sectors of agriculture like organic foods, we have included, for the first time, mandatory funding for specialty crop research and marketing. 
   And we are able to do all this while ensuring that the safety net for our farmers remains intact, ensuring that no matter what, our citizens will always have a stable food supply.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   As has been indicated, every day over 36 million people travel on forms of mass transit or public transportation in this country. More than 11 million commuters use rail and mass transit, while over twice this number, more than 25 million, use public or private school buses to travel to and from their schools. 
   As a former superintendent of schools of the State of North Carolina, I know how important these systems are to delivering our most precious cargo, our school children, to and from school safely and securely. Just as we have a responsibility to ensure the public can travel on rail and mass transit confident of their safety, we have an equal responsibility to make sure that our school bus routes are secure. 
   I thank Congresswoman Jackson-Lee for her hard work, Chairman Thompson for working with me to include this piece of legislation in this resolution, and I want to thank Ranking Member King for his help also. 
   School buses have been targets for terrorists not only in countries such as Israel, Thailand, Yemen and African countries, but also Canada and the United States. Last year, the FBI warned that members of extremist groups have purchased school buses and obtained licenses to operate them. 
   An attack on a school bus would be devastating, not only in lives harmed, but also the psychological and symbolic impact. We owe our children and their families no less than that we will be able to confidently say that their transportation is secure. 
   Earlier this year in a 9/11 bill, Congress required TSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment on school transportation. They are making progress on this goal. We need to make sure that this assessment is completed on time and that it is followed with efforts to keep our children safe as they travel to and from school activities. 
   The provisions of this resolution shows that Congress is serious about providing that confidence for rail, for mass transit, as well as for school transportation. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1150.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6331, The ``Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' This bill fulfills America's promise to its seniors and disabled citizens, protecting access to high quality health care without unreasonable costs. 
   For more than 40 years, Medicare has helped meet the needs of many vulnerable Americans. It cannot continue to do so if providers are paid unreasonable reimbursements, if rules hinder quality patient care, or if the burden of paperwork and payment delays keeps small businesses out of the health care market. This bill ensures physicians, pharmacists, durable medical equipment suppliers, and other health care providers can continue to support the health and well being of Medicare beneficiaries in many ways. 
   H.R. 6331 will ensure health care is available in rural areas of this country, like those in the Second District of North Carolina. By replacing a 10 percent cut in pay with a slight increase, it ensures doctors can afford to stay in business wherever they choose to practice medicine. By improving payments to hospitals that provide care where no other provider is available, and by making sure rural hospitals are paid equally for clinical services, it ensures those services are available throughout the country. By increasing access to telehealth, it expands the reach of professional advice beyond the doctor's office. 
   H.R. 6331 is also a boon for small businesses. The vast majority of medical providers are small businesses, and by ensuring they can afford to provide care we support the engine of our economy. Especially in rural areas, our small community pharmacies and medical equipment suppliers are the face of medicine for many Medicare beneficiaries. Health care is improved when people know their providers, and this makes them more likely to comply with medical directives. I am pleased that H.R. 6331 includes several provisions for these small suppliers that I have advocated for some time, including prompt payment provisions and a delay in rules from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. Before proceeding, we need to be sure that these initiatives, including competitive bidding for durable medical equipment and the implementation of the Average Manufacturing Price, AMP, system, help to preserve and improve patient care by allowing community suppliers to remain open so that they may continue to serve, and, more importantly, operate at a level that facilitates the provision of the best possible, safest medical care. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation improves the health and health care of Medicare beneficiaries, the ability of medical professionals to provide that care, and the quality of medical care throughout our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6331.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Thank you. 
   For many of my colleagues this is just another earmark. For me this is somewhat personal because the first job that I ever held right out of high school before I went to college was in a textile plant. That was when they were plentiful in North Carolina and really  across the Southeast. Hard work, in a lot of cases it was dirty work, but it was honorable work, and it made a difference in people's lives. 
   The National Textile Center, or NTC, as you have already heard, really is a national initiative. It's not a localized project. It's a project that has already made a difference. It will continue to make a difference. And as you have heard, it's a consortium of eight leading textile research universities. One of those is in my State. Actually one of the universities happens to be in my district, an outstanding university, North Carolina State University. But each of these States making a contribution, or the universities in these States. They're working to advance every aspect of the textile industry, from fiber production to marketing, through research, education, and, more importantly, industrial partnerships. 
   That's the kind of thing we ought to be promoting here. We ought to be about getting people to work together. That's what this is about. Yet we have an amendment that says, no, we don't want you to work together. We'd just as soon you have those silos. We argue on this floor daily about knocking down silos and getting people to work together. 
   The National Textile Center was established really to achieve that one goal, but three others: 
   It was to develop new materials, innovative and improved manufacturing procedures and integrated systems essential to the success of a modern fiber, fabric and fabricated products manufacturing enterprise. 
   Secondly, to provide trained personnel. It's important today as the industry changes to have people who can affect the new industry, because it is a high-tech industry today, and to develop those industrial partnerships and technology transfer mechanisms. 
   And, finally, to strengthen the Nation's textile research and education efforts. 
   Just yesterday I had a large manufacturer of textiles in my office. Twenty-four plants. He closed one in the western part of North Carolina. Now, for some people that might not make a difference, but for about 300 people that lost their jobs, that's trauma. Their lives have been changed. This is a way we can help that situation. We've lost our shoe industry overseas. Much of our textiles have gone. We are now about trying to reclaim some of it. 
   Now in its 14th year of activity, the center has made numerous contributions to its constituents, helping to keep the textile industry economically viable by providing a knowledge-based, competitive, cutting-edge opportunity. It enjoys widespread industry support and a partnership across the States. 
   As has been stated already, this industry is still alive. Six hundred thousand workers in America are still employed in the textile industry, contributing nearly $60 billion to the national gross domestic product on an annual basis. Research has already provided, as you have heard, uniforms and opportunities for our first responders. They're in the process in a broader sense of creating fabrics that are self-decontaminating to protect against biological and chemical hazards. 
   These are things we ought to be doing. And, yes, we ought to be doing them in a way that we work together so that at multiple universities and the bright minds we have across this country today can work together to make a difference. 
   I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I ask this body to defeat it resoundingly.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the chairman for his hard work, and really on both sides of the aisle, for all the Members who put in long hours, who traveled across this country and listened to farmers and commodity groups speak. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2419. It's an important piece of legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, this has been a long process. In the early part of the year, our Subcommittee on General  Farm Commodities and Risk Management continued to hold hearings. We listened to groups. All the groups came, they talked, they made their recommendations. 
   The message we heard from farmers was that they like the basic framework that was created under the 2002 farm bill. Not only did we preserve that framework, but we made improvements so that the safety net worked more effectively. 
   And yes, as a result of the farm bill in 2002, we saved money, which meant that we had a greater challenge. We maintained the three-legged stool that supports farmers through direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan benefits. We adjusted loan rates and target prices to achieve a rebalancing between commodities that was long overdue. 
   We included several improvements to the cotton marketing loan program to make it more reflective of current market realities and values, as well as corrected problems in the program that we experienced since the elimination of the Step 2 program. 
   We also provided assistance to the textile industry to enhance their competitiveness and help keep those jobs here at home. 
   This could be called not only an Ag bill; it's a jobs bill, as well as a national defense bill, because we use it for food and fiber to feed our people. 
   I'm also proud that we're also providing farmers with the opportunity to experiment with revenue-based counter-cyclical programs. While most producers are satisfied with the current counter-cyclical program, some farmers are interested in the revenue-based approach.  
   Providing farmers with the option to choose between these two types of counter-cyclical programs allows them to make the best economic decision for their families. This revenue counter-cyclical program will also provide us with better insight into how the program works so we can determine if it is a better model for future farm bills. 
   H.R. 2419 contains Rural Development programs that will better facilitate the financing of essential rural infrastructures like public water and waste disposal systems. It establishes grant and loan programs for rural healthcare facilities. It will improve access to broadband telecommunications services in rural areas. 
   The Bill also expands funding for a host of conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Maintaining the 60 percent share of EQIP funding for livestock is extremely important to North Carolina's poultry and pork producers. 
   As a representative from one of the most agriculturally diverse states in the Nation, and a member of the Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Subcommittee, I am particularly pleased that we are providing, for the first time ever, mandatory dollars for programs that benefit fruit and vegetable producers as well as the ever growing organic agriculture industry. 
   For our tobacco farmers who have been trying to get into specialty crop production since the buyout, these new programs will support the industry through projects in research, marketing, education, pest and disease management, production, and food safety. 
   We are strengthening the nutrition title through extra money for the Emergency Food Assistance Program; raising the minimum benefit for Food Stamps, which hasn't been done since 1977; and eliminating cap on dependent care, which opens up the program to more working families. 
   We are reforming crop insurance to provide better coverage for organic producers; expanding data mining to root out waste, fraud, and abuse; and providing an extra option for producers to obtain supplemental area-based crop insurance in addition to their current revenue or yield policies. 
   We have accomplished all this, and so much more. But we did it with a responsible budget. Operating 
   under the Pay As You GO (PAYGO) requirements has posed difficult challenges for the Agriculture Committee, but I believe we have managed to preserve for farmers a sound safety net that provides extra protections, while staying within our budget. 
   In addition to my service on the Agriculture Committee, I serve on the House Budget Committee. Yesterday, we had a hearing with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States. 
   They testified about the budget calamity this Administration and the previous Republican Majority have left this country in. A calamity which made the job of passing a farm bill that much harder this year. 
   According to their testimony, were it not for the policies of this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress, the federal budget would be in balance today. 
   Yet the Republican priorities are so out of whack that today, one of the fastest growing segments of the federal budget is interest on the national debt. 
   And most of that debt is financed by foreign countries like China who may not always have America's best interests at heart. 
   It was a Democratic Congress that restored fiscal discipline to the federal budget through PAYGO rules, and this Farm Bill responsibly adheres to those rules. 
   I thank the Chairman for his hard work on moving this bill to this point, and I urge my colleagues to support farm families, support feeding children, support moving to renewable fuels, and vote for H.R. 2419.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Kind-Flake amendment.  
   The sponsors of this amendment like to argue that passage of the amendment would help pave the way for new trade agreements. That is naive thinking. 
   Our trade negotiators are engaged in WTO trade talks in a bid to open up foreign markets for U.S. agriculture products and reduce, if not eliminate, trade distorting foreign subsides. The cuts in the farm safety net that the Kind-Flake amendment impose are tantamount to unilateral disarmament. 
   During the Cold War, we would never have cut our military strength without first extracting similar if not greater reductions from the Soviets. We should do no less in today's trade negotiations. 
   Cutting our farm support will not lead to a WTO agreement. As the current negotiations have shown, any time the United States gives a little on its trade position, our trading partners ask us to give more. 
   Trying to create a farm bill that will please a WTO negotiator from another country is the wrong approach. The farm bill is for helping U.S. farmers. 
   Who supports the Kind-Flake amendment, groups who mistakenly believe that unilateral cuts will spark a trade deal. 
   Who opposes the Kind-Flake amendment, farm and commodity groups across the nation. 
   When it comes to farm policy, I am going to stand with the farmers. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kind-Flake amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, as a former school chief serving in Congress, I rise today to commemorate National Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   All across America this week, our Nation's school children, parents, PTAs and others are gathering to show their appreciation to the professional educators who work every day to make their futures brighter. Teacher Appreciation Week is a great opportunity to stop and pay tribute to the profession that shapes the world of tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note that this new Democratic Congress is doing its part to support education in our communities. Democrats rejected President Bush's misguided educational budget cuts. Earlier this year, the House passed a balanced budget resolution that provides billions of dollars more for the non-neglected priorities like Head Start, secondary education, the Individuals With Disability Act and important initiatives. 
   In addition, my colleagues and I have crafted bipartisan legislation to provide critical investment in our school construction and modernization across this country. The Rangel-Ramstad-Etheridge America Better Classrooms Act will provide $25 billion in interest-free bonds for local schools. This bill will make a difference in our communities, our children and our teachers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this piece of legislation on National Teacher Appreciation Week.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7321, Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. 
   The automobile industry is one of the most critical manufacturers and job providers in the country and in North Carolina. Automobiles account for $690 billion, or about twenty percent of all retail sales in the United States. Over 4.5 million jobs in the United States depend on these 3 companies, and my State of North Carolina would stand to lose over 95,000 jobs with an auto industry shutdown. There are over 692 new-vehicle dealerships in North Carolina as well as hundreds of auto parts suppliers. These dealerships are often economic hubs of many of our small towns. The fallout of such a shutdown would be felt throughout all sectors of our economy and on almost every main street in America. 
   H.R. 7321 would provide the necessary financial assistance to keep our largest automobile manufacturers in business. Today's spiraling economy has been particularly devastating for the 3 largest automakers in the United States. Car sales are slumping sharply in the face of recession and the stagnant credit market has paralyzed these companies in the middle of their restructuring efforts. It has also left dealers unable to help finance most of their customers and move automobiles off of the lot. 
   H.R. 7321 would allow the President to designate one or more officers in the Executive Branch to oversee approximately $14 billion in bridge loans or lines of credit to the requesting companies. H.R. 7321 includes many taxpayer protections to help ensure that the government is repaid, including providing for stock in the company equal to 20 percent of the loan amount, and giving the government ``super seniority'' designation of the loans to ensure that the taxpayer is first in line to be repaid by the companies. In addition, the bill forbids bonuses or incentives for the 25 most highly paid employees in each company, and strictly prohibits ``golden parachutes'' during the life of these bridge loans. Furthermore, the President's designee will have a strong oversight role. The designee must establish appropriate measures to assess the restructuring plans, and evaluate the progress of each auto manufacturer within 45 days in order for loans to be approved. In order to qualify for any bridge loan, the auto company will have to submit a plan to achieve long-term viability, international competitiveness, energy efficiency, and plans for repayment of the government loan. 
   It is crucial that our Nation's leading automakers continue to restructure in order to meet the demands of a changing market, and to become healthier companies that can help lead American manufacturing in the future. Such healthier companies can continue to provide an economic engine to our Nation and provide innovations that can drive future growth. 
   I regret that these bridge loans are necessary, but today we can ill afford to risk the loss of more jobs and further damage to the economic base that our cities and small towns depend on in North Carolina and across the country. I support H.R. 7321, Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6304, FISA Amendments Act. This bipartisan bill takes steps to increase our Nation's security while also protecting Americans' civil liberties. 
   H.R. 6304, FISA Amendments Act, provides the critical tools that our intelligence community needs to ensure the safety of our Nation. With many surveillance warrants set to expire in the coming weeks, the intelligence community needs a strong and dependable set of guidelines to follow while conducting surveillance. H.R. 6304 allows the Government to authorize surveillance in the case of an emergency situation, provided that they return to the FISA court within 7 days to apply for a warrant. 
   This bill also includes a number of provisions that significantly strengthen the protection of our civil rights. H.R. 6304 clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means for conducting surveillance in the United States, prohibiting any President from using executive power to conduct a warrantless wiretapping program. This bill also requires the Government to obtain an individual warrant from the FISA Court before conducting surveillance on a United States citizen. This warrant must be based on probable cause, and the provision now includes American citizens abroad as well. H.R. 6304 requires prior review and approval of the intelligence community's targeting and minimization procedures that ensure that any inadvertently intercepted communications by American citizens are destroyed. Finally, the FISA Amendments Act adds a strong layer of oversight to this process by directing the Inspectors General from Justice, State, Defense, the DNI, and NSA to review surveillance procedures and submit their findings to Congress. 
   H.R. 6304 rejects blanket immunity for telecommunications companies that may have participated in the administration's warrantless wiretapping program. Under this bill, lawsuits against these companies would be determined by Federal district courts. These telecommunications companies will have to prove that the Administration provided written assurance that their activities were legal. There is no immunity for any government official who may have violated the law included in this legislation. 
   This bill is much stronger than the Senate version, and will protect both our security and the civil liberties that we enjoy. I support the passage of H.R. 6304, FISA Amendments Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bipartisan measure as well.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1538, Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it. 
   I support H.R. 1538 because I believe our men and women in uniform who have served our country deserve the best possible care when they return home. The conditions that were recently uncovered at Walter Reed Army Medical Center were disturbing and unacceptable. In addition, thousands of soldiers are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we need to further improve the conditions of the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration health care systems in order to meet this need. As the Representative for Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, and as a veteran myself, I have always made the needs of our soldiers and veteran and their families high on the priority list. 
   H.R. 1538 is a bipartisan bill that improves the lives of our veterans in several ways. This legislation will improve the access to quality medical care for service members who are outpatients at military health care facilities, restore efficiency to the disability evaluation system, and streamline the transition of wounded service members from the Armed Forces to the Veterans Administration. By establishing a system or patient advocates and independent medical advocates, and improving the system of case managers for wounded service members, H.R. 1538 makes sure that veterans are getting the care that they need. In addition, this bill improves training and reduces caseloads for these managers so that service members and their families can get more individual attention. Finally, H.R. 1538 establishes a national toll-free hotline so that service members and families have a mechanism for  reporting problems and deficiencies in their treatment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1538, Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, and improving the quality of care for our Nation's veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of North Carolina's children and our working families and the people of America, I rise this evening in support of this budget resolution and congratulate my good friend the chairman of the committee, JOHN SPRATT, for his visionary leadership in crafting this important document. 
   With this budget resolution, the new Democratic majority will succeed where our Republican predecessors have failed. To budget is to govern, and this resolution will produce a balanced budget with balanced priorities, and that is important. 
   As the chairman has indicated, I am proud to be the only chief State schools officer serving in Congress, and I am particularly pleased about the measures providing for education and innovation in this budget. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership. 
   Specifically, rather than continuing the Republicans' record of passing a crushing debt burden on the future generations, the Spratt resolution contains tough budget discipline for a new direction for the Federal budget. The Spratt resolution rejects the President's proposed education cuts and instead provides greater investment in our Nation's schools, including the school construction bonds that Chairman Rangel and I have been working on for nearly a decade. It provides $50 billion for children's health insurance, and it protects millions of middle-income families from the onslaught of the alternative minimum tax. 
   There are many reasons to support this resolution, but in my brief allotted time, I want to say that I support this resolution on behalf of my grandson, William, and my granddaughter, Virginia, and all the children of America and their families who deserve a budget that puts their needs first. 
   My friends, this is what the Republican leadership has done for the last 6 years. They used a credit card. No one in America could get away with paying nothing but the interest on a credit card. They have run up the debt for my grandchildren and every child in America, and that is wrong. The definition of a good budget is when you do what is right for the next generation. That is the definition of this budget, and it is a budget that is truly balanced. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your hard work.

   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. 
   Madam Chairman, as the only former State schools chief serving in Congress, I have always worked to be a voice for children and their schools. 
   One of the biggest challenges we face in my home State of North Carolina--and really across this country--is a lack of adequate facilities for learning to take place. We simply must make a commitment to get our children out of trailers and into quality classrooms. 
   You just heard my colleague talk about what we're doing overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan building schools. If we can build them overseas, we certainly can build them here in the United States. This bill is an important first step toward improving our children's education. 
   We will need to follow the authorization of these grants with full funding in appropriations. And we need to ensure that local and State authorities can raise money in other ways, as would be provided by in the America's Better Classroom Act through interest-free bonds to build more schools. There really is no substitute for bricks and mortar when it comes to quality schools and meeting the educational goals of our community. 
   I applaud Chairman Miller and Congressman Chandler for their leadership on this issue, and urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3021, to improve the quality of where our children go to school and help them to learn and to be able to compete in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I will vote to override the President's veto of H.R. 976. As the only former State schools chief serving in Congress, my life's work has been to provide for a better future for the next generation, and health care is critically important to that effort. There is no doubt that the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, has served this Nation well and must be reauthorized and expanded. The Congressional Research Service reported this week that, at current funding levels, 21 states would run out of SCHIP money before the end of the current budget year, and funding for North Carolina would only provide coverage for needy children through May 2008. 
   In North Carolina, over 250,000 children who would otherwise have gone without insurance have been served by North Carolina's Health Choice. The services they get through Health Choice--regular checkups and preventative care, doctor and hospital visits when they are sick, and ongoing dental and vision benefits--make sure that North Carolina's children are as healthy and productive as possible and grow up to fulfill their best potential. Untreated illnesses can have long-term consequences, and ensuring access to health care, as SCHIP does in North Carolina and across the country, allows children to remain healthy and strong and head off expensive treatments down the road. As a nation, we must follow through on the promise of SCHIP to protect our most vulnerable citizens. 
   SCHIP is not government-run medical care as some have falsely claimed. SCHIP is an effective initiative to extend health insurance to working families who otherwise cannot afford to send their children to the doctor when they are sick. In North Carolina, this has meant providing a physician-directed managed care system modeled on health insurance for children of state employees and teachers. North Carolina has about the best child health programs of any state, providing seamless cost-effective care for thousands of at-risk children, each year reducing costs and becoming more effective at providing health care. 
   The funding increase in H.R. 976 is necessary to address shortfalls in the current SCHIP funding plan, and to allow states to reach more eligible but uninsured children. The bill expands health care coverage to 10 million children in America over the next five years. In North Carolina the $35 billion in this legislation translates into 210,000 covered children, an increase of 90,000 children. Only kids aged 6-17 with families below 200 percent of the poverty level are covered by SCHIP in North Carolina. Even if some of these children have had private insurance for some of the time, their parents only were able to afford it by cutting back on other necessities. We owe it to these children to ensure  that they are continuously covered and can get the health care they need when they need it. I wholeheartedly support the increased funding and the guidelines for states in this legislation. 
   I have withheld my support for this bill in the past due to my concerns about the bill's funding mechanism, and I continue to be concerned about the impact of a tobacco tax increase on North Carolina's rural communities. I am working with the leadership of the House of Representatives to craft an effective disaster relief package that will assist North Carolina's farmers and help to counter any negative impact. As the Chairman of a key Agriculture Subcommittee, I will continue to work to address the needs of farm country, including finishing the Farm Bill with a real safety net for farm families and pursuing disaster relief for drought-stricken regions like North Carolina. Should the veto override fail, I will continue to urge the Congressional leadership to write a new bill that funds SCHIP without placing the burden of funding on the backs of North Carolinians. 
   After careful consideration, I will vote to override the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the children of America's working families.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And let me thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work. 
   The Department of Homeland Security is tasked with protecting America and its citizens. There is no greater charge. Oversight is critical to the Department both to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and to examine the effectiveness and to recommend improvements for the Department's operations. This bill provides support for the Inspector General's Office and creates tools that will enhance transparency for Congress and the public. 
   To help improve policymaking at the DHS and to promote long-term planning, this bill establishes a Directorate for Policy to be headed by an undersecretary for policy and requires a quadrennial review of the Department's practices and mission. 
   This policymaking must address the needs of America's most vulnerable citizens: its children. I thank the chairman for including my language that requires the Directorate for Policy to address the needs of children. That will enable the Department to enhance school preparedness and other emergency planning needs of facilities for children. 
   As a former superintendent of North Carolina's public schools, I know how important planning is to preparedness and security for our schools and other places that focus on our children. The Department must understand the importance of including schools and children in emergency planning, and this bill will ensure that it does so. 
   I also believe that DHS must prioritize the protection of our critical food and agriculture infrastructure to enhance the health and security of America. The ongoing melamine crisis only reveals how vulnerable we are. 
   This bill requires the Department to report on their progress on agriculture security in response to issues raised by two critical reports on their efforts. That will ensure that DHS is doing appropriate planning for agriculture security and give Congress the opportunity for oversight. I thank the chairman for including this in this bill. 
   I am also concerned about the security of sensitive materials used by the Department, uniforms, badges, identification cards, and protective equipment. 
   H.R. 1684 enhances the nation's security by requiring these items, subject to practical exceptions, produced domestically when they will be used domestically. 
   Taken together, the many good provisions in this bill will improve the Department's ability to protect our homeland. This is a good, bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment because section 407 that my colleague wants to strike has one purpose, to strengthen our national security. It is a commonsense provision that says that sensitive materials, uniforms, protective gear, badges and identification cards should be produced and shipped only within the United States of America. It has a flexible provision that contains an exception for when materials are not available domestically of an acceptable quality or at market value. As long as the Secretary certifies that national security will be protected, he may do it. So if one of our allies makes an item of protective gear that is not available domestically, it will still be available to the Department. 
   Additionally, it does not apply to purchases made outside the United States for use outside the United States. So if an agent or officer is overseas and needs a bulletproof vest or other piece of protective gear quickly, he or she can get it. 
   Our national security could be compromised if terrorists, smugglers or other would-be counterfeiters had ready access to the Department of Homeland Security's uniforms, protective gear or ID cards. 
   This amendment would remove or reduce the opportunity for terrorists or others with bad intentions to pose as Homeland Security officials or officers. It is not uncommon for cargo to be hijacked or lost, particularly in the staging areas at our Nation's ports-of-entry. 
   The potential theft of uniforms, badges or ID cards, by the truckload it could be, poses a clear threat. In years past, there have been several reports on the overseas manufacture of uniforms for the Department of Homeland Security's operational components. Indeed, most Americans would be shocked to learn that Border Patrol uniforms have been manufactured in Mexico and other countries. This ongoing practice raises legitimate security concerns, not only at the border but all across this country, which is what this provision addresses. 
   For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I admire the gentleman, but I think, in this case, we are talking about an issue that transcends the issues we are talking about. We are talking about the safety and security of American people. 
   I believe in trade. I have supported it. But there are issues that are paramount to the security and protection of the American people. I think this is one where it goes to the badges and the uniforms that our men and women use to protect Americans' interests. 
   So, with that, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, and I rise in support of H.R. 4.  
   Mr. Speaker, nearly 4 years ago, I voted against the legislation that created Medicare Part D when the then-Republican Majority passed it in the dead of night. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 4 to correct one of its most fundamental flaws. H.R. 4 would simply remove the provision of law that prohibits the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating the price of prescription drugs to lower costs for Medicare beneficiaries. I have never supported price fixing or rationing, and I am confident that this legislation is a good first step toward more comprehensive Medicare reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents work at America's pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, and I think it is important to take note of the many contributions these employers make to the betterment of our communities. Indeed, many of the biotechnology firms in North Carolina are among our best corporate citizens, providing employment opportunities, investing in America's health and well-being, growing the local tax base, providing essential services to our neediest constituents and giving back to our communities. 
   For example, GlaxoSmithKline offers the free GSK Orange Card savings program to help more than 175,000 low-income seniors to save 20 percent to 40 percent off the usual price for outpatient GSK medicines. A coalition of eight companies offers the free Together Rx Card to poor and uninsured Americans, which has helped more than 1.4 million seniors to save more than $600 million on their medicines. In addition, U.S. pharmaceutical companies annually invest billions of dollars in biotechnology research to develop medicines to treat and cure terrible diseases and relieve human suffering. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4 and call on this Congress to work with the private sector as we move forward to reform Medicare to lower prices for beneficiaries while providing vital health care products and services.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this fine legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it. This is a good bill, and I commend the bipartisan work of the Education and Labor Committee under the leadership of Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member Buck McKeon. 
   H.R. 4137 will renew and reauthorize the Higher Education Act for the first time in 10 years. This legislation will expand college access for low-income and minority students by allowing students to receive year-round Pell Grant scholarships and strengthening college readiness initiatives as well as increasing the authorized Pell Grant maximum to $9,000. The bill will streamline the federal student financial aid application. 
   In addition, H.R. 4137 will create Community Colleges as Partners in Teacher Education grants which will provide needed support to establish teacher education efforts that are aligned with four-year institutions, so students can transition seamlessly from community college to four-year schools. The bill will provide further assistance to community colleges in critical areas such as remedial education, rural development, and nursing education. And H.R. 4137 will make textbook costs more manageable for students by helping them to plan for textbook expenses in advance of each semester. 
   I also support several useful floor amendments to the bill that will further strengthen this legislation, including the Managers amendment containing the Davis amendment to create a new masters assistance program for HBCUs, including Fayetteville State University in my Congressional District. I also support the Doggett amendment to enable data-matching between the IRS and the Department of Education for the purposes of calculating the Expected Family Contribution when processing financial aid. I support the Edwards/Boyda amendment to provide for in-state tuition for soldiers' dependents like so many families of soldiers at North Carolina's Fort Bragg. And I support the Shuler amendment to authorize a competitive grant program through the Department of Education that would allow institutions of higher education to create longitudinal data systems to efficiently and accurately manage, analyze, disaggregate and use individual student data. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, as the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to higher education is the key to the American Dream for working families. I am pleased to support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. 
   As a veteran of the U.S. Army myself, I strongly support our troops, our veterans and their families. Our troops have done everything they have been asked to do and done it exceptionally well. I am tremendously proud of all the troops from North Carolina and across America who have done their duty so admirably. They are our heroes, and we salute them. But as the Representative for Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, I am very concerned about the state of readiness of America's armed forces. 
   I have traveled to Iraq twice, and after I returned last year, I said the Administration must change this failed policy. Specifically, I said that we need more focus on the threat of international terrorists. The National Counterterrorism Center has released a report today entitled: ``Al-Qaida Better Positioned To Strike the West'' that concludes Osama Bin Laden's network has been reconstructed while America's military is bogged down in the civil war in Iraq, with no end in sight. 
   H.R. 2956, written by Chairman IKE SKELTON of the Armed Services Committee, one of the most respected Members of this body and an expert on military policy, is a good first step for this needed new direction. It requires the Iraqi leaders to begin to provide for the security of their own country by redeploying American combat troops from the sectarian civil war and reconstituting our readiness and transitioning American forces to the mission of effective counterterrorism anywhere in the world where radical jihadists threaten America and our interests. Let me be clear that H.R. 2956 maintains the flexibility of the Commander in Chief to direct the operations of the armed forces. It simply calls for a change in policy and public accountability for a comprehensive U.S. strategy for Iraq. 
   North Carolina's senior Senator stated it well this week when she said, ``It is my firm hope and belief that we can start bringing our troops home in 2008.'' This bill begins to do just that. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

   ``The farm bill is one of our highest priorities. We understand there may be a motion to recommit the bill back to the House Committee on Agriculture. We urge you to oppose this amendment. Without the additional almost $4 billion in offsets, we cannot adequately fund the nutrition needs in the farm bill.'' This is signed by the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
   And from 24 different commodity groups that affect labor and commodities in America: 
   ``Dear Members of Congress, we support both the underlying farm bill and the additional nutrition spending which gives rise to the need for an offset. For that reason we appreciate the efforts of Members of Congress who have attempted to identify that offset and we would encourage those who are concerned about the offset identified by the Committee on Ways and Means to support H.R. 2419 despite those concerns. 
   ``In any event, we urge the House to move expeditiously to pass H.R. 2419. We remain hopeful that the long congressional tradition of passing farm bills on a bipartisan fashion will not be broken.'' And it is signed by 24 groups from the American Soybean Association through the U.S. Rice Producers Association.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report, the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Bipartisan 9/11 Commission, and commend the chairman, Mr. Thompson, and the ranking member, Mr. King, for their hard work. We would not be here today had it not been for their diligence and hard work and the leadership of our committee. And certainly, as has already been said today, Congress cannot wait for another attack like 9/11 to take the steps to protect our Nation from terrorists, and I thank them for their efforts. 
   This legislation improves homeland security. It empowers our communities to respond to threats, and it enhances interoperable communications and begins to restore America's moral leadership in the world. 
   Homeland security begins with hometown security, and local funding provided by this bill makes our entire Nation more secure. 
   Specifically, the bill provides States with more than $3 billion over 5 years to provide all hazardous preparation and response assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former State school chief in North Carolina, and a proud member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am particularly proud that this bill specifically strengthens school security. The legislation emphasizes the need for resources to protect our school children and plan for emergency response for our schools. And it contains a provision that I offered directing the Department of Homeland Security to study this related to school buses and school transportation. 
   Just last week, the National Intelligence Estimate gave us a stark warning that we cannot afford to be complacent in the face of rising Islamic extremism and threat of terrorist violence. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want bipartisan action and I commend this report.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this Conference Report to H.R. 1, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this vitally important legislation to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. 
   In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy of 9/11, our Federal, State, and local governments worked to improve preparedness and our security. The work that we have done since then has made our country safer, but there is much more yet to do. 
   Keeping all Americans safe must be the top priority of the government. Congress cannot wait for another attack to take steps to protect our nation from terrorism. The legislation that I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting today improves homeland security, empowers our communities to prepare for and respond to all threats, and begins to restore America's moral leadership throughout the world. It reflects bipartisan work on the part on the part of this Congress and implements many of the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. These provisions will make our Nation stronger and safer. 
   The bill fixes grant programs for first responders, and takes all-hazards risk-based approach to our homeland security spending. It will provide critical funding and equipment to our communities to implement state homeland security plans, protect mass transportation, and enable first responders to communicate with each other during a terrorist attack or other emergencies. It improves intelligence and information sharing among agencies, and ensures a unified response to all threats. Homeland security begins with hometown security, and these local resources make our entire nation more secure. Specifically, the bill provides states more than $3 billion over 5 years to provide all hazards preparation and response assistance. 
   Others have spoken about the provisions that provide 100 percent scanning of cargo, prevent the proliferation of WMD, and advance our democratic values--these are vital and important provisions we can all be proud of. As the former State schools superintendent in North Carolina, and North Carolina's only member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am particularly proud of the fact that the legislation emphasizes. the need for resources to protect our school children and plan for emergency response at our schools. It also contains my provision directing the Department of Homeland Security to study risks related to school buses and other school transportation. These details are evidence of the comprehensive nature of this bill, which preserves and strengthens our national response to all threats to homeland security. 
   Just last week, the new National Intelligence Estimate gave us a stark warning that we can not afford to be complacent in the face of rising Islamic extremism and the threat of terrorist violence. This legislation continues Congress' commitment to keeping America safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want bipartisan action to provide real solutions for a safe and secure country, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to approve this conference report.

   Mr. Chairman, as you've heard, this commodity has already taken a major hit, a major change in the whole list of that commodity. It is really unfair to single out cotton. 
   I agree with the gentleman from Colorado; we have done some things in conservation and wish we could have done more and wish we had more money. You have already heard how we have been strapped for cash, but the truth is this amendment is unfair. And I will oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I would encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. 
   We will continue to work with him as the bill moves forward to try and help, but it is absolutely unfair, once we have reached this very delicate balance within the bill, to reach in and single out one commodity that has already been hit harder in terms of cuts than any other commodity within all of the commodity titles.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (REGARDING INSPECTOR GENERAL OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6406, Mr. Larson's bill to make the Inspector General at the CFTC a Presidential appointment, and hence more of an independent office within the Commission. 
   Madam Speaker, as you know, the provisions of H.R. 6406 were originally part of the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act introduced by the Ag chairman, Chairman Peterson, and myself after Representative Larson had brought it to us. The House has already supported those provisions with 276 votes when the CMTA was first considered on July 30 of this year. Unfortunately, because of jurisdictional issues, the provisions were not a part of the version of the CMTA Act that passed the House last week. I am pleased that we are able to take this vote today to promote an independent Inspector General for the CFTC as originally intended. 
   We passed the CMTA to bring some more sunshine to the commodities market and over-the-counter trading of energy and agricultural commodities. This greater transparency will help establish greater confidence in the markets. An independent Inspector General will contribute further to that goal. 
   I applaud the gentleman from Connecticut for his perseverance in moving the bill forward. The points he has raised regarding the need for this bill have merit. Currently, the Department of the Treasury is the only financial regulator with a Presidentially-appointed Inspector General. This bill will make the CFTC the second financial regulator with this kind of independent oversight. 
   Given the financial turmoil that we have seen in other financial markets, the arguments for a more independent Inspector General for the CFTC also apply to other financial regulators, like the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC. Congress may want to consider requiring similar provisions for other financial regulators. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction to bring confidence to financial markets. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (TREATMENT OF FARMS WITH LIMITED BASE ACRES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6849. 
   Let me also thank Chairman Peterson, chairman of the full committee, and Ranking Member Goodlatte for their hard work and effort in making  sure that we got a quick markup on this bill in committee and got it to the floor. 
   I introduced this legislation with my good friend and colleague, Representative JERRY MORAN, to help thousands of American farmers who would have been adversely affected by really the willful misinterpretation in the 2008 farm bill by the Department of Agriculture. 
   Madam Speaker, the Department has interpreted the language in the 2008 farm bill in a manner that would prevent thousands of small farmers from receiving the program payments they are owed, putting them in jeopardy, in some cases, of financial hardship and some might even have to go out of business. 
   This is based on its misinterpretation of a provision in title I of the farm bill that was meant to prevent payments to those farms that are 10 acres or less. Despite clear report language outlining how USDA is to implement this provision, the Secretary has chosen not to read it as written. 
   I personally, along with a number of my colleagues, opposed the 10-acre provision in the farm bill when it was debated in the committee and again during conference, because we should not punish small farmers in America. But I understand the provision's intent: to prevent people who are not active farmers from gaming the system and getting government payments on land they didn't actively farm. I think that's appropriate. 
   However, I cannot abide by the interpretation that puts thousands of farmers who rent or lease small tracts of land for their farming operations and place them at risk of not receiving payments and could, in some cases, put them in jeopardy of being out of business, an interpretation that puts existing contracts between landowners and farmers at risk of being voided. 
   Let me just share with you what this means. In the State of Iowa, roughly 12,000 farms are affected; in Illinois, approximately 16,000 farms would be affected; in Ohio, 16,000 farms; in Kentucky, 20,000 farms; and in my home State of North Carolina, almost 16,000 farms would be adversely impacted if Congress let's the department rule stand. Nationwide, this number could be as high as 460,000 farms. 
   H.R. 6849 fixes this problem. It suspends the provisions in title I for the 2008-2009 crop years that would have required producers to have a minimum of a 10-acre base to receive program benefits. This provision provides time to consider a more permanent fix in the future. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ETHERIDGE. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ETHERIDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7005, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. 
   H.R. 7005 is critical to easing the burden on middle-class taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, was originally intended to ensure that the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers were not able to avoid paying taxes altogether. However, it was not indexed for inflation, and today millions of middle income Americans who pay their taxes as required would see a huge tax increase because of the AMT. In my district alone, over 30,000 people would be affected by the AMT this year. H.R. 7005 provides 1 year of AMT relief to protect ordinary taxpayers who are threatened by this extra tax by increasing the amount of income exempt from the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, this bill would protect individuals who exercised incentive stock options from being required to pay tax on gains that never materialized. This legislation will protect over 25 million middle-class families from paying the AMT. 
   I would have preferred that this bill was fully paid for. I supported H.R. 6275, the 1-year AMT patch legislation that the House passed in June of this year. This bill was fully offset and did not add to the deficit. Unfortunately, the Administration and Senate Republicans have continued to ignore fiscal responsibility and have threatened to veto any AMT bill that includes offsets. However, H.R. 7005 is a crucial part of providing tax relief to millions of middle-income Americans and strengthening our lagging economy. 
   I support H.R. 7005, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.
