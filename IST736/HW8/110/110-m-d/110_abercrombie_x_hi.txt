<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I would at this point like to thank Mr. Mike Turner for working with us and the committee, right from the get-go, and also Mr. Phil English as well, to demonstrate what we have been saying here that Republicans alone, Democrats alone cannot bring this to an end. It requires us all to work together. 
   Now, there are some, I am sorry to say, on both ends of the spectrum of the parties who want to diminish what the bill is all about and what its intent is all about. Someone went so far yesterday as to say, well, this bill is like naming post offices. 
   Well, yesterday, we named two post offices for marines that were killed in Iraq. I don't suppose the author of that kind of commentary would like to speak with the family of the marines who have been killed about why these post offices were named. 
   I think it's pretty important that we concentrate on those who are bearing the brunt of the policies that we approve of in this body. That's what this is all about. We want to end the party sniping. We want to end the commentary about advantages being taken from one party or another. 
   Cover has been mentioned, about whether it would be given to one party or another. The only cover that we are interested in is the cover that has to be obtained by our fighting men and women in the field, because they are engaged in battle as a result of the policies that we either approve or disapprove of. 
   It's time for the Congress to take back its responsibility. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into the Record a commentary from the Government Accountability Office as of the end of July of this year.  
   Issues that DOD needs to consider in planning and executing the draw down and redeployment of forces from Iraq:

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to recognize Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on its 100th anniversary. On this important centennial, I would like to commemorate the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the shipyard. In their honor, we have introduced H. Res. 1139. 
   The Congress established the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on May 13, 1908, and it has grown from a coaling and repair station to being known in Hawaiian as the ``No Ka Oi Shipyard''--``No Ka Oi'' meaning the best--and is a national treasure that is strategically important to our Nation and equally vital to Hawaii. 
   During World War II, shipyard workers earned the motto, ``We keep them fit to fight,'' by resurrecting the United States Pacific Fleet from the bottom of Pearl Harbor, helping to turn the tide of war at Midway, and maintaining the ships that would ultimately win victory at sea and sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay. 
   Throughout the decades, the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities by supporting America's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, and national missile defense. It continues to support the United States Pacific Fleet as the largest ship repair facility between the West Coast of the United States and the Far East, providing full-service maintenance for Pacific Fleet ships and submarines throughout the Asia Pacific theater. 
   The shipyard has become the largest single industrial employer in Hawaii and is the largest fully integrated military-civilian workforce involved in full service shipyard work in the United States. The shipyard has a direct annual economic impact of more than $600 million in Hawaii, and through its apprentice, engineer co-op, and other student hire programs, provides extraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities for residents. 
   Moreover, the shipyard has earned multiple national awards for its dedicated environmental stewardship and excellent safety programs, such as the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Star Award in May of 2007. 
   I want to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and congratulate the men and women who provide exceptional service to our military and indeed keep the Pacific Fleet ``fit to fight.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I'm going to reserve the balance of my time at this point.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Wittman and I want to thank him. It is perhaps by coincidence, but a happy coincidence, that the gentleman, of course, is from Virginia. And with Virginia and Hawaii, we represent the east coast and the far west coast, I guess--really west--in Hawaii. 
   And I want to thank him as well for his excellent statement. Part of the reason being that he has outlined very, very well, I think, one of the most important issues that we face and one that does not always receive the kind of attention that I think it warrants, namely, our shipyards as a resource, and meeting the strategic interests of the United States. 
   Our shipyards, both public and private, are crucial, vital and necessary not only to the defense of the United States, but to seeing to it that, should  we be called upon to exert military activity anywhere in the world, the backbone, the foundation of any naval presence in any such contingency is dependent on the professionalism, dedication and perseverance of shipyards in this Nation. 
   He also mentioned, of course, the Virginia Class submarines, the nuclear submarines. And having observed the maintenance facilities in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, I can assure you and Mr. Wittman that those Virginia Class submarines will be welcomed there, and that the repair and maintenance will be handled by people at the height of their professional capacity. 
   The military's counsel there, the Pearl Harbor supervisors--some of whom I believe are in the gallery today observing what we're carrying out today in terms of the resolution--understand that we're going through more than just simply a ritual undertaking. I think that perhaps sometimes these resolutions get put into that category in the sense that it appears sometimes that we're going through the motions. But I'm sure you know, Madam Speaker, that one of the advantages of ritual in our society and among our species is that ritual is the great conservator of value. It is a measurement of our sense of ourselves, where we've been, where we're going, and what we have as the basis for the future. 
   And so, yes, we're commemorating the 100th anniversary today of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, but in doing so, we remind ourselves of its historic legacy and we remind ourselves as well as to what the future may require of us here in the United States. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard stands ready to do its duty. Yes, Madam Speaker, I can tell you Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard will see that our naval forces are ``fit to fight.'' 
   Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close after my colleague has yielded back his time. And I will continue to reserve my time pending that happy occasion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in the wake of news that comes to us that the United States will now have as a policy in Iraq the arming of Sunni groups who have admittedly killed and maimed Americans. We have now reached the point of public-political lunacy. 
   Representative Paul, myself, Representative Jones and others have entered a bill for consideration of the House that will cause us to have to reauthorize this war. Any conceivable reason for having allowed the President to enter into this war with the enabling resolution that we passed has now been accomplished; any ``whereas,'' any ``be it resolved'' of that resolution is now moot. 
   In order for any of us to justify spending one more penny or committing one more soldier of the United States into this war, we have to have an up-or-down vote on whether it should be authorized. 
   Arming Sunni groups that have murdered U.S. service men and women as a policy, a strategy, is without merit and devoid of any political sensibility.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. That may be, and that makes my point. I certainly was not among the ones to create it; but I'll tell you, had I been here in 1984, I probably would have voted for it. I voted for these kinds of things before without thinking much about it because it was an easy vote, it was an easy vote as to come and say, well, environmental groups, they all know all about this, why get crossways with them when you have a good environmental record. I've gotten my awards, too, not because of my bright perception, but because I voted the right way without thinking much about it. 
   Why is this here in the Interior bill on appropriations? Why do we have members of the committee standing up ahead of time? I don't know that anybody on Appropriations knows more about it than the people on Resources or the Energy Committee. But why? Because we legislate on an appropriations bill, that's why. 
   And we didn't break any agreements down here. If the agreement was what was being broken, why is this moratorium again being put into the bill this year? If we had an agreement last year, you wouldn't need the moratorium.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. And I quite agree on that technical point, that limitations are appropriate. We're trying to put some limitations on some of the fiction that's out here today. I can assure you of that. 
   I think I know something about tourism. I know that in order to have tourists, you have to have people with jobs that have sufficient discretionary income to be able to come and spend their money. But if we're destroying the industrial structure of this country, which is what we're about right now, there won't be anybody having the jobs to be able to come and spend the money on tourism or anything else. 
   And if you want them to arrive in automobiles, which we can't do yet because I haven't been able to get an earmark for that bridge from San Francisco to Hawaii, that's a bridge to somewhere, I can assure you, the question then would be, well, what are you going to be paying for your gasoline? You want to have a hybrid car, you're going to have natural gas. You have to have natural gas as the base. You want to have ethanol to be able to do it? You have to have natural gas for the fertilizer that's going to grow the feedstocks in order to create the ethanol. 
   Natural gas is the natural energy bridge to a natural energy future, to an alternative energy future. If we don't have natural gas, let me tell you what's going to happen. It's happening right now, and there has been references to it already. Europe and Russia are now making a deal to promote natural gas exploration and extrication from Russia to the European economy, to the European Union in the hundreds of billions of gallons in order to be able to compete with us. It's not just mythology that the Chinese, using inferior technology, will be some 45 miles off of Florida right now exploring natural gas, as the Canadians are already doing on the other side of the Great Lakes. 
   Every single industrial country in this world is producing natural gas right now except us. We are the ones that destroying ourselves, committing suicide on this. This is what is happening; the rest of the world is going to have an industrial base and an industrial complex that's able to compete, and we're destroying ourselves. 
   You're looking at a convert here. I went into the Resources Committee fully prepared to not only sustain the moratorium that's here, but to vote against Mr. Peterson when he first brought up the idea of drilling for natural gas. But when I listened to him and I read all the facts involved, I decided that I had the wrong position. And what's required of us now is to become energy independent. We have to produce the energy in this country that is going to allow us to be independent, sufficient to be able to back up that Defense Department that we're talking about. The Air Force right now is spending an enormous amount of money on fuel that we have to import. If we can take the natural gas base for the Air Force right now, we stand a chance of producing fuel that can sustain ourselves. 
   We have to be energy independent in this country. And that means those of who us who have blindly supported, what were supposedly the right environmental proposals in the past have  to take an honest look at where we are today and what we can do to produce clean energy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time. I hope that when we get past this today, that we will deal with the bill that Mr. Peterson and I will be bringing forward to produce natural gas in this country to produce a free and independent America.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Chairman, I want to support my friend Mr. Peterson on this amendment. 
   I indicated in the last amendment, Mr. Chairman, that I had become a convert, not to everything that has to do with it, to just stand up and say, well, if it is going to be oil drilled anywhere or gas drilled anywhere, that I could care less, that doesn't make any difference. That is not true, and it is not the case. 
   In fact, what I have argued to the oil companies is, and I have said when I had the opportunity, why do you put these stupid ads in the paper that say we only make a return on investment the same as real estate agents? I said, there is a great way to go about saying why you got $30 billion in profits, that real estate agents are the opposition or the comparison. 
   I say, why don't you get up and say oil is $60 and $70 a barrel. We are rolling in money. We got so much money we don't know what to do with it. I feel like Huey, Louie and Dewey jumping into the piles of money for Scrooge McDuck. We got so much money we can't even begin to figure out how to spend it. 
   At that kind of money a barrel, what do you think the oil companies are going to make? 
   We have to have an energy supply in this country, and 100 miles out that is what we are going to have to do, because the opposition keeps on coming here against our energy independence. If we don't have energy independence, we are finished. We are destroying ourselves. Every other country in the world with a natural gas reserve out there, let alone with an oil supply, especially in the Outer Continental Shelves of their respective continents, are taking it and doing it and providing for their industrial expansion. That is what we are up against. 
   We are now in debt. You only have to go into the papers as recently as yesterday, the next globalization backlash. Wait until the Kremlin starts buying our stocks. We are in hock to the rest of the world, including Japan and China because they are owning this country because we have to import our energy. Energy independence is the key to freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the immediate support for the expansion of the eligibility of benefits for Filipino vets. 
   On July 26, 1941, Franklin Roosevelt brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States during World War II. Yet when their service ended, they did not receive the same benefits or treatment as other American soldiers. 
   Congress passed the Rescission Act in 1946, against General MacArthur's open objections. This even includes such things as burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits. There will be only 20,000 left by 2010. 
   There is some contention here that the Filipino veterans that fought with us as allies are not U.S. citizens. We are paying Sunni tribesmen who killed American soldiers bribe money today in Iraq, but the Filipino vets who saved American soldiers are left out of the benefits as allies of the United States. 
   This is shameful and needs to be stopped immediately. Bring those benefits to these Filipino vets, who are the allies and comrades in arms of United States soldiers.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I want to pay a special thank you, a big mahalo, to Mr. Scott and to the Judiciary Committee for their hard work. I am very grateful to the ranking members, the Republicans and Democrats. We cannot resolve this without seeing to it that we have a bipartisan approach on this. 
   I am particularly grateful to Senator PAT LEAHY, who is the Judiciary Chairman in the Senate, for entrusting this bill to our care here in the House and allowing me to introduce it as a companion bill to the one that has passed in the Senate. I am very hopeful that we can get a vote in the Senate and move this to the President's desk. 
   When the wrong computer equipment arrived in Iraq, the contractor ordered it dumped into a mammoth burn pit and placed an order for replacements, rather than sending it back. The government paid for both the wrong computers and the replacements. The contractor collected a fee for each, thanks to a cost-plus contract. 
   Halliburton had drivers driving empty trucks between bases in Iraq, unnecessarily exposing the drivers to danger, because the company was paid by the trip, not by the amount of materiel hauled or a flat fee; $186 million was spent over 2 years to build 142 health care centers, yet only 15 have been completed and only eight are open. According to testimony, the contractor lacked qualified engineers, hired incompetent subcontractors, failed to supervise construction work, and failed to enforce quality control. 
   A large U.S. construction company was paid tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's schools. Many of the schools were never touched, and several that were repaired, and I say that in quotes, were left in shambles, one filled with unflushed sewage. 
   At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in contracts have already been forced to pay up to $300 million in penalties to resolve allegations of bid-rigging, fraud, gross overcharging, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage, $300 million in penalties. Some of these same companies have faced such allegations during past military operations in other countries, but have had no problem receiving new contracts in Iraq. 
   Despite millions of dollars in payments to U.S. companies, key pieces of Iraq's infrastructure, power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems, have either not been repaired or have been fixed so poorly that they still don't function. 
   How has this been allowed to happen? The United States Government directly and through the late Coalition Provisional Authority have outsourced the war in Iraq like no other in our history, spending more than $50 billion on private contractors to provide food, water, gasoline and other supplies, guard bases, drive trucks, and many other activities in support of our troops. 
   But consistent with the administration's overall attitude toward spending public money with private companies, little or no thought was given to contract oversight or accountability. As a result, some of these contractors have declared the U.S. occupation of Iraq open season on the taxpayer. Cleaning up this mess has been hampered by the fact that while anti-fraud laws protect against the waste or theft of U.S. taxpayers in the United States, there have been no statutes prohibiting sleazy business practices by American companies overseas. 
   As we have learned in the investigation of the Blackwater USA contract, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued order number 17, which specifically exempted U.S. contractors from Iraqi law. 
   In fact, one contractor was found guilty of 37 counts of fraud, including false billing, and was ordered to pay more than $10 million in damages, but the decision was overturned because the contracts were let through the Coalition Provisional Authority, and it was found that U.S. laws against fraud did not apply. 
   Despite the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was created by the Bush administration under the Department of Defense; despite the fact  that L. Paul Bremer, the overseer in Iraq, subsequent to the initial attack on Iraq, had an office literally across the hall from Secretary Rumsfeld, the Coalition Provisional Authority was not considered part of the U.S. Government, and, therefore, U.S. laws were unenforceable. 
   These practices are a flagrant abuse of the public's trust and the public's money during a time of war and cannot be allowed to continue. H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, will, one, criminalize war profiteering defined as contract fraud or overcharging for goods and services in connection with the mission of the United States Government overseas; two, violations of law will be a felony and punishable up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime; three, jurisdiction for such cases, no matter where the alleged crimes are committed, will be in the United States Federal court. 
   H.R. 400 was heard and considered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on August 1. Among the many significant consequences of the decision to invade and occupy Iraq marked by a complete dismissal of the need for intelligent planning and stunning incompetence in the conduct of the war, this problem has received too little attention from the news media, the public, and the Congress.     
   Most of the cases of fraud, questionable business practices and outright corruption have been uncovered and investigated through the efforts of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, Jr. Mr. Bowen and his super staff both here in the U.S. and on the ground in Iraq have provided oversight and insight under the most difficult conditions imaginable for billions of American taxpayer dollars intended to rebuild Iraq and support our troops in combat. They deserve our gratitude. They deserve the gratitude of the Congress and the Nation for a tough job well done. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill, together with H.R. 2740, legislation passed by this House last week to expand the reach of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to private civilian security operatives in the region are two important steps this Congress is taking to clean up the mess in Iraq. 
   H.R. 400, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the War Profiteering Prevention Act will help end the open season declared on American taxpayers.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I find it very unfortunate that my good friend from Virginia has taken a position that the bill in any way encourages the whims of prosecutors. As Mr. Scott has pointed out, the standard is very high and applies to any contract, whether it's in the United States or overseas. There is nothing applied to the contracts overseas that is not applied to a contract here in the United States when it comes to the question of fraud or overcharging or deliberate deception with regard to the contract. That standard has to be met in any court and has to come before any judge meeting such a standard. There is no differentiation whatsoever. 
   The reason the bill is here, and the reason we're bringing the legislation, is the courts have ruled that there is, at best, an ambiguous situation, if not an outright gap between the capacity for prosecution of such a crime, should the standard for the crime be sustained by a prosecutorial investigation, and what is possible in Iraq. It can't be prosecuted in Iraq, and the courts found that it wasn't. We did not have legislation sufficiently clear in the United States in order to prosecute it. Thus, far from arbitrary or capricious prosecution, we have the opportunity for arbitrary defrauding of the United States taxpayer with no consequences. That's why the legislation is here.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that some of the misconceptions or misperceptions that might be out there can be alleviated, because I don't believe that this should be considered a controversial bill in any way. There are some issues with respect to questions about favoritism or reverse discrimination, et cetera. Some of these issues have been raised in other contexts. 
   But in this particular instance, simply because the word or the phrase Native Hawaiian is attached, I hope that it doesn't confuse the issue. I have just had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Boehner, and I believe that we have an understanding about what is at stake here. 
   Let me make very, very clear what we are talking about. It reauthorizes a Native Hawaiian housing block grant through 2012. Now, these funds are used for infrastructure development and homeownership assistance under a program that is administered by the State of Hawaii as the result of Federal legislation in the last century. The bill that is on the floor today did not originate with Representative Hirono or myself, but is as a result of the request of the Hawaiian Homes Commission and its chairman, under the leadership of Governor Lingle, Governor Linda Lingle, who is a Republican. 
   The reason I bring that up is not to cite that for special consideration, but rather that this is not a Democrat and Republican issue. This is an institutional issue that whoever is Governor, and whoever are the commissioners, in this instance happen to be Republican, appointed by a Republican Governor. Those folks are obligated institutionally to bring these issues to the Congress for final adjudication because of the unique status, the unique legal status of the Hawaiian Home Lands. 
   The Hawaiian Home Lands were created by the Congress as a result of legislation put forward by the original delegate from the Hawaiian Islands to the Congress, Prince Kuhio, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, for whom the Federal building is named where I have my offices in Honolulu, the PJKK. Mr. Renzi may refer to the PJKK Federal Building. He was a Republican at the time, and as a result of his presentation, the original Hawaiian Home Lands were created. 
   It enables Hawaiian families on Hawaiian Home Lands under this unique legal status to be able to acquire private financing they otherwise can't get because they are under this legal admonition to go through the Hawaiian Homes Commission. So it allows the Hawaiian Home Lands, the Department, to be eligible for loan guarantees to borrow, issue bonded debt, enabling servicing up to five times their annual allocation. 
   This allows the Department to service low-income families without a large increase in Federal appropriations. That's the whole idea of it. It allows low-income Hawaiians to get their refinancing in addition to construction. It reduces the cost of homeownership, and it reduced risk by lowering monthly mortgage payments. That is what this is about. It's no special consideration. It is fulfilling the law as it exists.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, what remains for me is to express my gratitude to Mr. Renzi and also to Mr. Kildee and the Native American Caucus for helping all of us to understand what the issues are here. And also, I want to reiterate my thanks to Mr. Boehner for his open-mindedness and his attitude of being willing to listen on issues that might otherwise have been easily misunderstood. I am grateful also to Mr. Cole of Oklahoma for his participation and for his leadership in again helping us to discern issues that are of distinct advantage, not just to our particular constituents in Hawaii, but on the whole issue of how we are able to help people achieve homeownership, achieve an opportunity not to be dependent on government, but rather to be able to participate in the American Dream, the overall American Dream in a way that has genuine meaning for them and their families. 
   I am very pleased to see that this has not become a partisan issue, and that it has not ended up dividing us when we should, in fact, be united in our opportunity to minimize the effect of government having bad consequences for people, and maximizing the opportunity for the ordinary individual and the ordinary individual's family to be able to advance the family's cause. 
   In this particular instance then, Mr. Speaker, I am very, very pleased that we are able to move forward on this, and I hope that the vote will be a solid one and that we can move forward to other issues not only where homeownership is concerned, but advancing the capacity of families to be able to succeed in the American Dream. 
   I would like to express my gratitude to the gentlelady from California, and express my thanks to her for the leadership of her and her committee in bringing this forward. Again, Mr. Speaker, before I close, my deep respect for and gratitude to Mr. Renzi and for all those who helped bring this forward on the Republican side of the aisle.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I am confining my remarks to the Chair, because if I was saying it directly to the gentleman, he would know it a lot more physically. 
   Now, the way I was raised, when you have something to say to somebody, you come and say it to their face. Now, if the gentleman would like to accompany me sometime out to Hawaii, I will introduce him to some of these folks that he is attacking today. 
   This act was established by the Congress, and every single dollar and every single item associated with that has been set forth by the Congress over time. The President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, including this President, has put these funds in the budget in order to meet the obligations of the contract. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with how the gentleman from the Eighth District of Georgia handles contracts, but we honor them where I come from. 
   There is 200,000 acres set aside, and the original legislation states as follows, section 1065-569, I commend to the gentleman's attention: ``Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship.'' 
   The Admissions Act that brought us into the Union as the 50th State says specifically that, with regard to these lands, the Hawaiian Homes Lands, that they are to be administered by the State of Hawaii and the United States ``for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians as defined under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.'' And it goes on from there to cite what is involved. 
   Now, the block grant program provides funds for infrastructure to help Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages on lands set aside for them from Congress. Because of the conditions set out by the Congress, ordinary financing is not available to them. This is why we have to do it. If the gentleman had had the courtesy to sit down for 2 minutes with us, we could have explained what this was about. 
   A decision has to be made here. Of course we have to come and defend our programs. Everybody does. I am quite content to do that.     
   But this is the first time ever in my experience, my legislative experience of more than 33 years, that this kind of thing has taken place. 
   Now, I know you folks over there. I'm looking at friends of mine right here. You would never have, me or Ms. Hirono would never do this kind of thing to you. If you have a disagreement about it, come and see us. Let's sit down and talk about it. And if you still disagree with what we're doing and why we're doing it, by all means bring it to our attention on the floor. But these kinds of attacks are unworthy of this House. It's unworthy of us to have relationships with one another like this. I don't understand it. I've never experienced it before. 
   Now, we can do this in 5-minute segments if we want to, but that's not the way to handle this. I appeal to you, if this is going to be a continuing onslaught, let's sit down and talk it over. 
   This legislation, the Department of Hawaiian Homelands is one of the most effective housing efforts that we have in order to try and meet the conditions that were set forth by the Congress and administered faithfully by the State of Hawaii since our entrance to the Union in 1959. 
   The House supported reauthorization of this program; 272 Members, including 45 Republicans, voted for it. It is not a partisan issue. 
   And I'll finish with this, Mr. Chairman. The Republican Governor and the Republican Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in Hawaii, as well as the Democrats, support this program. It is not a partisan issue. 
   And so I ask, out of courtesy for Members, that if we're going to have a discussion about this, at least let's have it on the merits of what the issue is before us. And if we're going to do this kind of thing, at least have the courtesy, the common courtesy that should be extended to any Member of House, to let us know that it's happening so perhaps, Mr. Chairman, we could resolve the issue beforehand. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 505, NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as this is a discussion on the rule and not necessarily on the bill itself, I would like to confine my remarks, at least in this initial phase of dealing with the issue, on some of the points raised by my good friend and colleague Mr. Hastings. I am appreciative of the points that he raised, because I think they are in need of not so much refutation but perhaps clarification. 
   It is easy to understand why those who are not necessarily familiar, and I am not speaking about Mr. Hastings personally, I am talking about the references that he cited in his commentary, it is easy to understand why people who are not familiar with a little bit of the history of Hawaii could come to some of the conclusions or make some of the observations that they have. Absent the context within which this bill is coming forward, it is understandable. That context then is what I want to establish, so that it becomes clear. 
   I certainly don't want to get in an argument with the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal either, and they are making some quotations there about complete territorial independence. 
   Well, I think what is being referred to there, and what the likelihood of the reference is, is that there was in fact not territorial in the sense of annexation of territory, like the Philippines or Hawaii or Puerto Rico or that kind of thing that occurred during the kind of ``imperial phase'' of the United States, but there was in fact territorial independence, because Hawaii was a kingdom. It is one of the things that kind of gets lost in the shuffle, and that is one of the reasons we are here today, Mr. Speaker. 
   The United States of America has in fact had, over a 175-year period leading up to the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893, a series of treaties and conventions; 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, 1887, dealing with commerce, dealing with trade, dealing with various recognitions. The Kingdom of Hawaii had treaties and conventions with other nations, as well as the United States. 
   So as a result of that history, we have a succession of land claims and assets that have come from the time of the kingdom to the shotgun republic that occurred after the overthrow of the kingdom and the annexation of the United States into the territory, and into finally becoming a State, as was indicated, in 1959. We are in fact the last State to enter the Union, along with Alaska in 1959. 
   I bring this up simply to point out that far from subdividing the American people, as was cited by my good friend, quite the contrary; it incorporates the politics as well as the historical reality of this land secession and the assets associated with it, because this land generates income. 
   Basically what this is about, Mr. Speaker, is land and other assets, including money, and who controls it. When this land came in, it wasn't worth anything. The Wall Street Journal did not comment, I am certain, on the ceded lands. They are called ``ceded lands'' because they were ceded from the kingdom to the succeeding governmental entities. They could care less,  the Wall Street Journal, about these lands when they were worth nothing, when they were not seen to be able to be marketed. 
   But let me explain now, and I ask my good friend as I look at him now with a smile on my face, we are talking about land in Hawaii? You are talking big bucks. You are talking money here. That is what this is about is land and money and who controls it. And this land has, from the time of the kingdom, resided with the Native Hawaiians. That is who is to be the beneficiary. 
   That takes me to the point, Mr. Speaker, of the entry into the Union. The Admissions Act requires us, requires us, the Admissions Act of 1959 requires us to utilize those lands and assets for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. That is in the Admissions Act.     
   We are not here on the floor today because we didn't have anything better to do in Hawaii than to try to bring this to the Federal Government. On the contrary, the Admissions Act requires us to make certain that these lands are utilized for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The reason we have the bill here is that in order to accomplish that, we need to get a governing entity that can come to the Department of the Interior for approval in order to be able to conduct the affairs, similarly to, parallel to what now happens with Native Americans in the so-called lower 48 in the mainland of the United States and with various Alaska Natives and corporations and other entities that have been set up in Alaska. 
   This is a history of indigenous people. They are different from other indigenous people because they were a kingdom, and we would not have the 2 million acres we are talking about had those acres not been associated with an indigenous people. They are not imaginary, they are real. 
   Finally, let me say with Rice v. Cayetano, Governor Cayetano, the first Filipino American to be elected Governor, that issue was settled on a question of voting procedures and had nothing whatsoever to do with programs for Native Hawaiians.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I'm very grateful and thank you. I want to thank Mr. Bishop for his kind remarks. It exemplifies, I think, the kind of relationship we have on the Resources Committee. And I want to repeat that for those who are in their offices, maybe are not here on the floor but in their offices and may be tuning in. I want to emphasize that the tenor of his remarks and the courtesy with which he put it forward, including his sense of humor, which is well recognized in the committee and appreciated, reflects that this legislation is not only bipartisan, it's nonpartisan. That is to say, it's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue and has never been presented on this floor, through all the different sections of the Congress, from its introduction over the past 7 years and as it has moved through the Congress over past sessions, it has never ever been presented as a partisan issue, Republican or Democrat. And I say ``nonpartisan'' because the committee reflects the full spectrum of the left of the Democratic Party and the right of the Republican Party. Whether you are characterized as a progressive or a conservative, this issue transcends that precisely for what Mr. Bishop so rightly pointed out. 
   This bill directly affects and only affects the ceded lands and the Hawaiian homelands and the assets associated with Native Hawaiians in Hawaii. Everybody who's on the Resources Committee and everybody who has dealt with issues that have come before the body as a whole coming out of the Resources Committee understands that there are particular and peculiar instances associated with each Member's district, whether it's salmon runs in the Northwest or whether it's water issues based on treaty obligations in the Southwest, whether it's indigenous people in Alaska or indigenous people in Hawaii. Each area has particular contexts and situations that need to be addressed legislatively. And so what the committee tries to do in a nonpartisan way is address those issues in a very specific manner so that they can be resolved without impinging on any other aspect of constitutional consideration. 
   Let me point out practically how that happens. For those of you who have visited Hawaii, when you land at the airport, you're landing on what's called ceded land. That ceded land produces revenue. Now, obviously the airport didn't exist back when the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893, and it didn't exist when the United States annexed the Kingdom of Hawaii as a territory of the United States, and that airport as it is configured today did not exist with the advent of statehood. And so what we have now is very, very valuable land producing revenue. And that's what this is all about, 1.8 million acres of ceded land coming in a continuum from the time of the overthrow of the kingdom down to the State of Hawaii today where the ownership of the land, and the benefit's very clearly recognized, including in the Admissions Act of Hawaii to the State of the Union: Public Law 8-3, March 18, 1959, which specifically requires us to address questions of benefiting Native Hawaiians through the lands that have been ceded to them or which were created for them by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. That's what we're dealing with here today. 
   So we are asking that deference be given to the committee's work, which has been nonpartisan, which has no ideological difficulties associated with it, that deference be given and understanding to what the Admissions Act requires of us. 
   And I find it ironic that support comes from Mr. Young, Mr. DON YOUNG, as it came from other Republican chairmen. In fact, this was first introduced under Republican chairmen, passed under Republican chairmen. Mr. Hansen of Utah and Mr. Pombo of California and Mr. Young of Alaska, as well as Mr. Miller and Mr. Rahall, all have supported this act, as have the committees. Mr. Young is now in Alaska speaking to the Federation of Natives, of Alaskan Natives, because we recognize that there are indigenous people who were not a party to the Constitution when it was formed and first passed but have activities, and in the contemporary context, their lives' affected by how we deal with them. The Constitution requires us as a Member of Congress to be able to do that. 
   So what is at stake here very, very simply for the Members is that this is enabling legislation. That's all it is. This creates the opportunity for Native Hawaiians to take responsibility for their own actions with regard to the control and administration of their own assets. That is not in dispute. The land boundaries are there. The amount of money that's coming in is not in dispute. What's in dispute is who's going to control those assets. That's what this is about. This gives the opportunity to Native Hawaiians to organize themselves to come back to the Secretary of the Interior, whoever that may be, and to ask the Secretary of the Interior to recognize that governing entity over these assets. If the Secretary of the Interior disagrees with it, they have to go back to the drawing board. This is enabling legislation, and it's enabling legislation that has been put together responsibly by responsible members of the Resources Committee in consultation with one another and with various administrations, and we would ask for your favorable consideration on the floor today.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Westmoreland, for his kind compliments that came my way. I knew something would follow on that, and of course it was his reservations about the bill. 
   But he cited a poll which seemed to indicate, I believe he said, that people were obviously against race-based legislation and so on. I don't blame them; I would think they would be. I'm surprised it wasn't 100 percent. But let me read what the question was. He didn't read us the question. Here's the question: ``If 505 would allow Native Hawaiians to create their own government not subject to all the same laws, regulations and taxes that apply to other citizens of Hawaii, do you want Congress to approve this bill?'' Well, I'm dumbfounded they couldn't get 100 percent against that question. And, of course, 505 doesn't do any of that; quite the opposite. As Mr. Rahall indicated, we specifically address those issues, and taxes, of course, are going to be paid. 
   Let me give you the Ward Research Poll, done this year, that is a real poll, and I will tell you the question: ``Have you heard of the bill, the Akaka bill?'' Yes, 84 percent. ``Do you think Hawaiians should be recognized by the U.S. as an indigenous group similar to recognition given American Indians and Native Alaskans?'' Yes, 70 percent. ``Do you believe Hawaiians have a right to make these decisions?'' Yes, 87 percent. ``Do you believe programs that have been passed by the Congress for Native Hawaiians should continue?'' Yes, 83 percent. This goes on and on at that kind of level in Hawaii. 
   So, I appreciate my good friend bringing up the question of polling, but I think it's useful for us to know that when the people of Hawaii are polled on an objective basis, there is overwhelming support, Republican and Democrat and independent, for resolving this issue in the manner in which 505 addresses.

Mr. Flake knows that I supported the opportunity for him to put that forward for discussion before the Rules Committee. But I'm sorry, I can't consent, despite my friendship and respect for Mr. Flake, because I'm not sure that the revised language, even if I had it in front of me, which I don't, would not be subject to the same kind of difficulty, perhaps an interpretation that we can't foresee on first glance.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. And I won't take more than a moment or two. 
   The question, nonetheless, as I indicated when we spoke yesterday and as I indicated to the Rules Committee, is an important one that needs to be addressed. I don't want to run anything by anybody where they might feel even for a moment that they haven't had full consideration of important fundamental issues like civil rights and equality before the law. 
   If the gentleman would consider the idea of not offering the amendment right now for the reasons that have been stated, we're not quite sure where we're going with it, I can assure the gentleman that, should the bill pass, it has to go to the Senate, it has to come out of the Senate, and we can address those issues, as has been done with other bills with which we are acquainted again and again. You have my word that I will sit down and go over with you in detail and in depth the issues involved here and, should the bill move forward, seek to have those addressed in whatever comes from the other body, if it's able to move forward.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Rather than having a motion to recommit, because I would ask you not to do that for the reasons already enumerated, this deserves our specific attention. And we both know, I think, what happens on a motion to recommit: people come to the floor; they see superficially what's involved. Who can argue about everybody wanting to have civil rights? 
   And I don't want to have to get into a debate with you about the question of recommittal. Here is what section 7 says of the bill, if you would allow me: ``Prior to conferring Federal recognition on a reorganized governing entity, the Secretary of the Interior must certify that the organic governing documents provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the entity, as well as all other persons affected by the exercise of the entity's governmental powers and authorities. In addition, the organic governing documents must be consistent with applicable Federal law. If the Secretary finds that the organic governing documents, or any part of these documents, do not meet these requirements, the organic governing documents will not be certified.''     
   This has to be certified by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting every Federal responsibility. Now, up until this time, and I am sure you agree, if the Speaker will just grant me a little more time and if you will, this bill has never been subject to partisan rhetoric or activity in the committee or elsewhere. From a realistic point of view, motions to recommit really have to do with who is in charge and who is not in charge and that kind of thing. I am not disputing that your question isn't real. But the motion to recommit essentially is repeating, in some fashion, without my quite knowing what the real consequences of that language would be, whereas the language that I am citing to you from section 7 has been vetted again and again and again by minority staff, majority staff, legal staff all over to fit exactly what the gentleman seeks to succeed with. 
   So I am asking you not to make a motion to recommit on the basis that what I have read to you, in good faith, is language that has been put forward in good faith within the existing bill. And if you conclude that it is not adequate, I pledge to you that I will certainly sit down with you as will Mr. Kildee and anyone else who is interested in it to try and see what we can do to make the language work as the bill moves along. But I don't want to get trapped in a recommital action which may then put language into the bill, the consequences of which I have no idea. Nor, I think, does the gentleman. 
   Your intentions are good. I have complete faith and say so publicly in your intentions and your desire to make this a better bill. So I ask you on the basis of a collegial respect for each other and on the basis of our friendship to let the bill go without a recommital based on section 7 and my promise to you that we will address any and all issues that may still be on the table once you have had a chance to examine the consequences of the language you might otherwise propose.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. My difficulty is, and I'll conclude with this. Mr. Bishop, I am very appreciative of your indulgence in this and the other Members. Obviously it is very, very important to all of us and important on a fundamental constitutional basis as well. The difficulty for me in doing that is that I am seeing it right now for the first time. The language in the bill has been gone over and over and over again with a legal fine tooth comb so that I have confidence in that. 
   My problem is that your intention and my intention may not be what the consequences legally would be when somebody reads it as written on the paper. My friend and mentor on the Armed Services Committee, the chairman, IKE SKELTON, who usually characterizes himself as a country lawyer, which should put everybody on edge and make them wary when he says it, has a saying that he admonishes us with on the Armed Services Committee all the time: Read it. What he means by that is the words on the paper are what will be referred to when legal recourse is taken. And what my fear is, is that not knowing the consequences of the language, despite the gentleman's intention, if I accepted such a thing, I am doing it on blind faith. Not on blind faith in you. I have faith in your good intentions. But I am doing it on blind faith as to what the safe harbor would be or not be or what the consequences would be. I am sorry I can't accept that and I ask you once again to give us the opportunity to work on this in the quiet and in the contemplative atmosphere outside the volatility of the floor.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, this bill before us is the result of years of bipartisan and nonpartisan work, which has been mentioned. I take second to none my regard for Mr. Flake and recitation once again of our personal regard for one another; however, I am afraid that the reason I have to oppose this motion to recommit is for precisely the reasons I mentioned during our previous dialog. 
   I am pleased that he actually read what the motion to recommit says because the part here, and you may recall in my previous commentary where I said we can't be sure what the consequences might be unless we have had a chance to vet them. The bill itself has been vetted again and again by counsel on both sides of the aisle and by groups that have an interest in the bill. This is the consensus that this meets all relevant legal technicalities. 
   Here, look what it says: ``The Native Hawaiian governing entity shall be subject to the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights and other protections in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.'' That is an invitation to an avalanche of litigation. How are you going to define ``same manner'' and ``same extent'' of a State or local government? 
   The indigenous people, whether they are Native Americans in tribes, whether they are Alaska Natives in corporations, Native Hawaiians trying to put together a government, and they are not a State, they are not a local government, and to say in a motion to recommit that we are going to require them to exactly replicate State and local governments, which is subject to litigation all the time, you would have to have a trust fund set up to handle the litigation, I think, that would result from that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think that that is Mr. Flake's intent. In fact, I would stipulate that that is not his intent. Our problem is we haven't had a chance to sit down and go over this to see whether we can cover any of these contingencies. I wish he had accepted my plea, my offer, and I wish he would stand up now and say, I have seen the light and I am going to withdraw my motion to recommit. Because if you go to number (i), applicability of Federal civil rights laws, it says the same thing with respect to civil rights and antidiscrimination laws in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States. 
   My friends, my colleagues, I agree that Mr. Flake has brought this not for political reasons but because of his sincere belief that this needs to be addressed. I can assure you that if anything is political, this is political by default. Far from saying simply that it is a simple explication of his point of view, it is an absolute wellspring of complication to try and figure out what the same extent of State and local government laws are with regard to civil rights, antidiscrimination or Bill of Rights and other protections. ``Other protections,'' what does that mean? That will be litigated to death. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Flake, now that I have analyzed his simple language for him, if he would reconsider withdrawing the motion to recommit. If he does not, I pledge to him now that if we are able to defeat the motion to recommit, which I think should be defeated by anybody who's worked on this bill. I make this final plea in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker. We have worked too hard, come too far on a nonpartisan basis, Republican and Democrat alike, to come to this conclusion and throw ourselves into the briar patch of State and government applicability of laws as recommended in the recommittal. The bill itself deals with all these issues on civil rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the motion to recommit be defeated and that we move to a vote, an overwhelming vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 505, which is an exemplary product, a singular stalwart example of what bipartisan work can do in this House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank John Peterson as we move on this bill, whatever happens tonight. I notice there are some Members we have been working with. 
   This is kind of an emotional moment for me, I will tell you, because one of the great sorrows that I am going to have out of this is not so much that our bill didn't make it to the floor, but that John Peterson is leaving the Congress of the United States. Of course, he is doing it always for the right reasons, for somebody else, and, of course, we hope that your wife, John, is going to be well. I send her greetings and love and affection tonight, the love and affection we bear for you. You make the word ``honorable'' mean something very deep and real in this House. 
   I see Mr. Bishop and others. Mrs. Drake was here. There are so many names we were working with: Jim Costa and Dan Boren, Bill Foster, Timmy Walz, Tim Murphy. So many people. I am going to risk hurting people's feelings if I don't name everybody. But I have got to say Dan Burton or he will yell at me. So many folks. Jeff Miller, so many. Nick Lampson, he is down there tonight. 
   The reason I bring all those names up is that we are productive with H.R. 6709 I think because we got away from lobbyists coming in or corporations coming, advocacy groups, and we got away from the leadership clash, if you will, over who is going to get the House or who might not. 
   In all honesty, I want to move this bill tonight. I agree, by the way, with Don Young, I agree with what John just said, what Thelma said, all the folks over here on sharing the revenues. I think we didn't have enough information coming from the CBO on that. It looks now like we can put royalties in and it won't create a pay-as-you-go problem. 
   There are a lot of things that can be done, if we can move the bill along. That is what I am asking, just move this bill along. It is like Jim Costa said earlier, a work in progress. Come on, there are very few rookies here, very few rookies legislatively, even if you are just new in the body. We have got four or five different shots at this in order to perfect a bill. 
   I wouldn't vote for this bill if it came back now and this was conference bill. I wouldn't vote for it. But this gives us an opportunity to move this along. That is all I am looking for. And, believe me, the Republicans can claim they forced the Democrats to take it up and they made their point, and the Democrats will claim that they went for the bigger national interest and acted in a nonpartisan way.     
   Everybody can make their political claims. But let's keep this moving. We have been talking to Saxby Chambliss, come on, a lot of us served with him here in the House; and Lindsey Graham, he is our friend; Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu. I told Mary, left a message, said, look, don't say it's dead on arrival. We are for the revenue sharing. We can work this out. 
   The American people will blame all of us. The American people will not say the Democrats have showed up the Republicans, or the Republicans sure showed the Democrats. They are going to blame the Congress, because they want energy independence. We have to have it. 
   My plea to you is that we take this bill and move it along and get it into the Senate. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of energy independence, number one; and, number two, preventing the exporting of needed American dollars from investment in this country to import energy. That's the reason that we need to do this. 
   We have got to get away from, I see there is something from the National Wildlife Federation, comes in today, a lot of praise for the bill, but they don't like the oil shale provision, where it's an opt-in from the State, so they still  kill the whole bill, kill everything because there is something in it they don't like. We urge you to oppose it and the motion to recommit too. So we end up with nothing. 
   Other people, we have been using words like ``hoax,'' despite claims to the contrary, this is not a drilling bill. Believe me, when the Speaker came around on this, and it's one of the reasons I feel we should move forward with the bill, the Speaker doesn't want this bill, believe me. But she is not the leader of the California delegation, she is the Speaker of the House, and she feels that something has to move along, even if she doesn't approve of most of the provisions that are in here, if she had her own personal way. What I am asking is let's rise above the arguments. Let's rise above the clash with one another. 
   I don't say that for altruistic reasons, I say it for practical reasons, practical legislative reasons. We will not be forgiven by the people of this Nation if we are not able to move an energy bill to the Senate so we have a fighting chance to try and work the legislative process here. Let's not have the kids that come to visit us every day, the people who come to our office sincerely asking us for our help, look at us and say they couldn't do the job that they were sent here to do.

   Mr. Boehner, the minority leader, has been talking about the other bill, the total energy bill or whatever it is all straight through. Then we come to H.R. 6709. Now, it's easy for me. I gave my word. Everybody in here knows that I give you my word, I'm going to keep it. I gave my word on this bill to try and move it along, and so I will. 
   What bothers me is if the intention was to work H.R. 6709 all along, why didn't we do it? It would have been easy just to say okay, Madam Speaker, let's put this together and do it. 
   Now, as I say, I believe that honor puts me in the position of voting for the bill as we have it on the floor, not for the recommittal. 
   What I'm asking is, is if we meant this for real about trying to pass something in the national interest, then that's what we should do is pass the bill that we have. 
   Now if the recommittal comes up and it doesn't succeed, what I'm hoping is if the other bill passes--and I urge us to vote for that bill--that we then go to the Senate and say, look, we've got a considerable consensus here, not unanimous by any respects, but we have a considerable consensus on the drilling, on the revenue sharing, on all the items that we worked on, on a bipartisan basis. 
   So I think what we have to do here tonight, what I recommend to everybody on our side, is that we keep our word. We said that we were going to put this bill in good faith on the floor and move it along despite everybody saying that they had other contentions they would like to be in there, and that where H.R. 6709 is concerned on the recommittal is that it should have been offered from the beginning as a working document, but that the first part--okay. All right.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, I am standing here today speaking for young people in Alaska. I am sure that when Mr. Young gets the opportunity, he will be down here to speak for them, too. 
   I wasn't aware of the fact that the young children in Alaska needed the tender mercies of the gentleman from New Jersey to speak for them. I would think that the children in New Jersey have all they can do, considering the level of the rhetoric I have heard for the last few minutes, to get the best education possible there. The Congress is certainly not being well informed about it today. 
   I most certainly agree with the other gentleman who said that education is best left to the local level. How about letting the gentleman from Alaska, or any other place where they understand what the educational needs of their children are, handle it at their level? That would be the way to take care of it.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. No, I will not yield. You had more than enough time to make your case. 
   Madam Chairman, I am going to make a case for those children and the children in Hawaii and the children in every other State and area in this country who deserve the support of this Congress. I have heard talk already down here today about taxes being paid. You don't think taxes are being paid in Alaska or in Hawaii or elsewhere? 
   When you talk about local programs, I have the local programs that we have in Hawaii. I am sure Mr. Young has the local programs that we have in Alaska. I haven't examined them in New Jersey, but, as I say, I have heard the rhetoric for the last few minutes. Maybe I had better go up there and give them a hand. 
   Now, I respect every Member of this floor, and I expect to receive the same in return. When the State of Hawaii came into the Union, one of the protocols of the Admissions Act is the requirement that we recognize and take care of our Hawaiian children. We have programs that are geared towards that. We have Historically Black Colleges in this country. We have established over the past few decades studies in various backgrounds, ethnically, culturally, racially. We have caucuses in this Congress that recognize the various backgrounds from which our people come. 
   Hawaii, I can tell you, just as Alaska is, because I have visited Alaska and have had an opportunity to speak with the teachers and schoolchildren in Alaska, we are a multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-ethnic country. We are a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-background, rainbow state in Hawaii, and we recognize those backgrounds and we try to take care of it in our educational processes. 
   All we are asking for is the opportunity here to help fund local programs that have local assistance as well. That is done in program after program after program. 
   Now, if the gentleman does not care to have the Federal Government fund anything for education in the United States, that is his prerogative. I recognize that and respect that. I don't approve of it, and I hope the Congress won't approve of it. But to have any Member come into another State without any notice to anybody that they are going to do it, by the way, a courtesy that I would extend to anybody in here, I have to find out about it by osmosis that this is being done, it is shameful and it needs to be stopped and it needs to have an end put to it. 
   Now, if the gentleman has specific objections to anything being done in Alaska, he should have taken it up with the gentleman from Alaska. That is minimum courtesy in this body. But to come on the floor and make the kind of accusations that are made today is an insult to the gentleman from Alaska and an insult to the Appropriations Committee and an insult to the House of Representatives. 
   If there are objections to anything in the next one that comes up, I hope that whoever offers that amendment with Hawaii would have had the courtesy to sit down with me and with Representative Hirono and specifically state what  their objections were, so that we might be able to accommodate them, had they legitimacy and foundation. That is the minimum we can expect from one another. 
   This is a shameful process. I hadn't realized until right now that we could solve the educational problems in this country if we could just keep those Alaskan kids from getting a dime for any program that has been put together by Representative Young and the local educators in Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I rise in support of the Spratt amendment. A reasoned and objective approach is needed for analyzing and assessing the serious issues surrounding the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation in Iran. The current bill language couples military readiness and contingency response planning with report elements that are inherently intelligence-related and dependent on the full spectrum of intelligence sources and methods. 
   The amendment appropriately shifts the burden of assessment regarding Iran's nuclear weapons capacity and/or intentions from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of National Intelligence. Why reinvent the wheel? Precedent and institutional knowledge specific to the issue already exist. The appropriate vehicle for perpetuating objective analysis of the situation is an updated NIE, with further updates regularly to follow, not an independent and parallel effort on the part of the DOD. 
   Renewing demand for products of the proven method of consolidating analysis through a centralized NIE process also discourages the temptation for some to ``forum shop,'' I assure you, among national security agencies for favorable or dissenting views, depending on the circumstance. We are all well aware of the Douglas Feith-led, Dick Cheney-originated cabal that was a major instigator of the war in Iraq. 
   A disassociated DOD effort would undermine a widely considered and properly vetted approach to nuclear proliferation and other high priority national security issues. 
   The amendment substantially reflects many of the points of inquiry from the report elements in the bill's existing language, but it centers the focus on an updated NIE analysis on the near and mid-term implications rather than on the speculative far-term projections, and does not rush to associate U.S. military response as a presupposition. 
   On that basis, Madam Chairman, I think this amendment deserves our favorable attention, and I thank you for the time allotted to me.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I oppose this amendment because it cuts funding to our troops and their families. The defense bill's purpose is to ensure that troops and their families needs are put first as they struggle to fight two wars. 
   The needs of the Army are shortchanged in this amendment. The needs of the Army should be put first as the service carrying the heaviest burdens in the wars in progress. Readiness above all. 
   Putting troops first involves making choices. As President Eisenhower said about ``the clearly necessary.'' 
   This amendment decreases pay benefits, health care for troops and their families, benefits that are clearly necessary by any measure, and puts hundreds of millions of dollars into corporate overhead. 
   Hear me. Understand. You vote for this amendment, you're voting to cut funds for the troops and their health care and their families' to put it in corporate overhead accounts, and you're going to be held to account for it come November, guaranteed. 
   The defense bill already provides $3.3 billion for this program. No more is needed for corporate overhead. The 5 percent reduction in the program that this amendment seeks to roll back has been reallocated. We reallocated funds for serious equipment shortfalls in the Army, National Guard, and Reserve. The equipment readiness needs of the Army, Guard, and Reserve take priority over corporate overhead any day. Understand, to pay for this amendment, you cut military pay, benefits, health care, and equipment for the National Guard and Reserve in multiple deployments. 
   The choice could not be more clear. You are going to take funding from the troops and their families and give it to defense contractors who have already received over $15 billion. Defense contractors are well paid for their services. They do not come and their profits don't come before military families.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Thank you. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have got a new grand jury in the House, the Office of Congressional Ethics, and we have the House Ethics Committee. We have two identical, competing committees by design. Now, I defy anybody in this House to go to your next Rotary Club meeting and try to explain what that is all about. 
   Any referral to the Office of Congressional Ethics will be seen as tantamount to a guilty verdict. Any other conclusion by the House Ethics Committee will be seen as a coverup. Mark my words, that is exactly what is going to happen. 
   This is about ethics, not criminal prosecution. I have heard words like ``corruption'' used around here as if we are some sinkhole of depravity. If a criminal matter is at issue, it should be in the hands of the Federal Attorney, not appointees of the Speaker or the majority leader. 
   I can't figure out where the ethics complaints come from. Are they dropped off at the door? What criteria will be applied by the OCE? This is about the House, and its membership should decide whether any Member has failed to meet its standards, not appointees who have not served or are not currently Members of the House. 
   An ethics investigation is by definition peer review. Any appointee to the Office of Congressional Ethics who has not served in the House has no credibility in terms of judging Members or the conduct of House standards. 
   And does anybody believe that complaints won't be in the media immediately, regardless of validity? The press irritation with the House Ethics Committee is because it has actually practiced confidentiality. 
   This is an invitation to ideological mischief and character assassination. We say this is about our ability to police ourselves. The effect will be just the opposite. The House Ethics Committee no longer has any discernable function other than to affirm whatever has been referred to it. 
   All this makes me sad, and it makes me angry. I have devoted every bit of energy in my life for nine terms to this House. I revere the opportunity for service in the people's House. With this proposal we are indicting ourselves. We are retreating before those who would tear this House down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Chairman, once again I find myself on the floor wishing that I had an opportunity to perhaps discuss the issue that is raised in the amendment. I wish really honestly that the courtesies would be extended on this to one another, not just on this issue but on any issue where it affects individuals. 
   Let me explain for a moment if I can to you and some others who may be listening in, Mr. Chairman. Here is a list of votes on Native issues. There are 52 Members, 52 Members who have tribes in their districts, some multiple. Some of them are Republican Members who are sponsors of this bill. Each of them has unique questions and problems that have to be dealt with. It goes to Republicans, it goes to Democratic districts. 
   I find it distressing that this is becoming more and more a partisan issue for some folks in the Republican Conference. I can't comprehend it exactly. 
   As I say, here is 52. Here are some of the votes that were taken, Minority-Serving Institutions, Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act, 59 votes against it all from Members of the Republican Conference. 
   Motion to amend the Small Business Act to expand and improve assistance provided by small business development centers to Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians, 73 members of the Republican Conference. I am not quite sure why this is happening. 
   I don't understand why Native issues and issues having to do with indigenous people and minorities find now an increasing number in the Republican Conference who are voting ``no'' on it. I wish we could get a dialogue established in some way to try and understand why Native people are being attacked. 
   In this particular instance, Mr. Chairman, I bring to your attention and the Members' attention the Admission Act that brought Hawaii into the Union. The Admission Act requires that we address questions such as those in the present bill that is before us. 
   Now if someone wants to attack the Admission Act, I suggest they go to court and do that. All we are doing here and all that is being requested in this bill that is before us is that which is required of us by law in order to accomplish the task at hand. If someone is opposed, and I invite once again the Members here who have this amendment, why attack us? Why attack our people for trying to implement the law? Attack the law. Change the law if that is what you want to do, if that is what you think is necessary. 
   We have 200,000 acres set aside for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what the law says we are supposed to do. That is what the Admission Act which brought us into the United States says is required of us. 
   I can quote: Any such lands income, therefore, shall be held by the said State as a public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions and for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians for the development of farm and home ownership, as widespread a basis as possible, and for making public improvements and provisions of lands for public use. 
   That is what the Admission Act says we are supposed to do, for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what this is about.  
   If one is opposed to that for everybody, for all of the tribes and so on, I guess we can take it up with the other Members and so on. I don't know. But I don't think here on the floor in any bill that is a consequence of trying to fulfill our obligations constitutionally is the way to go about it. Take it to court. Put in a bill to do that, but don't hurt us today.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Chairman, I have a New Yorker cartoon that I have pasted to the wall of my office to try to remind me of my position in life and sometimes the irony of history. 
   It pictures some Native Americans in tribal garb standing on a promontory gazing out on a bay in which a ship, strangely akin to the Mayflower, appears to be sitting. And some people in a boat wearing kind of quaint hats and cloaks with breeches seem to be rowing into shore. And the one Native American says to the other, Doesn't look like they have their documentation in order to me. 
   Now, I don't know if that is anything other than perhaps mildly amusing, but perhaps it does make a point. I'm not sure that we're in any position to say to Native American tribes in this country that everybody ought to have their documentation in order. I wonder if those of us who are proposing that have our documentation in order. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Just a couple of notes. My good friend from Iowa was complimentary to me, and I am appreciative of that. I want to indicate to him, perhaps he misunderstood my intention in citing just a couple of instances where the vote was taken by himself and others with regard to minorities, with regard to Native Alaskans and tribal members and Native Hawaiians. 
   The reason that I cited it was not because I was trying to look for something for them that they did not deserve or would not prove useful to them, but let me explain why I cited them, because I thought it was undermining the principles that were cited by our friend from Georgia and our friend from Iowa, initiative, working yourself up the economic and social ladder of success. 
   Take the two bills. First, the Minority Serving Institutional Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act. If you go into the bill itself, what it is is to try to assist in the areas where minorities are at issue, with trying to increase their capacity to do business, to increase their abilities to deal with wireless technology, digital technology today, as the keystone to economic opportunity and economic success. It's to give people the opportunity to increase their ability to pay their taxes to participate in the American foundation of American economic opportunity so that they could actually increase their capacity to succeed economically. 
   The same with the other bill, which is why I cited it. I thought that these were the kinds of things that we could all get behind, improve and expand the small business development centers. I know, out in Hawaii, for a fact the small business development centers have been crucial to getting small businesses under way to aiding and assist people who need not just a handout but a hand up, and to give them the technical skills not ordinarily available to them, to give them some of the institutional references that they need to make in order to be able to apply for loans to succeed in achieving, getting the loans to get started, particularly microloans and so on. 
   I can't speak for you, but I am sure you, as well, are familiar with small business development centers. What we are trying to do here, in the area of Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians is to extend that helping hand so they can participate even further and achieve the very goals my good friend from Iowa and my good friend from Georgia have cited as being worthy of pursuit, not just by way of legislation, but by way of the everyday activities of constituents as they try to partake in the American Dream. 
   That's all this is about. We want to give people the opportunity legislatively to take advantage of the small business development centers, to take advantage of the new wireless technology in a way that might not have been available to them otherwise.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, I have the honor of serving as the Chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. 
   This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with future required military capabilities. 
   Our military personnel are at risk each and every day. Our first priority is to make sure our men and women in uniform are properly supported by ensuring our acquisition programs adequately support current military requirements. 
   We cannot shortchange the current force for promised future capabilities when we are losing people everyday in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The Air and Land Forces subcommittee's jurisdiction in this bill includes approximately $100 billion in Army and Air Force programs. 
   Our priorities do not always agree with those of the Pentagon, but our objective is clear--to do our very best to ensure our military personnel get the best available equipment as soon as it can be properly tested--armored vehicles; body and vehicle armor; improvised explosive device jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles, small arms, night vision equipment, and related equipment. 
   The bill addresses a number of key requirements: 
   H.R. 1585 provides $4.1 billion in additional funds to fully fund a tactical vehicle referred to as M-RAP, or Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, to better protect our personnel against mines and improvised explosive devices. The budget request included less than $500 million to meet this $4.6 billion requirement which, as of last week, is now Secretary Gates' number one priority. 
   Over a billion dollars is provided for Stryker combat vehicles. 
   The bill fully funds body armor, Up-Armored Humvees, Armored Security vehicles, and vehicle add armor kits at $5.4 billion. 
   The bill also provides $4.5 billion for programs established to counter improvised explosive devices. 
   An additional billion dollars is provided for funding of National Guard and Reserve Equipment. 
   Overall, the bill represents an increase of 40 percent for Army procurement accounts over last year's budget request. 
   Ten C-17 strategic airlift aircraft have been added to the bill at a cost of over $2.4 billion, to maintain the C-17 production line and sustain the strategic airlift fleet. 
   The Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program has been funded at $480 million to provide two producers of engines for that program. 
   We have had to make some difficult choices to fund the highest priority programs and stay within the budget top-line. Some programs will have to make adjustments. We understand that, and will work together as the process evolves to ensure that these adjustments can be accommodated as best as possible. In closing, I again want to thank my distinguished chairman and ranking members of the full committee and our subcommittee. 
   This bill is deserving of a ``yes'' vote from every Member of this body.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Chairman, I have the honor to serve as the chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of our Armed Services Committee. I would like first to thank my own personal archbishop, Doug Roach, and all the acolytes on the Air and Land subcommittee, the subcommittee staff. They do a terrific job working with IKE SKELTON's overall staff, led by Erin. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is every day to be working with them in the manner in which they conduct themselves; professional, disciplined, focused, something I wish I could say about myself more often than I do. 
   Again, on the personal comment side, I want to thank my good friend, DUNCAN HUNTER. Always, without fail, in all these years, attentive, polite, always welcoming commentary and seeking advice. We may say farewell to you, DUNCAN, but we will not be saying goodbye. 
   Finally, Mr. JIM SAXTON, whom I don't see on the floor today. JIM SAXTON may have his position taken, but no one is going to replace him in this Congress. He has been my friend. He has been my mentor. I have served as a ranking member on various committees, not just here, but on other committees, as well as having the opportunity to chair. I never considered myself a ranking member or a chairman where JIM SAXTON was concerned. We were colleagues. 
   This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with future required military capabilities. Our military personnel is at risk each and every day. The first priority is to make sure the men and women in uniform are properly supported by ensuring our military programs adequately support current military requirements. 
   We cannot short-change our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan in their need for adequate equipment and the needs of our National Guard units here at home for what they may require to respond to potential national disasters. Promised future capabilities that have already been delayed because of overly optimistic and unmet schedules cannot subsume meeting today's demonstrated needs. 
   The Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction includes $90 billion in Army and Air Force programs. Our objective, Mr. Chairman, is clear, to ensure that our military personnel get the best available equipment as soon as it has been properly tested, equipment like armored vehicles, body armor, improvised explosive device jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles, small arms, and night vision devices. 
   We address key requirements: An increase in Army procurement and research of $557 million over the budget request, procurement and research where it's needed now, demonstrating the commitment of the Armed Services Committee to meeting these many needs. The Army in particular is carrying the heaviest burden of all the services in the war in which we are now engaged. This bill shifts funding to critical Army priorities now; $2.6 billion to fund sustainments costs for the tactical vehicle referred to as the MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, to better protect our personnel against mines and improvised explosive devices; $2.7 billion for counterimprovised explosive device programs, $949 million for Humvees, $783 million for body armor; $800 million for funding for much-needed National Guard and Reserve equipment. 
   Yes, we have reallocated funds in this budget where we have to meet the needs of the serving Army and Air Force today. 
   Fifteen C-17 strategic airlift aircraft added, at a cost of $3.9 billion dollars. It maintains the C-17 production line and sustains the strategic airlift fleet. Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program has been funded for $526 million to provide necessary competition of two producers of engines for that program; $246 million added for systems to counter rocket and mortar attacks on our forces. 
   To fund these priorities, we had to make reallocation choices to fund the highest priorities. Some programs will have to make adjustments. No program is adversely compromised. On the contrary, increased accountability and increased oversight are the result. 
   In closing, I want to thank the distinguished chairman, all the ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittees, and may I say, Mr. Skelton, as I close, that it is a particular pleasure and an honor to serve with you. As I stand here today, I am thinking of Suzie Skelton. I know how proud she is of you.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1077, calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet. The resolution also calls for the Chinese Government to enter into a substantive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the distinctive language, culture, religious identity, and fundamental freedoms of all Tibetans. 
   The Dalai Lama has stated his willingness to accept cultural autonomy for Tibet under the Chinese Constitution. He has also been willing to negotiate with Beijing and has advanced a number of very moderate proposals regarding Tibet's future status. The Communist regime, however, has only met this attempt at accommodation with stiff opposition, and is currently instigating yet another crackdown in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics. 
   To date, Congress has stood strongly by the Tibetan people as they bravely struggle for their rights: 
   In 1991, Congress passed a resolution stating that Tibet is an occupied country. 
   In September of 2007, Representative Rohrabacher introduced House Resolution 610, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Government should take immediate steps to boycott the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008 unless the Chinese regime stops engaging in serious human rights abuses against its citizens and stops supporting serious human rights abuses by the Governments of Sudan, Burma, and North Korea against their citizens. I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor this measure. 
   Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and I recently formed the Tibet Caucus and already have 8 new members. 
   Congress awarded the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   We cannot stand silently by and watch as another wave of brutality and oppression sweeps across the country by the Beijing regime. Congress must continue to stand by the Tibetan people and uphold their rights as human beings. I urge every Member of Congress to join the Tibetan Caucus, vote ``yes'' for House Resolution 1077, and urge the President of the United States to issue an executive order boycotting the Beijing Olympics and uphold the rights of the Tibetan people to ensure their voice is not silenced.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, with regard to H.R. 835, I would first like to thank very much Chairman Barney Frank and Ranking Member Spencer Bachus for their consideration of H.R. 835. 
   It is imperative, from the point of view of Representative Hirono and myself, that we regard this bill as nonpartisan in nature. And it was considered that way in committee, and I am grateful for it. 
   The bill was passed overwhelmingly last week 262-162. It was under the Suspension Calendar and did not receive a sufficient number of votes for the two-thirds required margin, so we find the bill before us this evening. 
   Of those 162 Republicans who voted ``no'' last week, 39 of them cosponsored the bill to create the Native Hawaiian Housing Title in the 106th Congress, including our good friend, Mr. Bachus, and minority leader John Boehner. 
   This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican Governor, Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of the State's Republican Party. 
   This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote without amendment. And last year's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, was also a cosponsor of the bill. 
   I bring these things up, Mr. Speaker, to emphasize that never have we ever considered this bill to be a partisan bill, a Republican or Democratic bill. This is a bill that affects constituents, regardless of their political affiliation, and is not ideological in nature. It is really administrative in nature. 
   There have been some discussions and some arguments concerning some of the constitutional issues that have been raised in other contexts about native people. This is not the venue to have that kind of a discussion or argument. We do not want to harm those who come before us for legislative redress and expect to have it and not expect to have an argument in which they will become grist for an ideological mill, grist for a disputation of an academic nature or of a philosophical nature, having nothing to do with the question at hand, in this instance, most particularly dealing with homeownership, mortgages, and refinancing. 
   I understand, and will defer to Mr. Bachus on this point, that Mr. Renzi has made a statement of support in addition, and I expect to hear about that when we yield to Mr. Bachus for his participation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again that this is not a partisan bill. It is not really anything that should be considered other than on the merits of the subject matter at hand. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Briefly, Mr. Speaker, I am also very grateful to Mr. Bachus for his commentary and his observations and will indicate that, at least as far as this Member is concerned, there will be time enough, I believe, tomorrow to deal with the question should there be a recommittal offered on the issues that were raised by either the Campbell amendment or any of the other points that were raised as a basis or foundation for possible opposition to the bill. I believe they can be answered. 
   I believe that this is fundamentally a very conservative approach that merits the support of Members across the various ideological spectrums that exist here in the House of Representatives; and I hope, with the opportunity to speak about them at some length, perhaps tomorrow, that we will be able to  satisfy one and all here on the floor that this is a bill worthy of support. 
   The principal thing I would say, just simply in quick response, is that the Rice versus Cayetano decision which was mentioned does not affect these programs, has literally nothing to do with the issue at hand in this H.R. 835. The decision invalidated an election system for a State agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a State agency. The decision did not affect the agency itself. It did not even question the validity of the agency. It had to do with the question of who could vote for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. 
   The Office of Hawaiian Affairs still exists today. It exists for the benefit of Native Hawaiians and is voted on by the entire voting population of the State of Hawaii. So it had to do with an election issue and absolutely nothing to do with this, and the Court declined to address the question of Native Hawaiian programs authorized by Congress. So we are dealing with an entirely separate set of issues here, and I hope to make that clear tomorrow. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to Representative Hirono.

   Section 220 of the manager's amendment recognizes the importance of vigorous enforcement of our Nation's coastwise laws by expanding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement authority to include the Coast Guard in addition to Customs and Border Protection. 
   In keeping with this important objective we hope that the Administration will make good on the effort that was begun last November with the publication of a proposed interpretive rule designed to address evasion by foreign cruise lines of one of our coastwise laws, the Passenger Vessel Services Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1436, a resolution to congratulate the Waipio Little League Team from the State of Hawaii for winning the 2008 Little League World Series. 
   On August 24, 2008, the Waipio Little League baseball team won the Little League World Championship. Waipio defeated the Matamoros Little League team of Tamaulipas, Mexico, 12-3. This is the most runs scored by one team in a World Series title game since 1998. Waipio's victory by nine runs is also the largest winning margin by a US team over an international opponent in the title game, 
   To get to the Little League World Series, Wapio went undefeated through the season. They went 3-0 in pool play, defeating teams from Connecticut, Florida and South Dakota. On August 20, 2008, Waipio won the United States Semifinal by defeating Mill Creek Little League, from Mill Creek, Washington. Then on August 23, 2008, they won the United States Championship by defeating South Lake Charles Little League, of Lake Charles, Louisiana. During this game, the team was down 5-1, but persevered and came back in the sixth and final inning by scoring six runs, to win the game 7-5. 
   I would like to congratulate each member of the team and recognize their spirit and determination that got them so far: Iolana Akau, Jedd Andrade, Christian Donahue, Caleb  Duhay, Ulumano Farm, Kainoa Fong, Trevor Ling, Keelen Obedoza, Khade Paris, Tanner Tokunaga, Jordan Ulep, Pikai Winchester, Matthew Yap, Manager Timo Donahue, Coach Kiha Akau, and Coach Gregg Tsukawa. 
   Just as important, this resolution commends the team's families, coaches, and community for their support and dedication to enabling the success of the team on and off the field. Without this support, the team could not have traveled such a tremendously triumphant road. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's support in advancing this resolution. I would also like to thank Representative Mazie Hirono, Representative Eni Faleomavaega and Representative Madeleine Bordallo for their unflagging support and also that of Representative John Peterson, whose district hosts the Little League WorId Series. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Waipio Little League Baseball team and their accomplishments and ask for your support of H. Res. 1436.  
   The resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 4933, the Captive Wildlife Safety Technical Amendments Act of 2008, was introduced by my colleague from Guam (Ms. Bordallo). As Mr. Kennedy indicated, unfortunately, she cannot be here in person at the moment because she is on her way here from Guam, but hopefully will arrive before the end of the proceedings. Coming as I do, Madam Speaker, on a 5,000 mile one-way commute, I have a lot of empathy and sympathy for her journey. But the issue before us today is very, very important both to her and to Members of the House and, by extension, the Nation. 
   The Captive Wildlife Safety Act, Public Law 108-191, amended the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and that made it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any prohibited wildlife species. 
   After the law was enacted, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice identified technical drafting problems that made full implementation and enforcement impossible. H.R. 4933 would make those technical changes to the law needed to allow the original intent of the legislation to be achieved. 
   Madam Speaker, on a personal note, I might add that, under Chairman Pombo, I had the privilege of traveling with him to Africa for the CITES, Convention on International Treaty on Endangered Species, so we could see with our own eyes what the consequences are by not having legislation like this correctly in place. The wildlife species are totally dependent upon human beings as the stewards of this planet and, most certainly, as the stewards of their welfare and for the salvation of endangered species, not just in our country, but overseas as well. Therefore, I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill. 
   May I say also, Madam Speaker, what a privilege it is to be on the floor with Mr. Bishop of Utah. I have the honor of serving with him on the Resources Committee, and have always valued his insight and perspective. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established by Congress in 1984 as a charitable nonprofit corporation. The foundation was formed to further the conservation and management of fish, wildlife, plants, and other natural resources by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
   While the foundation and its conservation programs continue to grow and fundraising for these programs keeps pace, it is considerably more difficult to meet the increasing administrative expenses of the foundation. Expanding the size of the board of directors will improve the ability of the foundation to raise private funds, to cover its administrative expenses, and to improve the implementation of its conservation programs. 
   I commend Congressman Henry Brown, again, a good friend of many of us here in the Congress and a friend of the Natural Resources, for introducing this bill, and urge all Members to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, let's go over what this does do and why it's here. 
   This amendment places a 1-year ban on flag and general officers in the Armed Services from receiving compensation from any company that does greater than $50 million in business with the Department of Defense. The rationale is very, very straightforward. It assures that large corporations, relying on DOD business, do not take advantage of loopholes in the post-employment ethics laws right now. That's what this is addressing, what exists right now. 
   Current laws govern conduct-based actions. Conduct-based actions and restrictions that are in there now are meaningless because there's what's called behind-the-scenes and in-house provisions. I didn't make this up. This is what's going on right now. If I'm going to get lectured on ethics, let's talk about ethics. Former flag and general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials. We know that. The $50 million ensures that small businesses seeking access to the DOD market are protected and people can go to work for them.     
   It does not impact officers pay grade O-6 and below. We are talking about the top people up here making the top money making the top decisions with Department of Defense organizations. 
   The amendment protects senior officers from large DOD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. You think you walk out the door of the Pentagon and down the stairs and by immaculate conception can go to work for one of these DOD corporations and not have tried to influence that job beforehand or negotiate that job before you walk out the door? 
   Take public universities. From the publication that just came out in March of 2007, of all the universities in the country, only two universities in the country are doing more than $50 million worth of business. So that is open that you can go to. 
   Dwight Eisenhower, more than 40 years ago, way back in 1961, warned us about the military industrial complex that was emerging in our country. And I am quoting: ``Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.'' 
   I think President Eisenhower's words speak for themselves. The amendment speaks for itself. This is an implementation of an ethics rule that should apply to the Pentagon, and I would think that people of goodwill would want to embrace it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment which places a one-year ban on flag and general officers of the Armed Services from receiving compensation from any company that does greater than $50 million in business with the Department of Defense. 
   This ban will take place 120 days from the enactment of the legislation. 
   The rationale is to ensure former flag and general officers and large corporations relying on DoD business do not take advantage loopholes in the post-employment ethics laws. 
   Current laws governing conduct-based actions and restrictions are meaningless because of ``behind-the-scenes'' or ``in-house'' provisions where former flag/general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials, but can provide an unfair business advantage by providing their new colleagues in the private sector with valuable knowledge immediately after leaving the Department of Defense. 
   The $50 million ceiling ensures small businesses seeking access to the DoD market are not restricted from hiring former general or flag officers as employees or consultants. Moreover, this does not impact officers paygrade O-6 and below. 
   Why include all flag and general officers? While not all flag and general officers are involved in procurement, they can be involved in the development of future military systems and operational requirements or have ``official responsibility'' for an acquisition program. 
   This amendment will protect senior officers from large DoD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. The ``prime'' contractors in the DoD industry are so pervasive and ingrained that they have been referred to as ``quasi-agencies'' in the media. One private company received over $24 billion in DoD contracts, an amount equal to the budget request for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year 2008 budget request totals $24.02 billion. 
   Another concern is the impact on the ability of these former officers to teach at universities. Well over 1,000 schools are listed in the Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges and Nonprofit Institutions: FY 2004 Report released March 2007--only two schools received more than $50 million in DoD funds (Johns Hopkins and University of Texas at Austin). 
   I urge my colleagues to support closing loopholes in our ethics laws and vote in favor of this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' This bill makes some important changes in the Medicare program that help assure access for our seniors to quality medical care. 
   The bill defers the 10.6% cut in physician reimbursements mandated by the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) that would go into effect on July 1, 2008. Instead, the bill continues the present reimbursement rate for 18 months and then increases it by 1.1%. 
   The bill also provides important improvements for our senior citizens, increasing the allowable income and asset maximums for premium assistance. The co-payments for mental health services are reduced from 50% to 20%, the same as any other doctor visit. 
   The legislation addresses problems within Medicare to pay for these benefits, reforming the system that overpays to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, private plans that operate within Medicare, which cost the government on average 12% more than traditional services. The bill will also require that any delinquent taxes owed by Medicare providers be deducted from their Medicare reimbursements. 
   In addition to improving Medicare services, the legislation also makes important changes to Medicaid, including a provision that is particularly vital for the people of Hawaii: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. 
   Following an oversight in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, only Hawaii and Tennessee have not received DSH payments in Medicaid, which provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. This bill provides a temporary remedy, which will help keep these hospitals open. 
   I have been working with Senator Daniel Akaka, the Hawaii Delegation and my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce to ensure that Hawaii and Tennessee receive equal treatment in the matter of DSH payments from the Federal Government. H.R. 6631 extends DSH payments for Hawaii and Tennessee through December 31, 2009, and provides an additional $15 million for Hawaii. This extension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a State plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals which is consistent with the requirements of existing law. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to provide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater contribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are providing indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements between the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for Hawaii's QUEST program. 
   I will continue to work toward a permanent solution to the DSH matter, but until then, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is not an earmark, but merely provides Hawaii and Tennessee equity with everyone else. 
   Again I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone, and Chairman Stark on this important piece of legislation that protects our seniors and provides equity for the State of Hawaii. I urge my colleagues to pass this vital bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (KALAUPAPA MEMORIAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of H.R. 3332, the Kalaupapa Memorial Act of 2007. This measure would authorize Ka Ohana O Kalaupapa to establish a memorial to honor those who were forcibly relocated to Kalaupapa. 
   Kalaupapa is a National Historical Park located on a remote peninsula of northern Molokai. From 1866 through 1969, about 8,000 people afflicted with Hansen's disease, previously known as leprosy, were relocated to the area now known as Kalaupapa National Historical Park. 
   Many of the first settlers faced a harsh and difficult life. But the patients who were sent to Kalaupapa eventually built a community that allowed them to endure a life cut off from parents, children, brothers, sisters and friends. Even after medication was developed to control Hansen's disease, many patient residents chose to continue living in Kalaupapa. 
   The site became a national park in 1980 and is dedicated to preserving the memories and lessons of the past. Kalaupapa is a living memorial to a community that once lived in extreme isolation. It now serves as a place of education, contemplation and quiet beauty. Unfortunately, many of the residents who finished their life in Kalaupapa do not have recognizable graves or grave markers. The memorial established by this bill would serve as a permanent marker and reminder of all 8,000 residents who lived on Kalaupapa. 
   A little more than 20 patients remain in Kalaupapa. As time passes, the number of former residents of Kalaupapa gets smaller, as do the number of people who remember this part of Hawaii's history. With each passing, the sense of urgency for erecting a memorial becomes more and more heightened. We need to pass this bill as soon as possible so that this memorial becomes a reality before the passing of the next Kalaupapa resident. 
   My colleague Representative Mazie Hirono has worked tremendously hard to bring this bill to the floor today. I commend her efforts and would also like to express my gratitude to Representative Nick Rahall, Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, and Representative Ra&#250;l Grijalva, Chairperson of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. We would not be here today were it not for their support and enthusiasm. I wholeheartedly support this bill, am proud to be an original cosponsor and ask my colleagues for their support of H.R. 3332.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (RECOGNIZING AND WELCOMING THE LEADERS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 355, a resolution recognizing and welcoming the leaders of the Pacific Islands to Washington, D.C., and commending the East-West Center for hosting the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders. 
   The United States has always had a unique relationship to the Pacific Islands. Not only do they help play a key role in the fight against terrorism, but these governments also aid the U.S. in its overall security. Furthermore, both the U.S. and the Pacific Islands rely on the vast resources of the Pacific basin; these resources while enormous are not unlimited, and management requires cooperation across all of our governments. These islands also work closely with the U.S. on an important environmental and security concern, global climate change, which has the potential to drastically affect all who depend on the Pacific for their livelihood. Furthermore, trade, tourism, and other economic ties further reveal the interdependence between the Pacific Islands and the U.S. The resolution before us recognizes these factors. 
   As we mark Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage month, we would also be remiss to not point out that Americans of Pacific Island decent are a rapidly growing ethnic group within the U.S. They add strength to our communities with their diversity and values, and they make important contributions to the U.S. as a whole. The resolution also mentions this important fact. 
   Furthermore, the resolution discusses the importance of the East-West Center, which runs the Conference of Leaders. Congress established the East-West Center, which is based in my district, in 1960. The East-West Center seeks to establish a dialogue between the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the U.S. The East-West Center provides a home for academics who perform vital research that helps all parties better understand each other's history and culture. The Center's Education and Outreach sphere helps disseminate what researchers learn to the broader public and to policymakers. Finally, the Center provides important dialogue programs. Under the effective leadership of Dr. Charles Morrison, the East-West Center continues to address the challenges of the Asian-Pacific 21st Century. 
   Established in 1980 the East-West Center's Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders grows out of these dialogue programs. It seeks to bring together leaders from the region to discuss many of the issues I mentioned earlier. In the era of growing interdependence between the U.S. and Pacific Island governments, both the work of the Center and the Conference of Leaders becomes more important. 
   I urge my colleagues to support both this resolution, and provide continued support to the East-West Center.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (GUAM WORLD WAR II LOYALTY RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman BORDALLO. H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the Japanese occupation of Guam. 
   During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims. 
   In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war ..... in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.'' 
   Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated. 
   There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices. 
   Congresswoman BORDALLO has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I will just recapitulate for a couple of moments, then perhaps we can move to the conclusion. 
   I indicated last night, and I think it was agreed to by Mr. Bachus of Alabama and others, by way of material that has been entered into the Record, like Mr. Renzi of Arizona, that this should not be a partisan fight. In fact, ``fight'' probably is the wrong word, but, I mean, even a disagreement here. 
   The reason that this bill passed overwhelmingly last week, with significant support from the Republican side of the aisle, was that it was supported in committee by Republicans and Democrats. The bill is here before the Congress as a result of a request by Hawaii's Republican Governor, and the former Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party, who is now the head of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. 
   We have always had legislation in this area based on the underlying law, which was passed in 1921, by the Congress, setting aside certain lands for Hawaiians. The issue before us is about refinancing of home mortgages. This is not about whether the original law, under which the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was established, it is constitutional. 
   On the contrary, that issue has been raised, and it perhaps should be raised in another context; namely, if someone wants to change the underlying law. But we should not punish my constituents or anybody's constituents for the fact that they appear before us in the form of a bill trying to carry forward on the admonitions required of them, in this instance, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to get their mortgages refinanced. 
   Let me say, just as recently as February 9 of this year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a group of individuals who came before the court, saying that funding for programs that benefit Hawaiians, in this instance, of this bill, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against non-Hawaiians. 
   The Federal appeals court ruled that was not the case. In fact, they returned it to the U.S. District Court to see if the plaintiffs were eligible ``in any  other capacity.'' That is to say, other than whether it was constitutional. 
   So we have, as recently as the last 30 days, appeals court admonitions that the constitutionality of having programs for Hawaiians is, in fact, constitutional. 
   If someone wants to argue that, please let's argue it on the basis of a bill that addresses that itself, rather than the bill which is before us, which has to do with the refinancing of mortgages. Please don't punish people that are trying to own their own homes, to keep their own homes, because of some ideological difference that we might have.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the final passage of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007. 
   Opponents of this bill believe this program may be unconstitutional based upon a mistaken interpretation of Rice v. Cayetano. But Rice v. Cayetano was a voting rights case. The question put to the Court was whether limiting the right to vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to Native Hawaiians violated the 15th amendment. The court in Rice specifically declined to rule on the status of Native Hawaiians and Native Hawaiian programs created by Congress. 
   Moreover, this bill and these programs have never been a partisan issue in the past. This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican administration and Governor Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of Hawaii's State Republican Party. This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Bob Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote and without amendment. Last Congress's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, cosponsored this bill. 
   I mention these pieces of background information to illustrate the wide support for the program and the fact that it has been both Democratic and Republican. Last week, when this bill was up for consideration in the House under a suspension of the rules, the GOP leadership issued a statement just hours before the vote, calling the bill ``unconstitutional'' and charged that it would ``confer on Native Hawaiian an arrangement like that between the federal government and American Indian tribes.'' Despite these charges, the bill was able to garner 34 Republican votes. 
   The status of Native Hawaiians needs to be debated and should be debated in the House. However, this is the wrong venue for that. I have another bill pending in the House of Representatives that would establish a process for the Federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. I hope to have this legislation considered by the House Natural Resources Committee and will gladly debate these issues at that time. 
   This measure is about helping low-income Native Hawaiians own their own home. The programs reauthorized by H.R. 835 simply provide funds for infrastructure, helps Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages and allows for refinancing to lower the cost of homeownership. This bill is about assisting Native Hawaiians to reach the American dream of owning their own home. 
   I believe this bill can, and should, pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage of this bill and support efforts to get more low-income people into their own homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 406, celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls. 
   Title IX changed the way the United States educates its women and girls. It states that, ``No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' This monumental legislation has had far-reaching effects on the women in this country. Title IX may be best known for its changes in athletics, but the academic world has been significantly changed as well. Since 1981, women have received more bachelor's degrees than men, and since 1986, women have received more master's degrees than men. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of Patsy Mink and Edith Green. Generations of women have and will benefit from the work of these women. 
   I had the honor of serving with Patsy Mink for 12 years, representing the State of Hawaii  in the U.S. House of Representatives. She strove to ensure equality and fairness for all Americans. Through her work on title IX, she was able to accomplish just that for every American woman. The renaming of title IX to the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act honors her work and reminds us all of her dedication to equality. 
   We should take this time to reflect on where we have come from and the progress we have made. Millions of women have access to the education to make their dreams come true, and that access was guaranteed 35 years ago by a woman who believed that we should all be able to better our lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. ABERCROMBIE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee on Air and Land Forces, my overriding concern on every issue that comes before us is whether and how it supports our men and women in uniform. 
   Every decision about equipment, procurement, training, end strength or budget authorization must meet this test: Does it support our troops? The question before us today, increasing U.S. forces in Iraq by some 21,000 combat troops and somewhere between 3 and 28,000 support personnel fails this test in every respect. 
   Both the immediate and long-term effects of the war in Iraq on our Nation's military preparedness are evident and drastic. Extended deployments, premature redeployments, and sustained combat under unbelievably harsh conditions have taken a terrible toll on our forces and their equipment. 
   The results are an overstretched U.S. Army and Marine Corps with no fully mission-capable Reserve forces, and an urgent need for billions of dollars to repair or replace worn and damaged helicopters, tanks, other armored vehicles, including up-armored Humvees and other equipment. 
   I recently returned from an inspection of two of the Army's busiest repair depots in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Anniston, Alabama. What we saw there were skilled and dedicated employees working feverishly to make sure that our men and women in uniform, particularly those in Iraq and Afghanistan, have every piece of equipment they need to do their jobs and keep themselves safe from harm. 
   What we saw were the results of an administration's abject failure to mobilize this country's industrial base for this war of choice. Only now are we ramping up America's manufacturing capacity to fully support our troops at home and overseas. 
   Smugly self-righteous in its belief that U.S. troops would be targeted with nothing more lethal than rose petals, this administration has been complacent in leaving the burden of the war on the men and women of our Armed Forces, active, Reserve and National Guard. The impact of this attitude hit home for me in Corpus Christi when I read recently about the death in Iraq of a 48-year-old Army sergeant with five children. 
   Newspaper Columnist Dan Thomasson asked: What in the world was a 48-year-old man with five children doing in the military in Iraq? The answer is obvious, he was a member either of the National Guard or the Reserve. The Guard and Reserve are being used in a way never contemplated. Their repeated and sustained deployments turn lives upside down, sometimes permanently, and have a profound impact on families, businesses and whole communities. 
   Why have they been so misused? Because there is not anyone else. Because our active duty force is too small to sustain our engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. To have acted to ensure the burden of this war would be more broadly shared, that the industrial sector would be mobilized, and the military equipment, supply and maintenance and repair systems put on a war-time footing would have been expensive and an admission of a reality the Bush administration did not want to confront. 
   The real and immediate concern is that forces now being deployed as part of this surge will not have the equipment they need when they get there. They will have to borrow it. We are not fully prepared to respond effectively. 
   The House then is considering an expression of support or opposition to another failure of leadership. Nearly 23 years ago, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, outlined in a speech entitled ``The Uses of Military Power,'' six tests that need to be applied whenever combat forces are contemplated. 
   One: never commit forces unless the particular situation is vital to our national interest or that of our allies. Two: if we are willing to commit the force or resources necessary to win, we should commit them all. 
   Three: we should have clearly defined political and military objectives. Four: the relationship between the objectives and forces, size, composition, disposition, must be continually reassessed and adjusted. 
   Five: we must have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress. Six: the commitment of U.S. troops to combat should be a last resort. President Bush's policies have failed every one of then-Secretary Weinberger's tests. 
   What then are the consequences of this failure? Our troops are in peril. Our credibility is shattered and the lessons of the past are submerged in empty rhetoric and political dribble.     
   Make no mistake, we are engaged in a war of choice, a catastrophe conceived in ideological zeal, cloaked in misinformation and administered with breathtaking incompetence. 
   It is an outrage that we have not had a single policy in Iraq worthy of our men and women in uniform. This surge is yet another misstep in this tragic journey to disaster. We need to end it and end it now.
