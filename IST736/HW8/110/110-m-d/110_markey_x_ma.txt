<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Lampson and I and Mr. Van Hollen introduced this legislation under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi in order to ensure that the American people get the relief at the gas pump they need before Labor Day in 2008. But the Republicans are holding consumers hostage. No immediate relief, they are saying to American consumers, unless the ultimate agenda of Big Oil is met. Unless they are allowed to drill off the beaches 10 years from now, they will not allow the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be used now in order to preserve it. Ten to 20 days of relief is all it will take for us to get help to the American consumer. The Republican plan is 10 to 20 years, according to their own Department of Energy. 
   The President says he does not have a magic wand. Well, he does have a magic wand, he has a big stick and that big stick is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that he can use right now to beat down the prices of oil which are driving American consumers crazy in terms of their home budgets. 
   Deploying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve works. It worked in 1991 when President Bush's father used it. It worked in the year 2000 when President Clinton used it, and it worked after Hurricane Katrina when President Bush the Second used it. The President is willing to use the Army Reserve to go to Iraq to protect the oil over there, but he is not willing to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to protect American consumers here from the emergency which we are facing at home--high gas prices, home heating oil prices, natural gas prices, the airline industry going under, the trucking industry in desperate shape. But they will not use it right now. 
   The Democrats have a short-term plan, and that is to give relief in 10 to 20 days. Use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, use it as a weapon against speculators, against Big Oil and against OPEC; but the Republican Party is still the GOP; GOP, Gas and Oil Party. That's what this is all about.

   Mr. MARKEY. How did we get here? It's very simple. President Bush and Dick Cheney were elected 8 years ago. They put together a secret energy plan. Two oilmen now in the White House. And here is the simple mathematics. Two oilmen plus two terms in office equals $4 a gallon for gasoline for every American consumer across the country. Very simple mathematics. 
   The Democratic energy plan, on the other hand, is very simple. Right now deploy the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Put the fear of the Lord into speculators, into OPEC, into the oil industry. The price will plummet. It did in 1991 when President Bush's father used it; it did in 2000 when President Clinton used it; it did when President Bush himself used it after Hurricane Katrina. This is a huge emergency for families as they look at their pocketbooks. They're being tipped upside down. The President should use it. 
   And for the Democrats, after the Republicans controlled Congress for 12 years, in 2007 the Democrats took over. We increased the fuel economy standard for the vehicles which we have to drive, the appliance-efficiency standards, the lighting standards, new biofuels policy. We backed out with that bill that passed in December of 2007, the Democratic bill, 4.1 million barrels of oil per day over the next 10 to 20 years. 
   Right now we spend $387 million a day to send American troops over into the Middle East, and we have to purchase 2.1 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf. Our bill in December that President Bush signed backs out that oil. 
   But the Republicans had 12 years of control of this Congress to do something about it. They did not. Now they say we need a renewable electricity center so electricity is generated from renewables. The Republicans are saying no. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this bill. This is the solution the consumers need before Labor Day.

   Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Welch. 
   Madam Speaker, we have on the floor right now for consideration legislation which will make it possible for American consumers, who are being tipped upside down at the gasoline pump every time they go in with their vehicle and having money shaken out of their pockets, to have immediate relief, to have the United States be on the side of the American consumer. 
   Now what has been happening over the last couple of months is really unfortunate. The Republicans and President Bush have been arguing that the answer is to go and to drill up in the remotest parts of the Arctic, when their own Department of Energy is saying that it will take 10 to 20 years for any of that oil to get to the gas pumps in the United States and, when it does, it will only offer insignificant relief to the American consumer. 
   Meanwhile, the President went over to Saudi Arabia, just a month and a half ago, to beg the Saudi Arabians to please produce more oil that we can use right now, because that would drop the price in oil. The Saudis said, ``Well, we'll think about it. Maybe we'll produce another two or 300,000 barrels of oil, but you'll have to send back your Secretary of Energy in another 3 weeks for us to talk to him.'' 
   Well, you can either promise the American people something that doesn't happen 10 to 20 years from now,  which is what the Republicans have been doing, or you can use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve right now, which is what our legislation will do, and it will say to the President, Mr. President, you must use 10 percent of all the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve right now, 70 million barrels of oil, and you must use it over the next 5 or 6 months. That would average out to about 500,000 barrels of oil a day. That's the signal that the marketplace would absolutely respond to, because it would send shivers up the spine of the speculators, of the manipulators, of the OPEC cartel that has been playing games with the American consumer. 
   How do we know that this is going to work? We know it's going to work because when past Presidents have turned the spigot on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, President Bush I, just before the first Persian Gulf war, the price dropped 33 percent for oil. 
   In the year 2000 when Bill Clinton used it, it dropped 18 percent. And even when this President Bush used it right after the Katrina storm, it dropped 9 percent. We know this works. 
   But what's going to happen? The Republican leadership is going to get on a plane and fly up to the Arctic wildlife refuge. Instead, they should get on a plane and fly down to Houston and take a look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and ask the President to just turn the spigot on and to send that oil right now, not 10 or 20 years from now, but 10 or 20 days from now so that Americans, who are enjoying their August vacations know that the American government is on their side.

   Mr. MARKEY. The reason the Republicans won't use it, however, is that they argue that we're not in an emergency. I think that is not how the American people view where we are. $4 a gallon for gasoline. The price for home heating oil and natural gas this winter rising by the day. We have the airline industry in crisis. We have the trucking industry in crisis. We have food prices skyrocketing. 
   The American people believe we are in an energy emergency. What we do in this bill is we say, Mr. President, it might not fit your definition of what an emergency is, but it fits the definition for the American people. We want you to deploy the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now. We want you to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect the American consumer now. 
   We don't want you to wait, Mr. President, until after some war in Iran and deploy it then too, sir, but please do not wait until then. Please understand that Americans want their oil. They paid for this oil. They've paid $100 billion to put this oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Houston, in Louisiana, in Mississippi. They want relief now. 
   Vote ``aye'' on this legislation.

   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman from Vermont. 
   You know, this Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an incredible weapon to be used in order to protect the American consumer from being gouged at the pump right now. And the Republican Party and President Bush and Vice President Cheney are talking about anything but using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to protect the American consumer at the pump today. And there's a good reason. Because the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to the oil industry what kryptonite is to Superman. It saps them of their strength immediately. It decreases dramatically their power over ordinary citizens across our country. And that's why they object to it. 
   You're going to keep hearing from Republicans how they really want to help consumers 10 and 20 years from now. But you're not going to hear a word about their support for deploying 500,000 or 1 million barrels of oil a day right now into the marketplace that will drive down the price of oil, drive down the price of gasoline at the pump today. 
   That's what we're going to continue to wait to hear them say. 
   Now, they have plenty of time left in order to make that statement in this debate today, but you're not going to hear it. You're not going to hear them talking about immediate relief.  They're going to continually talk about oil that will come from drilling on our beaches 10 or 20 years from now. Well, that's fine 10 and 20 years from now, but what are they going to do now? What are they going to do between now and Labor Day when Americans are driving all over the country? They're doing to say, We can't use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We can't drive down the price of oil now. We have to wait. 
   This is going to be an important bill to give protection to the American consumers.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1528, the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act. This important legislation would amend the National Trails System Act of 1968 to designate a 220- mile long National Scenic Trail through Massachusetts and Connecticut. Designation as a National Scenic Trail will allow this important regional trail system to be supported, maintained, and protected at the highest possible level. 
   The bulk of this new trail would be comprised of the existing Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett trail system--a 190-mile trail route through 39 communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut. This important regional recreation system has been in existence for more than fifty years and winds its way from the border of Massachusetts and New Hampshire through western Massachusetts and into Connecticut. 
   Designating this trail system as a National Scenic Trail will ensure that future generations of New Englanders will be able to fully enjoy the tremendous beauty of these trails and take advantage of their many recreational opportunities. Right now, more than 2 million people live within 10 miles of the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett trail system. As a result, this designation will not only allow millions of people to have access to the trail system but also ensure that it will be properly preserved from the threats and pressures of development and encroachment. 
   H.R. 1528 requires that the Secretary of the Interior administer the trail consistent with the recommendations of the National Scenic Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental Assessment that was conducted by the Department of the Interior. The legislation also ensures that no land can be incorporated into the trail system without the consent of the landowner, and I am pleased that the Administration has testified in support of this important legislation.  
   This National Scenic Trail designation would provide for increased cooperation between communities, citizens and the Department of Interior to conserve these special routes and expand the recreational opportunities of this New England treasure. I urge passage of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their excellent work on reaching an agreement on this important legislation to upgrade and modernize the regulations and the Agency charged with ensuring the safety of consumer products. 
   In the past couple of years, Americans have been shocked to learn that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is an agency in crisis, starved of resources and slow to respond to a growing tsunami of toxic toys and other products that continue to put consumers at risk. 
   We learned of defective cribs that resulted in deaths whose defects were never fully disclosed to the public. We learned of lead-tainted jewelry and other products, toys coated with a notorious date-rape drug, and unacceptable delays in the investigation and recall of dangerous products on the part of the CPSC. We learned of undue influence by manufacturers within the CPSC itself. With all of these problems, CPSC had come to stand for the ``Can't Protect the Safety of Children'' agency. 
   The Democratic Congress made reform a priority and embarked in a New Direction. The result is a remarkable success. 
   We have agreed to BAN lead and pthalates in children's products. 
   We have agreed to greatly increase funding and personnel for the CPSC. 
   And we have agreed to dramatically upgrade and make mandatory testing requirements and standards for toys. 
   These new provisions will dramatically improve the protection of consumers across the country. 
   There are three provisions in this conference report that I would like to call particular attention to. 
   First, I am delighted that the Conference Committee has included language I first conceived of and proposed during House consideration of the bill to create an online searchable database for consumers to obtain early warning of defective and dangerous products. 
   In 2000 and again in 2003, the CPSC documented cases of children suffering intestinal injuries after swallowing small but powerful magnets that had fallen out of toys. The public didn't know, and the CPSC did nothing. 
   By mid-2005, after more reports of safety concerns associated with the magnets and two reports of serious, life-threatening injuries, the public still didn't know and the CPSC still did nothing. 
   On Thanksgiving Day 2005, 22 month old Kenny Sweet of Redmond, Washington died after swallowing magnets that had fallen out of Magnetix toys. It was only after Kenny's death and an additional 4 hospitalizations that the CPSC finally gave the public an inkling of what was going on. 
   But it took until April 2007--after seven years of reports of risks, numerous serious injuries and a death--before a full recall of all the products was undertaken. 
   In the past months, we have learned of additional tragic accidents related to flawed or toxic products on store shelves. The fundamental problem that needed to be solved is that the people buying these products for their children, grandchildren or households should not have to wait months or years to find out that someone has died or been seriously injured. 
   The database created in this legislation will give empower consumers by requiring the CPSC to create a publicly searchable database that will allow them to access specific reports from consumers, doctors, hospitals or others of serious injury, illness or death, or risk of serious injury illness or death that may be due to a faulty or unsafe product. The database will be similar to those that already exist for cars and other automotive products at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and for drugs and medical devices at the Food and Drug Administration. 
   No longer will parents be learning about ``Thomas the Toxic Train,'' ``Defective Diego'' or ``Poisonous Polly Pocket'' months or years after the CPSC learns of them, and I thank the Conferees for including my proposal in the final bill. 
   I also want to particularly commend the Conferees for including strong whistleblower protections for private sector employees who are retaliated against for disclosing safety problems with defective products. These provisions are similar to those I authored for rail and mass transit security workers in the 9-11 bill, and represent an excellent step forward in ensuring that these brave individuals are treated like the ``Paul Reveres'' they are instead of being threatened with loss of their jobs and livelihoods. 
   I wish to point out that Congress did not reiterate long standing case law and established legal principles for interpreting statutory language in the whistleblower provision, and intends that those standards continue to be respected. To illustrate, consistent with long-established Supreme Court case law, see e.g., English v. General Electric, 496 U.S. 270 (1990), these rights do not cancel or replace preexisting remedies, whether under other overlapping congressional statutes, statute laws, state tort claims or collective bargaining agreements. There also should be no confusion that the rights created by this statute supersede and cannot be canceled and overridden by any conflicting restrictions in company manuals, employment contracts or nondisclosure agreements. 
   I also wish to note that consistent with the Act's remedial purposes and longstanding case law, employee should be broadly defined to protect all individuals, including current and former employees, as well as job applicants, who have information that may prevent danger to consumers from illegal product hazards. 
   Finally, section 102 which relates to third party testing, I am pleased that the Conferees included language that requires testing of samples that are identical in all material respects to the product, meaning that submitting product prototypes rather than actual examples of the manufacturing run for testing would not, in my view, satisfy the requirements of this section.  
   Once again, I wish to commend my colleagues for their excellent work on this landmark legislation. I look forward to a reinvigorated CPSC, equipped with the necessary resources and authority needed to be the consumer's ``cop on the beat'', keeping Americans safe from dangerous products.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I commend Chairman PETERSON and Chairman ETHERIDGE for their leadership in bringing this measure to the House floor. 
   When we have mounting evidence that today's high oil prices are due in part to excessive futures and derivatives market speculation, we must take action to help the American consumer who is struggling to pay $4 for a gallon of gas. We must stand up to speculators who are aiding and abetting big oil companies that continue to rake in record profits and laugh all the way to the bank. 
   In 2000, a regulatory black hole was created that took the cop off the beat when it comes to energy commodities. This law allowed energy commodities to be exempted from virtually all of the laws that we have had in place for agricultural and financial commodities.  
   At the time this bill passed the House, I argued that this loophole was not in the public interest and that it needed to be fixed in conference in order to prevent harm to energy markets and consumers. But it was not fixed. 
   The Enron loophole allowed speculators and financial operators to hide their actions from regulators and the public. 
   In May, Congress took the first step towards closing the Enron loophole when it passed, over President Bush's veto, the farm bill. That bill contained language that will help bring these commodities trades under greater federal oversight. 
   In June, this House took the next step, when it approved legislation that directed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to examine excessive oil speculation and use their emergency powers to take corrective action. 
   But the Congress needs to take further actions to address excessive speculation in these markets. 
   The bill before us today does that. 
   It would close the so-called London Loophole that has allowed traders to evade U.S. regulation by offshoring their trades. 
   It would require additional information to be made public regarding the trading activities of index funds--and other investors--in energy commodities markets. 
   It would subject over-the-counter energy derivatives transactions to regulatory reporting and recordkeeping requirements, including position reporting. 
   It positions limits for certain contracts on energy commodities, and mandates position limits for energy commodity speculators. 
   It requires the Commission to appoint at least 100 new full time employees. 
   It requires the Commission to mandate routine reporting of certain OTC energy transactions, determine whether such agreements have the potential to disrupt market liquidity and price discovery, cause severe market disturbance, or prevent prices from reflecting supply and demand. If the Commission finds that they have caused problems in these areas, it is authorized to impose and enforce position limits on the involved agreements. 
   The energy, economic and the environmental crisis we face are all connected. It is time for Congress to stop playing favorites to Big Oil. Cracking down on speculation will not only help families with skyrocketing gas prices, it will give needed relief to the airline industry, the trucking industry and small businesses across my district in Massachusetts. This is a good bill. It is a necessary bill, and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. MARKEY. First of all, I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Dingell, your staffs, Mr. Waxman, Ranking Member Barton and Mr. Deal, all the Members on the Republican side for the product that is here, all of the staff which has worked on it for so long. My own staff, Kate Bazinsky, who is sitting right here, just was married 2 months ago, this has definitely affected those first 2 months of marriage, the incredible negotiations that have taken place to reach this point, along with Mark Bayer who was working on the privacy parts of this legislation with your staffs. I congratulate everyone. 
   I am pleased that the final bill before us today retains the core drug safety and clinical trial provisions from the bill that Congressman Waxman and I introduced in March, which will improve transparency at the FDA and make drugs safer. Although I had hoped the sunset would be removed from the pediatric rule and less exclusivity given to blockbuster products under the pediatric incentive program, this bill is a historic achievement which will make drugs and medical devices safer for consumers around the world. 
   The past several years have been marked by drug scandal after drug scandal, Vioxx, Ketek, Paxil and Avandia. These drugs have harmed families across the country and come to symbolize the urgent need for reform at the FDA. Taking drugs should not be a game of RX roulette, and yet the FDA's current system is broken, and thousands of American families have been harmed by drugs with dangerous side effects. 
   Today, the House is responding to those failures. The bill is a victory for consumers and for patients. The bill will empower the FDA with important new authorities to mandate label changes and require postmarket studies. However, these new FDA authorities do not change the responsibility of companies to maintain drug labels and warn the public about risk. 
   For the first time ever, the FDA will have the power to impose civil monetary penalties on companies that fail to conduct required postmarket studies. It will also establish a new postmarket risk identification and analysis system to identify harmful side effects without compromising patient privacy. 
   Since 2004, I have been fighting for a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database which will ensure that the public has accurate and complete information about drugs and devices.  This bill will create that mandatory clinical trials database. 
   I am also extremely pleased that the FDA package includes language from the Markey-Rogers pediatric devices bill which is a major step forward for getting better and better devices for kids. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the chairman from New Jersey for all his great work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 3087. 
   H.R. 3087 requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress within 60 days, and every 90 days thereafter, ``on the status of planning for the redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq.'' This bill specifies that the Pentagon is to describe a range of different possible scenarios for withdrawal, and create multiple timelines for completion of withdrawal. These reports will be valuable to the Congress as it carries out its oversight responsibilities and considers future legislation regarding Iraq. While it is necessary to require the Department of Defense to draft plans for withdrawal for Iraq, it is not sufficient. President Bush must finally implement these withdrawal plans so that our brave men and women can return home to their families having served honorably under extremely difficult conditions. 
   It is clear that President Bush is content to allow the next President to clean up his mess in Iraq, and that is a travesty. The bill that we are considering today will at least make that job slightly easier for the next President, as the Pentagon will have already drawn up detailed plans for our withdrawal from Iraq. As we know only too well today, responsible planning and foresight was one of the earliest casualties of President Bush's war in Iraq. If the Congress must force such planning to be done, so be it. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I support H.R. 3087 and encourage all members to vote for its passage today, it is tragic that due to opposition from Republican leaders in the Congress and veto threats by the President, we have not yet been able to make further progress on withdrawing our troops from Iraq. There was no connection between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein and no nuclear weapons in the sands of Iraq, yet the President seems to have no intention of bringing this mistaken and ill-conceived war to an end. It is a war that has made the United States less secure, yet the President refuses to even begin thinking about a new strategy. It is long past time for the United States to hand over security in Iraq to the Iraqis, and I hope that this bill will move us closer to that goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I also wish to also briefly discuss various provisions in order to more fully explain the statutory language and to provide context for what we are accomplishing with this historic energy bill. 
   Section 3 of the bill states: ``Except to the extent expressly provided in this Act, or in an amendment made by this Act, nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this act supersedes, limits the authority or responsibility conferred by, or authorizes any violation of any provision of law (including a regulation), including any energy or environmental law or regulation.'' 
   The laws and regulations referred to in section 3 include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act and any regulations promulgated under Clean Air Act authority. It is the intent of Congress to fully preserve existing federal and state authority under the Clean Air Act. 
   In addition, Congress does not intend, by including provisions in Title I of the bill that reform and alter the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to increase fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, non-passenger automobiles, work trucks, and medium and heavy duty trucks, to in any way supersede or limit the authority and/or responsibility conferred by sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act. (For section 202 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to the authority and responsibility affirmed by the Supreme Court's April 2, 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA (No. 05-1120), and, for sections 177 and 209 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to the authority affirmed by the September 12, 2007 decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont in Green Mountain Chrysler Dodge Jeep et al. v. Crombie et al. (No. 2:05-cv-302).  
   Title 1 of the bill addresses CAFE Standards. Section 102(a) would require that the fleet of new passenger and non-passenger vehicles made for sale in model year 2020 reach a fleet-wide fuel economy average of at least 35 miles per gallon, regardless of shifts in the market or any other consideration. While fuel economy standards for each of model years 2011-2019 are expected to be the maximum feasible standard, this section does not allow the Department of Transportation (DOT) to set a fleet-wide average of lower than 35 miles per gallon for model year 2020 under any circumstances. In addition, if the maximum feasible level for model year 2020 is higher than 35 miles per gallon due to technological progress and/or other factors, Congress intends to require DOT to set standards at the maximum feasible level. 
   It is also the intent of this section to require DOT to set interim standards between 2011 and 2019 to make rapid and consistent annual progress towards achieving the 35 mpg minimum by 2020. In asking for ``ratable'' progress, the intent of Congress is to seek relatively consistent proportional increases in fuel economy standards each year, such that no single year through 2020 should experience a significantly higher increase than the previous year. 
   Section 104 addresses credit trading among and within automakers' vehicle fleets, and is intended to increase flexibility for automakers, but it is the intent of Congress that any trading not in any way reduce the oil savings achieved by the standards set for any year under this title. 
   Section 105 is intended to provide added information for consumers, but is not intended to in any way interfere with or diminish EPA labeling authority. Congress intends that DOT work closely with EPA in fulfilling the requirements of this section. 
   Section 106 is intended to clarify that Title I does not impact fuel economy standards or the standard-setting process for vehicles manufactured before model year 2011. This section is not intended to codify, or otherwise support or reject, any standards applying before model year 2011, and is not intended to reverse, supersede, overrule, or in any way limit the November 15, 2007 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (No. 06-71891) 
   Section 109 makes modifications to the cap on the credits allowed to manufacturers making dual-fuel vehicles to ensure that the dual-fuel vehicle credit program is phased out and is fully and permanently eliminated by 2020 and thereafter. 
   I urge the Secretary to pay careful heed to the intent and spirit of these provisions in carrying out the provisions of this Title, so that we achieve the Bill's goals of increasing the fuel efficiency of our cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   This is a historic debate. This is a historic day in the history of the United States. Today, we debate energy independence and global warming for the first time in a serious way in our history. This legislation will accomplish things that will send a signal to the world. 
   In this bill, we will increase the fuel economy standards of the vehicles Americans drive from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon. We will produce enough ethanol and cellulosic fuel that we can substitute for oil that by the year 2030, when both provisions are completely implemented, we will be backing out twice the oil that we import on a daily basis from OPEC, from the Persian Gulf. What a signal to OPEC, twice the oil from the Persian Gulf eliminated in one vote. 
   And, at the same time, because of the efficiencies in light bulbs, in heating, in cooling, in furnaces, in all appliances, in buildings, in homes, we will in this one vote meet 35 percent of our entire goal by the year 2030 in reducing greenhouse gases to protect the planet from global warming. We will meet in this one vote 35 percent of the entire goal between now and 2030. What a moment for this Congress. 
   It will unleash a technological revolution in new technology so that, rather than importing those technologies, we will be exporting those technologies. It will send a signal to our consumers that we are not going to stand by and allow them to be tipped upside down and have money shaken out of their pocket by OPEC as the price of oil has gone from $26 a barrel in President Bush's first year in office to over $90 a barrel today. Every week, the American consumers send $5 billion overseas to OPEC and other countries; $5 billion a week. 
   This bill today is really a signal to OPEC that we now mean business. And it is a signal to the rest of the world that we are serious about global warming, and it is a signal to our citizens that we are going to begin to create those new green jobs in our country so that we can produce the products that are going to revolutionize the energy sector. 
   So make no mistake about it as you cast this vote, my colleagues, you are casting the most important energy and environment vote of your career, and you will be remembered for this vote. So I ask you to give a signal to the American people that this Congress, when the Republicans took over in 1995, imported 43 percent of its oil; now we import 61 percent of our oil. It just keeps going up and up and up. So if we are to turn a corner historically and to engage these issues of energy efficiency, these issues of energy independence, these issues of global warming, this is the vote. One vote, later on today. I urge an ``aye'' vote by all of the Members of this body.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman, and I congratulate him on this excellent piece of legislation. I think we know why we are here. We are here because the American consumer is being pummeled at the gasoline pump on a daily basis. They want to know, how did we get from $30 a barrel of oil and $1.50 for a gallon, on the day that George Bush and DICK CHENEY were sworn in, to a point now where it's now $140 a barrel and more than $4 a gallon gasoline now. 
   Well, it's a very simple formula during the Bush-Cheney era. It's two oilmen in the White House for two terms, equals $4 a gallon gasoline. Oil math in the United States is very simple. They put together a secret energy plan, DICK CHENEY and George Bush, on day one in the White House. Today, we are out here debating whether or not it's a success. 
   Now, from the oil industry perspective, it is, and they were the only ones allowed into these secret meetings with the President and the Vice President. 
   But, for the American people, they are being tipped upside down at the pump. When we, as Democrats, say you can go right now and drill up in the petroleum reserves, you can go offshore. You can go into all of these locations that are already permitted. 
   No, there is absolutely no interest on the part of the oil industry. When we say to the oil industry and to the Bush administration, instead of drilling off of the beaches of the United States first, how about going to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? How about taking 70 million barrels there and starting to deploy it, to put the fear of God into the oil industry, into speculators, into traders?     
   The President says, I would never use that because it is a free market, the price of oil on the marketplace. 
   So what we are saying is, don't go to the beaches first. Go to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but they will not do it. 
   So the DRILL bill of Mr. Rahall is very simple. He says, instead of drilling somewhere 20 years from now, to give an insignificant relief, Mr. Rahall is saying, drill now in the 68 million acres that you already have, which has oil. 
   We need, instead of drilling for 20 years from now we need to tap, tap, tap the oil where we have it on the land in the United States today. We need to tap, tap, tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today, immediately, to protect the American consumer. We need to tap into renewable energy resources in order to protect the American people now with wind and solar. 
   The Bush administration says no, no, no; I am with the American Petroleum Institute, not the American consumer at the pump. And that is why we say to the oil industry and to the Republican Party, stop your coalition which has driven the price of oil to a point where consumers are being tipped upside down at the pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, and I commend Chairman GEORGE MILLER for his herculean efforts to move this bill forward and bring it to the House floor today. 
   This bill is an important step towards providing Americans with fundamental workplace protections that are long overdue. When workers have the freedom to join together and bargain collectively, they have the opportunity to secure affordable health care, adequate vacation time and other benefits as part of good faith negotiations with their employers. 
   Americans are working harder and more efficiently than ever before. But while productivity has increased, many middle class families continue to struggle to make ends meet, pay the mortgage, afford college for their children, and access affordable health care. 
   These hardworking families are everyday heroes, but even heroes need help. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act will help ensure that workers who seek a better future for themselves and their families through union representation are not coerced, intimidated or threatened by employers trying to prevent them from exercising their legal rights. 
   The bill we are considering today would enable employees to choose--they can choose to go through the current NLRB election process, or they can choose a card-check process designed to insulate them from intimidation. If a majority of employees choose to sign cards in support of union representation, the employer must abide by that decision and certify the union if the NLRB validates their majority. 
   While the card-check route to union representation is permitted under current law, employers have the choice to reject the results. 
   In other words, under current law, it's the employer's choice. Under the Employee Free Choice Act, it's the employee's choice. 
   This bill is urgently needed because some employers choose to fight unionization by intimidating workers, threatening to fire pro-union employees or close the plant. Making union certification mandatory when a majority of employees sign union cards would prevent illegal tactics intended to crush workers' efforts to bargain collectively. 
   James Madison famously wrote that ``If men were angels, no government would be necessary.'' Madam Chairman, if all companies were angels, this bill would not be necessary. 
   Unfortunately, while some enlightened companies currently recognize the legitimacy of a union when a majority of their employees sign union cards, many do not. 
   Now is the time to give Americans the power they need to improve conditions in the workplace. 
   President Roosevelt told us: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' 
   The Employee Free Choice Act is consistent with the American ideal that everyone--not just the privileged few--deserves the opportunity to improve their condition in life and build a bright, optimistic future for their children. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote and commend Chairman MILLER for his work on this important legislation.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this compromise legislation which will provide healthcare for 10 million low-income American children. 
   This bill will give 4 million currently uninsured children a healthy start in life. 
   Yet in a confirmation of the White House's pitiless priorities, President Bush is threatening to veto this bill if we spend any more than $5 billion dollars over 5 years to help poor American children get health care. 
   This year alone, the President requested 40 times that amount--$200 billion dollars--for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet he has threatened to veto SCHIP on the basis that it spends too much money on American children. 
   The President constantly chooses Corporations over Children, spending billions on tax cuts for millionaires and subsidies for his friends in big oil without batting an eyelash. But when it comes to giving our country's poor children health care, he can't find the heart to come up with the money. 
   Today's debate is a major moment in the history of health care, and a veto will place the President firmly on the wrong side of history. 
   By vetoing this bill, President Bush will expose himself as a Compassionless Conservative. 
   By vetoing SCHIP, the President will dash hopes of millions of working families who dreamed that they would be able to provide health care for their sick children. 
   I urge you to stand with those working families and help their children get the health care they need. Vote yes on this critical legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to any amendments that would strike the longstanding existing moratoria on offshore oil and gas drilling along the East and West Coasts. 
   When you look at these amendments, you see that they are particularly empty of any promise to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Right now, without these amendments, drilling is already allowed in areas holding roughly 80 percent of the estimated oil and gas resources. In fact, of the 8,000 active leases oil companies hold in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 6,000 have yet to begin producing oil. So if you are worried about making sure that the oil and gas industry has access to the Outer Continental Shelf, stop worrying. They already have more leases than they know what to do with. They have been given the right to drill for the vast majority of oil and gas offshore and are not even producing from the majority of leases they hold in the Gulf. The oil companies should begin producing on the leases they already hold, not looking to acquire new ones in environmentally sensitive areas that do not even have large estimated oil and gas resources. 
   Moreover, let's not forget the Republican leadership just rammed through an offshore drilling bill in the waning hours of the last Congress as a going out of business bonanza for big oil. That legislation opened up additional areas in the Gulf of Mexico holding 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. But barely six months later, drilling proponents are back for another bite at the apple, once again attempting to give away our important coastal areas away to Big Oil. 
   G.O.P still stands for the Gas and Oil Party. 
   It is highly misleading to suggest that we can solve the problem of our oil dependence or high gas prices with more drilling, when the real answer is not more drilling, but using technology to make our cars and SUVs more energy efficient. After Congress mandated a doubling of fuel economy standards from 13.5 to 27.5 miles per gallon, our dependence on foreign oil went from 46.5% in 1977 to 27% in 1985 but we are now back up to 60%. 
   We should be making our vehicles more efficient, not giving away our public lands to big oil companies that are making record profits. Soon, this House will have an opportunity to go on Record on the Markey-Platts legislation, which would mandate a 35 mile per gallon combined fleet fuel efficiency standard--an improvement that will allow us to reduce our consumption by roughly the same amount of oil that we currently import from the Persian Gulf by 2022. 
   I am pleased that the underlying bill once again includes language authored by myself and Mr. Hinchey that would give oil companies a strong incentive to renegotiate the faulty leases from 1998 and 1999. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that these leases could cost the American taxpayers more than $10 billion. The House has gone on record time and time again in overwhelming support of putting real pressure to renegotiate on every company holding these leases. Last year, the House adopted the Markey-Hinchey royalty relief fix that is included in this bill by a vote of 252-165 and earlier this year this body passed the royalty fixes contained in H.R. 6 by a vote of 264-163. It is time to put an end to big oil's free ride. I urge opposition to any amendments that would open up our coastlines to drilling and strongly support passage of the underlying bill.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, this bill today is a historic bill. What it is going to do is to reclaim billions of dollars, the GAO says upwards of $10 billion, which will then be moved over from unnecessary tax breaks and royalty relief for oil and gas companies, and moved over to a Strategic Renewable and Energy Efficiency Reserve so that we can change the direction of energy in our country by just taking back that which is undeserved in tax breaks and royalty relief. 
   So, what's the issue? Well, the issue is that back in 1998 and 1999 the oil industry received royalty breaks that didn't require them to pay any royalties back to the American people, the American taxpayer, as they drilled on the public lands of our country. 
   What this bill does is it gives a choice to the oil and gas industry: either renegotiate those leases or pay a fee going forward for the drilling on those lands. And that money will then go into a trust fund for renewables, for energy conservation, for ethanol, so that we can move in a new energy direction for the 21st century. It is a quite simple formula. 
   Now, the royalty relief, the change in how royalties are collected, it has already passed here on the House floor. But it was then blocked by the Bush administration. The $9 fee was the Pombo amendment. That has already passed on the House floor. So we are not talking about things that haven't already been debated. We are not talking about things that have already passed. What we are talking about are things that the Bush administration then blocked from becoming law. And what the Democrats are adding is just that it be put into a renewable and a conservation and ethanol trust fund so that we can move this country into a new energy direction. 
   I hope that this rule passes, and then I hope that we have an overwhelming vote, as we have had twice before in the past, by the way, on this royalty issue by all Members of the House, so that we can finally move in a new direction for the 21st century in energy policy.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill that we will consider later today represents the important first step in charting a new direction for the Nation's energy policy. H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, which repeals the unnecessary and wasteful tax breaks and royalty-free drilling rights for big oil and gas companies, and instead creates a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve that would invest in clean, renewable energy sources and clean alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as energy efficiency and conservation. 
   H.R. 6 will put an end to oil companies drilling for free on public land no matter how high oil prices climb. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the American taxpayers stand to lose at least $10 billion from leases issued in the late '90s that do not suspend so-called royalty relief. H.R. 6 would correct this problem by barring companies from purchasing new leases unless they had either renegotiated their existing faulty leases or agreed to pay a fee on the production of oil and gas from those leases. 
   The House has already adopted the royalty relief fixes included in H.R. 6 by overwhelming, bipartisan votes. By a vote of 252-165, the House adopted the Markey-Hinchey amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to provide a strong incentive for these companies to renegotiate. The House also voted last year to impose a $9 per barrel fee on oil produced from these leases in a bill authored by former Resources Chairman Pombo. Both those provisions are in H.R. 6. So two times this House has said that we want to put real pressure to renegotiate on all the oil and gas companies holding those 1998-1999 leases. 
   However, the Bush administration has consistently opposed our efforts to bring every oil company holding one of these leases back to the negotiating table and it continues to oppose the provisions in H.R. 6 that would do so. Instead, the Bush administration has argued that we should allow oil companies to ``voluntarily'' renegotiate with the Minerals Management Service. However, of the 56 companies holding these leases, only 5 have voluntarily agreed to renegotiate. When billions of taxpayer dollars are at stake, that is simply not an acceptable rate of return. This bill says that it's time for the oil companies to stop playing Uncle Sam for Uncle Sucker. 
   Passage of H.R. 6 will allow us to begin to move in a new, clean direction on energy and put an end to the free ride that big oil has had under the Bush administration. H.R. 6 represents the beginning of a change in direction, away from subsidizing industries that don't need extra financial incentives, and towards the technologies that do need a helping hand and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his great work and for yielding, and I thank Mr. Hinchey, who has worked with me over the past 2 years to bring to the attention of the American people this issue of the fact that there is drilling going on off the shores of our public country on public lands where there are no royalties being paid, whether it is $30, $40, $50, $60, $70, or $80 a barrel. 
   Here is what President Bush said about that on April 19, 2005. ``I will tell you, with $55 oil, we don't need the incentives to oil and gas companies to explore,'' Bush said in a speech in April. 
   So what are we saying? We are saying keep your contracts. You don't have to change the contracts. Keep them. But if you want new contracts on new drilling sites, renegotiate the old contracts or pay a $9 fee. You can keep the sanctity of the old contracts, but you are not entitled to new contracts. Very simple. 
   Then, after the money is recollected, we are going to create a Renewable Energy Strategic Fund to change and put our country heading in a new direction.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill that we are considering today represents the important first step in charting a new direction for the nation's energy policy. H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, repeals the unnecessary and I wasteful tax breaks and royalty-free drilling rights for big oil and gas companies, and instead creates a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve that would invest in clean, renewable energy sources and clean alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as energy efficiency and conservation. 
   At a time when they are making record profits and American consumers are being tipped upside down at the pump we should not be giving massive subsidies and tax breaks to big oil companies. Even President Bush conceded in an April 19, 2005 Washington Post article, ``I will tell you with $55 oil we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore. *.*.* There are plenty of incentives.'' Even George Bush admits that at $55 dollars, the price of oil is enough of an incentive for oil companies to drill and they don't need the additional taxpayer subsidies that were created under the Republican Congress. Today, with H.R. 6, we are simply going to repeal the most egregious of those unnecessary incentives and tax breaks to big oil. 
   In addition, H.R. 6 will put an end to oil companies drilling for free on public land when oil prices are high. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the American taxpayers stand to lose at least $10 billion from leases issued in the late 90s that do not suspend so-called royalty relief. H.R. 6 would correct this problem by barring oil companies from purchasing new leases unless they had either renegotiated their existing faulty leases or agreed to pay a fee on the production of oil and gas from those leases. 
   Now, I have heard some Members on the other side of the aisle argue that if we were to pass the royalty relief fixes included in H.R. 6 and take back from big oil the $10 billion or more that rightfully belongs to the American people, it will violate the contracts that they are holding. That it will turn our country into Bolivia or Russia. But let me be clear--we have spoken to the top constitutional lawyers in the country and they all agree that we are on the firmest of constitutional ground. 
   The contracts that these oil companies are holding allow for the federal government to impose fees like the ones in this bill. Furthermore, the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has said time and time again that including a condition in new oil and gas leases to exclude oil companies that have not renegotiated their faulty leases would not abrogate existing contracts or 
   constitute a takings. All H.R. 6 does is give these big oil companies a choice--they can continue producing royalty-free oil no matter how high the price of oil climbs, that's fine, but then they're not going to get any new leases from the Federal Government. 
   And more than that, this House has already adopted the royalty relief fixes included in H.R. 6 by overwhelming, bipartisan votes. Many of my Republican colleagues voted for both of those provisions. The House adopted the Markey-Hinchey amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to provide an incentive for these companies to renegotiate by suspending their ability to bid on new leases by a vote of 252-165. The House also voted last year to impose a $9 per barrel fee on oil produced from these leases in a bill authored by former Resources Chairman Pombo. That Pombo fee is this bill, and the Markey-Hinchey suspension on bidding for new leases is also there as an alternative. So, this is something that the House has already voted to do two times. Two times, this House has said that we want to put real pressure on all the oil and gas companies holding those 1998-1999 leases to renegotiate. 
   However, the Bush Administration has consistently opposed our efforts to bring every oil  company holding one of these leases back to the negotiating table and it continues to oppose the provisions in H.R. 6 that would do so. Instead, the Bush Administration has argued that we should allow oil companies to ``voluntarily'' renegotiate with the Minerals Management Service. However, of the 56 companies holding these leases, only 5 have voluntarily agreed to renegotiate. When billions of taxpayer dollars are at stake, that is simply not an acceptable rate of return. H.R. 6 says that it is time for the oil companies to stop playing Uncle Sam for Uncle Sucker. 
   According to an Interior Department's Inspector General's report that came out today, senior officials at the Minerals Management Service have known about these faulty leases for nearly three years, yet sat idly by and did absolutely nothing while big oil companies failed to pay nearly $1 billion in royalties that rightfully belonged to the American people. If the allegations in the IG's report are true, top Bush Administration officials have aided and abetted one of the greatest heists in history. We should not now leave those same officials in charge of getting oil companies to ``voluntarily'' renegotiate those same leases. 
   Finally today, as part of the first 100 hours, we are starting the comprehensive debate about our nation's energy policy that we should have been having over the last 6 years. Finally today, we are beginning to talk about how we can radically increase the amount of renewable fuels such as ethanol we consume in the country. Finally today, we are beginning to talk on the Floor of the People's House about how to make our appliances or our buildings or our vehicles more energy efficient so that we can reduce our consumption of foreign oil and our emissions of greenhouse gasses. 
   Adopting H.R. 6 will allow us to begin to move in a new, clean direction on energy and put an end to the free ride that big oil has had under the Bush Administration. This bill is a beginning. It is the beginning of a change in direction, away from subsidizing an industry that doesn't need extra financial incentives, and towards the technologies that do need a helping hand. Today, we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we can tap to help American consumers in the event of another Middle East oil embargo or crisis. But with this bill we create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, that we can tap to ensure that America can move towards energy independence. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, this debate marks the beginning of the end of the ill-conceived, mismanaged and ultimately failed war in Iraq. The war in Iraq was launched on the basis of false and misleading intelligence about a nonexistent nuclear weapons program. When the inspectors looked for nuclear weapons in all the most likely places, there was nothing there. When they looked in all the unlikely places, there was nothing there. When this was reported to the world, the world said ``don't invade.'' But when this was reported to the President of the United States, he chose to invade Iraq. In other words, the President did the opposite of what the evidence would dictate. 
   Here we are, 4 years after the invasion. The American people looked at the facts on the ground in Iraq and voted in November to de-escalate. The generals looked at the situation and said de-escalate. The Iraq Study Group analyzed our options and said we should de-escalate. 
   So what has the President of the United States decided? After all the evidence, he has chosen to escalate the war. Once again, our President is doing the opposite of what the evidence and common sense dictates. 
   Our troops continue to fight heroically to prevent Iraq from sliding into anarchy, but they are losing ground to a deep emotional cycle of religious strife and revenge that goes back 14 centuries. Our soldiers cannot be beaten on the military battlefield, but neither should they be faulted for failing to drain a political swamp. 
   The American people are now speaking out with one clear voice, in frustration and in anger, demanding change, demanding a new direction in Iraq. But the President isn't giving us a new direction. All he has to offer is more of the same, an escalation of our troop presence in Iraq. And this escalation ignores the recommendation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which said that all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq by the beginning of 2008. 
   This week, we have a choice: We can say no to the President's failed war in Iraq, we can say no to the President's escalation, and we can say no to the unnecessary loss of another American soldier, marine or airman; or we can once again vote to stay the course and to continue on with this failed policy. 
   Many Americans have expressed frustration that the resolution we vote on this week is a nonbinding resolution, and I understand that frustration. On January 9, Senator Kennedy and I introduced companion bills in the Senate and House to block President Bush's new plan to escalate troop levels in Iraq. Our legislation would prevent the obligation or expenditure of a single dollar to increase the number of troops in Iraq unless Congress affirmatively voted to do so. 
   But I would not dismiss this resolution's importance simply because it is nonbinding. Twenty-four years ago, this House took up another nonbinding resolution when it first debated my nuclear freeze resolution. We passed the nuclear freeze on the floor of the House. It was nonbinding and it never passed the Senate. But it nevertheless changed the course of this Nation's nuclear weapons policy. It did so because of the pressure it put on the White House to change, and it was followed by binding legislation that halted tests of anti-satellite weapons, cut funding for Star Wars and cut in half the plan size of the MX missile force. 
   That is why I fully understand why some Republican Members have simultaneously denounced this resolution as silly and unserious, and, at the same time, have tried to prevent its passage. Why are they afraid of a nonbinding resolution? Because this resolution exposes the lack of support in the Congress for the President's escalation scheme. 
   The administration's failed strategy has already ended any chance of a successful short-term outcome. The just-released, deeply pessimistic National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq simply confirms this situation. 
   We are in the middle of a sectarian religious civil war in Iraq, and the presence of our troops is preventing the Iraqi people from taking responsibility for their own security and for their own political solution that must follow. 
   This war should never have been fought, period. It was a mistake, the American people know it was a mistake, our military leaders know it was a mistake and a bipartisan majority in the United States Congress know it was a mistake.     
   Let's pass this resolution and send a strong signal to the Bush administration that it is time to stop the escalation, bring this war to an end, and bring our troops home. I urge adoption of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 556, the National Security FIRST Act, introduced by the Gentlelady from New York, Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY. 
   A year ago, a secretive committee at the Treasury Department that most Americans had never heard of approved a transaction to give a company owned by the United Arab Emirates control over terminal operations at 6 major U.S. ports. 
   The decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--or CFIUS--to approve this purchase by Dubai Ports World shined a bright light on an obscure committee and the process it uses to make decisions that can have important consequences for the security of our country. 
   Clearly, the Dubai Ports World transaction did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. The 9/11 Commission had identified the government of the UAE--the same entity that would own the terminals at major U.S. ports--as a ``persistent counterterrorism problem''. Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE. The 9/11 Commission concluded that the UAE banking system was used as a conduit for funds for the September 11th attacks. 
   Moreover, the UAE was a key transfer point for illegal shipments of nuclear components to Iran, North Korea and Libya. The UAE was one of only three nations to recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban government and still does not recognize the State of Israel. 
   Despite all of these warning signs, the proposed port deal did not even lead the Bush Administration to conduct a 45-day investigation, which is provided in current law and should have been interpreted as being mandatory when foreign governments--whether involving the UAE, the UK, the Ukraine or any other nation--seek mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions that could affect U.S. national security. 
   Public outrage ultimately sunk the Dubai deal. Last March, Dubai Ports World agreed to divest itself of the U.S. port operations involved in the transaction, and AIG purchased these assets earlier this month. 
   I commend Congresswoman MALONEY for crafting this strong legislation. It closes the loopholes that had, unbelievably, allowed commerce to trump commonsense. Specifically, this bill requires that a transaction involving foreign governments receive extra scrutiny by mandating that the chairman and vice-chairman of CFIUS certify that the transaction poses no national security threat or the transaction must be subjected to a second-stage 45-day national security investigation; ensures that senior level officials are held accountable for CFIUS decisions by requiring that the chairman and vice chairman of CFIUS approve all transactions where CFIUS consideration is completed within the 30-day review period and mandating that the president approve all transactions that have been subjected to the second-stage 45-day national security investigation; and provides for much-needed congressional oversight by requiring CFIUS to report to the congressional committees of jurisdiction within five days after the final action on a CFIUS investigation. CFIUS also must file semi-annual reports to Congress that contain information on transactions handled by the committee during the previous six months. 
   Passage of this bill is an important step towards making our country safer. As we continue to learn the lessons of the Dubai Ports World transaction, we also must push forward with efforts to require that all shipping containers are scanned for nuclear bombs before they leave foreign countries bound for our shores and sealed to prevent tampering en route. 
   The 100 percent scanning mandate was included in the 9/11 Commission recommendations bill that passed the House last month on a bi-partisan basis. As the other body considers its version of the bill, this vital provision should be retained. In New York Times columnist Frank Rich's piece last Sunday, he reported that the former head of the C.I.A. bin  Laden unit, Michael Scheuer has stated that the Taliban and Al Qaeda, having regrouped in Afghanistan and Pakistan, are ``going to detonate a nuclear device inside the United States.'' 
   Mr. Scheuer is not alone in making this assessment. Harvard University arms control expert Graham Allison has said that ``more likely than not'' there will be a terrorist attack using a nuclear bomb in our country. He has described the detonation of a nuclear explosive device in a cargo container in one of our ports as a nightmare scenario for our nation. 
   Port security expert and former Coast Guard officer Stephen Flynn has written about the ``catastrophic consequences of terror in a box'' that would result if a nuclear device hidden in a cargo container were donated in our country. Admiral James Loy, the former Coast Guard commandant and former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, has said that there is evidence that al Qaeda terrorists are already involved in the maritime trades. 
   Through the Secure Freight Initiative, the Bush Administration has begun the process of establishing pilot programs overseas to test the feasibility and effectiveness of scanning all U.S.-bound containers before they are loaded onto container ships headed to our country. 
   The provision in the 9/11 Recommendations bill that Congressman NADLER and I authored would require that lessons learned during the Secure Freight Initiative are incorporated into a comprehensive 100 percent scanning and sealing policy for every container headed to our country. Our provision contains a sensible time frame--3 years for large overseas ports and 5 years for smaller ones--to implement the 100 percent scanning mandate. 
   Dubai Ports World--the same company that triggered the reform process that led us to consideration of the legislation before us today--is planning to incorporate the capability to perform 100 percent scanning at its operations overseas. 
   We have the technology. We know the risks. We need to take action to require 100 percent scanning and sealing of all U.S. bound cargo containers OVERSEAS, before they arrive at our shores. If we detect a nuclear bomb in a container once it arrives at a U.S. port, it's too late. Once again, I commend the gentlelady from New York for her leadership on this important issue, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman from Vermont. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic day. It is the day when we begin to take seriously the issue of energy dependency and the issue of global warming. 
   The legislation that we have before us today is the culmination of a vision which Speaker Pelosi had as she was sworn in almost 1 year ago. She announced at that time that her goal was to make a huge down payment on the issue of energy independence and global warming. Today, we vote to pass the legislation which will send a signal not only to the citizens of our country but to the citizens of the world that our Nation is now serious about these issues.     
   I want to compliment Chairman John Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee for his statesmanship and leadership on these issues throughout this year. 
   I want to compliment all of the Members on both sides who have worked so hard to bring us to this point. It has not been easy. 
   For this decade, I have worked very hard in order to raise by 10 miles per gallon the fuel economy standard of the vehicles of our country. Back in 1985 we reached a peak of about 27 miles per gallon. Since that time, we have gone backwards. In fact, during that period of time we have actually seen an increase in America's dependence on imported oil go from 27 percent of the oil which we consume in our country to 61 percent of the oil that we consume in our country. That is since 1985. And that has sent the wrong signal to OPEC and to the rest of the world. 
   Today, in this legislation, we increase to 35 miles per gallon the fuel economy standard of the vehicles that we are going to drive by the year 2020. In conjunction with the cellulosic fuel component, the biofuel component that is built into this legislation, by the year 2030 this bill will back out the equivalent of twice the amount of oil which we import from the Persian Gulf today. 
   What we have today, is this whirlpool within which the United States has caught itself where we send nearly $150 million a day to the Persian Gulf to purchase the 2.2 million barrels per day that we import out of the Persian Gulf to bring to the United States. That is $55 to $60 billion a year that we are sending over to parts of the world which we should have no business in. And caught in that whirlpool are our young men and women in our military who are over in the Middle East protecting this oil supply so it can come to our country. 
   And for the first time the American people are now going to be made part of this effort. We no longer are going to pretend that the efficiency of the vehicles which Americans drive has no relationship to this amount of money that we send to the Middle East and the number of troops that we have to send to the Middle East. 
   So this is going to be a very powerful message: 2.7 million barrels of oil a day from the Middle East not having to be imported by the year 2030 because of the increase in fuel economy standards; 1.8 million barrels of oil per day in equivalence of oil in now biofuels, cellulosic fuels, that will substitute for the oil that we otherwise would have to import from the Middle East. 
   Together that is over 4 million barrels of oil a day equivalent. What a tremendous victory for the American people here today. Everyone in our country will now be part of it. Rather than in the Middle East, we will produce the fuels in the Middle West in our country and stop pretending that we can't improve the efficiency of the vehicles we drive. 
   Secondly, this legislation will in fact reduce by nearly a quarter all of the greenhouse gases that the United States has to meet as a goal by the year 2030. So on climate change, energy efficiency will play a huge role in reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that the United States sends up into the atmosphere. The buildings will be greener. The lighting and appliances will be better. And because of fuel efficiency and renewable fuels, we will reduce by the amount of 100 coal-fired plants the amount of greenhouse gases we will send up into the atmosphere. What a victory. What a day the United States Congress will enjoy today. 
   I congratulate Speaker Pelosi for her work on this legislation. I congratulate my colleague Todd Platts, and all of the Members who have worked on it. I salute President Bush for saying that he will sign this legislation. It is an historic signal. And I urge all of the Members who are here to realize that this is a moment that will be remembered forever as the energy revolution day, as the climate change revolutionary day where we changed course and sent a signal to the world that we mean business. 
   So, ladies and gentlemen, please today vote ``aye'' and join with Speaker Pelosi, with Harry Reid and President Bush in this effort to change the direction of our country. It is a monumental day.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, over the past 7 years, I have labored to increase the fuel economy standards of our cars and light truck fleets, and am gratified that the day has finally come where the fruits of my labor will be realized. Over 7 years, there are countless individuals, Members of Congress, environmental, consumer, and religious organizations who have labored alongside me--these people are too numerous to mention. I thank all of them for their important contributions. But I would also like to thank several in particular. 
   First, former Congressman Sherwood Boehlert, R-NY, who for six years was my partner in the House, advocating tirelessly, often against the wishes of his party's leadership, to move this issue forward. Second, Dan Becker, an environmental consultant, who has made raising fuel economy standards his life's work and who worked with my office in the trenches back when the trenches were a very lonely place to be! Finally, Securing America's Future Energy and the Energy Security Leadership Council, who brought together retired military officials and corporate CEOs to highlight the national and economic security dangers associated with our growing dependence on imported oil, and who played a critical role in developing more widespread support for these provisions. 
   As the principal House proponent of the fuel economy Title in this legislation, I also wish to briefly discuss several of its provisions in order to more fully explain the statutory language and to provide context for what we are accomplishing with this historic energy bill. 
   Section 3 of the bill states: ``Except to the extent expressly provided in this Act, or in an amendment made by this Act, nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this act supersedes, limits the authority or responsibility conferred by, or authorizes any violation of any provision of law (including a regulation), including any energy or environmental law or regulation.'' 
   The laws and regulations referred to in section 3 include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act and any regulations promulgated under Clean Air Act authority. It is the intent of Congress to fully preserve existing federal and State authority under the Clean Air Act. 
   In addition, Congress does not intend, by including provisions in Title I of the bill that reform and alter the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to increase fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, non-passenger automobiles, work trucks, and medium and heavy duty trucks, to in any way supersede or limit the authority and/or responsibility conferred by sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act. For section 202 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to the authority and responsibility affirmed by the Supreme Court's April 2, 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, No. 05-1120. For sections 177 and 209 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to the authority affirmed by the September 12, 2007 decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont in Green Mountain Chrysler Dodge Jeep et al. v. Crombie et al., No. 2:05-cv-302, and the December 11, 2007 decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California in Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. et al. v. Goldstone, et al., No. 1:04-cv-06663-AWIGSA. 
   Although Senators LEVIN, INOUYE and FEINSTEIN, in a December 13, 2007 colloquy, agreed that it was the ``intent of this bill that any regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency be consistent with the direction of Congress in this legislation and regulations issued by the Department of Transportation to implement this legislation,'' in fact this legislation includes no statutory requirement that would compel the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt regulations that are consistent with those promulgated by the Department of Transportation. I would also note that in a subsequent colloquy, Senator INOUYE stated that ``the DOT and the EPA have separate missions that should be executed fully and responsibly,'' and Senator FEINSTEIN stated that ``Importantly, the separate authority and responsibility of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is in no manner affected by this legislation as plainly provided for in Section 3 of the bill addressing the relationship of H.R. 6 to other laws.'' 
   Title I of the bill addresses CAFE standards. Section 102(a) would require that the fleet of new passenger and non-passenger vehicles made for sale in model year 2020 reach a fleet-wide fuel economy average of at least 35 miles per gallon, regardless of shifts in the market or any other consideration. While fuel economy standards for each of model years 2011-2019 are expected to be the maximum feasible standard, this section does not allow the Department of Transportation, DOT, to set a fleet-wide average of lower than 35 miles per gallon for model year 2020 under any circumstances. In addition, if the maximum feasible level for model year 2020 is higher than 35 miles per gallon due to technological progress and/or other factors, Congress intends to require DOT to set standards at the maximum feasible level. 
   It is also the intent of this section to require DOT to set interim standards between 2011 and 2019 to make rapid and consistent annual progress towards achieving the 35 mpg minimum by 2020. In asking for ``ratable'' progress, the intent of Congress is to seek relatively consistent proportional increases in fuel economy standards each year, such that no single year through 2020 should experience a significantly higher increase than the previous year. 
   Section 104 addresses credit trading among and within automakers' vehicle fleets and is intended to increase flexibility for automakers, but it is the intent of Congress that any trading not in any way reduce the oil savings achieved by the standards set for any year under this title. 
   Section 105 is intended to provide added information for consumers, but is not intended to in any way interfere with or diminish EPA labeling authority. Congress intends that DOT work closely with EPA in fulfilling the requirements of this section. 
   Section 106 is intended to clarify that Title I does not impact fuel economy standards or the standard-setting process for vehicles manufactured before model year 2011. This section is not intended to codify, or otherwise support or reject, any standards applying before model year 2011 , and is not intended to reverse, supersede, overrule, or in any way limit the November 15, 2007 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, No. 06-71891. 
   Section 109 makes modifications to the cap on the credits allowed to manufacturers making dual-fuel vehicles to ensure that the dual-fuel vehicle credit program is phased out and is fully and permanently eliminated by 2020 and thereafter. 
   I urge the Secretary to pay careful heed to the intent and spirit of these provisions in carrying out the provisions of this Title, so that we achieve this legislation's goals of increasing the fuel efficiency of our cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman from West Virginia, and I thank him for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and for the legislation he's bringing out here on the House floor, especially with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) for his work on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, right now we are facing an energy crisis. The Bush administration and Republicans in Congress are perpetuating a myth that the oil companies don't have access to enough places to drill for oil. This story is nothing more than a drilling decoy. We might as well put an aquarium out here in the well, there are so many red herrings that the Republicans are throwing into this debate about our energy independence. 
   Roughly 80 percent of all of the oil and gas are located in areas where drilling is already allowed, 68 million acres, 80 percent of the resources in America. So ExxonMobil, everybody in America pulling into the ExxonMobil station. They made $40 billion last year. Do you know what they did with their $40 billion? They put $32 billion of it back into buying their own stock. They were drilling for profits in their own stock, not on the lands where America wants them to go to find the oil and gas, where they are already permitted. 
   Now, what did they do on renewables, ExxonMobil? They took $10 million, million dollars, just millions of dollars, 10 million, and put it into renewables. Do you know what else the oil industry is doing and the Bush administration and the Republican Congress? They're blocking the tax breaks still today for renewables, for solar, for wind, for geothermal, blocking them. 
   So there is their agenda: Tip the consumer upside down at the pump, keep the supply of oil down because they're not drilling on the 80 percent of the land where we say they could go, even offshore, and go and drill; pocket the profits for themselves; nickle and dime renewables; and then block the tax breaks for a renewable energy revolution in America. It's a recipe for disaster. But there is no mistake why we are here. You cannot have an oil and gas President and Vice President for 8 years and not have an oil and gas strategy for America. And the price that we are paying at the pump is the price we are paying for allowing that policy to be implemented for these 8 long years. 
   So, ladies and gentlemen, we have 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, 2 percent. We consume 25 percent of the oil, which we consume on a daily basis. Republicans are saying let's drill off the beaches, let's drill where the polar bear is, although they are not willing today to put a penalty for the oil industry for not drilling where the 80 percent of oil is. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big mistake. 
   OPEC has two-thirds of the oil in the world. That's their strength. Rather than sending a message to OPEC, we are going to innovate our way out of this with wind and solar and renewable energy sources. The Republicans are  blocking the tax breaks for that and saying give bigger profits to oil and gas, don't penalize them for not drilling for the oil and gas here in America where we have access to it, and then go home on the 4th of July and pretend as though this 8 years of Republican rule where we have gone from $30 a barrel to $130 a barrel is not on their watch. It is, ladies and gentlemen. We have gone from 46 percent dependence on imported oil on the day the Republicans took over Congress to 61 percent dependence upon imported oil on the day they left office 1 year ago. That's why we are in the mess that we're in right now. 
   The American public needs help. We need to send a message to Big Oil, to Big Gas: Start drilling. Start drilling right now or lose the leases that the American people have given you. Do not warehouse these leases. Do not warehouse the oil and gas here in America. Let's put the penalty on them. Let us no longer have the policies set by Big Oil, by Big Gas, and OPEC. Let us today declare independence from them. Let us say we are taking those leases back from you. We are taking back the American land where oil and gas is. If you don't drill on it, you lose it, and we are going to penalize you for allowing this crisis to build to the point that it has today. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, support the Rahall bill. This is the day where we begin to break and create our own independence from Big Oil in our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the chairman so much, and I congratulate him on his superior work on this legislation. 
   In the year 2000, a new thing happened in regulation because of a Republican-controlled Congress. It passed a massive deregulatory bill into law. This bill included the so-called ``Enron loophole,'' named after the now-notorious energy trading firm that had lobbied for its creation. This loophole is being exploited. It has not been fixed. As a result, the bill that we are debating today directs the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to examine excessive oil speculation and use their emergency powers to take corrective action. 
   The CFTC simply has not been as aggressive as it should be in policing these markets. Part of the problem stems from the limited resources which the Bush administration have given them, but another part of the problem is that the CFTC has historically been a reluctant regulator. Instead of a commodities markets watchdog, it has been an industry lapdog, unwilling to use the full authorities that it does have to crack down on excessive speculation. 
   This bill tells them to use their authorities to more aggressively police the energy futures market from manipulation for fraud, for excessive speculation. This is a good step. 
   An ``aye'' vote on the Collin Peterson bill is essential to protecting the public from being tipped upside down and having money shaken out of their pocket.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, from 1995 until 2006, the Republican Party controlled the House of Representatives, and since January of 2001, they've controlled the White House as well. During this period, the leadership of the Republican Party in the Congress and in the White House have pumped literally billions of dollars of unnecessary subsidies into the pockets of Big Oil, tens of billions of dollars. 
   They voted for royalty-free drilling for the biggest oil companies on offshore public lands. They've opposed all efforts to repeal billions in tax breaks for Big Oil. And in the 12 years they controlled the Congress up until the beginning of last year, they opposed high fuel economy standards for the vehicles which we drive in America so we could back out that oil that we import from the Persian Gulf. 
   GOP used to stand for ``Grand Old Party,'' but now it stands for ``Gas and Oil Party.''     
   Here's what the President said about giving incentives to Big Oil in 2005. He said, ``I will tell you, with $55 oil, we don't need incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore. There are plenty of incentives for the oil industry.'' That's George Bush, April 2005 at $55 a barrel. Today, it's at $119 a barrel. But the Republicans, you know, they just can't kick a bad habit. Offering subsidies to Big Oil to drill is like subsidizing fish to swim, you just don't need to do it. They have all the incentives which they need right now. So the Democratic Party, assuming office just a year ago, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, she said, we're going to put a stop-payment order on these unnecessary subsidies to Big Oil. 
   Last December, we passed the first increase in fuel efficiency standards in 35 years, increasing it to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. We increased the renewable fuel standard to 36 billion gallons, but the Republican opposition made it impossible for us to take the $18 billion in excessive and unnecessary tax breaks away from the oil company and to transfer it to the solar and to the wind and to the renewable energy industry. So we're taking that bill up again this year. The Republicans oppose it. They're saying, keep the tax breaks for Big Oil. Keep them away from the wind and the solar industry. 
   They have no solutions for the 21st century. They have no plan to wean America off of this increased oil dependency. We have gone up from 27 percent dependency to 61 percent dependency upon imported oil in just the last 20 years. This Republican policy is going to make us less secure, more financially dependent upon the Middle East, and it is going to cause an economic and national security catastrophe for our country.

   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman from Vermont very much. 
   We welcome this debate. We welcome a debate on the Bush-Republican energy policy. Let's begin with a brief review of where the price of oil was back when President Bush was sworn in as President. It was $27 a barrel. That is what President Clinton, that is what  Vice President Gore, handed over to President Bush, $27 a barrel oil. Now let's look at what the price of a barrel of oil was yesterday: $119 a barrel for oil. So President Bush and Vice President Cheney, they might not know a lot about other issues, but you would think oil policy they would understand. 
   Well, this is what you get after 8 years of a Bush-Cheney Presidency, abetted and aided for 6 of those years by a Republican Congress. 
   Let's even take it further. Let's take it to the next step. Let's look at oil company profits. Let's just take the big five oil companies in the United States, led by ExxonMobil. Well, the cumulative profits of all five companies in 2001 was $37 billion. All five of the big oil companies cumulatively made $37 billion. 
   Now let's look at last year. Last year, those five oil companies made $123 billion in profits. And ExxonMobil alone made $42 billion, the largest profit of any corporation in American history, exceeding the total amount of all of those oil companies' profits in 2001. 
   So what has happened after 8 years of the Bush-Cheney administration is that they have allowed Big Oil and OPEC to take the American consumer and tip him upside down at the gasoline pump every single day, shaking money out of their pockets. 
   And looking over at this strategic asset that was built by the American people, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now has 700 million barrels of oil in it, as the American people say to the President, please deploy this weapon which the American people have to protect the American economy and the American consumer.

   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   The Bush administration continues to purchase 70,000 barrels of oil a day from Big Oil and OPEC. They are doing it today, buying it at $119 a barrel, buying it today, even though it makes no economic sense. We shouldn't be contributing to this speculation, which is driving up the price of oil. Instead, what the Bush administration should be doing is taking some of that Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the 700 million barrel asset, and beginning to deploy it as a weapon against the speculators who are driving the price of oil up and driving our economy into the ground. 
   The Bush administration won't do either. They won't stop buying oil at $119 a barrel and they won't at the same time use this asset now that is supposed to be there to protect the health of the American economy and deploying it in a way which, I will tell you, it will prick the speculative bubble almost immediately and begin to drive down the price of oil. That is only something that the President can do, if he determines that there is an economic emergency in our country, if he believes that our country is being adversely affected by high energy prices. That is a decision that can only be made in the Oval Office. 
   Obviously, the Bush administration, having seen the price rise from $27 a barrel to $119 a barrel, still does not believe that we are absent any energy policy, still believes that it is a free market and that OPEC and big oil are operating in a free market and that is just the natural price of oil. 
   But here is the interesting testimony before the Select Committee on Energy Independence last week.

   Mr. MARKEY. When I asked the number two executive at ExxonMobil what he was doing with his $42 billion worth of profits last year in terms of investing in renewable energy resources, the CEO said that he was going to invest $10 million in renewable energy resources. $42 billion worth of profit, $10 million going into renewable energy resources. 
   When I said to him, you know, the Bush administration and the Republican Congress gave you $18 billion worth of additional tax breaks 3 years ago and now at $119 a barrel you don't need them anymore, can we take those and give them as tax breaks for renewable energy resources, all of the oil executives said, no, we want the tax breaks. We don't want that to go over to renewables. And, secondly, we love our profits, and we are not going to invest them in renewables.

   Mr. MARKEY. That is a recipe for continued abject subservience to this oil industry and to OPEC. The President has to get aggressive on deploying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, stopping his policy of buying $119 barrel oil, 70,000 barrels a day from OPEC and Big Oil. Secondly, we need a new policy on getting aggressive on renewable energy, which the Republican majority for 12 years and the Bush White House has turned a blind eye to.

   This bill almost doubles the funding for real nuclear nonproliferation programs, both in the former Soviet Union and around the world, adding close to $1 billion for the most effective programs.

We are here only because of their leadership. 
   Secondly, while the President wants to build thousands of new warheads at a price tag of up to $100 billion, this bill puts a brake on the Reliable Replacement Warhead program and it demands an explanation of why the United States needs to build thousands of new nuclear weapons even as we are, with agreements with the Russians, trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world.

   While the rest of the world knows that carbon dioxide threatens the planet, this administration can't even decide if it endangers the planet. 
   President Bush's response is not action, but talk. Instead of stopping the pollution, he starts a filibuster. 
   President Bush has decided to host a conversation to discuss his aspiration for procrastination on global warming until he leaves office. It is time for America to save the planet from another 50 years of red, white and blue CO

   We have no choice. The ice is melting. The coral is dying. The forests are burning, and 30 percent of all species are in danger of extinction. 
   President Bush, it is time to stop the empty rhetoric and to start saving the planet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman from Illinois, and for his leadership on this bill, and the gentleman from Michigan. The bill before us today would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish wholesale or retail sale of gasoline or other petroleum distillates at prices that are unconscionably excessive or take unfair advantage of consumers during any presidentially declared national or regional energy emergency. 
   Now, we hear from the Republicans, don't interfere in the free market. Don't touch the free market. Don't have the Federal Government getting in on the side of the consumers. It's just a matter of supply and demand. That's what the Republicans are arguing. Don't interfere with the free market, even if it goes up to $3.20 a gallon for gasoline, $3.80 a gallon for gasoline, $4 a gallon for gasoline. Don't let the Federal Government help out the consumer. 
   You know what? The Republicans are right. It is a matter of supply and demand. Consumers are forced to supply whatever money the oil companies demand from the consumers. The oil companies have the consumer over a barrel, a barrel of oil that the oil companies control and that they price. They price it wherever they want to put it. 
   They tip the consumer upside down, the oil companies do, and they shake money out of the pockets of consumers at the pump. The Christians had a better chance against the lions than the consumer has against the oil companies at the pumps in the United States today. 
   All we are saying is let's give the Federal Government a sword to get into the battle in the arena on behalf of the consumers in America. And the Republicans are saying, we don't want to arm the Federal Trade Commission so they can help the consumers so that they are not tipped upside down. It is clear that high gas prices are hitting families hard, but they are also causing our economy to stall and to sputter like a jalopy. 
   The bill before us today addresses one potential cause of high prices: price gouging by the oil companies. It sends a signal to oil companies that there will now be a regulator out there that has been empowered to take action when unconscionably high prices are being charged. 
   The free market, I don't think so. I think that when we look at this oil market, we understand that the consumer is at the whim of the oil companies.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. When the markets go up, Wall Street cleans up. When the markets go down, Main Street gets cleaned out. 
   Nobody wants to do this. Nobody wants to clean up the mess created by Wall Street recklessness. Nobody thinks this is perfect. But, if we don't act now, we won't just punish Wall Street, but punish innocent people on Main Street who will get cleaned out. 
   This is the greatest threat to those people since the Great Depression. This bill, because of Barney Frank, protects taxpayers, prevents golden parachutes, and limits excessive CEO compensation, helps prevent home foreclosures, provides strong, independent oversight and transparency. Not just Main Street, but the whole world is looking at us. Our very system of capitalism is under assault. 
   We must pass this today. We must give support to this. We must protect Main Street across this entire country. Vote ``yes'' on this protection of citizens of our country.  
   I rise in support of this bill. 
   After careful consideration of the bill to provide emergency assistance to stabilize our economy, I have decided to support this bill. 
   For years, I have fought hard for tougher oversight and regulation of Wall Street. I fought for tougher laws against insider trading, market manipulation, and other financial fraud; I fought to give the SEC expanded powers to obtain risk assessment reports regarding the risks posed by derivatives and other risky investments; I fought against efforts to deregulate Wall Street and make it tougher for defrauded investors to sue the scam artists who have ripped them off. 
   But 12 years of Republican-led deregulation and lax controls have fueled Wall Street's greed and recklessness in an inexcusable manner. I don't like having to vote for this kind of legislation. Still, I believe that a failure to act now wouldn't merely punish Wall Street, but also would put hardworking Americans at risk of losing their homes, their jobs, and their savings. 
   When the Bush administration presented its plan to Congress a week ago, I believed it did not contain the safeguards needed to protect taxpayers from billions of dollars in losses that could result from this rescue plan. 
   But over the past week, as a result of round-the-clock negotiations with the Bush Administration, essential taxpayer protections were added. For example, the plan now: 
   Protects taxpayers by requiring a plan for full repayment of all funds used to assist troubled financial firms; 
   Helps prevent home foreclosures by granting the Government authority to work with loan servicers to change the terms of mortgages to keep Americans in their homes; 
   Prevents golden parachutes by limiting excessive compensation for CEOs and executives of firms selling assets to the Government as part of the plan; 
   Creates strong, independent oversight and transparency to prevent waste and fraud and protect taxpayers. 
   I believe that failure to take action now would mean considerable risk of serious economic pain for America. The pain would not be limited to Wall Street bankers who made risky bets that didn't pay off. 
   Without relief now, Americans across the country struggling to pay their mortgages would be at greater risk of losing their homes. Responsible companies seeking credit to keep their businesses afloat already have seen financing dry up--if the Government fails to intervene now, more companies could close their doors, putting more Americans out of work. 
   The bill provides tough oversight and commits Congress and the President to the principle that whatever the ultimate cost is, it will be borne by the financial services industry directly, not taxpayers in general. 
   Our economy is facing the biggest Wall Street crisis since the Great Depression. Congress must respond to stop further declines that could wipe out savings accounts and hurt everyday Americans around the country if the crisis spreads even further. 
   Our entire economy depends on this critical legislation, but the taxpayers should not be on the hook to pay for risky business on Wall Street and lax oversight by the Bush administration. The taxpayers' insurance guarantee in the bill is one of the many taxpayer protections Democrats included to improve the original Bush-Paulson plan to stabilize American financial markets. 
   I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Commerce be discharged from further consideration of the Senate bill (S. 1492) to improve the quality of Federal and State data regarding the availability and quality of broadband services and to promote the deployment of affordable broadband services to all parts of the Nation, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (BROADBAND DATA IMPROVEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1492, the Broadband Data Improvement Act. This is companion legislation to H.R. 3919, the Broadband Census of America Act of 2007, which passed the House unanimously last November. 
   Madam Speaker, an overarching telecommunications policy goal for the United States is achieving ubiquitously available, competitive, high speed, affordable broadband service for all Americans. Such broadband service capability is indispensable to various aspects of the United States economy, including public safety, education, entrepreneurial investment, innovation, job creation, health care delivery and energy efficiency. 
   The ability of the United States to promote and achieve a competitive, high speed broadband infrastructure will also be a key factor in determining our nation's success in the fiercely competitive global economy. International competitors to the United States are achieving progress in broadband deployment and adoption. Many countries have broadband service capability superior to the United States in terms of choice, speed, and price. 
   For the United States, offering broadband service capability at ever higher transmission speeds could spur new growth and investment in cutting-edge applications, services, and technologies that utilize higher bandwidth functionality. 
   The Senate bill contains several provisions which directly stem from H.R. 3919, including the international comparison and the consumer survey. While I wish the Senate bill contained the more rigorous data collection and disclosure that was contained in the House-passed bill, I believe the Senate bill makes sorely-needed progress in bolstering the data collection needed for policymakers to have a better sense of America's progress, or lack thereof, in broadband deployment, speed, and affordability. 
   Without question, ascertaining whether the Nation is achieving its broadband policy, goals has been stymied by a significant lack of data about the nature and extent of broadband service deployment and adoption throughout the country. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, in a May 2006 report, assessed the available data about broadband deployment and concluded that while such deployment is present in some form across the Nation, it remains difficult to decipher which geographic areas are un-served or underserved. Also difficult to determine is the type of service, the speed, and the price of broadband service capability available in discrete urban, suburban, and rural areas of the country. 
   More and better data about the nature and extent of broadband deployment and adoption is clearly needed and this legislation is a first step in getting the better data policymakers need. Indeed, the dearth of basic information available to the public and policymakers concerning availability, speed, price, and type of broadband service technology is highly problematic for a nation which ostensibly has competitive, affordable broadband service for every citizen as its highest telecommunications policy goal. 
   The fact that such information has not been obtained and is not readily available adversely affects the ability of policymakers to make sound decisions. For instance, the Federal Government could achieve significantly better performance from its multibillion dollar grant and subsidy programs, and effectively reform them, if better and more comprehensive data were readily available. Discerning which parts of the country are served by broadband service capability and which parts are un-served has proven elusive to policymakers. 
   This goal of this legislative effort from the start was the creation of a nationwide map of broadband data. I believe the Secretary of Commerce should create a Web site through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, depicting broadband inventory maps of all the States as outlined in the House-passed bill. The House-passed bill provides a roadmap for the ideal type of searchable map and the mechanisms by which the NTIA could achieve this objective. NTIA has authority today to pursue this worthwhile endeavor and the Bush administration should have sought to implement this idea long ago, using information readily available from public sources, from the States, from the FCC, or from industry participants or organizations themselves. At a minimum, and as a first step, the pending legislation would require that the Secretary of Commerce should create a  Web site to depict such nationwide data by including those maps created by grant recipients where appropriate. Ideally, grant recipients for State-wide efforts will be found in all the States and much of the rudimentary data to begin creating a truly robust national map can be developed at the state level and simply uploaded or linked to the Web site map or maps that NTIA creates. 
   In addition, a concomitant goal of this legislative effort from the beginning was to improve the quantity and quality of broadband data collected by and available to the Federal Communications Commission. When we began this effort, the FCC's available data was woefully inadequate with respect to broadband deployment, availability, speed, price and other metrics. Worse, the data collected was in a form that often misrepresented the reality of broadband deployment in the country. The FCC took action this year to improve the data it collects but it did not go far enough in my opinion. This legislation also does not go far enough and certainly is not as thorough and complete with respect to the collection and reporting of data as the House-passed bill. Yet it does represent additional progress. Obviously nothing in this bill is designed or should be construed to in any way limit the ability of the 
   FCC to collect better and more accurate data, or to utilize such data internally, or to publicly report such data in a way that is conducive to wise policymaking or otherwise consistent with its precedents for making non-proprietary data public. 
   Again, this bill represents an important step in developing an overarching blueprint for broadband policy in the United States. As such, it is worthy of passage. Enacting this bill will also avail lawmakers of the opportunity to jump right into developing broader legislation early next year. By not having to re-pass this measure all over again, we will be able to more immediately pursue additional concrete broadband policy proposals legislatively, including those to promote greater broadband and voice competition, to rekindle the prospects for broadband innovation, affordability, and consumer choice, and to ensure that architectural openness and consumer privacy are hallmarks of our Nation's broadband policy. 
   The legislation also includes language on Internet child safety. This is language that is similar to provisions spearheaded by our House colleague Representative MELISSA BEAN and we are pleased that her multi-year efforts have resulted in the inclusion of this language in the bill. 
   I again want to thank Mr. BARTON, Chairman DINGELL, Mr. STEARNS, and Mr. UPTON for their cooperation in working on this bill. I again want to commend Senator INOUYE and his staff, Jessica Rosenworcel, Margaret Cummisky, and Alex Hoehn-Saric, and the staff for the House Republican side, Neil Fried, David Cavicke, and Courtney Reinhard, and on the Democratic side I want to salute the excellent work of Amy Levine, Tim Powderly, Mark Seifert, and David Vogel. I urge members of the House to support the bill.  
   The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which I offer today with an amendment under suspension of the rules. This is a consensus, noncontroversial bill, and it is sponsored by our colleague, Representative Eliot Engel from the State of New York. A similar bill, sponsored by full Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Joe Barton, passed the House in the last Congress unanimously. 
   I want to commend Telecommunications and the Internet Subcommittee Ranking Member Fred Upton for his work and cooperation on this measure, and I commend full committee Chairman John Dingell for his excellent efforts on this bill as well. 
   This legislation addresses issues regarding so-called ``caller ID spoofing.'' ``Spoofing'' is when a caller masks or changes the caller ID information of their call in a way that disguises the true origination number of the caller. In many instances, a call recipient may be subject to pretexting through spoofing, which can lead to fraud, personal ID theft, harassment or otherwise put the safety of the call recipient in danger. 
   On the other hand, lest we think that spoofing always has nefarious aims, we must recognize that there may be circumstances when a person's safety may be put in danger if their true and accurate call origination information is disclosed as well. 
   For instance, Members of Congress often have direct lines in their offices in order to ensure that such lines do not become generally public and, therefore, remain useful to us. It may be necessary to keep such direct numbers confidential and have the outgoing caller ID information indicate a different number at which offices can be reached for return calls; that gives the recipient a legitimate phone number to call back, but keeps confidential lines that must remain private. 
   There are many doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers and other professionals who would similarly like to keep direct confidential lines private in this way, who have no intention of misleading anyone. 
   In addition, there may be instances, for example, when a woman at a shelter seeks to reach her children, when spoofing is important to safeguard someone's safety. Moreover, informants to law enforcement tip lines or whistle blowers have additional reasons for why their calling information should remain private. We should not outlaw any of these practices, and I think the legislation needs some improvement and clarification in these areas. 
   What we seek in caller ID policy is balance. This has been the case since we held hearings in the Telecommunications Subcommittee in the early 1990s on caller ID, when we sought to take into account emerging caller ID technology in a way that also allowed callers to block their origination number on a per call or per line basis. Technology also allowed call recipients to refuse to receive calls by anyone who is blocking their caller ID information from going through. 
   This is much-needed legislation. I urge support by all Members of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

This is a completely bipartisan piece of legislation, and we thank them for this cooperation. This is the way telecommunications legislation should be passed. 
   I would also like to commend the staff: Tim Powderly from the majority staff and Neil Fried and Courtney Reinhard from the Republican committee staff. I also want to thank Pete Goodloe and Gregg Rothschild from Mr. Dingell's staff; Cristina Batt from Mr. Engel's staff; and Colin Crowell on my staff, who has been doing this type of legislation for 17 years, going back to the beginning of the discussion of all of these caller ID-related issues. 
   And, finally, I would like to thank Johanna Shelton on her last bill on the House floor. Johanna has been incredibly competent, more than competent. She really brings the word ``excellence'' into congressional and legislative service. And this will be her last bill on the floor, and there is lamenting of a magnitude hard to fully measure on the Democratic side that her leaving is creating, although I understand her husband is not sharing that sentiment as she leaves her service here. 
   And it is that duality that we all have to deal with here in our congressional service. But for my part, there has been no more dedicated public servant that I have met in my time here in Congress, and we will miss her service, and we thank her for all of her great work. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.

   H.R. 1483 would allow for cooperation between the communities in the heritage area and the National Park Service to conserve these special places and develop increased recreational and educational opportunities for these tremendous resources. 
   I am proud to support the creation of this important new National Heritage Area, which will help preserve the unique history of New England. Sometimes we forget that the small towns and cities where we were born and live are also the birthplace of this great Nation. The Freedom's Way National Heritage Area designation will ensure that future generations will be able to visit, tour and learn about the communities in New England that shaped our young Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman very much. 
   President Bush and the Senate Republicans have been given opportunity after opportunity to pass tax credit extensions for renewable energy. In just the past year and a half, the Republican leadership has followed the marching orders of the Bush administration and voted 13 times against Democratic efforts to increase our use of renewable energy, help protect consumers from high energy prices, and ensure that Big Oil pays its fair share. They have refused time after time, instead siding with Big Oil and their fossil fuel friends even as oil prices remain sky high. 
   Now the Senate Republicans couldn't resist this time around, either, sending us a renewable energy tax package stuffed with goodies for coal-to-liquids, tar sands, and oil shale. Big Oil even gets to keep most of their tax breaks even though they're tipping consumers upside down and shaking money out of their pockets. They also want to shake them upside down as taxpayers and get more money as tax breaks from the American people. 
   The only thing renewable about Republican energy policy for the last 8 years has been their inexhaustible support for the Big Oil agenda. 
   I commend the great work of Chairman Rangel in stripping harmful and unnecessary provisions and giving us a genuine clean energy tax package to vote upon today. 
   This bill primes the renewable energy engine and gives coal a clean path forward with more than $1 billion in tax incentives to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration. This may be the last chance to get these renewable energy incentives passed into law. If President Bush and Senate Republicans shoot this package down like they've shot down every other opportunity for clean energy tax breaks, then there may not be another opportunity. 
   Solar and wind companies are delaying projects because of investment uncertainty. History has shown that renewable energy deployment could fall 70 percent or more if these tax incentives lapse. That would translate into a loss of 116,000 job opportunities and $19 billion in private investment loss in 2009 alone. That's one more legacy I fear President Bush has no problem in carrying back to Crawford, Texas: Champaign celebrations for Big Oil and red ink and pink slips for America's high tech energy companies and their green collar workers. 
   Last year in the United States, more wind capacity was installed than any other source with the exception of natural gas. Thirty-five percent of all new electrical generating capacity installed in the United States last year was wind power. 
   This year, over 40 percent of all new electrical generating capacity in the United States will be new wind power. Solar photovoltaic installations also increased an amazing 80 percent last year. 2008 will surpass that. But what about 2009? What about 2010? 
   This bill before us invests in the renewable revolution that will transform America. Electric cars, cellulosic biofuels, wind and solar will assert our energy independence over the coming decade if the President signs this bill. 
   After 8 years of running on a Bush-Cheney-Big Oil energy plan, America, it is time for an oil change. It is time for us to move off the oil agenda and move on to the solar, the wind, the biofuels. 
   The slogan for this Congress should be ``Change, baby, change!'' That is not what the Republicans are talking about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   This energy bill is truly a comprehensive energy plan. I commend the great work of the gentleman from West Virginia, Chairman Rahall, and Chairman Dingell and Chairman Miller in crafting this balanced legislation. I also want to commend Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for their leadership in pulling together what is truly a bipartisan approach that Members from all regions should be able to support. 
   The Republican leadership says that they want an ``all of the above'' energy plan. Well, today we get to see if they are serious, or if they have simply been playing politics. This energy bill is a comprehensive energy package that will protect consumers, unleash the renewable energy revolution, increase energy efficiency and conservation and even expand areas for domestic oil production. 
   While the Republican leadership and the Bush administration have said that they want ``all of the above,'' for the 6 years that they controlled the White House, the House and Senate, they did almost nothing to increase our use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. For 8 years, the two oil men in the White House crafted an energy policy that put the interests of the American Petroleum Institute over the American people, and consumers are now paying the price at the pump for that failed fossil fuel agenda. 
   One of the first actions the Bush administration took in 2001 after entering the White House was to convene the secret Cheney Energy Task Force to meet with executives from the oil industry and craft an energy policy. Then the Bush administration and the Republican Congress passed an energy bill in 2005 that gave billions of dollars to the oil and gas industries while nickel-and-diming renewables. 
   And in this Congress, the Republican leadership has followed the marching orders of the Bush administration and voted 13 times to block legislation that Democrats have brought to the floor to increase our use of renewable energy, help protect consumers from high energy prices and ensure that big oil pays its fair share. While the Republican leadership says they want ``all of the above'' they have repeatedly chosen ``none of the above'' and voted against these measures. But here they are  today, crying crocodile tears that all these policies that they have spent their entire career opposing have not been implemented. 
   The Republican leadership says they want ``all of the above,'' but here they are today, once again opposing a truly comprehensive, compromise energy bill that will not only increase our use of renewable energy but will also provide for more drilling. Perhaps that's because it's not ``all of the above'' that the Republican leadership and big oil are really concerned with, it's really only ``all that's below''--all the oil that's below our beaches 3 miles offshore, all the oil the below our national parks, all the oil that's below our most pristine wilderness areas. 
   The comprehensive energy bill that we are considering today will build on last year's tremendous energy bill accomplishment. This bill will adopt a National Renewable Electricity standard to require that 15 percent of the electricity that we generate in 2020 come from renewable sources and efficiency and will create 100,000 jobs. By further increasing the efficiency of our buildings, this comprehensive energy bill will save consumers $200 billion on energy costs. This comprehensive plan will extend the vital tax incentives for solar, wind and other renewables, and ensure that they are paid for, which will prevent the loss of $19 billion in investment and 116,000 jobs next year in these industries. And this comprehensive plan will protect more than 5 million Americans from an impending home heating crisis and an increase in the heating bill of the average family of nearly $600 this winter by funding the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
   And the Republicans say they want more offshore drilling, well this bill does that. I remain skeptical that additional offshore drilling will do anything to lower prices but this compromise bill ensures that there will be proper protections for Georges Bank off the coast of New England, which is one of our Nation's most important fisheries, and that if we are going to open more areas to drilling we first ensure that big oil cannot continue to drill for free on public land and reap billions of dollars in unnecessary tax breaks at a time when they are making record profits. With the renewable energy revolution that we will unleash with this bill it will make any additional drilling unnecessary in 20 years. 
   The comprehensive energy bill that we are considering today, combined with the energy bill that Democrats passed in December, means that Democrats in the 110th will have passed energy bills that achieve one-third of the reductions in global warming pollution needed by 2030 to save the planet and eliminate nearly twice the oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf. 
   After 8 years of running on a Bush-Cheney-Big Oil energy plan, America, it is time for an oil change! It's time to change our dependence on foreign oil and OPEC. It's time to change from the dirty fossil fuels of the past to the renewable energies of the future. It's time to change to invest in wind and solar. It's time to change to start building green to save families money. The Republicans like to say ``drill, baby, drill,'' but for our Nation's energy policy the American public is saying it's high time we started saying ``change, baby, change.'' 
   Vote ``aye.'' Vote for change.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentle lady. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is all part of an ongoing effort by the Republicans to change the subject, to have a drilling distraction, anything to get away from what their true agenda is. 
   This is something that should be opposed. What the Republicans are trying to do here should be opposed, because what this is really all about, and what they are trying to do now, is to avoid the real debate on the fact that this is a comprehensive energy plan that has been brought to the House floor, that this bill deals with renewables. It deals with conservation. It deals with all of these issues that we need to deal with. 
   We will see if they mean it when they say they want a comprehensive energy plan, because that's what we are going to be debating today, or have they been simply playing politics, which is what this motion is all about. It's intended to avoid the real debate. 
   We are going to see a lot of crocodile tears here, shed on the Republican side here, after 12 years of controlling the energy committees, after 8 years of having George Bush and DICK CHENEY in the White House, after the Department of Energy under Republican control, the crocodile tears are flowing with regard to all of their concern about our energy dependence. 
   That's what this point of order is all about. It's just another distraction, another attempt to get away from the fact that on renewable, on conservation, on efficiency they did almost nothing. It's almost 12 years that they controlled the United States Congress, until last year, in conjunction with the Bush-Cheney secret energy plan. 
   The Republicans say they want all of the above, but have they here produced a bill which is truly comprehensive? 
   No, they have not. 
   Because their plan is not all of the above. The Republican leadership, the White House, and Big Oil is really concerned with all that's below, not all of  the above, all that's below. Our beaches, 3 miles offshore, all of the oil that's below our national parks, all the oil that's below our most pristine wilderness areas, that's what they are in favor of. 
   Not all of the above, all that's below. They had 12 years controlling this institution to do something about all of the above, wind, solar, geothermal, efficiency. They did nothing. 
   All of this is just another attempt to get off the point, to have a distraction, which is why we should reject this point of order. America needs an oil change. 
   All right, we will permit some more drilling, but you also have to have a strategy for the future. They keep saying on the Republican side, drill, baby, drill. 
   What we are saying is change, baby, change. They can't change. They are still out here with the Big Oil agenda. They are still out here saying no to wind, no to solar, no to efficiency, no to geothermal, no to the future. 
   Innovate, baby, innovate. Change, baby, change. That's what this debate is all about, and that's what they are trying to do. They are trying to change the subject. They are trying to distract from the fact that they are interested in more drilling, but not a comprehensive energy plan for our country. 
   That's why it's great that we are having this debate. Because we see, once again, what they did for 12 years, distract the American public, allow ourselves to become more dependent on imported oil and then come out and try to wash their hands of their responsibilities. Vote ``aye.'' Vote for change.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6899, COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very simple debate. The Republicans are very upset that the Democrats are going to take the oil companies and make them pay taxes to the American people when they drill on the land owned by the American people, and the Democrats then want to move the money over to wind and solar and plug-in hybrids for tax breaks. So the Democrats are saying that America needs an oil change. So, as Mr. Green just said, we open up vast new areas where the oil industry can drill, drill, drill; drill, baby, drill. 
   But what we put into the bill is something else as well. We put in change, baby, change. Because we only have 3 percent of the oil in the world, we have 4 percent of the population, and we consume 25 percent of the oil in the world on a daily basis. That is not a long-term recipe. 
   So we need an oil change. And what we need to do and what we are going to do is allow them to drill in thousands and thousands of additional acres, to go for the oil, to go drill, baby, drill, but then say we need back some of those tax breaks that you don't need at $100 a barrel, $140 a barrel, $4 a gallon at the pump. We don't need to subsidize you anymore. 
   The taxpayer doesn't need to be tipped upside down and have money shaken out of their pockets as taxpayers to hand over to the oil companies, because they have already been tipped upside down and had money taken out of their pockets as consumers by the oil companies. 
   So we just take back those tax breaks, put a little bit of a tax on where they don't pay any taxes at all, and where do we shift it over to? Ladies and gentlemen, we shift it over to wind and solar and green buildings and plug-in hybrids. We shift it over to the future. We unleash a technological revolution that will break our dependence upon imported oil. 
   It is change, baby, change. It is innovate, baby, innovate. These guys are a one-note organization. They have been since two oilmen went to the White House 8 years ago. 
   Drill, baby, drill is not a long-term strategy.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (ESTHER KARINGE -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1485. I commend Chairman CONYERS, Subcommittee Chairman LOFGREN, and Representative BOUCHER for their tireless work on this most important legislation. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill we are voting on today gives Ms. Esther Karinge, a constituent in my district, an opportunity to escape persecution in Kenya and live freely with her son in the United States. 
   While living in Kenya with her uncle--a local political official--Esther and her family received harassment and death threats during a time of tremendous political unrest still present in the region. Esther left her home and sought out protection in the United States in 1994. 
   Esther's case, while strong enough on the grounds that she faced persecution or worse in Kenya, is further complicated by the fact that not long after arriving in the United States, Esther gave birth to her son Nicholas. Nicholas was born prematurely, and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and deafness. As a single parent to Nicholas, who is wheelchair bound, Esther has gone above and beyond for her now 11-year-old child, who has relied solely on his mother for survival. Because of Nicholas's perseverance, and the unconditional love and support of Esther, doctors believe that Nicholas may someday walk on his own. 
   Esther has worked hard to secure a better life for herself and her son, while becoming an important part of our community in Malden. For several years, Esther served at the Refugee Immigration Ministry in Malden, Massachusetts, as a case manager working with women who fled their countries for the same reason she did--fear of persecution. Esther also serves as a member of the board of directors for the Immigrant Learning Center, a not-for-profit offering English language classes in my district. 
   Today, we are one step closer to protecting the life of Esther, and the great potential of her son Nicholas. Again, I would like to thank Chairman CONYERS, Subcommittee Chairman LOFGREN, and Representative BOUCHER for their commitment to this body and legislation. I urge adoption of the bill.  
   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to increase some sanctions against Iran in response to it's ongoing nuclear program. One important provision, which I have fought for in my state of Massachusetts, is to grant State governments the authority to divest their funds from companies investing in Iran's petroleum sector. 
   But ladies and gentlemen, who are we kidding here? We just passed a bill which will break all the nonproliferation rules for India. And somehow we think doing that won't have any impact on our ability to prevent an Iranian bomb? 
   These policies are interconnected. 
   By breaking the rules for India, we're making it less likely that the rules will hold against Iran, or anyone else. 
   Iran is looking at the U.S.-India Nuclear Deal and they are saying, ``Where can I sign up? I want that deal!'' 
   In our efforts to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons, this bill moves us one step forward, but the India Nuclear Deal takes us 20 steps back. 
   If you want to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, you should vote for this bill, and you must vote against the U.S.-India Nuclear Deal.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill and to the U.S.-India Nuclear Deal. 
   Most people think that this is a debate about India. It is not. We are all friends of India, and we are all united in our view that the United States and India share a bright future of strong relations. This is a debate about Iran. This is a debate about North Korea, about Pakistan, about Venezuela, about any other country in the world that harbors the goal of acquiring nuclear weapons. 
   With this vote, we are shattering the nonproliferation rules. And the next three countries to march through the broken glass will be Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan. And there are others with their nose up against the window getting ready as well. Flashing a green light to India sends a dangerous signal to all of those countries because these policies are interconnected. 
   We are now seeing the devastating financial consequences of years of Wall Street recklessness. The subprime mortgage pushers pretended that the laws of supply and demand no longer applied and that home values would always go up. Well, they were wrong. The Bush administration argues that breaking the nuclear rules for India will not lead to broken rules for anyone else. The Bush administration is wrong. And this deal will have serious consequences for our national security. Like the financial crisis that is now gripping the globe, this disastrous nuclear deal will come back to haunt us because there is no bailout for a nuclear bomb. 
   Nonproliferation experts tell us that India will be able to increase its annual nuclear weapons production from seven bombs per year to 40 or 50 bombs per year. That is absolutely a crazy situation for us to be engaging in. Does the Bush administration think that nobody is watching what we are doing? Pakistan is watching. Pakistan is watching its arch rival get welcomed into ``the nuclear club.'' Does the Bush administration think that Pakistan will just watch India ramp up its nuclear weapons production and do nothing? Pakistan will respond. Pakistan warned us this summer that this deal, and I quote, ``threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race.'' 
   Right now, according to nonproliferation experts, Pakistan is building two new reactors to dramatically increase its nuclear weapons production. The first of these new reactors could come online within a year. Pakistan is essentially telling India, ``We're in this game, too. We will match you step to step.'' 
   This is an all out nuclear arms race. That is what President Bush should be working on, not fueling it, but trying to negotiate an end to it. This is what a nuclear arms race looks like. We lived through one with the Soviet Union, now we are fueling one in Southeast Asia. 
   And who is Pakistan? A.Q. Khan, right here, the world's number one nuclear proliferator, a criminal against humanity, he is in Pakistan. Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, the people that actually attacked us on 9/11--and we know have attempted to acquire weapons of mass destruction--they are in Pakistan. And the Pakistani government, upon which we are relying to safeguard the nuclear weapons and materials, is dangerously unstable. We are feeding the fire of a nuclear arms race in the one country, Pakistan, where we can least afford to do so. 
   It's incredibly ironic that next here on the House floor we will consider a bill to increase sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program because the bill we're considering now makes an Iranian nuclear weapon much harder to  prevent. By breaking the rules for India, we're making it less likely that the rules will hold against Iran or anyone else. 
   Iran is looking at this deal for India and they're saying, ``Where can I sign up?'' ``I want that deal.'' And where is it written that once these new rules are set up, that the Venezuelans can't cut the same deal with the Chinese, that the Iranians and the Russians will just continue merrily along the way? They will be pointing at us. They will be pointing at our explanation that we can cut a separate deal here with India. That is what we are establishing in this bill. This is the new regime for the world, not a comprehensive policy, but each big country who wants to cut a deal with a nuclear aspiring country can do so. 
   The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is the bedrock of our efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It is the foundation upon which all of our work rests. And this deal is ripping that foundation up by its roots. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we are at an historic point. This deal allows for a country which is not a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to be exempted from it. It's an historic moment not only in the history of the United States, but of the world. 
   This nuclear nonproliferation regime that President Kennedy told us we had to establish has worked. In 1963, when he said, by the year 2000 we might have to count the countries that don't have nuclear weapons because they will be fewer than those that do unless we put a regime in place, was accurate. And if you look now, in 2008, almost no new countries have obtained nuclear weapons since 1963; quite an achievement. But here tonight, we're about to create a new global regime. And we will look back on this in the same way that we look back on the day when we began to allow subprime loans, and we will wonder how a global nuclear catastrophe was created, and we will point back to this evening. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008. Overall, this is a very good bill, and I will vote for it. In this difficult fiscal environment, it provides funding for critical programs that have been starved by the Administration and the Republican Congress. 
   This bill provides significant increases for Education programs including resources for  teacher quality, early education and after school programs, and it provides more for Low Income Home Energy Assistance. It also provides important resources for preventive health care, for the title IIV and title IIIV Health professions training programs, and for the Ryan White program. 
   While I will support the bill, I am very disappointed that we were not able to provide more funding for the critical work conducted at the National Institutes of Health. The NIH embodies our country's hope for treating or curing debilitating diseases like heart disease, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer and so many other illnesses that American families battle every day. But scientific advances don't just occur by accident. They are the result of sustained investments in research. Unfortunately, since 2003, Republicans flat-lined the NIH budget, and NIH has lost 13 percent of its research funding when adjusted for inflation. 
   I was hopeful that this year we would be able to end that devastating trend and get the NIH budget back on track by providing the NIH with significant increases over the rate of inflation. 
   Although I am disappointed that we were not able to provide more for NIH this year, I look forward to working with the distinguished chair and the members of the Appropriations committee in the future to ensure that we provide our country's premier medical research institution with the funding it needs to find treatments and cures to our country's most devastating diseases.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1677, the ``Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007.'' 
   I would like to focus my remarks on Section 8 of this bill, which clarifies the intent of the Congress that the existing legal prohibitions on the misuse of Department of the Treasury names and symbols also extend to misuse over the Internet. I support this provision, which addresses a very real problem that currently exists with potentially misleading commercial websites that taxpayers may mistakenly believe to be affiliated with the IRS. 
   In February, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, which I chair, became aware of three commercial websites operating under domain names which may confuse the public into believing them to be official IRS websites: IRS.com, IRS.net and IRS.org. In response to this situation, I wrote to the Federal Trade Commission Chairman Majoras, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Everson to express my concerns that consumers who visited these sites might provide the operators with personally identifiable information and tax return information, enabling the operators to either market or sell this information to others, or to sell and market all manner of products and services to these taxpayers. 
   A consumer survey and study presented to the IRS and FTC in early January of this year by the Computer and Communications Industry Association suggested that a significant proportion of consumers misinterpreted these three non-governmental Websites as being sites hosted by the IRS. The survey showed, for example, that before viewing the website IRS.com, 47 percent of those surveyed believed the site represented the Internet address of the Internal Revenue Service. Even after viewing the site, 1/3 of those surveyed still believed the site was the IRS website. 
   Now, the IRS.com website bears a remarkable resemblance to the official IRS.gov site. Both websites have the same color blue banner at the very top, a grey search bar right below, and a white background with various links and search features covering the bulk of the page. Back in February, the IRS.com site even had an actual image of the U.S. Treasury headquarters building on the top of the  page. At the time, there was only a fine-print disclaimer at the bottom of these sites stating that that it was a non-governmental site. This disclaimer was so far down on the webpage that few consumers were likely to view it. 
   I continue to be concerned about the potential for unfair or deceptive trade practices associated with these commercial websites, and I believe that we need to do more to ensure that the public does not continue to be exposed to these potentially misleading or confusing websites. There is no relationship between a citizen and our government more sensitive, nor information more private, than that involving individual taxes and the annual voluntary compliance obligation. The federal government has a duty to protect taxpayers from predatory behaviors as they seek to meet their obligation to pay taxes. 
   I am hopeful that, by clarifying the intent of the Congress that the existing legal prohibitions on misuse of Treasury Department and IRS names and symbols are and should be applied to commercial activity on the Internet, this bill will better protect the public from this kind of operation in the future. 
   I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman and congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), for his enormously successful work; and Mr. Dingell as well, as well as the key Republicans who worked on this legislation. 
   I am pleased that the bill before the House includes language from the drug safety bill that Mr. Waxman and I introduced in March to strengthen the FDA's ability to monitor drugs after they have been approved and create a true post-market safety net system. 
   As we have seen with drugs such as Vioxx, new side effects and health risks may only surface after drugs are approved and are used by the general population. Yet the FDA has not had the authority to mandate label changes or require further studies to get more information about these risks once the drugs have been approved. This bill will empower the FDA with those important new authorities, and it will also establish a new post-market risk identification and analysis system to identify harmful side effects and uncover signals of unexpected adverse events without compromising patient privacy. 
   I am also pleased that the package includes a strong clinical trials registry and results database that is consistent with the bill that Mr. Waxman and I have been championing since 2004 when we learned that some drug companies were painting distorted pictures of their products by hiding negative trial results. 
   The current system, which allows companies to pick and choose which trials they want to make public, is like allowing students to just pick the grades they want to bring home. Everyone would have straight A's. 
   Our bill will establish one central mandatory registry of all clinical trials with strong enforcement mechanisms to require companies to make their clinical trials and the result of those trials available to the public, all of the trials. This is historic because the database of trial results will ensure that doctors and their patients have current, complete, and accurate information about all drugs on the market. 
   Finally, I want to thank Mr. Rogers from Michigan for working with me on the pediatric devices bill. It is an important bill that will help children get the devices that they need. I thank again Mr. Pallone, Mr. Dingell, and all the others who worked on this bill.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, today Democrats ae fulfilling a pledge to millions of working famllies who have struggled for too long to make ends meet with a minimum wage that has failed to keep pace with skyrocketing housing, health care, energy and other costs. 
   President Franklin Roosevelt told us, ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' 
   The federal minimum wage has remained unchanged for nearly 10 years, and its purchasing power has plummeted to the lowest level in more than half a century. It is unacceptable and immoral that millions of Americans have been working full-time and year-round while still being unable to afford the basic necessities of life. 
   By increasing the federal minimum wage by $2.10--from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over 2 years--we are giving a long overdue pay raise to about 13 million Americans, which amounts to an additional $4,400 per year for a family of three. I am proud that my home state of Massachusetts already has taken similar action, increasing the Commonwealth's minimum wage to $7.50 effective January 1, 2007. A total of twenty-eight states along with the District of Columbia have a state minimum wage above the current federal level. It is time for the federal government to catch up. 
   Raising the minimum wage will make an important difference in the lives of hardworking Americans across the country. The Senate should quickly pass similar legislation and President Bush should sign into law this much-needed increase as soon as it reaches his desk.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act. This bill will begin the long-overdue withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. 
   Yesterday, the President vetoed the Labor and Heath and Human Services-Education appropriations bill, which is the bill that provides funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Control, Low Income Home Energy Assistance, the Education Department, Pell Grants, and educational programs for the disadvantaged. He vetoed this bill because it contained a 2 percent increase over his request--an increase of $10 billion in a Labor HHS bill of roughly $600 billion. The President opposes even a 2 percent increase in the funding for these programs. 
   Meanwhile, the President has requested almost $200 billion more for his failed war in Iraq. That would make the total cost of the war in Iraq so far to over $600 billion and climbing, with no end in sight. President Bush's refusal to change course in Iraq is shocking, his failure to allow adequate rest for our soldiers between tours of duty is outrageous, and his demand for another $200 billion blank check for his war in Iraq while vetoing LIHEAP for the poor, education for disadvantaged children, Pell Grants for college students, and research into cures for life threatening disease is simply unacceptable to this House. What a misplaced set of priorities. 
   Instead of the blank check for an endless war, this bill requires President Bush to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq within 30 days. Instead of unfairly sending inadequately equipped soldiers on multiple tours of duty, this bill prohibits the deployment of any troops who are not fully equipped and trained. And at the same time, this bill provides the necessary funds, in full, to our troops who are still in harm's way. 
   Our Republican colleagues must make a choice: will they stand with President Bush's attempt to throw more money and more young men and women into the mess in Iraq, or will they join with Democrats seeking a bipartisan agreement on redeploying American troops out of Iraq? 
    Mr. Speaker, I would like to specifically note a provision of this bill, which I wrote, to bar any funds in this bill from being used for the gruesome and indefensible practice of extraordinary rendition. I would like to commend and thank Chairman OBEY and Chairman MURTHA for again including this language, as they have in every defense appropriations and supplemental appropriations bill this year. Through the use of extraordinary rendition, as well as abusive interrogation techniques and extrajudicial incarceration of so-called ``enemy combatants,'' President Bush has largely forfeited the mantel of human rights champion which the United States has carried for so long. We must reclaim the international moral high-ground if we are to cure the root causes of terrorism around the world, and we can start by banning extraordinary rendition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman OBEY for this strong and responsible bill, and urge all my colleagues to vote aye.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. 
   Let me start by commending the chairman of the subcommittee, the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, Mr. KILDEE, and the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from California, Mr. MILLER for their work on this bill. I offer my thanks to the House and Senate conferees for bringing forth this important piece of legislation today. 
   In 1965, with a great deal of hard work, Head Start was created. It soon became a ``legislative Lamborghini'' of social programs, going from 0 to 561,000 thousand participants in only a few months. In the 42 years since its inception, Head Start has become the educational foundation for more than 20 million American children. 
   Education serves as both a ladder of opportunity and an investment in our future. Our Nation's security, economy, and position in the world all depend on the success of our education system. We must take advantage of this opportunity to fund our future. 
   Head Start and Early Head Start are linchpins in the effort to prepare our country's most disadvantaged children to succeed in school and life. Many studies indicate that children enrolled in Head Start make significant progress in closing the readiness gap to their more advantaged peers as they enter kindergarten. 
   The congressionally mandated impact study recently published its results, which noted that after less than 1 year in the program, children in Head Start had narrowed the readiness gap by 45 percent in reading skills and 28 percent in writing skills. This momentum continues well beyond the ages of 3, 4, and 5, as another large academic study has noted that Head Start graduates continue to mount academic gains well after leaving the program. 
   The bill we see before us today helps to raise the academic standards of American children and ensures that every child in our country has an equal opportunity to a high quality education. It aims to improve teacher quality by requiring a greater number of Head Start teachers to have a bachelor's degree and be adequately trained in early childhood development. This is clearly good news for the children that will be participating in Head Start in the future. 
   On multiple occasions, the President has advocated that all 3- and 4-year-old participants in Head Start should take standardized tests to assess their improvement. For President Bush, No Child Left Behind means no child left untested. I am happy that this conference report terminates the further use of the National Reporting System, an inappropriate, ineffective, and expensive testing regime. 
   This conference report notes that Head Start is not without the opportunity for evaluation, however, and there is strengthened program accountability at the Federal, regional, and local levels included in the legislation. The report also requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to initiate classroom evaluations, thereby ensuring optimal teacher-child interactions. 
   We have known for some time that when children are not provided high-quality day care and early childhood services, once in school, their academic achievement and limited language proficiencies become cumulatively worse over time, over grade levels, and across all subject areas. By passing this conference report, we build on the past 42 years of success for this program and help ensure that both Head Start children as well as our Nation as a whole have a brighter tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker I rise in strong support of House Resolution 61, a resolution which honors the great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for his outstanding contributions to our country in the past and the continuing impact of his life and legacy. 
   Born on January 15, 1929, Martin Luther King, Jr., was destined to follow in his grandfather's and father's footsteps as a Baptist minister, but no one could have known he would play such an important role in this history of our Nation. After graduating from high school at the age of 15, Martin Luther King, Jr., attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA., just as his grandfather and father had done before. He became a pastor in Ebenezer Baptist Church, and quickly rose to become the leader of the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, inspiring first the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, and subsequently a nationwide battle to bring an end to racial discrimination in our Nation's laws and public accommodations, and to ensure full voting rights for African Americans. Though bus boycotts had been attempted before, none lasted as long, drew as much attention or were as successful. The Montgomery Bus boycott lasted for almost an entire year and had a profound effect on the businesses in Montgomery. 
   In recognition of his great leadership, Reverend King was the youngest person ever to win a Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 35. He donated all of the prize money to the Civil Rights Movement. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a spiritual giant who possessed a keen intellect and remarkable insights on the human condition. In Massachusetts, we feel a sense of privilege knowing that this extraordinary historic figure lived and learned among us during his lifetime. In 1955, he received a Doctorate of Philosophy in Systematic Theology from Boston University. He also studied at Harvard University. But most important, it was in Boston that he met Coretta Scott, who became his wife, the mother of his four children, and his indispensable partner in a destiny of struggle, transformation and remarkable achievement. 
   Many of the words of Dr. King speak greatly to the adversities that we still face today. As we work to change the direction of our country, those of us in government must repeatedly seek out those with whom we may sometimes disagree to accomplish those great things that are most worth doing. ``Like an unchecked cancer,'' said Dr. King, ``hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.'' 
   As Dr. King so eloquently put it, ``In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' 
   I urge adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1591, U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is a disaster. We are engaged in a war that should never have been fought and that was presented to the American people and this Congress over 4 years ago wrapped in falsehoods and mendacity. Our military is being drained of personnel and materiel in an occupation that, we were told, would never occur because we would be greeted as liberators. 
   To say that the President's prosecution of this war has been mismanaged misses the much more important point that President Bush exercised extraordinarily poor judgment in initiating an unnecessary war of choice. Our soldiers, their families, and indeed the entire country, now bears the legacy of the President's headstrong rush into this quagmire. 
   The President, with the Iraq War supplemental appropriations request, has again asked the Congress to give him a blank check to continue an endless and bottomless war. But that is not what the President will get with this bill. Instead of a blank check, the Congress is providing a much needed check and balance to the Executive Branch. 
   The bill before us today requires the President to certify to the Congress that certain tough benchmarks have been met. If he cannot so certify, an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces must commence. Under the bill, by July 1, 2007, the President must certify that Iraq has met political and military benchmarks, including the implementation of a program to disarm the militias. By October 1, 2007, the President must make another certification of Iraq's progress, including that militia control of local security has been eliminated. And even if the President is able to make both certifications to Congress, this bill requires that U.S. forces begin withdrawing from Iraq by March 1, 2008 and complete that withdrawal no later than by the end of August 2008. 
   These limitations on the President are important, as they will pave the way for the United States to finally withdraw from Iraq. 
   This bill also prohibits permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq, which is an essential precondition for the reestablishment of public trust in the United States within the Middle East and especially Iraq. 
   Particularly significant to me is a prohibition included in this bill which bars the use of funds from this supplemental in contravention of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. I have had to fight to include this provision in previous appropriations bills under the Republican Congress and I would like to thank and commend Chairman MURTHA for his leadership and courage on this issue. In this bill, my restriction on the use of funds for torture also includes a specific ban on the use of funds to carry out renditions, which the President has used to transfer detainees for interrogation or other purposes to countries known for the use of torture.  
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to see the war continue another day. I want our troops home immediately, and I am frustrated beyond words by the President's continued intransigence in the face of overwhelming evidence and opinion. The bill that this House is debating today will take us closer to the moment when every American soldier, sailor, airman or Marine in Iraq can be brought home. 
   I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much. I rise in support of this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule today lays the framework for a historic debate, a debate that will talk about the energy future of the United States of America, an agenda that has not been discussed out here on the House floor, although there has been a pent-up demand by the American people that we move to this new renewable energy agenda for the 21st century. 
   Climate change has now become a problem, not only for the United States, but for the whole world. We must be the leader. 
   In 1986, we imported 27 percent of our oil. Today, we import 61 percent of our oil. Today, we begin the effort to turn that around, to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of our country, to unleash a technological revolution that can capture the solar, capture the wind, capture the cellulosic future for our country; make our country more efficient, have the devices which we use to consume energy infinitely more efficient. That is the debate that we have been missing here in America, and today we begin that debate here on the House floor. 
   This is what the American people want. This is what the world has been waiting for, a debate on the energy future of the United States; unleashing its technological genius, and as a result, making it possible for the rest of the world to gain access to these technologies. 
   This is the day, and we have to be the leaders. This rule is now constructed in a way in which we can begin the debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the rule.

   This is the challenge for our country. This is what the American people expect from us, not to be held hostage by OPEC, not to be polluting the atmosphere, not to be exacerbating climate change, but to be moving to a renewable future. 
   This is the vote of the decade on the energy future of our country. This will send a signal to Europe, to China, to India, that we are serious about climate change, that we are serious about energy independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak about a very important provision in the Defense Appropriations Act for 2008, which yet again confronts President Bush over his inhumane and un-American torture policies. 
   I want to thank Chairman MURTHA for agreeing once again to include my language regarding torture in this bill. The provision, in Section 8104 of the bill, states that none of the funds in the Defense Appropriations bill may be used in contravention of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. This is a crucial provision because, as we all know, for years the President has been willing to ignore our obligations under international and domestic law to protect the basic human rights of detainees. This disregard for treaty and legal obligations also undermines our efforts in the war on terror, serving as a valuable recruiting tool for terrorists and putting our brave men and women in uniform at risk of similar mistreatment if captured by our enemies. 
   I have inserted this provision into a number of funding bills over the past several years, and I will continue to do so until we can legislatively restrain this and every future President from intentionally misinterpreting our obligations to respect the fundamental human rights of all people. In the period of the Republican majority, I had to come to the floor and offer amendments to insert this funding restriction into the appropriations bills. Fortunately, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that our obligations to treat individuals humanely are paramount, and my amendment repeatedly prevailed with near unanimity. I commend Mr. MURTHA for including this language in the bill, which reflects his deep concern for our troops and his commitment to upholding our obligations to fundamental human rights. 
   With his policies of extraordinary rendition, President Bush has shipped countless prisoners to countries such as Syria and Uzbekistan where they are brutally tortured--without ever having been afforded a lawyer, a trial, or any opportunity to challenge their transfer based on probability of abuse. By allowing senior officers and officials to implicitly encourage the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, President Bush not only allowed a situation to develop where Americans horribly abused detainees but also created one of the greatest public diplomacy disasters in American history. By establishing a network of black-site CIA prisons around the world, where prisoners are held in total secret and without access to international monitors such as the Red Cross, the President engages in the grossest hypocrisy and undermines the very international protections for prisoners that our own troops abroad count on as their last line of defense should they be captured. 
   These policies must come to an immediate and permanent end. I look forward to passing my Torture Outsourcing Prevention Act to end extraordinary rendition once and for all, and it is essential that Congress reinstate habeas corpus. Until then, I am proud that the Congress will, with this funding restriction, once again bar any appropriations in violation of the Convention Against Torture.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 152, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reunification of the city of Jerusalem. 
   The city of Jerusalem is a unique place in the world, steeped in history and faith, the eternal heart of three major world religions. Jerusalem has suffered war and conquest repeatedly throughout the ages, but I have faith that Jerusalem will never be fractured again. 
   Jews, Muslims, and Christians all find a spiritual home in Jerusalem, and it is essential that Jerusalem remain open to worshippers of all faiths. Unfortunately, for too many years of its history, access to the holy sites in Jerusalem was denied to some. But for the last 40 years, Israel has guaranteed access to all faiths, and the world community has been able to visit Jerusalem freely. I applaud Israel for this principled and fair policy, which has surely not always been easy to maintain. It is an important affirmation of Israel's humane and democratic values that a country which finds itself under frequent attack would maintain a commitment to the openness of a site of such international importance as Jerusalem. 
   Unfortunately, the great emotion people feel about the holy city of Jerusalem has frequently found a false outlet in violence against others. It is a great sadness to me, and a great injustice against the history and sanctity of Jerusalem, that the city has been a flashpoint for so much violence in my lifetime. 
   I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that in the past several years the Middle East peace process has been derailed from the promising moments during the Clinton presidency. President Clinton was as deeply involved, at a personal as well as a political level, with the quest to find a permanent solution to the problems of the region as any world leader has ever been. While he was not quite able to attain the overarching peace agreement that he had worked so hard to achieve, President Clinton recognized that finding a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue needed to be a foreign policy priority of the United States. 
   Since President Clinton left office, the involvement of the United States in the Middle East peace process has been scattered, sporadic, and ineffectual. Instead of redoubling our efforts to find peace, the United States launched a disastrous war in Iraq. We have sparked a bloody civil war in that country, inflamed Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Middle East, empowered the dangerous regime in Iran, ignored the frustrations and economic despair of the Palestinians, and damaged the immediate security of our great ally in the region--Israel. 
   On the 40th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, I view that city as a symbol of hope in the bleak landscape of the Middle East. Through Israel's commitment to the openness of Jerusalem, worshippers of all faiths can visit the holy Old City and see the beauty of its timeless stone buildings and ancient walls. 
   The United States has always stood steadfast with its close ally Israel, and we must never cease doing so. We must recommit ourselves to the peace process in the Middle East, and lead the international community in forging a path to reconciliation and coexistence. We must dedicate ourselves to bringing about a new peaceful history in this divisive region, so that future generations may continue to find spiritual renewal in Jerusalem.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. 
   This vital legislation comes at a time of record-breaking gas prices, double digit increases in food prices and a weakening economy. On top of all these struggles, Americans now face a crisis at home and in their communities in the form of rising property foreclosures. In some parts of the country, neighborhoods are littered with ``for sale'' signs, and many families are struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments. The legislation we are debating on this floor today will empower communities to respond to the current home mortgage crisis, prevent further lending abuses and increase federal oversight of the mortgage industry. 
   H.R. 3221 expands the Federal Housing Administration's role in preventing foreclosures by expanding refinancing loan guarantees for at-risk homeowners. Today, families are facing variable interest rates, hidden fees, early payment penalties, but with enactment of the Foreclosure Prevent Act, the government will be there to provide relief and counseling. It also increases oversight to ensure regulators have the tools to prevent the next crisis. It expands housing counseling and consumer protections. The bill also establishes an affordable housing trust fund to provide assistance for low income households. The bill even makes it harder to foreclose on the homes of our returning troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This bill also contains important language to my district and my hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. The tenants of the Heritage Apartments face an uncertain future, with an HUD affordability contract expiring soon. The tenants are facing possible displacement once an outstanding HUD mortgage is fully paid in a few years. The development is also in need of major renovations and upgrades that simply cannot be delayed. Unfortunately HUD is failing to ensure that the development remains affordable and livable by placing burdensome restrictions on prepayment of the outstanding mortgage and subsequent transfer to a new owner who is willing to finance the renovations. 
   Language in this bill would allow income-eligible residents to qualify for enhanced housing vouchers following the prepayment of the HUD mortgage and the property transfer and directs HUD to approve such actions. I want to thank the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee (Mr. FRANK) for his assistance in ensuring that this important provision is included in this housing bill. 
   Today, with this legislation, we are taking steps to revitalize our communities for a better tomorrow. I strongly urge this House to vote to approve this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, the ``Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act'' is a bill whose time has come, and I am pleased to rise in strong support of this important legislation. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), in the past ten years, CEO pay has more than doubled, and the ratio of median CEO pay to worker pay has risen to 179 to 1. The escalation in executive pay raises significant issues, including the equity of widening income disparities and the potential that such extraordinary CEO salaries may be a result of inefficient labor markets. The bill before the House today provides a balanced, pro-market approach to this addressing issue. Specifically, the nonbinding advisory vote mandated in this bill will give shareholders a mechanism for supporting or opposing their company's executive compensation practices without diminishing the board's legal authority. Such a vote will signal to the board, without tying its hands, that the individuals who actually own the firm will hold the board accountable for CEO pay packages, which should give board members some pause before approving excessive compensation plans. 
   H.R. 1257 does not cap, limit or change any CEO's pay. Rather, it simply requires that shareholders have a ``nonbinding'' say on their company's salary decisions. Moreover, the SEC already requires companies to disclose compensation. The SEC's recent executive compensation disclosure rules already require that companies disclose their compensation packages in their annual proxy. The annual vote requirement simply requires that companies add a line to that disclosure permitting shareholders to approve or disapprove the compensation packages and also tally the votes. Shareholders are the owners of our Nation's public companies. They should have the right to vote on the compensation packages for companies' senior officers. 
   The cost to businesses complying with the bill's provisions would be minimal. In fact, CBO estimated that costs from the annual vote would fall well below the annual threshold for private sector mandates--that is, below $131 million in 2007 for the entire country. This is a tiny, and worthwhile, cost that is more than offset by the significant benefit it provides shareholders by enabling them to have their voices heard in the board room. Additionally, businesses are provided more than enough time to make the logistical arrangements necessary for the nonbinding advisory vote, as it would not be required until the 2009 proxy season. 
   The nonbinding vote has been used successfully in other countries. For example, the nonbinding advisory vote approach has been used in the United Kingdom since 2003 and is now used in Australia, without impeding economic activity in any way. To the contrary, the policy change is credited with improving management-shareholder dialogue on executive compensation matters and increasing the use of long-term performance targets in incentive compensation. In the United States, the nonbinding advisory vote on CEO pay recently was adopted voluntarily by Aflac, and is currently pending before numerous U.S. public companies. 
   I commend my colleague from Massachusetts, Barney Frank, the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee for bringing this important bill to the Floor today and urge an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. 
   The United States has the highest gross domestic product in the world. We have the most advanced technology, the strongest research program, and for some, the best medicine in the world. 
   But last year, 18,000 Americans died because they were uninsured and did not have access to health care. Many of them were children. 
   Providing health care for poor children used to be a bipartisan issue. But today the Republicans say that they philosophically object to this bill claiming that it is a massive expansion of Government-run healthcare. 
   But this bill does not change the structure of the program that the Republicans voted for in 1997. The only explanation is that they philosophically object to spending the $50 billion necessary to find and give healthcare to all 11 million poor, eligible children. What kind of philosophy is that? 
   President Bush used to talk about compassionate conservatism, but this debate has exposed a Republican Party that is neither compassionate nor conservative. 
   Instead, we are seeing some on the other side of the aisle choosing corporations over children. They demand that we continue Federal subsidies for their friends in the big, for-profit, insurance companies, while denying uninsured children the healthcare they need. 
   If you kick these Republicans in the heart, you'll break your toe. 
   I urge you to vote ``yes'' on this critical children's health bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (BROADBAND CENSUS OF AMERICA ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to suspend the rules and to pass the Broadband Census of America Act of 2007 because, Mr. Speaker, the overarching telecommunications policy goal of the United States is achieving ubiquitously available, competitive, high-speed, affordable broadband service to all Americans. Such broadband service capability is indispensable to various aspects of the United States economy, including public safety, education, entrepreneurial investment, innovation, job creation, health care delivery, and energy efficiency. 
   The ability of the United States to promote and achieve a competitive high-speed broadband infrastructure will also be a key factor in determining our Nation's success in the fiercely competitive global economy. 
   International competitors to the United States are achieving progress in broadband deployment and adoption. Many countries have broadband service capabilities superior to the United States in terms of choice, speed, and price. 
   For the United States, offering broadband service capability at ever higher transmission speeds could spur new growth in investment in cutting-edge applications, services, and technologies that utilize higher bandwidth functionality. 
   This bill represents an indispensable first step in developing an overarching blueprint for broadband policy in the United States. In brief, the Broadband Census of America Act tasked the Federal Communications Commission with collecting data from providers of broadband service capability throughout the country, and with developing a series of tiers for categorizing the speeds of such services. 
   The data collected will be disclosed to the public in an annual report that will include: one, the actual number of residential and business subscribers within each five-digit ZIP code with a list of the broadband technologies present in each ZIP code: and, two, the actual number of residential and business subscribers, correlated to each broadband speed tier identified by the FCC on a statewide basis. 
   This bill also encompasses a broadband mapping effort as well as community organization initiatives for unserved and underserved areas to increase knowledge of where, what type, and what speed of broadband service may be available. 
   The bill requires the National Telecommunications Information Agency to develop a national broadband availability map which will include the availability of broadband service capability at the nine-digit ZIP code level, census track level, or functional equivalent. 
   This is a very consumer-friendly mapping function and ``demand side'' identification initiative that consumer groups, the high-tech community and the telecommunications industry all support. 
   This map will be interactive and searchable by consumers, and at the providers' discretion will also indicate the type of technology and speed of service offered in that area. 
   The legislation also includes authorizations for grants to local planning entities and communities around the country. These grants are designed to increase broadband availability and usage in local communities through so-called ``demand side'' identification and other initiatives. 
   To better gauge how the country is performing compared to international competitors, the bill also requires the FCC to conduct a comparison of the extent of broadband service capability  abroad in 75 foreign communities with equivalent American communities. 
   This legislation reflects several months of negotiations. And I want to thank Mr. Upton from Michigan for his patient attention to this legislation. No legislation in telecommunications has received the detailed attention that this legislation has on a bipartisan basis, and for that I want to thank Mr. Upton. 
   I also want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton, for his work on this legislation. And of course on our side, Mr. Dingell and I worked with the minority towards achieving this legislation. And with the thanks of Mr. Dingell and myself, we once again want to point out how cooperative all of our working relationships were on this legislation. 
   It also has the support of consumer groups, the Communications Workers of America, NARUC Connect Kentucky, Qwest, and organizations representing the high-tech industry, the cable industry, the telephone industry, and the wireless industry. 
   I want to again thank Mr. Upton and Mr. Barton for their cooperation in working through the differences on this legislation, and to thank Mr. Dingell for his excellent work on this legislation.

   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3403) to promote and enhance public safety by facilitating the rapid deployment of IP-enabled 911 and E-911 services, encouraging the nation's transition to a national IP-enabled emergency network and improve 911 and E-911 access to those with disabilities, as amended.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3403, introduced by Representative Bart Gordon, is designed to ensure that a consumer calling 911 in an emergency from an Internet phone, using so-called ``Voice over Internet Protocol,'' or VoIP service, can do so with a degree of confidence matching that of traditional phone service and wireless service. 
   The bill seeks to achieve this goal through two key provisions: The first provision extends liability protections to VoIP service providers. The Federal Communications Commission lacks authority to grant liability protection to VoIP service providers, and, therefore, Congress must take action to achieve this policy objective. This is similar to action this subcommittee took in 1999 when such liability protection was accorded to wireless providers. 
   The second key provision in the bill establishes the right of VoIP providers to access the parts of the 911 infrastructure they need in order to complete 911 calls for consumers. This is an important provision because while the FCC has acted to require VoIP providers to meet enhanced 911 service obligations, the commission did not order that such VoIP providers had a legal right to the components of the 911 infrastructure they would need to fulfill their E-911 obligations under the commission's own rules.     
   I want to commend Representative Gordon for his excellent work and leadership on this bill. We have endeavored, over the last several months, to work on a bipartisan basis through several issues, and the bill we bring to the House floor this afternoon reflects the results of these discussions. It is an excellent step forward. 
   I also want to salute Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Shimkus and Mr. Pickering for their work on this legislation and, as always, to commend the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Dingell; the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton; and my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for their excellent efforts as well. 
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentlelady very much. 
   For nearly 8 years, this administration's backwards energy policy has lined the pockets of oil company executives, while hurting American consumers, the economy, and the planet. 
   Since President Bush took office, the price of oil has gone from $30 a barrel to a new record high price of $101 a barrel yesterday. As a result of this administration's failed energy policies, our dependence on foreign oil is now over 60 percent, and we are hemorrhaging funds to pay for our oil addiction at the rate of over $500,000 a minute, $30 million an hour, $5 billion a week sent overseas. And consumers are the ones paying the price for our oil addiction. Gas prices are now at a nationwide average of $3.14, up nearly $1 from a year ago. 
   This administration's oil-centric energy policy has proven itself to be completely bankrupt for everyone except Big Oil. While American consumers are being tipped upside down at the pump and having money shaken out of their pockets, Big Oil is recording the greatest corporate profits we have ever seen in the history of the world. 
   Today, we debate whether we will repeal unnecessary tax breaks for the biggest oil companies and use those funds to spur investment in renewable energies, biofuels and energy efficiency. The future of renewable energy is in America's hands. But the money to fund the renewable revolution is stuck in Big Oil's pockets. 
   Renewable energy is ready to take off, but it needs us to build the runway. That is what we are going to be debating here today. Thirty percent of all new electricity in the United States last year was wind. There was an 80 percent increase in photovoltaic installations in the United States last year. 
   The future is clear. It is in front of our eyes. We must give it the boost we need. 
   Vote ``aye'' on this very important legislation today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I would like to say that the gentleman from Maryland is like Socrates up here lecturing to the Members and to the country on this incredibly important issue. And I would just like to take note that you do it day after day, and you are relentless. 
   There is no question that, still, there is this denial with regard to the amount of oil that the United States has in terms of reserves compared to OPEC, compared to Russia, compared to other countries in the world.     
   And the gentleman from Maryland on a consistent basis comes here to the House floor. I know you do it in other places to bring this message. And if I may, just for 10 seconds because I know the gentleman shares my view on this, I think we both drive hybrids. I think the gentleman is the Chair of the Hybrid Caucus, as a matter of fact. And we both know that the technology exists if we make a commitment as a nation. So here is just one little statistic I would like to put out there: 
   In 1970, the United States imported 20 percent of its oil; 80 percent we produced. By 1977, just 7 years later, we imported 47 percent of our oil. We went from 20 percent imports to 47 percent imports. But then the Congress and Gerald Ford, President Ford, passed legislation which mandated a doubling of the fuel economy standards for the United States of America. By 1985, 1986, we had dropped back down to 27 percent imports. So we went from 20 percent to 46 back down to 27 percent because we improved our technology. We doubled the fuel economy from 13 miles per gallon to 27 miles per gallon. We did it technologically. 
   Today, unbelievably, the United States imports 60 percent of its oil. So from 1986 to 2006, we went from 27 percent of our oil that we imported to 60 percent of our oil that we imported. And as the gentleman graphically, in eye-watering detail, continues to present out here on the House floor, the places from which we import this oil is not healthy for the United States of America. It is an unhealthy relationship with countries that we should not be dependent upon. Three hundred billion dollars worth of oil imports last year. Three hundred billion dollars. And we know that much of that money is spent on things that are completely adverse to the overall national security interests of the United States of America even as we emit more greenhouse gases out into the atmosphere that we would not be emitting if our fuel economy standard was much higher. 
   So I saw you out here again like a preacher, and I thought that I would just let you know that I am out here in the congregation listening to you, and I know that there are many, many other people who are very much in debt to you for having the resolute commitment to getting this message into the minds of the American people. 
   So I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Why do you think it is so hard to convince people that we don't have the oil reserves that would allow us to have a healthy relationship with the rest of the world that does have the oil reserves that ultimately we are going to need to import if we don't change our habits? Why do you think our country doesn't come to grips with that? Where is the gap in communicating with the American people on this issue?

   Mr. MARKEY. You tell your wife that in Massachusetts the messenger's name was Paul Revere and we actually built statues to him up in Massachusetts for telling us the Red Coats were coming, the British were coming, the regulars were coming. And that is what you are telling us right now, that at 60, 61 percent dependence upon imported oil, we are heading inexorably towards a very, very dangerous foreign policy, national security crisis in our country because we are averaging about 1 1/2 percent per year increase in our dependency. So in order to move from 27 percent back in 1985, 1986 to 60, 61 percent today, it just has to go up that much. So if we come back here in 67 years and we haven't done anything, we will be over 70 percent, 75 percent dependent upon imported oil, all unnecessary if we looked at the facts and looked at the facts today and began to change our national habits. 
   So tell your wife that Paul Revere is more likely the analogy that applies to you rather than the messenger that they shot.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   This is a very important bill. Amongst other things it is because for the first time the Department of Defense is required to consider the effects of global warming on Defense Department facilities, capabilities, and missions. It requires that the Department of Defense in three central defense planning documents, the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the Quadrennial Defense Review, look at the impacts of global warming on the facilities and capabilities of the United States military. 
   This is a central issue. I am the chairman of the Select Committee on Global Warming. We had testifying before us General Gordon Sullivan, representing 11 three-and four-star admirals and generals who are all very concerned that this issue of global warming has major national security implications for the United States. 
   By including this requirement in this bill, we are beginning to focus upon the long-term needs that we have to focus on in order to protect our country and give the resources to the Department of Defense.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule, and in strong support of a provision within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 which requires, for the first time, the Department of Defense to consider the effect of global warming on Department facilities, capabilities, and missions. 
   I commend Chairman SKELTON for including this important language, which will allow our armed forces to begin preparing, in a strategic, Department-wide manner, for the impact that global warming could have on our national security. 
   This provision requires the threat of global warming to be assessed, and guidance for military planners to be issued, in the next versions of three central defense planning documents: The National Security Strategy, The National Defense Strategy, and the Quadrennial Defense Review. 
   The very first hearing of the new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming focused on the geopolitical and security consequences of our dependence on foreign energy and the looming threat of global warming. We heard from former Chief of Staff of the Army General Gordon Sullivan, who presented a report by eleven retired three- and four-star generals and admirals arguing that global warming is a grave national security threat, and must be treated as such by our defense establishment and by this Congress. 
   Last month, Congressman BARTLETT and I introduced the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act, with the intention of jump-starting our government's analysis of and preparation for the national security consequences of global warming. Our bill would require a National Intelligence Estimate on the impact of global warming, and last week exactly such an NIE was mandated by the Intelligence Authorization bill. Our bill also encourages the Department of Defense to integrate into our defense planning the threats posed by global warming, and I am very pleased that this priority is being mandated in this year's Defense Authorization Act. 
   Thinking about global warming as a national security issue is new for many Members, but with the speed that the major provisions of the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act have been adopted by this House, I feel confident that the Congress is making progress in broadening how we think about global warming. It is crucial for the national security of this country that the Congress continue along this path. We must push our defense and intelligence communities to address this threat, and we must offer, debate, and implement solutions to the underlying problem. 
   I am also pleased to support and cosponsor an amendment that will be offered during debate on this bill by the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. LIPINSKI, which would require the use of high efficiency light bulb in Department of Defense buildings when new bulbs are installed or old bulbs are replaced. This amendment will help lower energy consumption in Defense Department facilities, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help promote energy independence, and result in millions of dollars of savings for the American taxpayer--all without impeding the operations of the U.S. military. 
   I urge adoption of the Rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, for nearly eight years, this Administration's backwards energy policy has lined the pockets of oil company executives while hurting American consumers, the economy, and the planet. This bill encourages production of clean alternative fuels and renewable energy while creating jobs. It transfers Oil Executive Power to Blue Collar Renewable Power. 
   Last week the House passed legislation on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to give hurting Americans an immediate break at the pump. But the energy crisis demands long term action, breaking our addiction to oil and transitioning our economy to clean renewable energy sources once and for all. 
   Last week immediate relief with SPR, this week we put our nation on a path to a clean renewable future. 
   President Bush and Senate Republicans have been given opportunity after opportunity to pass tax credit extensions for renewable energy. They have sided with Big Oil each time, even as oil prices have blown past $100 a barrel and many Americans are now paying $4 per gallon for gas. This morning oil reached $130 a barrel. 
   This bill finds alternative revenue raisers which I do support. But let's not forget what this Administration fought to protect. ExxonMobil had $40 billion in profit last year. Do you know how the largest corporate profit in history was used in 2007? 
   It repurchased $31.8 billion worth of stock. 
   It increased compensation for top executives by 170 percent since 2001. 
   It financed a $100 million public relations campaign to try to deflect blame from angry consumers. 
   It invested around $10 million in renewable energy alternatives. That is less than one tenth of one percent of their profits. 
   These and other findings are being released today in a report by the Select Committee that analyzes where Big Oil's profits are going. Let's hope President Bush's love for the oil industry doesn't extend to hedge fund managers and corporate CEOs using offshore tax havens. 
   Today, because of this Administration's misguided policies, the renewable energy industry has its back against the wall. Solar and wind companies are delaying projects because of investment uncertainty. There is no more time to delay. 
   The other side likes to tell America that wind and solar and biomass cannot be real solutions to our energy challenge. They tell us that drilling in our most pristine natural areas and building nuclear power plants with taxpayer support are the only things that can solve this problem. 
   No. Last year the United States installed 5,244 megawatts of wind power, 30 percent of all the new capacity installed nationwide in 2007. Solar photovoltaic installations in the U.S. also grew an incredible 80 percent. This was the start of the renewable energy revolution. 
   Last week, the Department of Energy produced a study detailing what it would take for America to meet 20 percent of its electricity needs with wind power in 2030. The way the industry has grown over the last decade--about 30 percent a year--we can meet this target ahead of time. 
   This bill also provides valuable incentives for carbon capture and sequestration, plug-in hybrid cars, and renewable fuels. The American entrepreneur will rise to the energy and climate challenge if Congress puts the right incentives in place. 
   Passing H.R. 6049 will give renewable energy the support it needs, drive economic expansion and job growth in this country and put America on a greener path towards realizing long-term solutions to global warming. I urge an ``aye'' vote on the rule and on the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentlelady, and let me begin by expressing my appreciation to Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Deal for their support of this important resolution, but I would also like to extend my special thanks to my friend and cofounder of the Congressional Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, Cliff Stearns of Florida. Thank you, Cliff, for your commitment to this issue. 
   The resolution before us today is intended to highlight the importance of beating this dreadful, cruel disease, and bring hope to people with cystic fibrosis and their loved ones. Approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States have cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic lung disease for which there is no cure. 
   In my home State of Massachusetts, 800 families are affected by this horrible disease. That's a lot of moms that wake up at 5 in the morning so that they can pound on their child's chest to clear the abnormally thick, sticky mucus that makes breathing difficult. That's a lot of children who cough and wheeze and are at constant risk for life-threatening lung infections. That's a lot of dads who want their child to have a healthy life but have to worry about the unpleasant alternative of a shortened life expectancy marked by frequent admissions to the hospital. 
   This resolution is about supporting these families and providing them with the hope for a better future. Significant improvements have been made in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Fifty years ago many children with CF did not live past 10 years of age. Today, the life expectancy is 37 years. 
   Many of those achievements are due to the hard work and dedication of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Yet we still have a long way to go to provide people with CF with a normal and a healthy life. It is time for Congress to become more involved in the pursuit of a cure. We need to make a greater investment in research and make a stronger commitment to the people with CF, their families, and their caretakers. The cystic fibrosis community has ensured that we understand the unique challenges that face people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on overriding President Bush's veto of the urgently needed Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. Over the last several months, President Bush has had an opportunity to work with a bipartisan majority of Congress to enhance access to care for our Nation's seniors, disabled, and military families by preventing cuts in reimbursement to physicians. 
   The President had an opportunity to invest in our country's health by ensuring that seniors would continue to have access to physicians in the Medicare program. But instead, he opted to throw patients and physicians under the proverbial bus, all for the sake of padding the pockets of the Medicare Advantage program. 
   A veto of the President's override would not only improve seniors' access to health care, it would also increase investment in preventive health care, expand programs in rural communities, and guarantee mental health benefits. For our active-duty military personnel and military retirees, a veto override will ensure they have access to doctors they know and trust in the military health care program, Tricare. 
   This bill is supported by over 150 large organizations, and most importantly, by a vast majority of our Nation's seniors, disabled, military families, and physicians. We need to build on the success of this program and override this ill-timed and unconscionable veto. 
   At a time when the population of seniors seeking Medicare services continues to grow, what does the President do? He vetoes a bill written to prevent cuts to Medicare physicians, and in doing so, threatens seniors' access to Medicare providers. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
   To my Republican colleagues, who are considering how to vote on this bill today--given the overwhelming support for this bill from the patient and provider community, I urge you to reject the President's stand against patients and physicians in favor of the insurance industry and join the overwhelming majority of the American public who support this legislation. 
   It has been said that ``Health is the first wealth.'' Well, what does it say about our country when seniors, military families, and physicians are pushed aside for the interests of the insurance industry? Let's not put increased wealth for the insurance companies above the health of our seniors. We must give seniors the access to the health care that they need and deserve, and that is what today's veto override vote will accomplish. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote to override this veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. 
   This is an historic debate. The history is quite clear. At the point of which President Bush was sworn in as President in January of 2001, as a renowned oil industry veteran, the price of a barrel of oil was $30. Today, as we are now in the eighth year of the President's term of office, it is $126 a barrel, an historic high, nearly a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of oil. 
   Other interesting facts: On the day that the President was sworn in, again, as President, gas was $1.45 a gallon, the good old days when the Bush administration was sworn into office. Today it has hit a record high of $3.72, on average, for self serve regular. So that is something else that is quite dramatically negative in terms of the impact on American consumers. 
   Now, here's what has happened over the years with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Back in 1991 President Bush's father actually deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the price of a barrel of oil dropped 33 percent. In 2000 President Clinton deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the price of a barrel of oil went down 18 percent. In fact, President Bush himself deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2005, which led to a 5.6 percent drop in the price of a barrel of oil. 
   Now, this is an interesting U-turn that the President has taken because what he said in 2006 was----

   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   What the President said, President Bush said, in April 25, 2006, was, ``I have directed the Department of Energy to defer filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this summer. So by deferring deposits until the fall, we will leave a little more oil on the market. Every little bit helps.'' The price of a barrel of oil when President Bush said that in 2006: $67 a barrel. 
   Now here's what the President said as of April 29, just 2 weeks ago, in 2008. He said: ``In this case, I have analyzed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve issue, and I don't think it would affect the price.'' 
   Well, that's a surprising change of economic analysis by the President in just 2 years. And as we debate this out here on the House floor, he seems to find himself in the minority because, in fact, what the President has at his disposal is the ability to be able to do something about this issue. 
   As consumers get the shakedown at the pump, this Friday President Bush is going to meet with the sheiks in Saudi Arabia to ask for more oil. And while the President sent troops to the Middle East to look for weapons of mass destruction, he's avoiding using a weapon of price reduction here at home. The President has said he does not have a magic wand to wave away high gas prices, but he does carry a big stick. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

President Bush said in 2006 that every little bit helps. We know it is not a panacea, but every little bit helps. Today he is saying, I am sorry. I am just going to go over and meet with sheiks in Saudi Arabia and ask them to please give us more oil that we can buy from them. 
   We should be more aggressive. One, stop filling at 70,000 barrels a day; two, stop drilling 70,000 barrels a day and you will see a huge change on the open market. 
   Obama says ``yes.'' Clinton says ``yes.'' McCain says ``yes.'' President Bush still says ``no.'' Vote ``yes'' on the Welch resolution to ensure that the American consumer is protected at the pump.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 322, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. And I would like to commend Speaker Pelosi for introducing this resolution and for bringing it to the floor. 
   This is a truly bipartisan resolution, introduced with the support of the leadership of  both parties in the House. This bipartisanship is entirely appropriate, because Americans agree that the State of Israel is a great friend of the United States, and we all celebrate the anniversary of its founding today. 
   A century ago, Theodore Herzl dreamed of a Jewish homeland, and envisioned Israel as a ``light unto the nations.'' Since 1948, Israel has been that light. I am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting Israel as it continues to shine brilliantly as a force for progress and hope, not only in the Middle East, but throughout the entire world. 
   Prime Minister Golda Meir believed that one day there would be peace in Israel, because there are mothers and grandmothers--and let me add fathers and grandfathers--in Egypt, in Jordan, in Syria and the Palestinian territories who also want their children and grandchildren to live in peace. Today is an opportunity to be hopeful about the future of Israel and the prospects for peace--hopeful that we will soon reach the day when children will have to turn to the history books to learn that there ever was conflict in the Middle East. 
   Today, as we celebrate the founding of the State of Israel, our great ally and friend, we also know that independence is not enough without security. The Jewish homeland must be secure and must be surrounded by neighbors who respect its right to exist in peace and security. Through struggle and sacrifice, ingenuity and innovation, Israel has managed 60 years in a dangerous and unstable region of the world. Let us hope that the conflicts that have marked Israel's first 60 years will subside in the years to come. 
   Sixty years ago, Israel's pioneers began to revitalize an ancient land. Today, Israelis remain pioneers at heart--pioneers for peace, prosperity and progress. They are once again facing challenges in their homeland with determination and a vision for a better future for their children and for their country. 
   I congratulate the State of Israel on its 60th anniversary, and I urge adoption of this resolution.

   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which calls upon China to end its repression in Tibet. 
   I would also like to commend the Speaker for her long advocacy on behalf of the rights of the Tibetan people, and for bringing this bill before the House today. 
   In Tibet, there is an ongoing struggle for basic human rights and human dignity. Our Nation has a moral obligation to make its views known to the Chinese Government regarding its oppression of the legitimate rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and express their culture. 
   Last month, I was honored to join Speaker PELOSI in traveling to Dharamsala. We met with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, with leaders of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and with ordinary Tibetan people have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge from Chinese political oppression. 
   I was moved by the extraordinary struggle of the Tibetan people, and the stories I heard of the brutal repression that has been taking place in that country. All the Tibetan people are seeking is their right to be able to express their culture, language, and religion. 
   The Dalai Lama made it absolutely clear to us that he is firmly and unequivocally committed to nonviolence, that he is not seeking independence but autonomy, and that he is seeking peaceful dialogue with the Chinese Government. The Dalai Lama is not seeking a boycott of the Olympic Games; he is seeking to return to his homeland with his people in peace. 
   As I told Ambassador Zhou of China when I met with him last week, it is in the interest of China and Tibet to arrive at a lasting resolution of this dispute as soon as possible. China's reputation around the world, and its relations with other nations, will only continue to suffer if Beijing continues to ignore the world's call for action. 
   This resolution calls upon China to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, without preconditions, to address the legitimate grievances of the Tibetan people. I truly hope that the Chinese Government heeds this call, ends its repression of Tibetan rights, and enters into a genuine dialogue on Tibet's future. 
   I urge adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I'd like to congratulate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for producing bipartisan legislation to address the security weaknesses in our rail and mass transit systems and to ensure that strong whistleblower protections are provided to our front-line rail and mass transit security workers. 
   One area that has been largely overlooked since September 11th is the security associated with shipments of extremely hazardous materials on the roads and railways of our country. 
   Every day tank cars pass through our urban centers carrying enough chlorine to kill 100,000 people in half an hour. Some of these shipments must travel the routes they are currently using. But others could easily be safely re-routed to avoid population centers and other sensitive areas. 
   We already know that these chemicals are attractive terrorist targets. Just a few weeks ago, several deadly attacks in Iraq involved improvised explosive devices that included canisters of deadly chlorine gas, and a planned attack involving a truck full of chlorine was foiled this past weekend. 
   The risk is not just an overseas risk either. Several years ago, an Ohio-based al Qaeda operative was arrested and pled guilty for plotting to collapse a bridge in New York City or derail a train in DC. 
   Earlier this year, reporter Carl Prine at the Pittsburgh Tribune wrote a scathing expose on the state of rail insecurity in our country. He was able to walk right into rail yards with tanker cars containing some of the deadliest chemicals on earth. No one stopped him--he had no problem getting his hands on these deadly chemical tanks. 
   We're lucky that--this time--it was a journalist and not a jihadist who penetrated these rail yards. 
   Whether it's an accident or an al Qaeda attack, we need to make the shipments of deadly chemicals more secure. 
   The language in this bill that I authored and that was agreed to on a bipartisan basis builds upon the recent Notices of Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Department of Transportation and the TSA. 
   It requires rail carriers to analyze the routes and storage facilities for security sensitive materials as part of the security plans that they must submit for approval to the Department of Homeland Security. Then it requires the rail carriers to select the route and storage facilities that best reduce the risk and consequences of a terrorist attack on a shipment of these materials as they travel through or near high threat urban areas and other areas that DHS thinks need special security protections. 
   The language in this bill doesn't apply to all hazardous materials--just the ones that pose the greatest threat, such as chlorine or propane. Most assessments put this at less than 1 percent of all shipments. 
   This bill also doesn't require re-routing to occur if there is no practical alternative route. Rail carriers will only be required to re-route when a more secure route is available. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this bi-partisan effort. Now is the time to upgrade the security for these toxic shipments so none of our constituents are ever exposed to a catastrophic chemical release simply because we failed to take these simple steps.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered read.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Chairman, it's good to see you back up in the Chair again. I'm glad that you have returned up there. 
   I would like to thank, first of all, Chairman Jim Oberstar, a great chairman of the Transportation Committee for his excellent work; Chairman Bennie Thompson for his perspicacious leadership; to Chairman John Dingell, whose omniscient and ubiquitous presence on so many issues is always an essential ingredient in passing legislation of this magnitude. 
   And I encourage all of my colleagues to ensure that this commonsense provision, which will ensure that siting decisions for proposed LNG facilities are coordinated and informed by homeland security considerations. 
   My amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security to notify the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the Homeland Security Department's determination of whether the waterway to a proposed liquefied national gas facility is suitable for the marine traffic associated with the proposed facility. 
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in turn must respond to the Department of Homeland Security within 90 days or at the conclusion of any available appeals process of what the action the commission will take on the LNG application. 
   My amendment does not dispute the need for more LNG. We need more LNG. What my provision says is that before we build a new LNG facility, we must first make sure we are not creating a giant terrorist tiger. In Boston, we've always known that the LNG facility on land in my congressional district was a huge potential fire hazard. But after the September 11 attacks, when we learned how many terrorists had actually gotten off the LNG ships themselves in Boston coming in from overseas, we learned that it was a huge potential terrorist tiger. 
   In the face of this kind of risk, my provision mandates that we should have the Homeland Security Department involved at the beginning when any new LNG facilities are being proposed so that the department can assess the potential homeland security risk of building one of these facilities before we blindly move forward to put more LNG terminals in various parts of the country. 
   The need for coordination between the Coast Guard and the commission was recently reinforced in Fall River, Massachusetts. In Fall River, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the construction of an LNG facility in 2005. Two years later, the Coast Guard determined that the waterway was not suitable for the marine traffic associated with it. So we have a situation where the FERC has approved a license for the LNG facility that the Coast Guard says, 2 years later, shouldn't be built because the waterway to the facility is not suitable.     
   But despite this action by the Coast Guard, which effectively blocks the facility, the FERC license remains in place. This lack of coordination makes no sense. 
   There currently is an interagency agreement among the FERC, the Coast Guard and the Office of Pipeline Safety that is supposed to coordinate efforts on the siting of LNG facilities and safety and security issues associated with proposed sites. But as the review process for the proposed LNG facility in Fall River makes clear, more structure and a timeline is needed to make sure that there is better coordination so that the FERC is not approving proposed facilities only to have the Coast Guard, years later, reject the proposals due to concerns over the suitability of the waterway to the facilities. 
   At this point, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MARKEY. The purpose of my amendment is not the prevention of LNG facilities, but rather to promote coordinate between the Coast Guard and the FERC in siting. We have two other offshore facilities which we are also going to be licensing in Massachusetts. We need more LNG. We just want to make sure that there is good policy, good sense, good coordination. 
   Again, it's my great honor to have the support of the polysyllabic professor of transportation legislation, the gentleman from Minnesota, who has a mastery of the English language that when the Congressional Record is reviewed, no matter how many compound, complex sentences that he utters, they always parse. And that's a special gift that the chairman has. In the area of transportation that is so complex, we need people with those abilities to be able to put together complex policies as he does. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much. 
   In this bill there are two provisions which have been blocked for 4 years by the White House and by Republican leadership. They are going to be included in this bill and passed this afternoon. 
   One is to require that all cargo which is placed on passenger planes in the United States is screened so that there is no bomb, there is nothing that can lead to a catastrophic event in the air, does in fact pass through security. This is a huge change. Each of us has our bags screened, our shoes screened; but the cargo on that same plane placed next to our bags is not screened. This bill will make that possible. I have been working with Mr. Shays from Connecticut on this for the last 4 years. Today is a historic day. 
   Secondly, there is an amendment in this bill which will ensure the screening of all ships, all cargo overseas before it departs for the United States to determine whether or not there is a nuclear bomb on that plane. We know that is al Qaeda's highest objective: to obtain a nuclear weapon from the former Soviet Union or from some other rogue state, to then transport it to a port somewhere around the world, put it on a ship and bring it to a port in the United States. When it is in the port of New York or Boston or Long Beach, it is already too late.     
   The bomb will be detonated by remote on the ship, causing the catastrophic event, not as the cargo is being taken off. So this amendment requires the screening of all that cargo overseas. This is long overdue. It is al Qaeda's dream to have a nuclear explosion in a major American city, and now, finally, today we do this. 
   I want to compliment Mr. Nadler on all of his work over the years on this  issue, for his leadership. I thank the chairman, the ranking member, Mr. King, for all of their courtesies over the last several years.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I commend Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Rush for their intensive efforts to produce bipartisan legislation to overhaul a beleaguered agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC. As a tsunami of toxic toys flooded into our country and onto store shelves earlier this year, it became clear that the CPSC was unequipped to perform its vital mission--protecting the public from significant risks of serious injury or death from toys and other consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rush moved swiftly to respond to this crisis of confidence in the CPSC, holding important hearings that exposed major weaknesses at the agency, including an under-resourced and demoralized staff, a lead standard that enabled unsafe lead content in children's products, weak leadership provided by Acting Chairman Nancy Nord and other problems that made the CPSC the ``Can't Protect the Safety of Children'' agency. I congratulate my distinguished colleagues for their work. 
   When the Energy and Commerce Committee considered this legislation yesterday, I voted for it. H.R. 4040 mandates many important improvements at the CPSC and includes much-needed increases in resources for the Commission. Specifically, the bill: 
   Bans lead beyond a minute amount in products intended for children under 12. 
   Requires mandatory safety standards for nursery products, such as cribs and high chairs. 
   Mandates that the CPSC examine the current voluntary safety standards for toys, starting with dangerous magnets, and if found to be inadequate, requires mandatory standards to be adopted. 
   Significantly increases CPSC resources to hire additional staff and for laboratory renovations, including $20 million to modernize the testing lab. The bill allots $80 million for FY2009, $90 million for FY2010 and $100 million for FY2011. 
   Prohibits the export of products that violate U.S. consumer product safety rules, are subject to mandatory or voluntary recalls, are designated an imminent hazard to public health and safety, or are designated as a banned hazardous substance. Similarly, the bill makes the domestic sale of such products a prohibited act. 
   Bans CPSC commissioners and staff from accepting trips paid for by an organization regulated by the CPSC.  
   While this legislation contains urgently needed reforms, I hope that additional enhancements can be made as the bill moves through the legislative process. During committee consideration, I offered two amendments that I believe would have further strengthened this legislation. My first amendment would have created a ``Public Right To Know'' at the CPSC. In 2000 and again in 2003, the CPSC documented cases of children suffering intestinal injuries after swallowing small but powerful magnets that had fallen out of toys. The public didn't know, and the CPSC did nothing. By mid-2005, after more reports of safety concerns associated with the magnets and two reports of life-threatening injuries, the public still didn't know, and the CPSC still did nothing. On Thanksgiving Day 2005, Kenny Sweet died after swallowing magnets that had fallen out of Magnetix toys. And it was only then that the CPSC finally started to pay attention--but it wasn't until the following March and an additional 4 children were hospitalized with injuries that CPSC reached an agreement with the manufacturer to issue a partial recall, and the public finally got an inkling of what was going on. 
   The fundamental problem, even with the positive changes made by Section 206 of this bill--Publicly Available Information on Incidents Involving Injury or Death--is that right now, the only product information one can find on the CPSC Web site is information about products that CPSC has been both able to investigate and get manufacturers' approval to release, or information that does not identify which specific products are causing problems and is therefore of no real use to consumers. 
   My amendment was very simple. It required the CPSC to create a publicly searchable database that would allow consumers to access specific reports CPSC obtains from doctors, hospitals or other individuals of serious injury or death, or risk of serious injury or death that may be due to a faulty or unsafe product. In addition, manufacturers were required to send similar allegations they receive to the CPSC for publication in the database. The language also required CPSC to include a disclaimer that states that each report is provided for informational purposes only and that the commission has not investigated the report and cannot vouch for its accuracy, so that 
   no one would confuse a single report from a consumer with a formal recall by the CPSC. 
   My amendment was developed to empower the public by enabling mothers and fathers to find out whether a product they might buy for their child might pose a risk--without waiting the months or years it could take for CPSC to take action. Although the committee did not approve this amendment, I hope that such protections can be added as this legislation moves forward. 
   My second amendment would have restored the CPSC's authority to investigate accidents occurring on rides located at amusement parks. While CPSC has the authority to investigate rides that are transported to carnivals and county fairs--and 15,000 other categories of consumer products that can endanger consumers--there is no Federal regulation of rides located at amusement parks. 
   A recent Washington Post report contained an extensive, front page investigation of the dangerous consequences of this regulatory black hole. It is entitled ``On Thrill Rides, Safety Is Optional--No Federal Oversight of Theme Parks.'' I recommend this important article to my colleagues. 
   My amendment was developed to put an end to a special interest loophole that prevents Federal consumer safety experts from investigating serious and sometimes fatal accidents even when they believe action is merited. As a result of this loophole, children and other ride enthusiasts are put at risk of serious injury and even death due to the absence of any Federal regulation. States are left to monitor the safety of these rides, and 23 States do not even permit State authorities to investigate accidents that occur at fixed-site amusement park rides within the State. 
   Some argued that State regulation is sufficient. I disagree. I received a letter from a former senior executive in the amusement park industry who also served as a board member for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, IAAPA--the amusement park industry's trade association. This individual was closely involved in the effort in 1981 to carve out the loophole for fixed-site rides that my amendment would have closed. In his letter, he wrote: ``Insurance programs mandated by States or maintained by the operating amusement park companies are often touted as assuring ride safety but many of these programs have gaping holes rendering the programs essentially meaningless. Some State licensing or inspection programs were created to serve not the public, but the industry, providing an illusory aura of safety. I now believe that I was wrong 25 years ago and that the industry should be regulated.'' 
   As this industry insider has now admitted to himself, the time has come to stop using the good intentions and vigorous safety efforts of a few--be they an active State, a particularly attentive company, or even a past board member of the industry's trade association--to cover up the negligence, unsafe practices, and manufacturing defects that are routinely maiming and killing children and adults on rides. Thousands of people are injured every year on these rides, and people die on them every year. 
   My amendment did not mandate the creation of a new fleet of CPSC amusement park inspectors who would be required to fan out across the country to check every amusement park ride. My amendment merely permitted the CPSC--whenever it believed that the public safety would be served--to investigate accidents at amusement parks, share information with operators of rides across State lines, compile statistics that help inform consumers about safety risks and take similar actions to protect the public. Under current law, the hands of CPSC inspectors are tied when it comes to rides at amusement parks, which are off limits to Federal safety regulators. My amendment simply would have freed these inspectors to investigate these rides, when CPSC believes it is warranted. There are now about 90 safety inspectors, some of whom currently investigate accidents at carnival rides--these inspectors and others to be added under this bill--should be permitted to check the safety and investigate accidents at amusement parks. 
   I am pleased that Chairman Rush committed to holding a hearing on this important issue, and I hope that we will soon close the roller coaster loophole, which continues to put children at risk when they board rides at amusement parks around our country. 
   As this bill proceeds, I also hope that there will be advancements in several other areas, including raising the cap on civil penalties for safety violations, improving pre-market testing of toys and other consumer products, and eliminating industry's ability to prevent disclosure to the public of significant safety risks by tying the commission up in Federal court. 
   Madam Speaker, I again commend Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rush for their work on this important bill, and I look forward to working with them in the future on the important consumer protection issues facing our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. There is a certain absurdity to this debate that the poor oil companies have had their hands tied. We've had a President from Texas, an oil man; a Vice President from Texas, an oil man; the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee was from Texas; the chairman of the subcommittee on energy was from Texas; the majority leader was from Texas, all over the time that the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. 
   So during that time, by the way, and this is the good news, the Bush administration actually gave to the oil and gas industry 268 million acres of American land to drill on for oil and gas. Said, You just go and drill there. And guess what we got? Last year, ExxonMobil, the other four big companies, they reported $142 billion worth of profits. Pretty good tipping the American people upside down. 
   How much of it do they put into renewables? How much do they put into the supply side, the new energy sources: wind, solar, all of the new technologies? ExxonMobil: $10 million. They made $42 billion. They put $10 million into renewables. And what else do they say? When we come and say, How about giving back some of those tax breaks so we can give them over to wind and solar, the oil executives said, You can't touch our tax breaks, and by the way, we're also not going to invest in renewables. 
   Well, there's our future. Our future is saying let's go to the most pristine parts of the country. Let's go drill there. Let's not invest in solar; let's not invest in wind; let's not reinvest. That's the plan. 
   By the way, the price of oil under the Bush watch has gone from $30 a barrel to $126 a barrel. It's gone from $1.45 a gallon to $3.72 a gallon. And the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, when the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is filled and ready to go so we can deploy it, the President says he doesn't want to use it. 
   Well, here's the spigot, Mr. President. It's on top of the White House. You just have to turn it, deploy the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the price of a barrel of oil will begin to drop immediately. 
   This is a phony debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. I thank the gentleman very much, and I thank him for his eloquent statement. I thank him for the eulogy which he delivered on behalf of Father Drinan at St. Ignatius Church in Massachusetts on this past Saturday. You captured the essence of Father Drinan in that eulogy, and I thank you for doing that on behalf of all of us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives mourns the passing of Father Robert Drinan, Society of Jesus, Member of Congress. His death is a blow to those of us who revered his wit and wisdom, and a great loss for those who continue to struggle for human rights and life's basic necessities. Yet, tonight we also celebrate Father Drinan's life and know well that the life he brought to the issues of our time will continue to shine on in the efforts of those he touched and those whom he exhorted to do more. 
   I had the privilege of having Father Drinan as my dean at Boston College Law School. I met him in August of 1968 as the school year at Boston College Law School was about to commence. But the truth is that I had set my goal to attend Boston College Law School 6 years before when I was a sophomore in high school because it became my goal to go to Boston College Law School so that I could have Father Drinan as my dean; and, to be honest with you, I didn't even know if you had to go to college in order to go to law school, such was my desire to go and to be in this school that was training lawyers to help humanity. 
   At Boston College Law School in the late 1960s, Father Drinan used his power as the dean of that school to actively recruit minorities, to actively recruit women to come to Boston College Law School. He did so using the greatest power that a dean of a law school has, and that is admissions and full scholarships. He wanted Boston College Law School to be at the cutting edge of the change which was taking place in our society, and he wanted to ensure that those who had been excluded from our society would be given access to the law school education that they would need in order to effect the laws in our society. And today, all of those who were exposed to him during the years that he was dean at Boston College Law School continue to have a debt to him, not only those to whom he brought in, in order to ensure that they were not excluded, but all of the rest of us who were then exposed to these injustices and the remedies to them that Father Drinan ensured that that law school embodied. 
   Just a few years after graduating from Boston College Law School, only 4 years later, I had the great honor of coming here as Father Drinan's colleague. I felt that there was no greater honor in fact in being elected to Congress than in knowing that I would be his colleague. It seemed somewhat asymmetrical that I would have the same vote that he had here on the House floor. And when he would consult me on which choice he should make, should he become the chairman of the criminal law subcommittee or the immigration subcommittee, it was an honor for me to be consulted by Father Drinan as a young man now, but his colleague in Congress, as to what was the best place. And his criteria of course was what was the best place where he could do the most good for those most in need in our society. And of course, the way he saw our society was not just the United States of America but the whole planet. 
   So I had that unique opportunity to see him in both of those settings, both in law school and here on the House floor. And I saw him play the role of the catalyst, of the idealist, of the man who continued to push others when they say they can go no further in trying to strive for excellence and to stand up for an ideal. And that is the role that Father Drinan played not just in law school and not just here in Congress, but for the last 26 years since he left this Chamber. 
   When we stand in this Chamber of Congress, when Members of Congress are coming here to cast their vote, all of our names are flashed up on a board over the head of the Speaker to vote ``aye'' or ``nay'' on the key issues of our time. During the years that Father Drinan was a Congressman, as the Members would look up to see how other Members of Congress voted, when they looked up at Father Drinan's name, they knew he was not casting a vote looking at the next election, but rather he was looking at the next generation on every vote. And that led to almost every one of his elections being as close as an election can be, because he was not factoring in his own electoral life but rather the life of every person in our society. His vote was true north, every vote that he cast here in Congress. 
   As a Jesuit, he clearly lived up to the Jesuitical ideal of being a contemplative in action. He worked tirelessly for both tolerance and for social justice. He took on each task in this institution, large and small, as he did others in life, and offered them Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, To the Greater Glory of God, which was a favorite phrase of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order. 
   He was unambiguous in his convictions that America could do better, could aspire to greater things for its people and the world. The direct and candid quality of Father Drinan's personality added to the moral force that Father Drinan brought to the quality of the debate in this Chamber. His personality animated these discussions in hearings and debates here on the floor. His eloquent, passionate, heartfelt speeches are greatly missed. 
   Madam Speaker, I think that one of the real ironies of Father Drinan's career is that at its very end here in 
   Congress, in his very last term here that he served in this body, that he was unopposed. In other words, just at the point at which he had convinced those who lived in his district that in fact not only was he not outside the main stream, but his views were those that should be embraced by everyone who lived within that district, he was unopposed. He had fought Richard Nixon on Vietnam; he had called for Richard Nixon's impeachment because of the illegal bombing on Cambodia. He was someone who, by the time he had reached 1980, people looked up to with admiration that he had been unafraid during those fights during the early 1970s, one that had been able to now command the admiration of everyone in this body. 
   His defense of human rights was tireless, from the plight of Soviet Jewry to the victims of apartheid to the dislocated and the powerless in Central America. He risked his own life in going down to Central America after the assassination of Archbishop Romero. He was the first. His voice was the most powerful. He brought a moral dimension to the crimes that were being committed in Central America. He elevated that to a point where Congress had to deal with it. He mobilized the Jesuit community, the moral community not only here but around the world to focus on what was happening in Central America. It was Father Drinan. And he was literally risking his life when he went down there in those early years. There was no protection for him. That was the unwavering commitment of his life, that he would use it in order to advance the cause of those who were most powerless. 
   And at Trinity College, as Speaker Pelosi said, on the day before she was sworn in he delivered a sermon to each of us who was there on our responsibilities to help the children of Darfur, the children of Katrina, and every child in need of help around the planet. And he told us that it was our job here to make sure that those children were taken care of, that God's work was truly our own here in this great body. 
   Now, when Father Drinan was forced to choose between political life and his priestly life, it really wasn't a choice. On that day, I went up into his office and sat with him and I asked him how he felt. And he said, ``EDDIE, it really isn't a difficult choice. I am a priest for life, not a politician. I will find other ways to serve God, and I will be able to accept this, although it is difficult.'' And that is just how he was. And for the next 26 years, it can be argued that he had the most productive part of his life, because during those 26 years he, then at Georgetown Law School, trained thousands of young lawyers to go out across this country and across this world in order to advocate on behalf of human rights. 
   So he showed us how we could pursue justice, seek continued incremental progress towards peace, towards a more  just distribution of society's assets, and towards a Nation which celebrated diversity and fostered tolerance. 
   In the final analysis, Father Robert Drinan was a gift to all of us. Here in the House of Representatives, the memory of this iconic and comprehensively decent man of our friend and our colleague will be long remembered and venerated. He will be sorely missed not just here in Washington and in Massachusetts, but all around the world. 
   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I come to the floor today to debate funding for President Bush's war in Iraq, yet again, as more innocent Americans and Iraqis fall victim to a horrible and debilitating violence that has not only torn Iraq apart, but threatens the stability of the entire Middle East.  
   We should not be having this debate at all, because the President should have changed course long ago. The President has had so many opportunities to reevaluate his policies in Iraq that his failure to do so can only be explained by an absolute unwillingness to admit that he has made a grave mistake. He continues to act as if nothing is wrong, even as Baghdad burns and the body count of dead Iraqi civilians and dead American troops continues to rise. He continues to send more troops to Iraq even as the Army, Marines, and National Guard are all straining to the breaking point. He continues to ignore the will of the American people who want an end to this war, even as public opinion turns ever more decisively against his failed war policy 
   Madam Speaker, it is far past time for a new direction in Iraq. The American people do not want to be there, and the Iraqis do not want to have us there. Only the President and his dwindling cadre of head-in-the-sand advisors believe that the United States is on the right course in Iraq. 
   I am tremendously disappointed that the President, in the face of the utter collapse of his policies in Iraq, refuses to change course. I supported the first supplemental bill we passed this year for a simple reason: It contained language to force an end to this disastrous war. But in his legendary stubbornness and his inability to see reason, the President vetoed that bill. I also supported the House version of the second supplemental appropriations bill, because that bill established strict benchmarks for progress by the Iraqi Government and military and required the President to certify that progress to the Congress, or else face a cutoff of funds to pursue the war. 
   But the supplemental that we will vote on today does not require the troops to come home, and does not establish strict benchmarks to ensure accountability, and for these reasons I will oppose it. But today's vote does not end the effort in Congress to end the war. There will be future votes, and I believe that as the public continues to make its opposition to this war clear, there will be continued pressure on the White House and on congressional Republicans to change course. We will end this war eventually, but today I must oppose this appropriations bill because it fails to take the steps needed to advance the goal of bringing our valiant troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. And I want to commend especially the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) for his historic leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Time and again, the opponents of Mr. Stupak's measure have exhorted us not to interfere with the free market, not to let the Federal Government help consumers in the face of price gouging.     
   Even as gas prices have sped past $4 a gallon, it is all just a matter of supply and demand, say the oil companies and Republican leaders in Washington. Well, it is a matter of supply and demand: consumers are being forced to supply whatever money the oil companies demand from them at the pump. 
   The oil companies have the consumer over a barrel, a barrel of oil, that the oil companies control and that they price. They tip the consumer upside down at the pump every single day and shake every bit of money out of their pockets, which they can. 
   The Christians had a better chance against the lions than the American consumer has against the oil companies at the pumps in the United States today. And all we are saying, all Mr. Stupak is saying is let's give the Federal Government a sword to get into the battle, to get into the arena on behalf of the American consumer. 
   The bill before us today would give the Federal Trade Commission new authority to investigate and punish the wholesale or retail sale of gasoline or other petroleum distillates at prices that are unconscionably excessive, or take unfair advantage of consumers during any Presidentially declared national or regional energy emergency. 
   The Republicans think that is terrible. Why would you pass a law against unconscionably excessive or unfair practices that are tipping the consumers upside down. Don't give the Federal Government that kind of authority to take on the oil and gas industry. And President Bush and Dick Cheney, the oil President and Vice President for 8 years, are saying that they will veto legislation that gives authority to go after excessive, unconscionable pricing of gasoline. 
   Under the bill, the Justice Department could impose criminal penalties of up to $150 million on corporations, and fines of up to $2 million and jail sentences of up to 10 years for individuals. The legislation would give the regulators the tools they need to more aggressively aid consumers when the oil companies are turning them upside down. 
   When President Bush took office, the price of oil was $30 a barrel. A couple of years ago, oil at $100 a barrel was unthinkable. Now we are up to $135 a barrel. 
   So the first energy crisis back in 1973-1974, it was an oil embargo; 1979-1980, a revolution in Iran. What has been going on for the last year? How could the price of oil double and everyone says it is not a crisis in the White House. How about manipulation. How about fraud. How about the consumer being taken advantage of at the pump. 
   I thank the gentleman for his good leadership.

   Mr. MARKEY. I hate to say this because there is a bit of the capitalist, the unregulated capitalist in all of us. But when I had my Fudgsicles, my chocolate eclairs, my strawberry shortcakes, my twin fudges, and Mr. Softie wasn't coming down the same street, there is a tendency to try to raise the price because there is no one else in the market and there is no regulator going up and down those streets. And if you are outside Fenway Park and there are 35,000 fans coming out and there is no regulator around to say what you can charge as an audience is coming toward you in desperate need of a Popsicle, of a Fudgsicle or a Coke, you have a tendency without a regulator to charge unconscionably high prices. 
   Now at the time, I didn't think of it that way because, of course, the capitalist never thinks that way. That is why you need regulators to protect consumers against anyone who is selling any product in the marketplace. And that's the lesson I learned. 
   And I decided early, I was not going to do that any longer, I was going to move over to the regulatory side to protect consumers against human nature that sometimes can affect certain corporate chieftains, especially in the oil industry, to tip consumers upside down and take advantage of them.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. 
   Many of my Republican friends seem to think that they know better than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its elected representatives when it comes to meeting our state's energy needs. They claim to know not only how much LNG we need in our region, but also where these LNG terminals should be located. 
   I have some news for my Republican friends: you have been sold a bill of goods by the developer of the failed Weaver's Cove project, a project that was rejected by the Coast Guard which will never be built. Before you shed another crocodile tear about our need for LNG, I would like to share with you some facts about LNG in Massachusetts. 
   The fact is that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has more LNG terminals in operation or approved by both Federal and State regulators than any other State in the Union! We already have two LNG importation terminals in operation, and we also have a third terminal that will become operational by next year. 
   Now that is a larger number of LNG terminals than is currently in place in any other State of the Union. In fact--when all three terminals are in place, we will have more LNG terminals in Massachusetts than Texas and Louisiana have today. 
   So, my Republican friends should stop shedding those crocodile tears about the need for more LNG in Massachusetts. Our State has already seen that need, and we have already responded to it. 
   Since 1971, there has been an LNG terminal in my district in Everett, Massachusetts. That terminal has been in operation longer than any other LNG importation terminal in the country. In fact, between 1971 and 2003, the Everett terminal has received about half of all of the LNG imported into the United States. The Everett terminal has two LNG storage tanks that have a combined storage capacity of 3.4 billion cubic feet, and the terminal can vaporize this LNG into natural gas at a rate of approximately 1 billion cubic feet each day. Now, this is a facility that is located right in the middle of a densely populated urban area, and never could be built there today due to safety and security concerns. 
   But we need the gas that this facility produces, so we are forced to continue operating it. The Everett LNG terminal, currently operated by the Suez company, today meets 20 percent of New England's annual natural gas demand. The local natural gas distribution companies served by this terminal store the LNG that they receive from the Everett terminal in satellite terminals all around New England. That allows this LNG to meet an additional 15 percent of New England's peak natural gas demand. So, nearly 40 percent of New England's peak demand for natural gas is served by the existing Everett facility. 
   Now, in addition to the Everett LNG terminal, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has also approved two additional offshore LNG terminals to meet our future 
   demand. We learned from the lesson of Everett with these facilities, and wisely chose to locate them offshore, away from any populated areas where they could be an attractive target to terrorists. 
   The first offshore LNG terminal is called the Northeast Gateway. It is owned by a company called Excelerate, and it is located about 13 miles off the coast north of Boston in Massachusetts Bay. This offshore facility re-gasifies the LNG on the tanker ship, turning it back into natural gas, and then sends that gas into the existing HUB line, which is a natural gas pipeline off our coast. The Excelerate LNG facility received 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in March, but has received no additional LNG deliveries since then because of low demand. According to Excelerate, this offshore terminal is capable of accommodating up to 800 million cubic feet of natural gas each day future growth, though they initially are projecting that it would operate at a rate of 500 million cubic feet per day and a peak capability to 600 million cubic feet per day. 
   In addition to this first offshore LNG terminal, there is also a second LNG terminal, which is being built by Suez, the owner of the Everett LNG terminal. Neptune, a liquefied natural gas, LNG, offshore deepwater port, is also being built approximately 10 miles off the coast of Gloucester. Neptune has received all Federal, State and local permits and approvals to proceed with construction. Pipeline construction and testing are planned for mid-July through September 2008. Work on the pipeline connection to HubLine and the buoy installation are scheduled to begin in May and end in September 2009. Neptune will be prepared to receive LNG shipments by late 2009. 
   When completed, the Neptune LNG project will be capable of delivering approximately 400 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to the region, or enough to heat 1.5 million homes, and 750 million cubic feet per day a peak winter day. 
   So, the bottom line is that with these two new facilities, we will be going from an LNG capacity of 750 million metric cubic feet per day of natural gas, and 1 billion cubic feet per day in peak periods, up to 1.65 billion cubic feet per day routine delivery capacity, and 2.45 billion peak delivery capacity. 
   The proposed LNG terminal at Weaver's Cove has been rejected by the Coast Guard. It is opposed by virtually every elected official in Massachusetts. It would be located right in the middle of an urban area, just like Everett. It makes no sense from a security standpoint in a post-9/11 world. The Coast Guard has already said no to Weaver's Cove. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has already said no. The developer doesn't like that, but his proposal has been rejected. It is going nowhere. It's not going to happen. 
   It also makes little economic sense to build this facility, at this location, at this time. There is not sufficient economic justification for this facility in light of the three existing or planned LNG terminals in our State. These three existing LNG facilities can meet our State's needs for natural gas for many, many years, and if we need to build another LNG terminal in the future, our State has already demonstrated that we are willing to move quickly to approve the siting of offshore LNG terminals that allow LNG to be imported into our State without any of the safety or terrorism risks associated with the siting of another urban LNG terminal. 
   So, don't pretend that this bill to designate the Taunton River as a wild and scenic river has anything to do with LNG. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not need this facility. Federal regulators have already rejected it. We already have two LNG terminals in our State, with a third on the way, and if we need more LNG in the future we can build more offshore terminals. We've demonstrated a willingness and ability to do so. 
   I urge the adoption of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for her leadership on this issue. 
   As the Chairman of the Select Committee on Global Warming, I conducted  a hearing 3 weeks ago in which Retired General Gordon Sullivan, speaking for eleven senior retired three- and four-star admirals and generals, released and testified on a report entitled ``National Security and the Threat of Climate Change,'' which called for global warming to be fully integrated into the military and defense planning. 
   Here's what General Sullivan testified to. He said that he was the Army chief of staff when we lost 19 men in Mogadishu. He testified before the Select Committee on Global Warming that with more drought we will see more disasters such as Black Hawk Down. Drought caused famine, famine caused food relief, food relief caused warlords to fight over it, the warlords fighting caused the U.S. to intervene, and 19 U.S. fighting men were killed. He added, and I quote, that the same thing is what is driving Darfur and there has to be some recognition that these issues are at the heart environmentally related. 
   These are men who have dedicated their lives to protecting our country. They are asking us to do a National Intelligence Estimate about what the impact is of climate leading to drought, leading to famine, leading to conflicts, leading to the American military or other of our allies having been dedicated to preserving the peace. That is no small request from 11 retired three-star generals and admirals.

   It is not inappropriate for the CIA to tell us how the increasing scarcity of water could exacerbate the very failed state conditions which breed terrorism. It is not politically correct to want the military services to know how polar ice melt could alter the patrols of our submarines or how rising sea levels could threaten not only our naval facilities but also our crucial shipbuilding infrastructure. 
   It is not pre-9/11 mindset that wants to study how our ability to project power from the Pacific would be damaged if our crucial air base at Diego Garcia, average elevation 4 feet above sea level, changes from a land-based stationary aircraft carrier to a sub-sea ruin. 
   That is in the interest of the national security of our country.

   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce the newest Member of the 110th Congress, the gentlelady from the Fifth Congressional District of Massachusetts, Niki Tsongas. 
   Niki Tsongas is the eldest of four sisters who grew up in a military family bouncing between air bases all across the United States, Europe, and Japan. In 1967, while her father was stationed at the Pentagon, she met her future husband, our late distinguished House colleague, Paul Tsongas, while he was working just across the street as an intern in the office of then Fifth District Congressman Brad Morse. 
   NIKI was Paul's soul mate and his strongest supporter when he ran successfully to join us here in the House of Representatives in January of 1975 and for the Senate in 1978. She was at Paul's side when he ran for the Presidency in 1992 and when he fought so valiantly against the cancer that finally claimed him in 1997. 
   Over the years, NIKI TSONGAS has been a social worker, a community leader in Lowell, a lawyer, and an educator. As a community leader, she has had a passion for social and environmental justice, which she brings with her as she arrives in Congress. And through it all, she was an amazing mother to three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly. 
   Lowell and the Merrimack Valley has a strong industrial past, and nobody will better represent the roll-up-your-sleeves, hard work persona of this area like NIKI TSONGAS. 
   In January, our delegation was proud to cast our votes for the first female Speaker of the House. Today, I am proud to introduce the first female Member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation in 25 years. 
   I give you the distinguished gentlelady from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Congresswoman NIKI TSONGAS.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this authorization bill, and I commend Chairman Thompson for his hard work in shepherding this important bill to the Floor  today. Today is a monumental moment for the Homeland Security Committee and for this House, as we bring forward an authorization bill to the floor--which our Committee was unable to do during the last Congress. 
   I am proud that the bill we are considering today to authorize the operations of the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2008 includes a vital first responder provision on the Metropolitan Medical Response System--or MMRS. I'd like to thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership and also recognize the work of Subcommittee Chair Sanchez and Ranking Member King on this important program. 
   Despite the Bush administration's repeated efforts to eliminate this unique and effective program, Congress has wisely and consistently appropriated funds for MMRS over the years, providing $33 million for the program this year. While preservation of the MMRS program is paramount, new duties and responsibilities assigned to MMRS--such as response to an avian flu pandemic--require additional funding. That is why I am pleased that the authorization bill contains funding at the $63 million level per year for fiscal year 2008 through 2011. 
   The authorization bill also resolves programmatic problems that MMRS responders have faced as they work to perform their difficult jobs. 
   Specifically, the bill clarifies that the cap on personnel expenses, which had been set at 15 percent of the grant funding a jurisdiction receives, is lifted. This change will ensure that jurisdictions have the resources--if needed--to hire and retain experienced and talented personnel. The bill we are considering today also makes clear that MMRS jurisdictions should have the authority they need to come to the aid of neighboring jurisdictions in emergencies--even if they are located across State lines--without being impeded by unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions. And the bill directs the Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs to conduct a review of the MMRS program and report to Congress on the several issues that could further strengthen the program, such as whether MMRS would be more effective if it were once again managed through a contractual agreement with the Federal Government rather than through the current process, which requires Federal funding to be passed through State administrative offices before the funds can be released to the MMRS jurisdictions. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you know, the MMRS program is the only Federal program that helps first responders, medical personnel, emergency management workers, and businesses develop effective, integrated capabilities to minimize casualties in the event of a terrorist attack using a weapon of mass destruction, a natural disaster such as a hurricane, or a public health emergency including an avian flu outbreak. 
   As demonstrated by the Bush administration's failed response to Hurricane Katrina, our country has a dangerous ``Preparedness Gap''. Established after the Oklahoma City bombing, the MMRS program is designed to increase our Nation's preparedness capabilities through grants that currently provide funding to 125 jurisdictions in 43 States. 
   The MMRS program helps local first responder and ``first receivers'' such as doctors, emergency medical technicians and public health officials buy the specialized equipment and get the training needed to act in a coordinated fashion that will save lives in the event of a mass casualty event--whether it's a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. 
   In the post 9/11 era, there can be no doubt that Al Qaeda is willing and capable of launching attacks on the United States. Moreover, the ongoing potential for severe hurricanes and flooding remind us of the urgent need to be prepared to respond in an organized, effective way to all hazards. The MMRS program is an essential part of our preparedness capability. 
   Our MMRS personnel across the Nation are hometown heroes. But even heroes need help. Thank you, Chairman THOMPSON, for your help and support of this program, and I urge my colleagues to support the authorization bill. 
   I would also like to note the strong need for this bill's cyber-security improvements. The Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Internet, which I chair, and full Energy and Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman Dingell, have worked on a bipartisan basis, with Ranking Members Upton and Barton, to address cyber threats within the Department of Homeland Security in order to ensure that our country is adequately prepared for massive disruptions from cyber attacks. 
   This measure provides needed guidance to DHS on these Congressional expectations. Moreover, this legislation will require the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications at DHS to collaborate with the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission--agencies that have established roles in protecting vital telecommunications and cyber assets. Such collaboration will ensure that ongoing efforts will not be interrupted or wastefully duplicated at the Department of Homeland Security. For example, NTIA's organizing statute establishes the head of NTIA as the President's principal adviser on telecommunications issues. In addition, the agency is compelled by the same law to pursue policies to foster national safety and security, to promote efficient use of Federal spectrum, to coordinate Federal telecommunications assistance to State and local governments, and to coordinate the Executive Branch's telecommunications activities, including the formulation of policies and standards for interoperability, security, and emergency readiness and ongoing review of management of the Internet domain name system. 
   The FCC also protects telecommunications and cybersecurity, and under the Communications Act is responsible for assuring rapid and efficient communication services with adequate facilities for the purpose of the national defense and promotion of the safety of life and property. 
   I also support amending this important legislation in order to address the pressing need to improve interoperable communications among first responders. This is something that we have been working on for several years. Representatives Cardoza's expected amendment does not limit interoperability efforts to a single technology or solution. This is vitally important, especially given the history at DHS with grant programs for these efforts. Last year, Congress established a $1 billion interoperability grant program at the Department of Commerce, distinct from DHS's efforts, so that the Commerce Department could draw upon its spectrum and telecommunications expertise. In their respective programs, both DHS and the Department of Commerce should include methodologies to better ensure that funds for interoperability are being used effectively. DHS would do well to implement all of the recommendations of the GAO suggested in its recent report. There is a significant amount of work that DHS must perform in order to improve its interoperability efforts and we will be watching such efforts closely.

   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. 
   We've heard about how Wal-Mart reduces costs through the purchasing power of their ``Sam's Clubs.'' 
   Well today we are establishing ``Uncle Sam's Club'', a smart way of pooling the enormous purchasing power of the Medicare program and enabling the Secretary to drive down the cost of prescription drugs through negotiation. 
   Fortune 500 companies and large pharmacy chains all across the country negotiate for better drug prices on behalf of their patients. 
   It is now time for the Secretary of HHS to do the same on behalf of millions of seniors in the Medicare program. 
   When the Republicans passed their prescription drug bill, they explicitly prohibited the Secretary of HHS from negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry to get better drug prices for seniors. 
   They seem to have forgotten that the government is supposed to work for the public interest, not the special interests. Unfortunately, it has become necessary to remove that giveaway to the special interests and remind the Secretary of his public interest obligations. In this bill we require the Secretary to work on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities to make sure they get the best possible deal on prescription drugs. 
   The Republican's prescription drug bill has failed to get the cost of prescription drugs under control. Last year drug prices rose at twice the rate of inflation. 
   The Medicare Prescription Drug Act was supposed to help seniors pay for their prescription drugs, but instead it became a means to keep drug prices and company profits at record high levels. 
   It is long past time for the Secretary to use his negotiating power to help seniors avoid choosing between buying the drugs they need and paying for their rent or food. 
   Vote for your constituents for a change. It is good medicine. Vote for H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Chairman, I rise with an amendment that I am making in conjunction with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce). Our  language seeks to make some technical corrections to ensure that affordable housing is preserved in three housing developments, two located in Ohio and one in Massachusetts. 
   The low-income tenants of the Heritage Apartments in Malden, Massachusetts, are facing possible displacement once an outstanding HUD mortgage is fully paid in a few years. The development is also in need of major renovations and upgrades that simply cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, HUD is failing to ensure that the development remains affordable and livable by placing burdensome regulations and restrictions on prepayment of the outstanding mortgage and subsequent transfer to a new owner who is willing to finance the renovations. My amendment would allow income-eligible residents to qualify for enhanced housing vouchers following the prepayment of the HUD mortgage and the property transfer and directs HUD to approve such actions. 
   I will defer to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) to explain the portion of our amendment which deals with maintaining affordability in housing developments located in her congressional district in Ohio. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has determined that adoption of this language would result in $1 million in net savings to current mandatory spending over the next 5 years because HUD is currently paying mortgage interest reduction payments for the development which would be nullified upon adoption of the Markey-Pryce amendment. 
   The amendment is supported by the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. It is also supported by the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, and the National Association of Home Builders. And I urge adoption of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   It is long past time that the disaster in Iraq is brought to an end. 
   The President's failed policy in Iraq has been repudiated by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, his inability to extricate the United States from a quagmire in the desert has been rejected by the voters, and we must change course. The President has proven himself to be either blind to the reality on the ground in Iraq or simply uncaring of what that reality means for the stability of the Middle East and the security of the United States of America. 
   The President took this country to war on false premises. There were no weapons of mass destruction, there was no imminent threat, there were no operational ties to al-Qaeda. And the administration knew, because we had U.N. weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq for months before the invasion, that the so-called ``intelligence'' pointing to an active and dangerous Iraqi WMD program was simply wrong. Over and over again, Hans Blix and his teams of inspectors would launch surprise visits on sites that the CIA had pointed them to, and over and over again the U.S. intelligence would be proved incorrect. 
   We have been fighting in Iraq longer than we fought in the Second WorId War. Within a few months, we will have spent more money in Iraq than we did in the more than 10 years we were in Vietnam. And while a very small segment of our citizenry is being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice for this adventure by sending their loved ones to war, the Bush administration has given billions of dollars in tax breaks to the richest Americans. If this war were truly a national struggle, underpinned by the faith and support of the public, the sacrifices would be shared by all instead of borne by the few. 
   Since President Bush infamously declared ``Mission Accomplished'' over 4 years ago, the situation has only gotten worse and worse. The administration never had a plan to win the peace, and still does not, and as a result the peace cannot be won. Our brave men and women in uniform are caught in the midst of a multifaceted civil war which can only be brought to an end with political reconciliation, not military engagement. 
   Unfortunately, the President stubbornly refuses to understand the nature of the conflict into which he has dragged us. He refuses to change course, but more of the same cannot any longer be an option. We must extricate ourselves from a sectarian civil war which is bleeding our military every single day. This bill will begin the responsible redeployment of US forces out of Iraq within 120 days, and complete that deployment by April 1, 2008. On that date, we will have been in Iraq for more than 5 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman SKELTON for bringing this resolution before us and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, September 11 was a very important day in Boston history. Mohammed Atta and nine other terrorists hijacked two planes with hundreds of people on them 2 miles from my house and flew them into the World Trade Center, killing not only the people in the World Trade Center, but all of the people on those two planes from Logan airport. 
   For the last 5 years, we've had a fight over whether or not we should screen  the cargo which goes on passenger planes in our country. Yes, each of us has to take off our shoes, our bags have to go through, we have to take off our wristwatches, children's baby carriages have to be inspected. But, believe it or not, then the cargo is placed right under our feet, and it's not screened. Billions of pounds of cargo not screened. 
   And so this cargo loophole has been fought by the cargo industry, opposed by the Bush administration, but now it is in this legislation. And henceforth, all of the cargo which goes onto passenger planes in our country, placed next to the bags of passengers, placed under the feet of passengers on planes, will also be screened. And so now cargo will have this on it. Screened, safe to place upon those planes. It is a huge moment in security. This bill is historic. 
   And secondly, although the Bush administration has opposed it, this legislation also includes my language which is going to require the screening of cargo on ships coming into ports in the United States. 
   Right now cargo with a nuclear bomb in it, which we know is al Qaeda's top goal, to obtain a nuclear weapon from someplace in the former Soviet Union, move it to a port in the world and move that ship with the cargo into New York, into Long Beach, into Boston, and then detonate the nuclear bomb before it is taken out of the cargo hold of that ship, destroying that American city. Because of the language in this bill, that cargo will now be screened in the port overseas before it ever leaves for our country. It will be screened for a nuclear bomb overseas, thwarting the highest objective which al Qaeda has, which is to detonate a nuclear bomb. 
   Now, I can understand the Bush administration's misgivings about it, and I understand that many of the Senators, Republican Senators will not sign this conference report because of this requirement. I think they're making a historic mistake. This is at the top of the terrorist target list. This is what they want to do to American cities, detonate a nuclear bomb on a ship already docked in a port in the United States before it's ever taken off that ship. 
   This legislation is historic. I congratulate Chairman Thompson. I congratulate the staff. I congratulate the bipartisan nature for the vast majority of this legislation. It is overdue. It is overdue. 
   We must put in place the defense, now, against al Qaeda returning to finish their plot against us here in the homeland. 
   Al Qaeda came to Boston to begin this attack. There's no reason to believe they can't return to those very same planes, to those very same docks where al Qaeda came in. They came in through the ports of Boston to, in fact, wreak this catastrophic event on our country. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, as the principal author of the air cargo security provision in Section 1602 of the conference report--Screening of Cargo Carried Aboard Passenger Aircraft--I want to make several points clear. 
   While the House version of the bill used the term ``inspected'' and the Senate version used ``screened'', neither bill actually defined these terms. The language in the final version of the bill does define ``screening'', and it makes clear that screening does not mean what DHS currently considers screening--reviews of manifests, information about shippers (Known Shipper program), etc. 
   To make clear what is meant by screening, the final bill states that: 
   The system used to screen 100 percent of cargo carried on passenger planes must provide a level of security on par with the level of security for passengers' checked bags. Specifically, the language states that the system ``shall require, at a minimum, that equipment, technology, procedures, personnel or other methods approved by the Administrator of TSA are used to screen cargo carried on passenger planes to provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage.'' (emphasis added). A 3-year deadline is established to get to 100 percent, with an interim benchmark of 50 percent of cargo within 18 months of enactment. 
   Screening means an examination of the cargo's contents, not just information about the cargo, consistent with the mandate that the cargo screening must be on par with the security standard for screening of passengers' checked bags. The bill stipulates the cargo screening methods TSA is to use to meet this standard: ``Methods of screening include x-ray systems, explosive detection systems, explosive trace detection, explosive detection canine teams certified by the TSA, or a physical search together with manifest verification.'' These are methods currently used for checked bags. 
   While TSA may approve additional methods, they cannot be solely data checks, and must also utilize physical checks. As the final language makes clear: ``The Committee is also concerned about TSA using data checks of cargo or shippers ..... as a single factor in determining whether cargo poses a threat to transportation security. The Conference substitute, therefore, requires that if such data checks are used, they must be paired with additional physical or nonintrusive screening method approved by TSA that examines the cargo's contents.'' (emphasis added). 
   There has been some discussion in the media about Congress's intent in passing this provision. I want to address these points and make clear the intent of the provision. 
   One concern that was raised is that as much as 60 percent of air cargo could be exempt from a mandatory physical inspection at airports, under a new program to be called Certified Shipper. 
   As noted above, the language in the final version of the bill requires that the system for screening all cargo on passenger planes must ``provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage.'' All cargo on passenger planes must be physically examined before it is loaded onboard, a major departure from current practice. While TSA may be considering a so-called ``Certified Shipper'' program that would require physical examination of all cargo in a location off the airport grounds and then a sealing of the cargo containers with tamper-proof seals, this plan, and any such system developed by TSA, must provide a level of cargo security on par with the level of security for checked bags, which includes the requirement that the contents of all the cargo must be physically checked. 
   The final version of the bill mandates that the Department of Homeland Security issue a rule to implement a system consistent with the bill's 100 percent cargo screening requirement. Congress, along with stakeholders who have been working to require 100 percent screening of all cargo carried on passenger planes, will be watching TSA's plans closely to ensure that the implementation of the cargo screening mandate in the bill is performed in a manner that complies with the mandate in the final version of the bill. If TSA's system does not ``provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage'' as required in the bill, it will not be in compliance with the congressional mandate in the final version of the bill, and therefore will be in jeopardy of being halted or modified by Congress to bring it into compliance with the law. 
   Another concern that has been raised is that companies that participate in the Certified Shipper program would still have to follow security rules, including conducting their own package inspections and putting special tamperproof seals on containers, but packages handled by these companies, which will probably represent the bulk of the air cargo industry, would generally be exempt from mandated electronic, canine or other physical inspections at the airport. 
   Again, a so-called ``Certified Shipper'' program or any other program that TSA develops to implement the mandate to screen 100 percent of the cargo on passenger planes must meet the standard that it provides a level of security on par with the level of security for passenger checked bags. At this point, it is unclear whether a program that screens and then seals cargo outside the airport perimeter would meet this standard. 
   In an April 2007 report requested by Representative Markey and other Members, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that the Department of Homeland Security is conducting pilot programs to test a number of currently employed technologies used in other areas of aviation and transportation security, as well as new technologies. These pilot programs include an air cargo security seals pilot, which is exploring the viability of potential security countermeasures, such as tamper-evident security seals. According to GAO, TSA anticipates completing its pilot tests by 2008. (GAO-07-660 Aviation Security). Before implementation of any TSA air cargo program relying on seals, a thorough, comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of such seals will have to be conducted. Again, if such a system does not ``provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage'' as required in the bill, it will not be in compliance with the congressional mandate in the final version of the bill, and therefore will be in jeopardy of being halted or modified by Congress to bring it into compliance with the law. 
   Another concern that has been raised is that a program similar to Certified Shipper that is  used by Customs and Border Patrol for ship cargo has frequently been criticized. Auditors have found that companies in this program are sometimes permitted to move their goods more quickly even though there is insufficient proof that they have a robust security system in place. 
   The program referred to above is called the Customs--Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). I have criticized C-TPAT for many of the same reasons cited above. In fact, in addition to the air cargo screening requirement, the final version of the bill also includes a requirement that 100 percent of maritime cargo must be screened and sealed overseas before it arrives in U.S. ports. Clearly, with the inclusion of this mandate in the final version of the bill, Congress rejected C-TPAT as a substitute for 100 percent scanning of maritime containers. It did not intend, nor would it permit, a program for screening 100 percent of air cargo that is based on the flawed C-TPAT program. 
   By establishing the standard that TSA's system for screening 100 percent of cargo on passenger planes must ``provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage'', the final version of the bill creates requirements much more stringent than the C-TPAT program. C-TPAT uses risk-based process, not mandatory, comprehensive screening. Specifically, C-TPAT security guidelines state that ``C-TPAT recognizes the complexity of international supply chains and endorses the application and implementation of security measures based upon risk analysis. Therefore, the program allows for flexibility and the customization of security plans based on the member's business model. As listed throughout this document appropriate security measures, based on risk, must be implemented and maintained throughout the Air Carrier's supply chains'' (emphasis added, http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/import/commercial 
    &lt;enforcement/ctpat/security &lt;guideline/ 
   guideline &lt;air &lt;carrier.xml) 
   The air cargo provision requires 100 percent screening, not risk assessment. The air cargo provision mandates screening of all cargo carried on passenger planes within 3 years. Under the air cargo provision in the conference report, no risk calculation is permitted to determine whether or which cargo to screen; rather, all cargo is presumed to present a risk and must be screened, just as all of passengers' checked bags must be screened under the current policy. 
   The C-TPAT program relies on data and manifest information, not physical checks. C-TPAT guidelines advise program participants in the procedural security measures they should use for the shipping and receiving of cargo. These procedures rely on data and manifest checks, not the physical screening of the cargo to determine and evaluate its contents. Specifically, the C-TPAT guidelines state that: ``Arriving cargo should be reconciled against information on the cargo manifest. The cargo should be accurately described, weighed, labeled, marked, counted and verified. Departing cargo should be checked against purchase or delivery orders.'' (emphasis added) 
   Whatever system TSA establishes to implement the 100 percent air cargo screening requirement in the bill will be subjected to close congressional scrutiny to ensure that it meets the standard established in the bill; namely, the system must provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked baggage, as stipulated in the bill. Again, any TSA system that fails to meet this standard will not be in compliance with the congressional mandate in the final version of the bill, and therefore will be in jeopardy of being halted or modified by Congress to bring it into compliance with the law.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (ESTABLISHING NATIONAL TUNNEL INSPECTION STANDARDS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 409. This legislation will require that tunnels are inspected with the same kind of intensity and scrutiny as bridges in every community in the United States. 
   In Massachusetts for years now we have been working on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, also known as the ``Big Dig'', a system of tunnels that has made it much easier to get around in and outside of Boston. In July of 2006 there was a tragic death in the Ted Williams tunnel due to a collapse of a concrete panel in the ceiling. By adding tunnels to all inspection legislation we will give states the vital jurisdiction they need to look into important transportation structures. 
   This bill will not require excessive funds or staffing. As of right now it is estimated by the Department of Transportation that it will cost less than $1 million and require 5 employees or less to run the program. This is a small amount to ask for the safety it would provide to all of our constituents across the U.S. 
   The legislation calls for standards that must be met for all of the tunnel inspections and timelines for states to fix any reported deficiencies. We have seen first hand in Minnesota this year what can happen if a structurally deficient bridge is left unchecked. This bill would help reduce the risk of more tragedies occurring as a result of tunnels that have fallen into disrepair. In addition, the Federal Highway Administration would be required to work with state transportation departments to establish a certification and training program for tunnel inspectors as well as keep an inventory of highway tunnels. 
   I urge adoption of this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARKEY. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. I commend Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their tireless work on this comprehensive and timely legislation. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill we are voting on today includes language I originally submitted as an amendment to H.R. 1851. This language seeks to make some technical corrections that will ensure that affordable housing is preserved in certain housing developments, including one located in Malden, Massachusetts. 
   Low-income tenants of the Heritage Apartments, from my district in Malden, Massachusetts, have been facing possible displacement once an outstanding HUD mortgage is fully paid in a few years. The apartment is also in need of major renovations and upgrades that simply cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, HUD is failing to ensure that the apartment remains affordable and livable by placing burdensome restrictions on prepayment of the outstanding mortgage and subsequent transfer to a new owner who is willing to finance renovations. The language included in Section 2802, allows income-eligible residents to qualify for enhanced housing vouchers following the prepayment of the HUD mortgage and the property transfer and directs HUD to approve such actions. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has determined that adoption of this language would result in 1 million dollars in net savings to the current mandatory spending over the next five years because HUD is currently paying mortgage interest reduction payments for the development, which would be nullified upon adoption of the language in Sections 2802 and 2803 of H.R. 3221. 
   This is a good provision, and it is part of a broader piece of housing reform legislation that is desperately needed in response to the tidal wave of foreclosures that have affected families across the country. Again, I commend Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their tireless work on this comprehensive and timely legislation. I urge adoption of the bill.
