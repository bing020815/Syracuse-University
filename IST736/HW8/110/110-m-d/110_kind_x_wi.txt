<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR MIDWESTERN FLOOD VICTIMS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join Mr. Walz here today to offer this resolution expressing our concern and support to the victims of the flooding that ravaged our congressional districts and so many other States during those fateful days in August, but also to take a moment to express our eternal gratitude and thanks to the countless numbers of official agencies, to private organizations, to individuals who rose to the call of many people in great need during this time. 
   I personally saw Mr. Walz and the action that he immediately took when I visited southeastern Minnesota along with Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota to see some of the damage and get together with many of the first responders who were working around the clock to come to the aid of so many businesses and families and individuals affected by the flooding. 
   The rains started on August 18, and it seemed as if they were never going to stop. It was literally a torrential downpour; in some areas, from 12 to 20 inches in just a very short period of time. It's amazing to personally witness the severe devastation that an intense amount of rain can accomplish in a very short period of time. 
   Fortunately for Mr. Walz and myself, we represent two very beautiful congressional districts, but part of that beauty is the fact that we have a lot of hills and valleys and coulees that act like a funnel effect when you have the so-called ``1,000-year rain'' take place within a 24-hour period. That is exactly what happened; the rain came, the water backed up and started devastating community after community. 
   Unfortunately, at the end of the rain, there were 14 people who lost their lives. Fortunately for myself, there were none in my congressional district, but we did have some loss of life in Mr. Walz's district. There were also three electrocutions associated with the rain and the flooding that occurred in Madison. 
   Short of loss of life or physical injury, there is nothing more devastating than having your personal belongings washed away, whether it was in your home or in your businesses or on your farm. 
   I was down in one of my communities in the southern part of my congressional district, Gays Mills, shortly after the flooding, and they described to me horrific conditions where the rain came so quickly that within a matter of an hour there was five feet of water standing on the main street in their downtown area. I was talking to two teenage girls who, that evening, literally left their homes only to see the rising water and the swift current coming through the main street; and they jumped into a tree in order to get out of the way, it was coming so quickly, only to be rescued by a volunteer fire department personnel in a boat that took them to high land. You heard countless stories of this. 
   I guess it's times like this during great personal tragedy when you also witness the greatness of humanity and the response that occurred, from the various agencies at the Federal, State and local level that immediately geared up and started rushing in help and supplies, to the private organizations and businesses, to the Salvation Army, Red Cross, Catholic charities that were on the ground with their staff and their volunteers to provide assistance, to also FEMA. 
   One of the fortunate aspects at the time of this tragedy was Hurricane Dean didn't hit landfall in the United States, so FEMA, in preparation for Hurricane Dean, had a lot of supplies, they had a lot of personnel ramped up in the southern part of our country anticipating the worst of the hurricane. When it didn't arrive, they were able to redeploy a lot of their personnel and resources up to our area to provide assistance immediately. 
   I also want to take a moment to thank Director David Paulison of FEMA, who personally came on an inspection tour shortly after the flooding to see the devastation himself, and his office out of the Chicago regional office who were there very quickly. 
   With the help of Representative Walz and our respective Senators, as well as Governor Jim Doyle of WI, we were able to get quick State declarations, to be followed by a Natural Disaster Declaration in order to provide much-needed relief to the victims of the flooding. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There's still a lot of assistance that is going to have to occur in the community and in our respective States to try to make people whole. 
   On a lighter, happier note, I was fortunate to be home on Sunday to visit Gays Mills during their annual apple festival celebration and parade. This was a little more than a month after the floodwaters that were 5 feet deep in their town, yet they strove to make sure that they were going to keep this celebration, try to keep that continuity of tradition in their community. It was a wonderful day; the sun shown on us, the kids were having a great time, and that little sense of normalcy brought some smiles on a lot of faces in that community. 
   But if it wasn't for the quick reaction, again, of the agencies, but especially the family, the friends, the neighbors who responded to people in need, we could have suffered a fate much worse than what we did. 
   Again, I want to thank Representative Walz for the work that he did. I look forward to continuing the work that still needs to take place, because this isn't going to get fixed overnight. It's going to be a slow, laborious process. There's nothing worse than being denied access to a home or businesses. Just now, people are able to go in and have access for the first time. 
   Many of our farms, too, were devastated just before the crop was supposed to be harvested. Many livestock were lost in the flooding. Again, you work so hard and long all year long, and then just at the time you are going to go to market with the fruits of your labor, something like this takes place. 
   We also were fortunate that 20 earthen dams in Vernon County in my congressional district held up. It is a great tribute to the engineers and their foresight over 20 or 30 years ago that constructed these earthen dams that they held up, or the damage and devastation could have been much worse if they had given out and those floodwaters had released further down the valley. 
   So I want to thank all of those that were involved in providing much-needed and quick assistance to the individuals and to the communities that were affected by it. I again want to express my gratitude to FEMA and their quick reaction, Director Paulison and his team on the ground. But there is still more work to be done. It is good to see in a tragedy like this that there is that type of capability, both at the local and Federal and State level, in order to come to the aid of many citizens who needed it.  
   In particular, I would like to thank the many people who were involved in the recovery effort, only a few of which are named here.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, we would be remiss, too, if we didn't acknowledge the help and the work that our respective staffs did during this time. They were 24/7 on the spot trying to provide assistance. I know my staff didn't get much sleep during those weeks following the flooding. I know Mr. Walz's staff was the same way. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge their hard work.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Chairman, I rise today to provide my strong support for H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act of 2007. Representing Wisconsin's workers in Congress is a privilege I am honored to have. That is why I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 800, because protecting workers ability to form unions is of the utmost importance for the continued prosperity of our country. 
   Our Nation's economic success depends on the viability of the American workers, but the current Administration's policies have created an unfavorable climate. I fear that if Congress doesn't act to protect employee free choice and change current labor law to discourage unfair labor practices by employers, the legislative victories of the past will be at stake. With the Employee Free Choice Act, which amends the National Labor Relations Act to establish a more efficient system for monitoring labor relations, I see an opportunity for Congress to do just that. 
   Americans have waged countless battles to improve conditions in the workplace and to pave the way for a better life for all working families. Yet today they lack the adequate measures to address workplace inequities and to safeguard against unfair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Act, enacted by Congress in 1935, no longer works to protect the right of workers to form and join unions. But the need to monitor relations between unions and employers is just as important today as it was 72 years ago. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would combat obstructionist behavior by: 1) guaranteeing free choice through majority recognition; 2) facilitating initial labor agreements through mediation and arbitration; and 3) providing more effective remedies against employer coercion. 
   Having grown up in a labor household, I know there is no question that union workers benefit from a collective voice, thus improving the lives of all working Americans and their families. The wages of workers are 26% better than for non-union workers; and union workers generally have better healthcare benefits, pensions and disability compensation than workers not associated with a union. Therefore, it is clear to me that protecting the right to form a union is critical. 
   The current system fails to provide a responsive mechanism for workers when their rights have been unjustly denied. The Employee Free Choice Act makes necessary changes to the National Labor Relations Act to fill in the gaps of the current law and guarantee workers a voice without the threat of unwarranted penalties. 
   The rights of the American worker are far too important to ignore and not preserve. I promise to continue the fight against any changes that will reduce workers' benefits and pay while supporting initiatives that increase workers' rights and protections in the workplace. Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and the rights of their constituents.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill would expand the current Federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after August 9, 2001, while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure Federal oversight of the research. I am pleased the 110th Congress has taken immediate steps to address this important issue, and it is my hope that members will once again unite in support of this bill. 
   Biologists, medical experts, and the vast majority of Americans agree there is a reservoir of discovery in embryonic stem cell research that offers hope for over 100 million  Americans afflicted with life-threatening and debilitating diseases. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act allows this critical research to move forward in an ethical way by expanding the number of stem cell lines readily available to scientists, while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure federal oversight of the research. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for federal funding in 2001, only about 22 lines are actually available for study by researchers. 
   We are already at risk of losing our scientific and technological edge because of increasing competition around the world. As a Nation of opportunity and innovation, we have a responsibility to embrace policies that create breakthroughs in both medicine and technology for the benefit of our citizens. 
   From its earliest days, The University of Wisconsin-Madison has been one of the leading facilities for stem cell research, and I believe with continued study, the possible medical benefits of stem cell research are limitless; lives affected by diseases, damaged tissue, and faulty organs would be greatly improved. Additionally, this legislation would ensure the important work of our scientists is not unnecessarily sidetracked by politics. 
   The significance of this legislation extends beyond the potential for advances in science and technology. More importantly, embryonic stem cell research could lead to new treatments and cures for the over 100 million Americans afflicted with life-threatening and debilitating diseases. Scientist believe these cells could be used to treat many diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. However, the promise of this research may not be reached if the Federal policy is not expanded. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has become increasingly clear that the American public supports expanding the Federal stem cell policy. From the study of human development to the discovery of life-saving cures,there are just too many potential benefits to allow Federal policy to roadblock the continuation of this groundbreaking research that holds promise and hope for so many lives. Thus, I strongly urge my colleagues to respond to the interests and needs of our Nation's citizens. Please join me in supporting this important legislation that will reinvigorate embryonic stem cell research in this country and allow science to move forward unimpeded, revolutionize the practice of medicine, and offer hope to the millions of Americans suffering from debilitating diseases.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (HONORING THE MERCURY 13 WOMEN -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer strong support for House Resolution 421, honoring the extraordinary accomplishments and courageous journey of the Mercury 13 women. Though largely unrecognized in history, these 13 female pilots displayed determination, bravery and strength in their quest for space exploration. 
   Selected from a large group of women, the Mercury 13 pilots endured and passed the same grueling physical and psychological tests as the Mercury 7 male astronauts. These women however, were tested not only on their ability to withstand the toils of space exploration but also on their capacity to overcome extensive discrimination in both their careers and personal lives. When championing their cause, the women were repeatedly told by government officials that any effort to put a woman in space was a waste of time and money. Given this lack of U.S. support, Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian engineer, became the first woman in space on June 16, 1963. It would be many years later, in 1983, that Dr. Sally Ride would become the first American woman in space. 
   Although the women of Mercury 13 were barred from space travel, disappointment did not lessen their pioneering spirit and quest for equality. We must follow their lead. Given our country's shortcomings in 1963, it is our responsibility today to ensure that future generations of women are granted equal opportunities to follow their dreams. 
   These courageous women demonstrate that the sky is not the limit and that as a Nation we must ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, are encouraged to venture into the fields of math, science, technology and engineering. I believe we must instill the spirit of the Mercury 13 into our children today, by supporting innovative programs such as the National Science Foundation that promote technology in the classroom. By creating an environment in this country that fosters innovation and growth, we will ensure our businesses and workforce can stay competitive in the global economy of the 21st century. From new education technology and better math and science teachers to train the next generation of innovators, to the promotion of new sources of energy and the expansion of markets for our products, this comprehensive agenda will create a strong foundation to build the economy of the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to capitalize on this opportunity to extend an honor to the women of Mercury 13 and to ensure we never again allow gender inequality to restrict our citizens' ambition and potential.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, a bill to continue the promise Congress made in 1965 to provide all Americans, regardless of culture or socioeconomic status, greater opportunities to further their education. This bill recognizes the shared benefits to both individual Americans and to the country as a whole of ensuring future generations have the tools necessary to be successful in a vastly competitive 21st century workforce. 
   The opportunity for children to attend institutions of higher education is essential in preparing our future leaders. While the number of students with the academic knowledge, talent, and desire to attend and succeed in college has substantially increased over time, the necessary financial assistance has regrettably not kept pace. We must reverse this trend and uphold the Federal Government's commitment to America's schools and to all of our children. 
   The recent instability in financial markets has hurt more than just homeowners, and many individuals and their families are finding it difficult to secure student loans to attend college. The ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act assists future and current students by increasing unsubsidized loan limits for undergraduate and graduate students, giving parent borrowers more time before they begin paying off their Federal Plus loans and encouraging Federal financial institutions' participation in ensuring continued student loan access. 
   As a former member of the Education and Labor Committee, a representative of 12 institutions of higher education located in the Third Congressional District of Wisconsin, and a father of 2 school-aged boys, I recognize the importance of increased access to post-secondary education and ensuring that everyone who wishes to attend college can afford to do so. The ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act is a step in the right direction, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1591, Health, and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007. 
   It is time for a new direction in Iraq. We cannot continue to ask our troops to baby-sit a civil war. With our help, the Iraqis have established a coalition government, and we have trained more than 250,000 Iraqi security forces. We must now send a message to them that the patience of the American people is not endless, and that the Iraqi people must take control of their future by making the tough political compromises essential to living in peace. In short, it is time to take the training wheels off. 
   The bill before us today achieves the goal of redeployment of U.S. forces by setting specific benchmarks of progress using for the Iraqis and President's own benchmarks for success. If these benchmarks cannot be met, then the bill provides for a systematic approach for withdrawal of our troops. 
   Although I have had concerns about setting a date certain for withdrawal, a responsible timeline will work to hold the Iraqi Government accountable for much-needed and overdue progress. Essentially, this is a timeline on the Iraqis to come together and take control of their country. 
   The proposals included in this bill are truly a new direction, rather than just more of the same. By calling for a responsible, phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, this bill allows us to re-focus our military efforts in Afghanistan. 
   I am increasingly concerned that the main threat against the United States, al Qaeda, is still a global threat with global reach, and that the person who was directly responsible for Ð9/11, Osama Bin Laden, is still at large. The President has taken his eye off the ball in Afghanistan and is not doing everything in his power to bring those responsible for 9/11 to justice. It sends a terrible message to would-be terrorists who may be interested in striking us that all they have to do is go in hiding and lie low until we get distracted on another adventure. I am hopeful that this supplemental appropriations bill sends a signal to the President that he needs to reassess his priorities. 
   Our men and women in the Armed Forces are to be commended for the terrific job they do for us across the globe each and every day, often in very difficult and dangerous circumstances. They deserve a clearer mission, they deserve to have the training and equipment they need to complete 
   that mission, and they deserve the best care when they return home with physical and emotional wounds. The supplemental provides for all these needs. 
   During my three visits to Iraq, I met with our military command, troops in the field, and numerous Iraqi leaders and civilians. I can honestly say that nothing has made me prouder to be an American than seeing the performance of our troops in the field. They are well-trained, well-motivated and an inspiration to us all. They are, in short, the best America has to offer. 
   In particular, active military, Guard, and Reserve forces from western Wisconsin have answered the call to service. I have been to many deployment ceremonies and witnessed the anguish in the hearts and faces of family and friends as they say goodbye to their loved ones being sent abroad for lengthy stays. I have also been to several welcome home ceremonies to honor their service and to thank them for their sacrifice. 
   Sadly, I have also had 18 military funerals in my congressional district alone, most of which I have personally attended. If I don't have to attend another military funeral, if I don't have to pick up the phone to call another grieving family, I will be one of the happiest people in the world. They are a constant reminder of the human toll this war is having, not only with our troops but also with their families and our communities. There is not a day that goes by when I am not concerned about the safety and welfare of our troops. 
   A new direction, not an escalation, is what is needed in Iraq. We have now been in Iraq longer than the entire Second World War. The supplemental provides that new direction--one where the Iraqis assume responsibility for their future, and the U.S. starts to redeploy our  troops and strengthen our military that is stretched too thin and on the verge of breaking. ``More of the same,'' or ``staying the course,'' is not an option. 
   Once again I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks and undying admiration for our men and women in uniform for their service to our country. May God bless them and their families during this difficult time. May God provide his special blessings and care for those who fell in the line of duty. And may God continue to bless these United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word. 
   I just want to take a moment to congratulate the Chair and the ranking member and the entire committee for the wonderful job they did in regards to the stewardship of our public lands. 
   If you take a look at the budget, and this was eloquently stated by my friend from New Mexico, whether it was the National Park Service, whether it was the National Wildlife Refuge, if you take a look at funding for our public lands in recent years, it has been static at best and having severe consequences in regards to the management of our national park system but also the national wildlife refuges. 
   As one of the cochairs of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus, along with my colleagues, Jim Saxton, Mike Castle, Mike Thompson, we have taken it upon us to try to educate our fellow colleagues in both the House and the Senate with regard to the real challenges that we are facing throughout the refuge system. 
   While there are over 500 refuges nationwide right now, over 20 percent of them are not staffed and not offering any educational value to visitors, more refuges being prepared to be mothballed in the future, serious staff cuts with the agency budget, given the limitation of funds that they have seen. 
   Now with this $56 million increase, the first increase since 2003 when we celebrated the centennial anniversary of the creation of the refuge system, this will go a long ways as far as stemming the cuts in personnel, staff, educational opportunities, but also the importance of maintaining and operating these refuges which are currently facing about a $3 billion backlog in routine maintenance and operation. 
   I commend the committee, again, for their devotion and their attention to this very serious issue. But they are also recognizing we have another centennial anniversary coming up, and that's for the park service in just a few years, and a lot of work that needs to be done to bring that up to par so that they are worthy of the public attention and hopefully the increased visits that will lead up to this centennial anniversary of the national park system as well. 
   I just want to take a moment to commend one park service person in particular, who my family and I had the privilege of spending Father's Day Sunday with, and that was at the Antietam National Battlefield, just outside of Washington here. 
   The gentleman's name is Mike Gamble, and he works for the Park Service at the Antietam Battlefield. He was a 30-year history teacher for a local high school. He has been with Antietam Battlefield now for the last 9 years conducting tours and offering services to the visitors. 
   If there is anyone with greater depth of knowledge of what took place, that crucial battle, the Battlefield of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history, I don't know who that could be. 
   He was incredibly well versed, extremely interesting, very educational, and even for my 9 and 10 year-old little boys, he brought that battlefield to life with great personal relevance in their lives. It's people like Mike and those who serve in our park service, whether it's Civil War battlefields or national parks or in our refuges, that really make this the great monuments to civilization that we have in this country.

   Mr. KIND. Again, I appreciate this gentleman's leadership and the committee's work in regards to refocusing our attention on a great need in our Nation. 
   I wanted to also mention to my colleagues that I, along with the other cochairs of the Wildlife Refuge Caucus, recently introduced legislation called the Repair Act. We had a nice hearing before the Natural Resources Committee last week that would hopefully provide singular focus on one of the great threats facing our refuge system, and that's invasive species, plants, animals. What we are trying to do is establish an important public and private partnership by working with friends groups, with Federal, State, local agencies, but other nonprivate organizations, so we can develop a battle plan to deal with these invasive species, try to get out ahead of the curve, which is one of the great threats facing the entire refuge system today. 
   So I would hope my colleagues would take a look at the legislation that we have recently introduced. Hopefully we will have the cooperation of the committee, be able to move it to the floor for consideration, so we can start providing a singular focus and a good plan in place to deal with the invasive species threat that we are facing in this Nation. 
   Again, I thank the committee for the work that they have done, they have produced a good product here, and I would encourage its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, which will begin to right our country's course on energy policy, steering us away from costly subsidies for the oil and gas industries that are both unnecessary and unwanted. Instead, this bill will allow our government to invest in its own industries, which produce clean, efficient energy that will improve our environment, produce jobs, and increase our national security. 
   Madam Speaker, I cannot say why, during a time of record profits by oil and gas companies, this industry was targeted for tax relief in 2004 and 2005. I honestly cannot say why the majority of this congress thought it was a good idea to give away billions of taxpayer dollars in this way. What I do know, is that I am not alone in wondering why. 
   Our own President, whose personal ties to the oil industry are well known, has said numerous times that industry does not need these subsidies. Just last year, he was quoted in the Washington Post saying:  
   Record oil prices and large cash flows also mean that Congress has got to understand that these energy companies don't need unnecessary tax breaks like the write-offs of certain geological and geophysical expenditures, or the use of taxpayers' money to subsidize energy companies' research into deep water drilling. I'm looking forward to Congress to take about $2 billion of these tax breaks out of the budget over a 10-year period of time. Cash flows are up. Taxpayers don't need to be paying for certain of these expenses on behalf of the energy companies.  
   President Bush was saying these things even before we passed the energy bill. In 2005 he said, ``With oil at more than $50 a barrel, by the way, energy companies do not need taxpayer funded incentives to explore for oil and gas.'' 
   Even the President, from the oil State of Texas, understands that our country needs to move in a new direction on energy policy. In his State of the Union address last year, he said, ``America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology.'' 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6 will repeal the unnecessary giveaways to the energy industry by reducing the tax deductions for exploration that were included in the 2005 energy bill, and eliminating a tax break the industry never should have had. This is expected to raise $6.6 billion over 10 years, which will be set aside in a new strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve to go toward research and development of newer, cleaner alternatives. 
   It is time for us to invest in the midwest, not the Middle East. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.

Planting season is  starting throughout the country, but I would hope that at the end of the process we get a good farm bill rather than a bad farm bill, one that recognizes current market prices and the conditions that farmers are experiencing out there. It was a little more bold on reform, especially under those title I commodity programs. 
   The President has made it clear that he won't find a farm bill acceptable that does call for an increase in taxes in order to pay for it. I and others who have been a part of a reform effort, especially with the commodity subsidy programs, believe that we are capable of producing a farm bill that maintains an important safety net for family farmers, but also protects the important priorities that are also a part of the farm bill. 
   It's based on the philosophy of let's help family farmers when they need it, let's not when they don't. Clearly with commodity prices at or near record highs in the marketplace today, part of it driven by the biofuels portion in this country, a large part of it due to the increased global demand, many of us are suspecting that these prices are going to continue. That's been great for the rural economy, and it's been great for farm income. 
   But let us also take this opportunity then of starting to move forward on some commonsense reasonable reforms of these commodity programs, while still maintaining a safety net in the farm bill, but without jeopardizing the conservation title or nutrition or specialty crops, rural economic development programs and renewable fuel investment. 
   I would hope that my colleagues support this motion to instruct. I think it's the right thing to do. I think at the end of the day, if we are going to have a bipartisan bill that the President feels comfortable in doing, one of the goals that we have to strive for is a bill that does not call for an increase in taxes in light of record high market prices. 
   I commend the gentleman for offering this motion and encourage support on the vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment by my colleagues, Mr. ALTMIRE and Mr. CARNEY, which will offer some needed comfort to those of us in the sportsmen's community who seek to protect what access remains to cherished hunting and fishing opportunities on public lands. With the adoption of this amendment, I would urge all of my colleagues on the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus to vote for the underlying bill as well. 
   Without a doubt, the 26 million acres that constitute the National Landscape Conservation system's more than 850 individual units represent some of the very best hunting and fishing opportunities available today. These lands harbor bighorn sheep, elk, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, caribou, salmon, chinook, sockeye, steelhead, redband trout, and so many more game and non-game species, not to mention spectacular landscapes unparalelled in the rest of the bureau of land management. These are the very best places the BLM has to offer, and they are very deserving of the additional recognition and institutional support H.R. 2016 will provide. 
   Opponents of H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act, have claimed that it will create a new Federal bureaucracy that will usurp private land rights, divert Federal dollars, and dilute public access. None of these claims is true. By simply codifying in law a designation that has existed through administrative action for the last eight years, H.R. 2016 will change nothing in how the BLM or Department of the Interior manages these lands. What it will do is raise the profile of these national treasures both within the department and with the public so that they are known by all as the gems of the BLM's stewardship mandate rather than mere afterthoughts subject to executive fiat. 
   While the underlying bill already contains a savings clause stating that all existing laws and regulations governing these lands will continue to be exercised and enforced as before, the Altmire-Carney Amendment very simply adds an explicit reminder that hunting and fishing will continue to go hand in hand with conservation. as sportsmen and women provide the primary source of funds for state and local conservation budgets, It is appropriate that hunting and fishing rights be retained in the National Landscape Conservation system. 
   As co-chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and a member of the Natural Resources Committee, I wish to thank my friend and subcommittee chair RA&#218;L GRIJALVA for introducing this bill, chairman RAHALL for his invaluable support, and Representatives Altmire and Carney for offering this important amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (HONORING TERRY MILFRED -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Terry Milfred upon his retirement as superintendent of the Weston School District. Terry is a dedicated public servant who has earned the respect and admiration of the teachers, staff and over 300 students under his supervision. 
   Most recently, Terry is revered for his efforts in comforting and uniting the local community after a tragic shooting last fall at Weston High School that took the life of a dear friend to Terry, and the schools well-respected principal, John Klang. 
   One hundred twenty-five students were left stunned on September 29, 2006, when a fellow classmate opened fire on faculty members and peers. Fortunately for the students of Weston High School, Principal John Klang, in the most unselfish act one person can do for others, sacrificed himself to protect his students and his faculty. 
   Terry Milfred and the dedicated members of his staff took immediate action and displayed steadfast leadership, establishing a safe environment in consoling the students and the faculty. In an effort to recover from this tragedy and the loss of an incredible principal, others in the administration, such as Tom Andreas and Melissa Nigh, stepped forward to ensure that students and faculty received the support that they needed. 
   Together, Tom, Melissa and Terry summoned leaders from around the State, forming a crisis management team to address the specific needs of each individual impacted by this tragedy. The students of Weston High School should also be commended for the courage and selflessness they displayed in overcoming this hardship and uniting as a student body. 
   As a husband, father, grandfather, and role model to students, parents, and members of his staff, Terry has bettered the lives of numerous individuals. He has risen to the challenge of protecting those in his care and mentoring those dearest to him. Prior to the unfortunate incident last fall, Terry served as an adviser to Principal Klang. While much of their time was spent conversing in school hallways and cafeterias, Terry and John had a relationship and respect for one another that extended beyond the classroom door. 
   Principal Klang was a dear friend to many and he will be greatly missed. 
   In memory of Principal Klang and in an effort to prepare others if such an unfortunate incident should occur in their community, Terry has dedicated countless hours addressing school groups and educators on methods to handle school violence. 
   Although Terry Milfred is retiring from the superintendent position, he will remain a visible actor in the lives of students and teachers at Weston School District. His advocacy and community work will leave a lasting legacy for the entire community, and the area will continue to benefit from all that he has done. 
   On behalf of the students and faculty of Weston School District, I would like to thank Terry for his many years of tireless service and for bringing hope in the shadows of tragedy and despair. 
   I wish Terry a very long and a very happy retirement.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (COMMENDING GREEN BAY PACKERS QUARTERBACK BRETT FAVRE FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE RECORD FOR MOST CAREER TOUCHDOWN PASSES -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre upon his achievement of throwing his 421st NFL touchdown and breaking the all-time NFL record for touchdown passes. 
   From my days as Harvard quarterback, I can say firsthand that I have a deep appreciation for the sport of football and for the strength and dedication it takes not only as an athlete, but as a team leader as well. While growing up in western Wisconsin, I spent countless Sunday afternoons watching the Green Bay Packers through both good and bad seasons. I have watched Brett Favre grow from his first season as a Packer, to a Super Bowl MVP, and to a well respected legend. 
   Throughout the sports community, Brett Favre is a symbol of stamina, leadership, toughness, and sportsmanship. Not only has Brett Favre broken the NFL record for touchdown passes, he holds the records for most number of wins by starting quarterback, most consecutive games as a starting quarterback, and the only three-time winner of the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award. During his 16 years on the Green Bay Packers, Brett Favre has led the team to two Super Bowls and given Wisconsin a good reason to look forward to winter. 
   Brett Favre is more than an outstanding athlete; he is a dedicated humanitarian who has demonstrated leadership both on and off the field. The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation has donated more than $1.5 million for disadvantaged and disabled children in Wisconsin and Mississippi. When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi coast, Brett Favre played a leading role in rallying fundraising and aid for his home state. After his wife, Deanna, was diagnosed with breast cancer, the Favres founded the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation to provide support to uninsured or underinsured women living with this terrible disease. 
   I believe NFL Hall of Fame Coach Vince Lombardi captured it best when he said: ``Individual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.'' 
   On behalf of the residents of the state of Wisconsin, I would like to congratulate Brett Favre on his many accomplishments, including his 421st touchdown pass, and to wish him the best of luck for the rest of the season.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this Peruvian Trade Agreement. We know that it has been increasingly difficult to pass measures out of this Congress in a bipartisan fashion, and it is unfortunate. I still believe that this Congress functions best when you can work in a bipartisan manner. 
   The vote tomorrow on the Peruvian Trade Agreement will be different. It will be different because we are embarking upon a new historic template on these trade agreements, one that embodies core international labor standards and environmental standards for the very first time in these trade agreements, fully enforceable, like any other provision in the agreements. 
   This debate tonight isn't about whether the United States of America should remain positively engaged with other countries around the world, whether we should be trading. We are less than 4 percent of the world's population. Of course we have to trade. 
   Rather, the debate is what the rules of trade should be, and will we do everything we can to begin elevating standards upwards across the globe or to continue to see this race to the bottom for the lowest common denominator. With core labor standards and environmental standards in the body of the agreement, we are, for the first time, leveling the playing field for our workers so they can successfully compete in the global marketplace.  
   But I also believe that trade is more than just goods and products and services crossing borders. It is an important part of our diplomatic arsenal, because when goods and products do cross borders, I believe armies don't. 
   I commend the leadership of our committee, the leadership of our respective parties, and also the President and Susan Schwab, our USTR, for coming to agreement on this historic trade measure. 
   But there is one cautionary note I would give to the current administration and future administrations, and it is the best argument that the opposition has here tonight, and that is if administrations refuse to enforce these provisions, it will prove increasingly more difficult to pass future trade agreements out of this body and we will continue to lose the confidence of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the agreement.

   Madam Speaker, we have before us today, because of our friends in the Senate, the granddaddy of all jams. They took an incredibly important economic rescue plan and loaded it up with a bunch of extraneous, unrelated items that weren't paid for. They're in essence holding a gun to our head today daring us to vote ``no.'' But, unfortunately, we gave them that gun last Monday because of the failure of this Chamber to act. And the credit markets are continuing to freeze up, and my concern is unless we take action today, many innocent people back home and throughout America will suffer the consequences. 
   The plan we have before us today, the rescue plan, is vastly different from the original one sent to us by the administration. Today it's about protecting Main Street, not Wall Street. It's about protecting the American taxpayer, not CEOs' salaries. We have included in here important oversight, transparency, accountability provisions to protect the American people. And time is of the essence. But at some point and some time, we have to have the political will and the courage to start paying for things again in this country so we do not leave a legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren. We won't accomplish that today, but time is of the essence and we must move this rescue plan forward to avert a much wider disaster tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of long overdue legislation that would equalize care for the millions of Americans suffering from mental health and substance-related disorders. More than 10 years after passing the Mental Health Parity Act, Congress now has the chance to finish the job it began and ensure that no Americans face discrimination in insurance coverage of mental health care. 
    Patients throughout the country struggle with the enormous financial costs of mental health and substance abuse treatments not covered by insurance. Many go without treatment, creating a burden on families, communities, and even our economy. Over 1.3 billion work days are lost annually due to mental disorders, more than stroke, heart attack, and cancer combined. In addition, employers face $135 billion in lost productivity each year due to untreated alcoholism and $31 billion due to untreated depression. 
    Enacting H.R. 1424 is important not only as a way to remove barriers to mental health and substance abuse care, however, but also as a way to remove the stigma long associated with these disorders. Equalizing care would send a strong message that the 57 million Americans suffering from mental health disorders and 26 million from chemical addiction should be treated no differently than individuals suffering from other medical conditions. I applaud the leadership and work of Representatives KENNEDY and RAMSTAD for their tireless efforts to bring this important legislation forward, and I am proud to give them my strong support. 
    In moving forward, it is my hope that the House and Senate can work together to find common ground so that mental health parity can be enacted. as part of this process, I would encourage negotiators to review the offsets used to pay for H.R. 1424, particularly the increase in the base Medicaid drug rebate level. I encourage Congress to consider the  effect this increase would have on small businesses that provide drugs and biologics to the Medicaid program, as well as possible disincentives this increase could create for companies to innovate and develop important new medicines. Although I am not opposed to raising the base rebate amount on principle, I am concerned that it may not be a prudent step to take without a thoughtful and complete review of its possible impacts.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National School Breakfast Week and in support of a resolution that recognizes how providing breakfast in schools through the National School Breakfast Program has a positive impact on classroom performance. 
   It is often stated that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and yet a great number of children begin their school day without access to a nutritious breakfast. As a former member of the House Education and Labor Committee and the father of two young boys, I understand the vital link between a healthy diet and successful performance in school. We must ensure that schools have the resources necessary to provide each student the nourishment necessary to get them through their day. 
   With over 8.1 million students participating in the school breakfast program, schools recognize the benefits of making sure that all children have a healthy breakfast to start their day; however, there are still many students not at the table and their academic progress may be suffering. It has been shown that school breakfast programs have led to a drastic reduction in school tardiness and provide students with the vital nutrients they need for remaining attentive in class and processing the information. They receive. We can simultaneously improve the physical well-being of our students while also improving their performance in the classroom. 
   The National School Breakfast Program provides students with the healthy start to the day that they need to succeed. I ask my fellow Members to join me in offering their full support of this resolution. Together we can ensure that our commitment to the physical health of our students matches our commitment to their academic progress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008. This bill provides a number of much needed and deserved tax benefits to members of the military, their families, and veterans. Specifically, I am proud that the Qualified Veterans' Mortgage Bonds (QVMB) program, which impacts my home State of Wisconsin, was renewed and reformed so that the dream of home ownership will continue to be a reality for thousands of veterans. 
   Under the HEART Act, the QVMB program will be expanded to allow $100 million annually in tax exempt bonding for the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) State veterans home loan program--enough funding to aid about 600 State veterans in obtaining low interest rate home loans. This program is more important now than ever before with the ongoing credit crisis in this country, and I am proud we were able to expand it. In Wisconsin alone, the WDVA has made over 54,000 home loans to veterans through this program. 
   Other important provisions in this bill include allowing combat pay for troops to count as earned income for the Earned Income Tax Credit and making permanent the Internal Revenue Code provision that allows active duty reservists to make penalty-free withdrawals from their retirement plans. 
   Our military service men and women have sacrificed a great deal to protect the freedoms that we so deeply cherish in this country. Their sacrifices and extended tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, have placed greater economic hardships on their families here at home. The bill before us today will help alleviate some of those hardships by giving military families much needed and deserved tax relief and making permanent some of the temporary provisions that Congress has previously enacted. 
   The HEART Act is one simple but significant way we can thank our troops for their service to our country. I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support our men and women in the military by passing this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Terry Erickson, a man who has dedicated his life's work to helping children. Terry has tirelessly served western Wisconsin youth for over 40 years, mainly as the executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse, a place I proudly called my second home while growing up on the north side of La Crosse. 
   For over 100 years, the Boys and Girls Club of America has been fostering an environment of hope and opportunity for all children. In addition to promoting character development and educational progress, the club creates a safe environment so kids can simply play and enjoy themselves. In fact, some of my fondest childhood memories are a result of my participation in the La Crosse club. 
   At a time when many temptations existed in our neighborhoods for children and when there were plenty of opportunities for us to get into trouble, I found the club to be a safe haven for me and many other students for playing sports or just hanging out with our friends. 
   Since the creation of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse in 1966, Terry has been a champion for youth programming and a father-like figure for many of us. Terry's devotion to the club's goal of inspiring all young people to realize their full potential is unrivaled. It is this passion and enthusiasm that has resulted in unprecedented growth for the organization. 
   Under Terry's leadership, the Boys and Girl Club of Greater La Crosse has flourished, growing from a small organization into one of the premier clubs throughout the country. The organization has expanded to six different locations, including a partnership with Viterbo University. Recently, Terry's university president, Bill Medlandis, and the Mathy family's dedication to this partnership resulted in the Amie L. Mathy Center, a club located on the campus of Viterbo University that enriches academic support for children. 
   The number of lives Terry has positively affected throughout the years is impossible to quantify. I know my two boys have greatly benefited from their experiences with the club and from Terry's selfless example. Because of Terry's guidance, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse has created a haven for youth and a sense of community in the area. 
   Terry simply brings out the best in people, whether they are young children and students who benefited from the club's many activities, or the countless adults who have volunteered their time to make the La Crosse club one of the premier models in our country. 
   It has been said that great teachers enjoy a special immortality because their influence never stops radiating. I just hope that upon his retirement, Terry appreciates the wonderful teaching that he has done and the countless lives that he has influenced. 
   I am proud to count myself as one of Terry's products, and I am even prouder to call him my friend. Although Terry's service and commitment to the children of the La Crosse area will be deeply missed upon his retirement, the solid foundation he has laid for the club will empower children for decades to come. 
   I also want to congratulate my childhood friend and classmate Kevin Johnston, who was chosen to take over for Terry at the club. I couldn't imagine a better selection, given Kevin's history with the club, his passion for youth of our community and his close relationship with Terry throughout the years. I know Kevin will excel in his new position. 
   I commend Terry for his unyielding service and dedication to the community. As in any lengthy undertaking, Terry's service to our children required tremendous personal time and sacrifice by himself and his entire family. That's why, on behalf of all the children in the La Crosse area, I would like to thank Terry, Sue and their entire family for the impact that they have had in the La Crosse community. I wish Terry and Sue all the best as they close this chapter in their lives and begin a new one. But knowing Terry, I am sure the best interests of our youth will be close at hand. 
   Congratulations, Terry. Thank you for a job well done. We all wish you Godspeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act so that all American workers will be able to realize the benefits of the global economy. H.R. 3920 will update our system of trade adjustment assistance, TAA, to include service sector employees, strengthen benefit levels and duration, improve worker training, and stimulate economic recovery in affected communities. These are needed changes to ensure that workers affected by globalization are taken care of if their job is lost. 
   International trade is an essential part of the American economy today and in the future. In fact, total U.S. trade of goods and services last year totaled $3.6 trillion. The reduction of trade barriers in recent years has led to a corresponding increase in trade volume, to the benefit of both American businesses and American consumers. Knowing that these benefits do not accrue evenly across all industries, however, Congress established the TAA program to help smooth the transition for workers who have to make the shift to a more competitive field. 
   The safety net for outsourced jobs, which consists of extended unemployment benefits, worker training, and a health care tax credit, was first enacted in 1962 and updated in 2002. This update, however, did not go far enough to bring the program up to date with current trade and labor realities. For one, the benefits currently extend only to workers in the manufacturing sector, despite the fact that a growing percentage of jobs shifted overseas have been from the services sector, such as telemarketing and financial services. Since the nature of the American economy has moved away from a reliance on manufacturing, it only makes sense that workers in the services sector be eligible for the same support as industrial workers. 
   The bill makes a number of other changes to strengthen TAA benefits, including an increase in the health care tax credit, an extension of income support and training period, and a large increase in the overall funding level to ensure that no eligible worker is turned away due to lack of program funds. 
   But H.R. 3920 also takes the TAA program beyond the effects on individual workers by offering new tax incentives for investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs. The whole notion of worker assistance is meaningless without creating new jobs for displaced employees. Targeting investment into communities with an available workforce would benefit employers and employees alike and maintain vibrant towns and cities across this Nation. 
   Finally, this bill considers the needs of the larger Federal-State unemployment insurance (UI) system by dedicating $100 million annually for the States to improve UI administration. Additional funding for this purpose would also be available from Federal unemployment trust funds. This money would be an incentive for States to cover part-time, low-wage, and other workers in State UI laws. 
   I look forward to passing this bill today in anticipation of also passing pending trade deals in the coming weeks and months. By giving our businesses the freedom they need to sell American goods and services abroad, we are ensuring that the American economy will stay strong and competitive in the future. By assuring our employees that there will always be a place for good American workers, we will ensure a strong labor force capable of evolving along with the global economy. 
   I support H.R. 3920, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and commend him for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the substitute being offered to us today and in strong support of the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act that we have been debating this afternoon. 
   I believe that in order to forge a renewed consensus in support of trade in this country, we really need to accomplish three things: One is we need a new template on trade agreements, one that I think will be reflected with the Peru trade agreement that will come to the floor next week that calls for core international labor standards and environmental standards in the bulk of the agreement so we begin to level the trading field. 
   Another important ingredient is the strong enforcement of trade agreements by this administration and future administrations so that workers and businesses alike know that everyone is playing by the same rules and if they are not, there will be consequences. 
   Finally, there has to be assurance to the workers of this country that when they do feel the adverse affects of globalization and job displacement or downsizing or outsourcing, there will be adequate programs there to assist them to get on their feet, from job training funding to adequate health care coverage during a very difficult and oftentimes traumatic moment in their lives. 
   Unfortunately, the substitute falls short in regards to the support mechanism. It precludes service workers from qualifying for these TAA benefits. It prohibits manufacturing workers whose jobs are offshored to China and India from qualifying for these benefits. It also cuts worker training benefits by capping it at $8,000, even though we know that the average State today is spending close to $15,000 for job training benefits. 
   Finally, they pull up short on the crucial aspect of adequate health care. They move from 60 to 70 percent support for the premiums of workers, whereas we go to 85 percent. And even at 85 percent, that remaining 15 percent can be very, very expensive for the average worker when they have lost their job and they don't have an income. They also don't minimize the gaps in coverage as we do. And they also don't allow the continuation of COBRA coverage for employees as we do in the substitute. 
   I would encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3920 and oppose the Republican substitute.

   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The financial crisis that has been gripping our country reached a point last week where extraordinary action is now required. 
   Supporting this legislation was not a decision that I came to easily or without tremendous thought and consultation. It is based on imperfect information. Initially I was very angry and skeptical of the plan that the administration proposed because it gave too much discretion to the Treasury Secretary and included no accountability for the burden that was going to be placed on the taxpayer. 
   Fortunately, the administration has listened to the concerns from me and my colleagues and has returned the focus of the rescue plan from Wall Street to Main Street. This plan protects taxpayers, not executive compensation. It includes strong transparency, accountability, and oversight functions for Congress. 
   The goal of this plan is to take the poison out of the market, get it stabilized, and ensure the free flow of credit. Most importantly though, it guarantees that taxpayers will be reimbursed for their investment at the end of the day. Furthermore, in the longer term, I support a comprehensive review and reform of our financial market structure and associated regulations. 
   This is a rescue plan for the American economy. The reality is that without action, there is a good chance that Americans could lose everything they have worked so hard for. We are loaning banks money so they can loan money to Americans for their everyday lives to buy a car, pay for college, start a small business, or buy a house. The risk of inaction far outweighs the risk of action. This bill will allow us to continue moving forward. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this important legislation that will shore up our economy and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, over the last 6 years, under one party control we had the largest and fastest accumulation of national debt in our Nation's history. The national debt skyrocketed to $8.8 trillion. Today we have a budget that changes the failed policies of the past and is, instead, a new direction to get the U.S. government back in the black with surpluses like those the country enjoyed at the beginning of this decade. 
   At the start of the 110th Congress, our party promised that when we took over as the majority party we would get the fiscal books back in order. This budget fulfills that promise by bringing the budget back to surplus by 2012. It gets us there by strictly adhering to the pay-as-you-go rules that was implemented at the beginning of this year. Additionally, this budget contains tough program integrity measures to crack down on wasteful spending, and it directs all committees to review their programs to promote efficiency and eliminate unnecessary spending. 
   This budget stands in stark contrast to the President's budget on many fronts. As I previously stated, this budget reaches balance in 2012 and starts paying down our debt. The President's budget does neither.  
   Budgets are all about priorities. This budget makes it clear that the priorities of this Congress are the priorities of the American people. Our budget provides for our national security, our veterans, our children, and working families across America. 
   The budget framework contains the necessary resources to meet critical threats to the Nation and to deliver excellent health care to those who have served in the armed forces. Funding for veterans' services is increased by $6.6 billion over the 2007 level, and by $3.5 billion above the President's request for 2008. This will cover the Veterans Administration's (VA) increasing patient load and the cost of forthcoming recommendations to improve health care facilities and treatment for service members and veterans. It is the largest expansion of veterans' healthcare funding since the creation of our VA system. 
   Most importantly, this budget reduces the deficit, which will decrease our reliance on foreign investors to buy our debt. Since 2001, foreign ownership of Treasury securities has more than doubled to $2.2 trillion, leaving our economy more vulnerable to foreign investment decisions and instability. The more we rely on our global competitors like China and India to finance our debt, the more vulnerable America's economic well-being--now and in the future--becomes. As the father of two little boys, I did not come to this Congress to leave a legacy of debt for them or future generations to climb out of. Let us pass this sensible, fiscally responsible budget that protects important American values so that years from now, we can look back and say, yes, we had to make some tough decisions, but they were the right decisions under the right circumstances, and American families are the primary beneficiaries as a result. 
   The Budget Resolution before us today makes the tough decisions to get us back to surpluses, while offering an economic stimulus plan now which is fair, quick, and responsible. It supports our troops, but it also supports our Nation's veterans, our seniors, and our children's education programs. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this common sense fiscally responsible Budget Resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from New York for yielding me the time and for his management of this important rule and the important legislation that we're going to have a chance to debate and consider in a short while. 
   But I also want to thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for his strong commitment to the rural school portion that's been discussed on the floor here. 
   As someone who represents Western Wisconsin, with many rural schools, I have the utmost confidence that we're going to find a way, working with the Senate, whether it's in conference in the reconciliation that will inevitably have to take place between this energy tax incentive extender bill that we have before us and what they've moved earlier in the week in order to get this provision done. It is important, across the aisle, that we accomplish that.  
   But let's get back to the substance of what we have before us here, which represents, I believe, an important step along the road to developing a comprehensive energy plan that makes sense for our country's future and our children's future because of the crucial investment that it makes with the tax incentives to develop alternative and renewable energy sources in this country. 
   Throughout the summer, and for too long, we have heard the chant from the other side that the answer to our energy woes is ``drill, drill, drill.'' But Thomas Friedman is correct in stating that it's comparable to a group of citizens standing up on the eve of the information technology revolution, screaming for more electric typewriters, electric typewriters, electric typewriters, when our national chant really should be, ``invent, invent, invent.'' It's the only way we're going to see our way out of the energy box and crisis that we're facing as a Nation and throughout the world. That's what this bill helps us to accomplish, with tax incentives for the development of wind and solar, fuel cell development, geothermal, electric hybrid technology, but also the incentives to enhance conservation and an efficiency program, which is another important aspect towards energy independence; extending the credit for energy efficient improvements to existing homes, for instance, energy efficient commercial buildings, energy efficient appliance credits, accelerated depreciation for smart meters and smart grid systems, qualified green building and sustainable design projects, as well as the extension of the R&D tax credit, which will help spur the investment in clean technology and clean energy sources. 
   The only real difficulty we have with this legislation is the fact that the Democratic Party, since we took the majority, believes that we need to start paying for things again. We have responsible offsets to pay for this so we don't dig a hole deeper for our children to climb out of. And when we adopted pay-as-you-go budgeting rules, we did it not because we thought it was going to be fun or easy. We did it because we thought it was the responsible thing to do, so that we don't leave a legacy of debt to our children and grandchildren. 
   And the revenue offsets that we identify in this bill to pay for the investment and build-out of renewable energy in this country, come from the exorbitant tax breaks that big oil companies receive under their bill at a time of record profits with oil companies sitting on huge cash reserves. That's why this legislation is important, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7060, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008. This bill provides much needed tax relief for many Americans and will help create jobs at a time when unemployment is increasing. Furthermore, this legislation provides needed incentives for renewable energy investments that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease our dependence on foreign oil. 
   These are uncertain times for the economy. The troubles on Wall Street have created problems on Main Street, and America's working families are struggling. In times like these, we need tax relief that everyone can count on. The legislation before us today will help achieve this goal. 
   First, H.R. 7060 extends several important expiring tax provisions. In particular, the bill will provide property tax relief for tens of millions of Americans, support for parents through an expanded child tax credit, relief for more than 11 million families through state and local sales tax deduction, help for more than 4.5 million families to cover the cost of education through the tuition deduction, and relief for more than 3.5 million teachers who will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for their classrooms. 
   H.R. 7060 also addresses the need for more clean energy production in our country by providing long term extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit, while amending them to increase accessibility. These long term extensions will give utilities and investors the predictability they need to move forward with new generation projects in the years to come. The bill also addresses energy use and carbon emissions by extending multiple energy efficient credits for homes and businesses, creating incentives for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects, and calling for carbon audit of the tax code to determine what policies are encouraging wasteful energy use and unnecessary carbon emissions. The bill also addresses our dependence on dirty foreign oil by extending and improving tax credits for the production of cellulosic biofuels and plug-in electric vehicles. 
   Finally, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules. Under the leadership of Chairman Rangel and Speaker Pe losi, we are demonstrating that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After years of fiscal recklessness--deficit financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out of control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7060.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today with the gentleman from Tennessee, my good friend, Mr. Wamp, for the purpose of engaging the chairman in this colloquy about the National Youth Sports Program. While my purpose for rising today is to discuss the merits of NYSP, I would also like to commend the chairman on the work that the committee has done in crafting such a respectable bill before us. The subcommittee was able to restore several programs that otherwise would have been eliminated, while also increasing important investments in much-needed areas such as No Child Left Behind, IDEA, and the Community Services Block Grant. 
   I am disappointed, however, that this year, due to funding constraints, the National Youth Sports Program was not funded in this appropriations bill. The National Youth Sports Program program is an educational partnership that has worked successfully for over 37 years. It provides low-income children ages 10 to 16 a 5-week summer program offering sports and academic programs at colleges and universities nationwide. 
   While touring the NYSP program on the UW-Eau Claire and UW-LaCrosse campuses in my district on several occasions, I have witnessed firsthand how this program reaches beyond academics and sports to provide opportunities for learning about good nutrition, developing leadership skills and developing good character. 
   In previous years, the program served approximately 76,000 children at 201 colleges and universities across the country. The loss in Federal funding, however, has had a dramatic effect on the program's operation. It is expected there will only be 50 programs and 10,000 students participating this summer nationwide. 
   In our home State of Wisconsin, close to 1,600 young people once participated in this program, yet this year, unfortunately, that figure has dramatically declined to approximately 400 children.

   Mr. KIND. As the chairman is aware, earlier this year we sent a bipartisan letter to the committee requesting an $18 million appropriation for NYSP, and given the importance of this program to many children throughout the country and the fact that NYSP has successfully leveraged Federal funding to secure substantial matching community investments, we would hope that if funding is found on the Senate side, that both the House and the chairman would be supportive of the funding level coming out of the Senate in conference. 
   It is also our hope that in the future NYSP will receive an outreach of support to continue its agenda for organizations that specialize in assisting at-risk youth. This program is too vital for the health and well-being of our young people for it to be left unfunded for another year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding me this time, and I commend him for this motion to instruct. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: We need a farm bill, and we need one as soon as possible. It is planting season back home in the upper Midwest and the district I represent in western Wisconsin, and our farmers need some predictability. They need to know what the rules are that they are going to be operating under and producing under in the coming fiscal year and in the coming 5 years. 
   But we also need a good farm bill, not a bad farm bill, one that is responsible to the American taxpayer and one that does well by the American farmer. And those of us who have been talking about much overdue and needed reforms under the commodity title, these subsidy payments to a handful of commodity producers in this country, have been saying, let's give farmers help when they need it but let's not when they don't. 
   And the market conditions today are something we have never seen before. They are talking about $10 corn by this summer. Soybean, wheat, rice at an all-time high in the marketplace. Yet instead of trying to tighten up these subsidy programs and rein them in for some possible savings so we can address the other priorities in the farm bill, what is being proposed, to our understanding, and we haven't been privy to the conference negotiations that have been going on, is actually expanding direct payments from the current maximum level of $40,000 up to $60,000, and allowing dual entities operating on the same farm to qualify for the same amount of these direct payments. 
   And to be clear, the direct payments bear no relationship to commodity prices, no relationship to production. They are something that go out automatically regardless of the marketplace. And, quite frankly, it is the least justifiable aspect of this farm bill today in light of the record commodity prices that exist. 
   But we also need a farm bill that this President is comfortable in signing, and the administration has been clear from the beginning that they feel there is more room for reform under these commodity programs. We are not talking about the two other subsidy programs, the loan deficiency program or the countercyclical program, although there too they are ramping up the target price and the loan rates under those programs. We are only talking about the direct payments right now, that which goes out automatically to only five principal commodity crops at the expense of everything else that we are trying to accomplish in this farm bill, having a strong conservation title in light of the increased pressure that crop production is placing on sensitive and highly erodible land. And we are seeing that now with a lot of CRP acreage being taken out of CRP and put back into production.  
   And what does that mean to the average person? That is going to affect quality water supplies throughout the Nation, it's going to affect habitat, wildlife populations, all of which depend on good land stewardship of these lands and knowing what land is highly erodible and what isn't. And that was the whole basis behind CRP to begin with, and yet that now is in jeopardy because of increased commodity prices. 
   I don't begrudge, and I don't think anyone here begrudges family farmers getting a decent price finally in the marketplace. But where I am from in Wisconsin and talking to my producers, for years they kept saying: We don't like these subsidy programs, either. We wish we didn't have to rely on it. And if we could only get a decent price in the marketplace, we wouldn't have to. Well, guess what. That day has come. And now is an opportunity, never better in the history of the Congress, to start reforming these commodities subsidy programs right now so that at the end of the day we are not painting this big bull's eye on the back of our farmers with more subsidy payments that are going to be challenged through the WTO and possibly taken away through the WTO challenges, just as Brazil has done with the cotton challenge that they successfully prevailed on. And this is only the beginning. 
   Instead, we could redirect funding for what are called green box payments, conservation payments that also go to family farmers to help them be good land stewards but do not distort the marketplace and they do not distort trade policy, and it doesn't get us into trouble by these outside challenges that we may be facing in the future. 
   So that is why I think this gentleman's motion to instruct is important. We understand it is in the 11th hour. I appreciate the hard work that the chairman and everyone involved in the conference has been doing. Putting together a farm bill is probably one of the toughest things to do in this place given the parochial interests, given the different ideas and opinions that go into deliberations. But we have an opportunity right now of maintaining an important safety net for family farmers in case things do go south in the commodity market, but at the same time starting to reform these subsidy programs so we are more responsible to the taxpayer but also helping our farmers modernize so they can be more competitive both domestically and abroad. Otherwise, again, we are setting them up for future challenges by loading up these subsidy programs to the extent that they have been occurring. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend from Arizona.

   Mr. KIND. I probably won't need that much time. But, again, hard negotiations. We are getting into the final details of it. There is still an opportunity of producing a bill that the President feels comfortable with in signing, and that way the farmers know what they are operating under. 
   But, again, these direct payments are probably the least justifiable program going forward today in light of what the marketplace is producing. And the futures market right now is looking astounding when it comes to these commodity crops, and that is going to be good for farm income and debt-to-asset ratio. For family farms, it has never been better. And that again speaks to what we think is a reasonable and justifiable goal of trying to reform these commodity programs so we can deal with the other priorities and still maintain an important safety net to the family farmer. 
   Again, I thank my friend from Arizona for offering the motion.

   Mr. KIND. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have great respect for the gentleman from Minnesota, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and my friend from Arkansas and their depth of knowledge when it comes to farm policy in this country. They have invested their careers in trying to understand these programs and how they work. 
   But I have as much respect and admiration for my family farmers back home in Wisconsin, too. The gentleman from Arkansas is exactly right; these are hardworking individuals playing by the rules in a market that is set out for them. But when I have producers in my district in western Wisconsin coming up to me and saying, Ron, why are we still receiving these direct payments when the market prices are so good right now? 
   I say, You know, you're right. We should be looking at this anew. 
   The gentleman from Minnesota pointed out that the first time direct payments were introduced in a farm bill was back in 1996 as a transitional program to get away from these direct subsidy payments to the farmers. 
   Now we are into the third farm bill, and instead of at least holding them constant, as the gentleman's motion would have us do, we are talking about increasing the reliance on these direct payments over the next 5 to 10 years. 
   In my conversations with farm experts from Australia and New Zealand, they said they heard the same arguments down there when they weaned their producers off direct government subsidies for agricultural production, that this would spell disaster for the entire farming community in Australia and New Zealand. And now you would be hard-pressed to go down to either one of those countries and find one farmer who wants to go back to the government-subsidized system that they were operating under all these years. They say that with a change of those subsidy programs, it has made them more efficient and more competitive, especially in the global marketplace. 
   And whether we like it not, that day has arrived for our producers. The world is at our doorstep, and I don't think we are doing them any more favors by propping them up with these artificial subsidy programs with the strong market prices they are receiving, and at the same time telling them that you can go out and compete with everyone else around the globe. 
   There is a better way of doing this while still maintaining a safety net, and I think that is what the gentleman is trying to get at with this motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. One of the things that I have noticed back home in Wisconsin with the direct payments and the overall subsidy programs that exist for these commodity crops is that it is leading to greater consolidation. We know these subsidies have been primarily skewed to the larger entities, and they are using them to gobble up smaller family farms around them. And they are also driving up land values by artificially inflating these land values with the subsidy guarantees that attach to them, and it is making it virtually impossible for newer or beginning farmers to have the capital in order to invest in order to enter this very honorable work and profession. 
   So that is the unintended consequences that these subsidy programs have brought in, putting the squeeze on smaller family farmers throughout America. 
   I think it would be reasonable as well, although we can't address it in this motion, to have some reasonable means testing attaching to these direct subsidy programs. It is tough to justify to the American taxpayer that if someone is earning $900,000 in adjusted gross income, that is profit, that is after you back out the expenses and all of the deductions of doing business, that you would still qualify for subsidy payments. 
   I understand in the course of negotiations there has been some movement, and hopefully that is a good thing; but nevertheless, that is a pretty hefty adjusted gross annual income for anyone. And then to say they still qualify for American-taxpayer subsidies at the end of the day, that is pretty tough to explain back home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before you today in support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. It is essential that we ensure that all Americans are able to maintain a decent standard of living, guaranteed in part by real living wages that reflect today's economic realities. 
   With rising health care, energy, and education costs, America's hardworking families are being forced to do more with less. While Congress has failed to raise the minimum wage over the past 10 years, it hasn't failed to raise its own pay. Since 1997, congressional pay has increased $31,600. This is simply unjustifiable. 
   America is the most prosperous nation in the world. It is unconscionable that someone can work full-time and still live in poverty. Working full-time, a minimum wage earner will only bring home $10,712 this year. This is $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. More than 125,000 Wisconsin workers would directly benefit from this legislation. 
   While it is vital that we help the most vulnerable in our society, we must also ensure the livelihood of main street America's small businesses. These small businesses form the cornerstone of our economy and are essential to the well-being of our communities. That is why it is important that any increase in the minimum wage be implemented gradually. 
   I believe H.R. 2 accomplishes that by raising the minimum wage in a manner that will help the least fortunate while simultaneously protecting small business owners from sharp payroll increases. Sixty days after this legislation is enacted, the minimum wage would increase to $5.85 per hour. One year later, it would rise to $6.55 per hour and reach $7.25 a year after that. 
   The American public supports raising the minimum wage. In November, six States passed minimum wage ballot measures. Currently, 28 States, including Wisconsin, have minimum wages above the Federal level. The time has come for Congress to listen to the States and the public and pass this important and overdue legislation. 
   I thank you Mr. Speaker, and urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing and give America's minimum wage earners a well-deserved raise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for his leadership on this issue. I am proud as a 10-year member of the House Education and Labor Committee to stand here in support of H.R. 5. 
   With all due respect to my colleague from North Carolina, the previous speaker, facts can be a stubborn thing. The fact of the matter is, if we implement this law, if we get the President to support this cut in interest rate burden in half, over 750,000 undergraduates in my home State of Wisconsin will realize cost savings, over half of them in my home congressional district alone. 
   They are looking at, on average, about a $14,000 debt burden by the time they finish school; and with this bill, they will realize close to $4,400 in savings with this interest rate reduction, which almost covers a full year of tuition at a public university in my home State of Wisconsin. So, yes, facts can be a stubborn thing. What we are doing here is real. 
   But let us also recall why we are today, because we are following in the wake of the largest raid on student aid in our Nation's history when the Republican Congress last year, in their budget reconciliation, cut over $12 billion from the student aid program, that the President went along with. 
   The irony is that budget reconciliations are supposed to reduce the deficit. What they did in delivering huge tax breaks to the most wealthy was doing that cut in student aid while also increasing the deficit, which is another thing that we need to emphasize here today, that we fully pay for this bill because of the pay-as-you-go budgeting rule we implemented this year. 
   Can we do more on accountability? Should there be more transparency in why there are rising costs? Should we be doing more with direct grant programs? Of course. 
   This isn't the final step of a long journey, but merely the beginning. I hope that by the rhetoric that we are hearing today that we will be able to produce a bipartisan higher education bill later this year that we can all be proud about, that will focus on access and affordability issues. 
   I may propose one way to find some cost savings. The Congressional Budget Office indicates that if we expand access to the STAR program, the direct loan program, we could realize over $17 billion worth of savings over the next 10 years, and that is based on a very conservative utilization estimate from 25 to 44 percent. That is a very conservative increase in utilization. 
   In fact, if every school participated in a direct loan program, we could realize savings of over $60 billion these  next 10 years. Imagine what we can do for student-need-based programs and direct grant programs like the Pell Grant program with an additional $60 billion freed up for this higher education bill. So it is one proposal that I throw out there that maybe we can have a discussion about as we move forward with reauthorization of the higher education bill. 
   But I suspect we are going to get bipartisan support with H.R. 5. We should with this bill today. Not only does it bring real savings to real students making college more affordable, but we do it in a fiscally responsible manner by paying for it all and not adding to the deficit. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5658, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   I would like to start by commending the outstanding service provided by our men and women in the armed forces and thanking them for the terrific job they do for us across the globe each and every day, often in very difficult and dangerous circumstances. In return, I believe it is our duty as Congress to provide our troops with the support and resources they need to do their job as safely and effectively as possible. It is a credit to Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member HUNTER that we have been able to fulfill this important obligation with strong bipartisan support. 
   I especially thank the committee for addressing an issue of particular importance to me and one of my constituents in this legislation. During a 15-month deployment in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Sergeant Jeff Frawley endured extremely harsh conditions in the mountains near Pakistan. Despite these hardships, he selflessly re-enlisted to serve his country for another 4 years. 
   Upon his return to the United States, Sergeant Frawley's company was forced to live in barracks at Fort Bragg that were infested with mold, suffered from decrepit plumbing, and  were structurally unsound. While visiting his son, Sergeant Frawley's father took pictures of the barracks and eventually posted a video of them on the internet. 
   The appalling conditions to which soldiers such as Sergeant Frawley have been subjected upon their return to the United States are an embarrassment. The improvement of these facilities must be of the highest priority for this country. Our returning troops deserve better. That is why I am proud to support H.R. 5658, which increases the Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization account for the Department of Defense by $650 million. This additional funding is directly targeted at modernizing and fixing existing barracks, and will go a long way in ensuring that Sergeant Frawley and other soldiers are provided with the resources and facilities they deserve. 
   I thank Armed Services Committee Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member HUNTER for their leadership on this critical issue. I applaud their work and urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

This bill provides a number of much-needed and deserved tax benefits to members of the military, their families, and veterans. Specifically, I am proud that the Qualified Veterans' Mortgage Bonds, QVMB, program, which impacts my home State of Wisconsin, was renewed and reformed so that the dream of home-ownership will continue to be a reality for thousands of veterans. 
   Under the HEART Act, the QVMB program will be expanded to allow $100 million annually in tax-exempt bonding for the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, WDVA, State veterans home loan program--enough funding to aid about 600 State veterans in obtaining low-interest rate home loans. This program is more important now than ever before with the ongoing credit crisis in this country, and I am proud we were able to expand this crucial program, In Wisconsin alone, the WDVA has made over 54,000 home loans to veterans through this program. 
   Our military servicemen and women have sacrificed a great deal to protect the freedoms that we so deeply cherish in this country. Their sacrifices and extended tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, have placed greater economic hardships on their families here at home. The bill before us today will help alleviate some of those hardships by giving military families much needed and deserved tax relief and making permanent some of the temporary provisions that Congress has previously enacted. 
   The HEART Act is one simple but significant way we can thank our troops for their service to our country. I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support our men and women in the military by passing this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6275, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to have helped craft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers. 
   Unfortunately, over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under the guise of ``relief'' for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented as tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers, many of whom are hardworking middle class families. 
   Specifically, H.R. 6275 provides for a 1-year patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was developed in the 1970s to ensure that America's wealthiest could not take advantage of the tax code in a way that would allow them to avoid paying taxes altogether. The AMT was not indexed for inflation, however, and without this legislation it will reach into the pocketbooks of middle-class families it was never intended to hit. In my district alone, the AMT could affect 50,000 additional western Wisconsin families this year, many of whom have no idea they face a tax increase. Without this legislation, it is estimated that the AMT will hit an additional 538,970 taxpayers in Wisconsin and 25 million nationally. It is hard for me to think of something more important than protecting 25 million Americans from a tax that was never intended for them. 
   Most importantly, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules that the Democratic majority restored at the beginning of this Congress. The legislation provides 1-year relief from the AMT without adding to the deficit by closing loopholes in the tax code, encouraging tax compliance, and repealing excessive government subsidies given to oil companies. These changes establish fairness in the tax code and show that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After years of fiscal recklessness--deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out-of-control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL for putting together this common sense bill that is not only fair but does the right thing by paying for the bill and fixing some inequities in the tax code. I look forward to working with him to reform the tax code and for once and for all put an end to the AMT and Congress having to do a yearly patch. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. Protecting millions of taxpayers from being caught by the AMT is of the utmost importance. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6275.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) as well as Mr. Castle, for the bipartisanship that they have shown in bringing forward this important piece of legislation. I do rise in support, because my State is home to one the premier research institutions in the entire world for stem cell research, the University of Wisconsin at Madison. But the point is this: This research is going to go forward. The question is where and under what ethical guidelines it does so. 
   If we want to remain the most creative and innovative country in the world, at the forefront of medical and scientific discovery, we need to allow this research to occur here and not abroad. We are currently experiencing a serious brain drain in the medical research community of some of our best and brightest going overseas so they can conduct this research in this promising field of study. 
   I would rather see us, through our watchful guidance and oversight, see this being done here under very strict ethical guidelines, which are laid out in this legislation, as given to us by the National Institutes of Health, guidelines that prohibit human cloning, that prohibit the creation of embryos for the sole purpose of medical research. 
   This should be here, and I hope today we receive bipartisan support in passing this important legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill would expand the current Federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after August 9, 2001, while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure Federal oversight of the research. I am pleased the 110th Congress has taken immediate steps to address this important issue, and it is my hope that members will once again unite in support of this bill. 
   Most of the scientific community believes for the full potential of embryonic stem cell research to be reached, the number of cell lines readily available to scientists must increase. A number of NIH Directors have testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee that the current policy is restrictive and hinders scientific progress. 
   We are already at risk of losing our scientific and technological edge because of increasing competition around the world. As a nation of opportunity and innovation, we have a responsibility to embrace policies that create breakthroughs in both medicine and technology for the benefit of our citizens. 
   Important advances in the science of embryonic stem cell research have been made since the August 2001 policy was set. Recently, researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison developed a method to grow human embryonic stem cells without using mouse feeder cells. This is exciting news since mouse feeder cells are thought to be a source of contamination if the cells are ever to be used therapeutically in humans. 
   From its earliest days, Wisconsin has been at the forefront of embryonic stem cell research. The University of Wisconsin--Madison is one of the leading facilities for stem cell research, and I believe with continued study, the possible medical benefits of stem cell research are limitless; lives affected by diseases, damaged tissue, and faulty organs would be greatly improved. Additionally, this legislation would ensure the important work of our scientists is not unnecessarily sidetracked by politics. 
   The significance of this legislation extends beyond the potential for advances in science and technology. More importantly, embryonic stem cell research could lead to new treatments and cures for the over 100 million Americans afflicted with life-threatening and debilitating diseases. Scientists believe these cells could be used to treat many diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. However, the promise of this research may not be reached if the Federal policy is not expanded. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has become increasingly clear that the American public supports expanding the Federal stem cell policy. Thus, I strongly urge my colleagues to respond to the interests and needs of our Nation's citizens. Please join me in supporting this important legislation that will reinvigorate embryonic stem cell research in this country and allow science to move forward unimpeded, revolutionize the practice of medicine, and offer hope to the millions of Americans suffering from debilitating diseases.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, last fall, my 8-year-old son Matt, while he was sleeping, fell off the top of his bunkbed, broke his clavicle. As Tawni and I were driving to the emergency room to get treatment to this kid in excruciating pain, I thought of the numerous parents throughout America who fear the financial consequences of taking care of their child in an emergency or if they had an ear infection or an abscessed tooth or an asthma attack because they didn't have adequate health care coverage for that child. That is wrong. That is unacceptable. And we change that today. 
   The CHAMP Act expands health coverage to 5 million more children, and with the reforms we make under the Medicare system, we extend the solvency of Medicare for three additional years, unlike the Republican-passed Medicare reform bill passed just a few years ago that called for the largest expansion of entitlement funding in over 40 years, with no ability to pay for it. 
   We pay for this bill with a modest increase in the cigarette tax, which is also the best thing we can do to prevent these kids from being addicted to that poison and incurring smoking-related illness with associated life-long health costs. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of HR 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. The CHAMP Act makes crucial investments in children's health, preventive care, rural providers, and improved services for Medicare beneficiaries. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Over the past several months, this Congress has debated how best to resolve serious problems facing this country's healthcare system: how do we provide responsible, reasonable healthcare coverage to children of working families? How do we modernize the benefits package provided to seniors under Medicare? How do we ensure that physicians and other providers caring for these seniors are paid fairly under Medicare? And finally, how do we accomplish all of these goals while at the same time adhering to the responsible budgeting rules this Congress has adopted for itself through pay-as-you-go budgeting rules? 
   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee faced with these issues, I can tell you that it has not been easy. I do not believe, however, that our constituents elected us to come to Washington and make the easy decisions. We are here to govern, to balance competing and often equally deserving interests, and to arrive at a solution that we think is best for this country. I believe the CHAMP Act accomplishes all of these goals. 
   This legislation will expand health care coverage to some 5 million new children across the country, allowing them to receive the vital preventive care that we know is essential for a healthy future. The CHAMP Act pays for this new investment through an increase in the federal tobacco tax, a move that itself will improve the health of our children by making cigarettes more expensive to buy. The forty-five cent tobacco tax increase included in this bill will reduce youth smoking rates by almost seven percent and will result in significant future savings in healthcare costs. 
   The CHAMP Act also invests in this country's seniors by eliminating cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare. This move will allow seniors to get essential services--such as check-ups, cancer and diabetes screenings, and flu and pneumonia vaccines--for no out-of-pocket costs. 
   We know that in order to improve seniors' quality of life and to prevent and detect life-threatening diseases, we must make this investment in prevention and primary care. I am proud of this important advance. 
   Lastly, this legislation ensures that rural healthcare providers are paid fairly for the services they provide to seniors. The Medicare program provides a vital healthcare safety net for seniors living in rural areas. The CHAMP Act ensures that this level of care can continue by providing fair payments to physicians, ambulance providers, home health agencies, and other practitioners who care for the more than 9 million seniors living in rural areas. 
   The CHAMP Act is the right choice for Wisconsin and the right choice for this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of the rule and strong support of the reauthorization of the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. 
   As a former member of the Education and Workforce Committee over the last 10 years, I have been heavily involved in Head Start programs, the reauthorization process in previous Congresses, and had an opportunity to visit many of the Head Start centers throughout my congressional district throughout western Wisconsin. They are doing a terrific job not only helping our children, typically, who are very high-risk, high-need children, get off to literally a head start when it comes to their individual development and education, but also working very closely, as my friend from Indiana just highlighted previously, the close partnership with the parents of those children, which is crucial to the success of this program. 
   I want to commend the members of the committee for producing this product, in particular Chairman Miller and chairman of the subcommittee, Dale Kildee, along with Ranking Member Castle and Ranking Member Buck McKeon. I know a lot of them have collaborated and worked closely to produce this. 
   There are two features in particular that I want to highlight and commend. One is making sure we get the measurements of these kids done right. I led the effort in previous Congresses to see if we could suspend the National Reporting System. This was based on studies that the National Academy of Sciences had made asking us to slow down in this assessment and standard practice until they could develop what they feel are the proper forms of measurement for kids at this age, because if we get that wrong, they said, we could actually do more harm to the children with improper measurements and assessments than doing good. 
   I am glad to see that this legislation now recognizes that suspension of the National Reporting System gives the National Academy of Sciences a chance to report back with recommendations and guidelines on what proper measurements of these children should be. 
   The second feature is requiring programs to consult with child care health experts in developing proper nutrition and physical education programs for kids at this age. 
   In light of childhood obesity and type 2 juvenile diabetes, it's going to be important that we do everything we can to make sure that our kids are getting off to the right start when it comes to quality-of-life issues, make sure that they are not going to start smoking or taking drugs, but also taking the proper nutrition and involved in the proper physical activities to make sure that  they have healthy bodies to go along with the healthy minds that Head Start is meant to produce. 
   Those two provisions in particular I commend, and I encourage a strong bipartisan vote for this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of the resolution before us. It is a very simple and straightforward resolution. It expresses our support and gratitude to our troops and our disapproval with the President's escalation plan in Iraq. I have believed for some time now that we are in desperate need of a new direction and not an escalation in Iraq. 
   It is not like we are confronted with a new plan by the President here today. We have tried three troop surges in the last 2 years alone, without the desired result. I don't know what the President sees or hears today that leads him to believe that the fourth time is a charm. 
   No, from the beginning, this has been the wrong war at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. We now know that Saddam Hussein did not, in fact, possess weapons of mass destruction. He had no involvement in the attacks on September 11. He had no links with al Qaeda. I believe then, as I do today, that while he may have been potentially dangerous, he was eminently containable. 
   But I too must share some responsibility for having supported the Iraq resolution in the fall of 2002. I did so while believing the President when he stated that the goal was disarmament and not regime change, that war would be a last resort and not a convenient option, that he would work through the U.N. Security Council and with the international community rather than taking unilateral action. 
   But I also believed that it was important at that time to get weapons inspection teams back in Iraq to search for weapons and to keep an eye on Saddam so he didn't develop capability to do harm. I also believe that we could not accomplish that goal without a threat of credible force hanging over Saddam's head. 
   When, in fact, we did accomplish it and got inspection teams back in with unfettered access, I was sitting through administration briefings asking them if we were cooperating with them and directing them to suspected sites. Of course we were, they said, but they are not finding anything. 
   That is when that pit in my stomach first formed, that perhaps Saddam did what he said he did all along, and that is disarm. That is when I, along with my friend and colleague, Sherrod Brown, drafted a letter signed by 150 of our colleagues in January of 2003 asking the President to give the inspection teams time to do their job and not rush in because they were not finding anything. 
   But instead of heeding our advice, he ordered the inspection teams out, sent our troops in with insufficient forces to secure the peace, with no plan for the day after, with no clear objectives and with no exit strategy, all contrary to the Powell Doctrine. Now we are where we are today with over $500 billion already spent, over 3,000 lives lost, over 23,000 injured who have returned home. And we are faced with no good options. 
   Yes, we do need a new direction and not an escalation. It is time for us to turn over responsibility for security to the Iraqi people so we can begin a redeployment of our forces, first within the country, let us get them off the front lines and off the main streets of Baghdad, where they can still play a support role, but which could also lead to a redeployment eventually out of country. We can then refocus our energies on the real national security threat, and that is dismantling the al Qaeda global network that we face, making sure we don't lose Afghanistan, making sure the Taliban doesn't reconstitute themselves and making sure that we bring those who are directly responsible for September 11 to justice, like Osama bin Laden, who is still at large and roaming free today. Ultimately, this conflict cannot be solved militarily, but only by tough political compromises between the Sunnis, Shia and Kurds. We cannot do this for them. 
   We also need to get the Arab League involved, because they can help with reconstruction, they can help with security, and they can help add legitimacy to the Iraqi government. It is not in their interest to see the Sunni-Shia conflict spread outside of the Iraq borders and sweep the region, which is a very real threat today. Nor is it in Iran and Syria's interests to be on the opposite sides of a civil war that may break out in Iraq. That is what a plan, a new direction should look like, one that we should be pursuing, rather than just more of the same, stay the course. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity on three occasions to visit our military command and our troops in the field in Iraq. I also visited our troops during the height of our military engagement in the Balkans. Nothing has made me prouder to be an American than seeing our troops in action, because they are so very good. They are well motivated, they are well trained. They are the best our Nation has to offer. 
   I have had 18 military funerals in my Congressional district alone, most of which I personally attended. If I don't have to attend another military funeral, if I don't have to pick up the phone to call another grieving family, I will be one of the happiest people in the world. They are a constant reminder of the human toll this is having, not only with our troops but with their families and our communities. There is not a day that goes by when I am not concerned about the safety and welfare of our troops. 
   That is exactly why we should be debating this resolution, because it is imperative that war is a last resort, that we as policymakers do everything we can to get the policy right because of the impact it has on our troops, their family, and our communities. It is important that we give them a mission with which they can succeed. 
   It is time to stop asking our troops to babysit a civil war. It is time to ask the Iraqis to stand up. It is time to support this resolution and give the President a clear indication of where this Congress stands.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very simple motion. I understand we are in the waning, perhaps minutes of conclusion of the farm bill. But, nevertheless, I think it's important that we get the policies right. We do need a farm bill. We need it as soon as possible. It's planting season back home. Our farmers need some predictability. They need to know what rules they are being to be operating under, one way or another. But we need a good farm bill, not a bad farm bill; one that tries to get the policy right, not the wrong way. 
   I still believe there's more room for reform under the commodity programs in light of record high commodity prices. It's tough to justify to the average taxpayer that what is still being considered under the current farm bill is close to $25 billion of direct payments to go out over the next 5 years, bearing no relationship to price or production. It's not a safety net. These are entitlement funding, automatic payments that go to large producers, primarily merely due to their existence and not because of market. 
   But there's another important feature of this farm bill and that is the conservation title. This farm bill offers this Nation the greatest public investment in private land ownership in regards to anything else we do around here. For a very long time, we have had important land and water conservation programs set up on a voluntary and incentive basis to help our producers be good stewards of the land; good manure management practices so they are not running off and polluting our rivers and streams and lakes and tributaries, making sure we have got buffer strips in place, making sure we have got the ability to absorb more CO  
   2 from the atmosphere so we don't lose ground on the global warming battle that we are confronting. 
   This is something that also benefits the American farmer, family farmers in every region. But it also benefits the community at large through enhanced water quality programs, through habitat protection, and wildlife, which is also vital to our own local and regional economies. Yet what is being considered right now in the conference is a dramatic reduction in the level of funding that came out of the House. 
   The House had an historic passage of conservation funding last year, calling for another over $5 billion in these conservation programs. This, I think, in part, is to address the backlog of demand because today, under current funding, close to two out of every three farmers applying for conversation funding assistance are turned because of the inadequacy of funds. So the demand is there. 
   But what makes these programs especially attractive is their so-called ``green box payments.'' They are nonmarket, nontrade-distorting, still a way to help our family farmers manage their own land, but in a way that doesn't distort the marketplace. What's being considered now is a dramatic reduction in the level of funding that came out of the House originally. 
   Our motion to instruct today would merely ask the conferees to try to get back to that House level of funding rather than going even below where the Senate took it. The Senate was proposing a $4.2 billion increase. We were over $5 billion. It's my understanding, and I haven't been privy to the ongoing negotiations, but they are talking about just a $4 billion increase under conservation, substantially below where the House went. 
   More specifically, this motion would instruct conferees to maintain the House funding for the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. That is the main program that helps with manure management projects throughout the Nation, especially beneficial to large animal feedlots that have to control that and prevent the spillage into the environment. 
   It would also maintain the allotment for the Grassland Reserve Program. There is more pressure being put on these highly sensitive and highly erodible lands because of the increase in commodity prices. It would also maintain House funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program. That, of course, is a great filter that exists throughout our communities to enhance quality water supplies but also crucial to water fowl populations in North America. 
   It would also accept the Senate Sod Saver Provision so that the Federal Government doesn't incentivize the conversion of sensitive virgin prairie land back into crop production. Again, given the pressure that exists with these historically high commodity prices, it's a real concern that more of this virgin prairie land that has been vital for conservation efforts, especially in the Great Plains, are going to be brought back into production with the consequent adverse environmental and conservation effects that would result. 
   So that is merely what this motion to instruct would do; get back to what the House passed last year under conservation, give the farmers throughout the country the tools they need to be good stewards of the land, and do it in a nonmarket, nontrade-distorting fashion, especially in the tremendous increase in commodity prices today and the pressure that producers are under to bring the land that has been conserved for many years back into production and resulting with a lot more sediment and nutrient runoffs that will be a consequence of that action. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the comments of my good friend from Oklahoma and the hard work that he has done. But these are two individuals who serve on the Agriculture Committee. In fact, my friend from Pennsylvania is the Chair of the subcommittee in charge of this conservation title. My friend from Oklahoma is the ranking member of the subcommittee in charge of the conservation title. 
   All we are asking them and the conferees from the House to do is to protect their programs and to protect their funding level, that which was contained in the House-passed version of the farm bill last year. That is a simple request, and it received good support in the House when it left last year. 
   But there is an additional wrinkle that was just introduced, to my knowledge, within the last 24 hours, and that is the consideration to start capping payments under the conservation title. I think that would result in bad policy. I think it is going to result in a lot of unintended consequences, because these conservation practices aren't marketable, unlike the subsidies going to commodity crop producers, where they grow something and they can sell it in the marketplace. 
   To get a farmer to have a good manure management system in place or to have buffer strips and that, they can't take that outside then and sell it to the private marketplace. So these incentives are important to partner with the individual landowner to get them to do the right thing on their own land. And they want to do the right thing on their own land. 
   That is why two out of every three of them are being denied funding right now, because of the inadequacy of funds. The demand is exceeding the supply. We are saying let's try to catch up to that demand right now, which brings huge societal benefits at the same time, to enhance quality water supply throughout our country. And I still believe that is going to be one of the major challenges we face, not only in this country, but throughout the world in this century. How are we going to maintain a quality water supply? And if we can't partner to the level they expect in farm country, it is going to make that challenge all the more difficult. 
   So I would hope the conferees in their discussion and last minute deliberations of where they are going to find a nickel or dime in order to pay for things don't go down that road of trying to cap these conservation payments, like many of us have been proposing under the commodity title.     
   I think we can pay for what we are requesting in this motion through some more commonsense reasonable reforms under the title I commodity program, starting at another look at these so-called direct payments. They are slated to go for another $25 billion over the next 5 years alone. In fact, unfortunately Mr. Flake's motion to instruct failed a little bit earlier, but all he was asking is, let's just keeping those direct payments at the current funding level, a maximum of $40,000 instead of increasing it at a time of high commodity prices. Not an unreasonable request. 
   But what is being considered now going from $40,000 up to $50,000 for these direct payments and having dual entities on the same farm to qualify for it. 
   I also believe it is reasonable to take another look, as the President and the administration is asking, for us to have a stricter means test under the commodity programs. Let's face it, a $950,000 adjusted gross income cutoff is in the stratosphere for most individuals in this country. We are talking adjusted gross now, not just gross income. This is after you back out your expenses and all the costs of operating that farm. That is close to $1 million of profit we are talking about that an individual would receive, and still receive these commodity subsidy payments under what is being proposed in the conference. 
   So I think there is plenty of savings that can still be had without cutting the legs off of our producers while maintaining an important safety net in case things do turn bad in farm country. And Lord knows we have seen that cycle come and go in the past. But let's  do it in a more fiscally responsible manner and maximize the scarce resources that we have for the benefit of the community at large, and that includes funding under the conservation title. 
   A few groups have already weighed in on this motion to instruct and have expressed their support, from the Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, the World Wildlife Fund, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Working Group, American Rivers, those who have been actively engaged in participating and trying to shape this next farm bill. We still have an opportunity because the conference has not closed, no report has been filed yet. There is going to be some last-minute negotiations. But ultimately, at the end of the day, if my colleagues are serious about having a farm bill concluded and implemented into law, the President has to be comfortable in doing it, and clearly he is not there yet, the administration is not there. And they are pressing the conference to do more in reforming these commodity programs. 
   We can choose to ignore that, but at the end of the day the President has got to sign something into law, or we have to try to override a veto, which I think is going to be very, very difficult. So I think there is still a way of working with the administration, trying to produce a product that they feel comfortable with, that the President feels comfortable with. And one of the ways to do it is more reform under commodity, and have a strong conservation title at the end of the day. The President has consistently expressed his support for a strong conservation title. I don't think they would object to the requests that we are making here in this motion to instruct. 
   And let's remind ourselves, this is another way of providing help and assistance to those who are working the land in our country. This isn't separate from the help in other areas that we try to provide to family farmers; it is in addition to it, it is a supplement. And it is something that benefits every farmer in every region, and including all people throughout the country, instead of the concentrated payments that we see under the current title I commodity program. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   For my colleagues' information, I have no further speakers. I believe I have the right to close. I am prepared to do that if they are ready to close, too.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Just to wrap up my remarks, let me just reiterate. I truly do appreciate the hard work my colleagues here today on the Agriculture Committee have been doing to try to craft a farm bill that can get accomplished yet this year. It is one of the most difficult things that Members are asked to do in any Congress, is to piece together the parochial and the different interests that span this great country to find an acceptable farm bill that can get signed into law. But we still have a little ways to go. 
   And I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, as far as the feed factor with dairy production, there is no question that fixed costs are going up right now in agricultural production driven by a variety of factors, not the least of which is the energy debacle that we find ourselves in right now.  
   But I think once we start going down to that feed route, we are going to get a lot of other groups now chiming in saying: What about us? What about us? How come dairy is being taken care of? What about poultry? What about beef? What about the others that are experiencing the same type of cost increases? And then you are really talking about blowing the lid off of some of these other programs. 
   But all that I and others who are in support of this motion to instruct are asking is for the members of the committee to defend their work, defend the programs that passed the House last year, defend the funding level that came out of the House last year because of the vital importance that these programs have, not only to the individual land producers, but to the resources that are so precious to all of us in this country. 
   Now we see disturbing trends; because of the high commodity prices, great pressure to bring more highly erodible sensitive land back into production. And there will be adverse consequences from that, unless we can maintain a viable incentive based system with these conservation programs to deal with that additional pressure that producers are facing throughout the Nation. 
   I think there is a better way of dealing with the abuses that my friend from Pennsylvania highlighted under the conservation program. Certainly we can do more oversight and get more information with regards to whether individuals are milking the system. No one is in support of that. We want to clamp down on it. But let's work with USDA and NRCS and those agencies in charge of implementing it, rather than calling for a blanket payment limitation cap with crucial conservation funding. Because, again, I am afraid that without these incentives in place, I don't care how wealthy you are, there won't be much incentive for you to engage in these type of programs, which just doesn't benefit the landowner but the community and the watershed area and the wildlife at large. So we need to be careful what road we are going to go down. 
   And, hopefully, this isn't just a response to some of us who have been asking for meaningful payment limitations and means testing under the commodity program just to get back at those who have been very supportive of conservation funding. 
   I think there are reasonable means tests we can apply to the commodity title. The fact that LDP and countercyclical payments aren't going up today I think is a good thing. That means farm income is up and commodity prices are up. 
   Back home in Wisconsin, in the agriculture district that I represent, farmers for years have come up to me and said: You know, I'm not a big fan of these subsidy programs, but I just wish the market would give us a decent price so we wouldn't have to rely on them. Well, that day has come. Now today I have got producers in corn and soybean coming up to me and saying: RON, why are we still receiving these direct subsidy payments when we are getting such a good price in the marketplace? And they are right. Farmers know how these programs are working. 
   I think we can be a little bolder and more courageous in the reforms that some of us have been advocating, find those savings, so we can deal with conservation, nutrition, world development, speciality crops, and having a good energy title to this farm bill, too. This can happen, and it can happen in a way that the President feels comfortable in signing. And that will truly be a good bipartisan day then in the United States Congress. I encourage my friends to support this motion to instruct the conferees.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   He and I and others have tried to introduce the concept of more reform in this next farm bill. But I didn't intend to speak on this motion; I just want to point out a little bit of irony in what this motion would do. 
   It's my understanding that by using the 2008 numbers, it would result in a lower baseline for the commodity subsidy programs by about $11 billion, which I don't have a problem with because we have introduced a 10-point option plan to find over $10 billion of reasonable savings under these commodity programs already. So it's consistent with that. 
   But it would also call for an increase of the baseline under the conservation title of close to $2 billion and under the nutrition title of close to $35 billion because of increased food costs and eligibility under these nutrition programs. If the nutrition groups knew what the practical effect of this motion to instruct would be, they will be doing cartwheels all over this town for the next week. 
   I just wanted to point out the irony of today's baseline versus last year's baseline.

Mr. Speaker, as a 10-year member of the Education and Labor Committee, I'm very proud of the product that the chairman and the ranking member and members of the committee have produced in this Congress today. It's the most important investment that this country is going to make in the future of our Nation for many years to come, but I'm especially grateful for the inclusion of the real-time court reporter scholarship program. 
   The court reporters are the guardians of our public record, and not too many of my colleagues realize that with the Telecom Act, we mandated closed captioning for every television program in the United States. But because of the shortage of court reporters, we're having a hard time filling our courtrooms and meeting closed captioning services.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. This bill creates immediate opportunities for small businesses around the country and in western Wisconsin. Small businesses are the engine of America's economy, representing more than 95 percent of all employers, creating half of our gross domestic product, and creating three out of four new jobs nationwide. If the United States is going to continue to have a strong economy, we must give small businesses every opportunity to succeed; H.R. 976 provides the right tax opportunities for positive growth for small businesses. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY for presenting a bipartisan bill to the Committee on Ways and Means and to the House of Representatives. With their combined leadership, I know my first term on the Committee on Ways and Means will be eventful and successful. 
   Since coming to Congress, I have consistently supported a range of proposals to help small firms, including giving help to small manufacturers through tax relief and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership; creating a new small business health care tax credit; and putting the government on a ``pay as you go'' basis to restrain deficit spending that raises interest rates and restricts small firms' access to capital. 
   H.R. 976 follows this tradition by providing $1.3 billion in tax cuts targeted to small business over the next 10 years. This cost, however, is entirely offset by provisions that pay for it. The bill's tax cuts include a one-year extension for deductions on small business expenses, and it increases the amount of such expenses these businesses could deduct. It also extends for one year the tax credit for employers who hire certain disadvantaged workers, and ensures that an increase in the minimum wage would not reduce the current ``tip credit'' for restaurant employers. Most importantly, this bill accomplishes these savings for small businesses within the framework of pay-as-you-go rules. 
   Most significantly, H.R. 976 includes a provision to help simplify taxes for family farmers. Right now, if a farm owned by a married couple files as a sole proprietorship (instead of a partnership), only one spouse receives credit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. This bill allows both spouses to receive credit for the Social Security and Medicare taxes they pay while under a sole proprietorship. Filing for a partnership can be a costly and time consuming process, and this bill allows both spouses the security that comes with Social Security and Medicare benefits, without the extra burden. 
   Specifically, I know this provision will greatly benefit family farmers in western Wisconsin and around the country. This simplification will allow both spouses running a farm to receive credit for the taxes they pay, and ensures that in the event of a tragedy, or simply in old age, both of them are taken care of. 
   Small business is critical to economic strength, building America's future, and helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace. I urge my colleagues to vote for this common sense bill so we can support our most important economic driver, the small business.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-115) -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do need a farm bill. It's planting season throughout the country. The farm economy is crucial in regards to the health and well-being of our Nation. It's an integral part of the economic well-being of my home State in Wisconsin. But I always believed that we should have the right type of farm bill, not the wrong type of farm bill before us today. 
   Merely because the President is not the most popular person in the country today doesn't mean that he is always wrong. I think he is right when he is sending back a veto message telling the Congress today: We can do better. We should do better. We ought not be giving large taxpayer subsidies to wealthy individuals at a time of record commodity prices. 
   The modicum of reform that is being hailed under the commodity title is barely the illusion of reform. In fact, if you look at the three main subsidy programs that still exist and still continue on this farm bill, the loan deficiency program, the countercyclical, and the direct payment all of them are going up, in practice. They are increasing the loan rates under the LDP program, increasing the target price under the countercyclical, they are expanding the maximum amount allotted under the direct payments from $40,000 to $45,000. 
   While the gentleman from Virginia is correct that there is a little tightening of the adjusted gross payment limit to farm entities, it doesn't come anywhere close to the type of reform that is eminently justifiable in light of farm income and debt to asset ratio. 
   By the time you allow two entities on the same farm to qualify for these same direct payments, you can have a farm entity with an adjusted gross income of up to $2.5 million still receiving taxpayer subsidies. What does this mean in regards to production agriculture? It means that based on last year's schedule F tax returns that farmers file to report their income, these so-called reforms under the commodity title might affect two-tenths of 1 percent of producers around the country today. Hardly the type of reform that we should be talking about. Hardly the justification that we can take home and tell the taxpayers that we are doing right by them. 
   I believed from the beginning that we can still have a farm bill that maintains an important safety net for family farmers throughout the country in case the bottom drops out, in case they run into hard times. And we know how cyclical farm economy is. We can find savings under those subsidy programs through the reforms that are justifiable to have a strong conservation title coming out of this, strong nutrition title, research and marketing for specialty crops, and having a strong rural economic development program, not to mention the energy title that was alluded to.  
   In talking to one of my colleagues earlier this afternoon, he says he is reminded by an old Clint Eastwood film: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. There's plenty of good that you can point to in this farm bill. Certainly the increase in nutrition is justifiable in light of rising costs and eligibility and to combat hunger that is rising throughout the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
   The bad is the fact that last year when we passed the farm bill out, they were talking about an increase of $5.7 billion of funding under the conservation title. Today, coming back, it's less than a $4 billion increase. 
   Why is this important? It's important because the increase of commodity prices, there's great pressure on sensitive lands to bring them back into production, and that means it's going to affect wildlife habitat, highly erodible land with sediment and nutrient flows flowing off and contaminating our water and drinking supply. We are seeing already that CRP enrollment is dropping because farmers are choosing to take that out of CRP and putting it back into production. Instead of recognizing market forces and having the strongest possible conservation title, that was one area where they went for further savings in order to protect these large subsidies. 
   Finally, the Washington Post reported in an article today, Farm Bill Subsidy Costs May Rise. Billions More Could Be Paid Through Little-Notice Provisions. This is that new revenue-based countercyclical program the gentleman from Virginia just alluded to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds. 
   This is based on a 2-year rolling average of commodity prices rather than 5 years that the administration was proposing. But even 2 years ago, commodity prices were at or near record lows. What this means is that it will take very little for the prices to drop today for this program to get triggered and for tens of billions of dollars to be flowing out in further subsidy programs because of the way this is structured, and that is wrong. And we should be more honest, not only with the Members of this Congress of how it's going to work, but with the American taxpayer. 
   One farm economist called this new ACRE program, and I quote, ``lucrative beyond expectations.'' That is what has been created. So instead of reform, we are heading in the opposite direction. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, under of the commodity title of the current bill, we still have loan deficiency programs in place, countercyclical programs, another $25 billion of direct payments that will go out over the next 5 years regardless of price or production. A new revenue-based countercyclical program has been added to it. And then the granddaddy of all earmarks, a disaster relief fund has been created, all of which have been reformed upwards rather than down, rather than restricting it. 
   I think the gentleman I talked to earlier is right. This can be described as the good, the bad, and the ugly farm bill. Unfortunately, the ugly outweighs the good here today. But, of course, whenever you go $10.5 billion above current baseline and put enough money around and enough groups with enough individuals, you're going to get a strong vote. We understand that. 
   But someone needs to stand up here today on behalf of the American taxpayer. Someone needs to stand here in the Chamber and say the emperor has no clothes. This farm bill will continue to distort the marketplace. It will continue to paint a bull's-eye on the back of our farmers through trade-distorting policies. And I would encourage my colleagues, if they took another look, a closer look at what's being proposed here today, they would understand that we can and should do a better job. 
   I would encourage my colleagues to sustain the President's veto and do the farm bill the right way, not the wrong way.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. As a member of the Ways & Means Committee, I am proud to have helped craft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers while also moving forward on our agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate our economy. 
   Unfortunately, over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under the guise of ``relief' for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented as tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers, many of whom are hardworking middle class families struggling with rising energy and food bills. 
   First, H.R. 6049 addresses the need for more clean energy production in our country by providing long-term extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit, while amending them to increase accessibility. These long-term extensions will give utilities and investors the predictability they need to move forward with new generation projects in the years to come. The bill also addresses energy use and carbon emissions by extending multiple energy-efficient credits for homes and businesses, creating incentives for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects, and calling for carbon audit of the tax code to determine what policies are encouraging wasteful energy use and unnecessary carbon emissions. The Act also addresses our dependence on dirty foreign oil by extending and improving tax credits for the production of cellulosic biofuels and plug-in electric vehicles. 
   Most exciting of all, however, are the innovative qualified energy conservation bonds this bill creates. The qualified energy conservation bonds give states and local governments the resources needed to invest in green programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giving local authorities the power to choose what green energies to implement in their backyard is good public policy, because I know the energy needs of western Wisconsin are vastly different than those of Queens. By not picking the winners and losers in Washington, we are allowing exciting technological changes, advancements, and the market--not Congress--drive the green energy revolution. 
   In the area of tax relief, H.R. 6049 extends several popular expiring tax provisions. In particular, the bill will provide property tax relief for 30 million Americans, help for more than 12 million children through an expanded child tax credit, tax relief for more than 11 million families through state and local sales tax deduction, help for more than 4.5 million families to cover the cost of education through the tuition deduction, and relief for more than 3.5 million teachers who will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for their classrooms. 
   Finally, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules. Under the leadership of Chairman RANGEL and Speaker PELOSI, we are demonstrating that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After years of fiscal recklessness--deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out-of-control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform. 
   Again, .Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. Offering some tax relief in uncertain economic times and meeting the challenge of climate change with innovative and constructive solutions are exactly the issues this Congress should be focused on. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6049.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (REFUGE ECOLOGY PROTECTION, ASSISTANCE, AND IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 767, the Refuge Ecology Protection, Assistance, and Immediate Response Act, which I authored. Passage of this legislation today will bring us one step closer to giving our National Wildlife Refuge System a vital tool in the war being waged against invasive species. 
   For too long, our National Wildlife Refuges have been overlooked and neglected. The Refuge System has forged on as a System under siege from a number of fronts. Paramount among these has been the steady march of invasive plants and animals that have come from other places and literally taken over, crowding out the very wildlife and habitat the refuges are charged with protecting. Experts and refuge managers at the Fish and Wildlife Service have identified invasives as the number one threat to the biological integrity of our National Wildlife Refuges. Nevertheless, without the resources to maintain even the most basic functions and infrastructure--indeed, many refuge units do not have any dedicated staff at all--refuges have been able to do little to respond to invasive species. 
   This House has affirmed its commitment to our wildlife refuges by approving the largest-ever budget increase for the Refuge System in the FY08 Interior Appropriations bill. This money will begin to bring the System's budget to a level where it can stop cutting employees and shuttering refuges and begin to address its pressing maintenance and management needs. This is a good start. But with all the challenges that face our refuges, there is still a great need to focus resources on preventing the spread of invasive species. That is why we must pass the REPAIR Act here today. 
   H.R. 767 authorizes new grants that will bring the Fish and Wildlife Service together with State agencies, community groups, and private citizens to form a united front against invasives. The bill confronts the challenge of invasive species through a two-pronged approach. First, it authorizes immediate response grants when a harmful non-native species has been identified as an immediate threat to a refuge at a stage at which rapid eradication is possible. This way we will be able to prevent new invasive species from taking hold and wreaking havoc on refuge ecosystems. 
   The second line of defense in the bill are REPAIR grants, which contribute to a more long-term strategy for combating existing invasives. These grants would go to States, local governments, community groups, or individuals to remove harmful non-native species and promote native species and their habitat on lands and waters in and adjacent to National Wildlife Refuges. Additionally, the grants could be used to complete assessment projects consistent with existing State wildlife conservation plans to identify invasive species, assess the needs on the ground, and target resources to address the problem adequately and efficiently. 
   All grants would be awarded on a competitive basis and include monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure proper oversight ability by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Federal grants would cover 100 percent of the cost for projects within refuges and for immediate response projects, but a non-Federal cost share of at least 25 percent would be required for REPAIR grants on adjacent lands. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, the REPAIR Act brings together the public and private sectors to ensure the future of our Wildlife Refuge System. These are special places unlike any other in the world. They are the only Federal land system devoted primarily to the preservation of our unique wildlife resources. I know from my countless hours spent taking in the grandeur of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, admiring the special beauty of Trempealeau NWR, or proudly watching the whooping cranes take off from Necedah NWR behind their ultralight guide, that these places are an integral part of the American experience that deserve special protection. 
   I would like to thank my fellow co-chairs of the Congressional National Wildlife Refuge Caucus, Jim Saxton, Mike Thompson, and Mike Castle for helping promote our Refuge System here in the House, and for their support of H.R. 767. I also extend my great thanks to Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rahall and Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans Subcommittee Chairwoman Bordallo for their support and for helping this bill get through the committee process and to the floor today. Finally, I thank Dave Jansen and the rest of the committee staff for their expertise and tireless work on behalf of our Nation's tremendous natural endowment. 
   H.R. 767 makes good policy by fostering cooperation between government and private entities in pursuit of a common goal in the national interest. I urge my colleagues to support its passage today so we can begin to protect America's National Wildlife Refuges from further attack and degradation. We owe it to future generations of hunters, anglers, wildlife enthusiasts, and nature lovers of all types to preserve creatures and habitats that are distinctly American.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2262 because it will finally compensate American taxpayers for the minerals that are extracted from public federal lands and, at the same time, dedicate this revenue to restoring wildlife habitat, drinking water supplies, and other natural resources that have been ruined by mining operations. Mr. Chairman, these changes are long overdue, and I commend Chairman RAHALL for bringing this bill to the floor today. 
   The importance of mining to the settlement and development of the West and to western economies today cannot be overstated. Therefore, this bill does not seek to destroy the U.S. mining industry, but to bring it out of the 19th century and into the 21st. The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act at long last will force U.S. law to recognize that our public lands belong to all U.S. citizens, and any activities or industries that utilize those lands must do so for the benefit of all Americans. This bill will hold the mining industry responsible for the public minerals it extracts and for the environmental consequences of their operations. 
   For the past 135 years, the mining industry has had easy access to federal lands and was free to take what it wanted and then leave the lands in whatever condition they chose. The American taxpayer gave up their rights to these minerals and then took up the bill for cleaning up lands polluted with toxic chemicals. H.R. 2262 rightfully imposes a royalty fee on mining companies, similar to that paid by oil, coal, and natural gas companies who drill and mine on federal lands, which the Department of the Interior will use to fund environmental restoration and reclamation of abandoned mines. It is only fair that the mining industry pay to repair the damage it has done to natural resources, including drinking water supplies and prime habitat for wildlife and outdoor recreation. 
   This last point is very important to me. As an avid hunter and outdoorsman, it is critically important to me that we maintain our Nation's natural heritage for current and future generations. Federal lands harbor some of the most important fish and wildlife habitat and provide some of the finest hunting and angling opportunities in the country. For example, public lands contain more than 50 percent of the Nation's blue-ribbon trout streams and are strongholds for imperiled trout and salmon in the western United States. More than 80 percent of the most critical habitat for elk is found on lands managed by the Forest Service and the BLM, alone. Pronghorn antelope, sage grouse, mule deer, salmon and steelhead, and countless other fish and wildlife species are similarly dependent on public lands. 
   That is why sportsmen's organizations around the country support reform of the Mining Law of 1872. By passing this bill today, we will ensure the continued viability of wildlife habitat and the continued ability of hunters, anglers, and outdoor enthusiasts to pursue and pass on our sporting heritage. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2262 just makes good sense. By holding the mining industry accountable for its own actions and making it live up to certain basic environmental standards, this bill will protect the rights of all American citizens while ensuring that mining will continue in a balanced and responsible manner. I support H.R. 2262, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, legislation to fully implement the remaining recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I am pleased the new House leadership has made this one of the first major pieces of legislation debated in the 110th Congress. 
   In the 5 years since the appalling acts of September 11, our country has been fighting terrorism to protect America and our friends and allies. On July 22, 2004, the independent and bipartisan 9/11 Commission provided to Congress and the American public 41 recommendations to improve homeland security. 
   At the end of the 108th Congress, legislation was passed and signed into law that implemented some of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I was disappointed that the bill did not implement all of the Commission's recommendations. That is why I am pleased to support the bill before us today which includes all of the remaining recommendations. 
   One of the most important subjects the bill addresses is how the U.S. Government interacts with the Arab and Muslim world. The United States must extend our preemptive strategy to include winning the hearts and minds in the developing world; I believe this can be achieved through education reform. H.R. 1 would significantly enhance the International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund, which is designed to improve educational opportunities for these youth, by calling for greater funding and outlining specific purposes for the fund. 
   Education reform in the Arab and Muslim world is of great importance to me. In fact during the 109th Congress I introduced the Universal Education Act to reform education in the developing world. Despite strong evidence that education can make nations more prosperous, healthy, stable, and democratic, the total amount spent each year on foreign aid directed at education could not even build 20 American high schools. If one of our strategic goals is to defeat terrorism around the world, we need to drastically increase our foreign aid spending, and to help developing nations improve their education systems. 
   Additionally, the bill before us improves the capabilities of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center by authorizing additional funding and hiring intelligence analysts experienced in the fields of human trafficking and terrorist travel. Cutting off the ability for terrorist to leave their country of origin is a first good step to stopping another attack on U.S. soil. 
   Further, the legislation strengthens several Federal non-proliferation initiatives so that weapons of mass destruction, WMD, do not fall into the hands of terrorists. Moreover, H.R. 1 would enact the Nuclear Black Market Counter-Terrorism Act. This bill requires the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person who trades nuclear enrichment technology to a non-nuclear weapons state or provides items that contribute to the development of a nuclear weapon by a non-nuclear weapons state or any foreign person. This action sends a clear message to would be terrorists that if they do attempt to arm themselves there will be serious consequences. 
   I praise the Commission for its excellent work, leadership, patriotism, and service to our country. We owe it to the families of the victims of 9/11 and to the citizens of our country to use the report's recommendations to make certain such attacks never happen again. 
   Again, I would like to congratulate and thank the House leadership for making one of the first tasks of the 110th Congress implementing the wise reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (U.S. TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. If the gentleman will yield, I am very, very glad my colleagues here tonight are taking time to try to explain what all the news has been about the last couple of weeks, and this is a very important template of trade that has been reached with the Democratic leadership here in Congress, with the Bush administration. 
   Let me congratulate both of you for the leadership you have shown on the Ways and Means Committee on this issue and so many other economic issues that affect all of our constituents across the country. 
   I also want to commend Chairman Rangel, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; and SANDY LEVIN, who is the chair of the Trade Subcommittee; and Speaker Pelosi for the negotiation and hard work that they put into this template of how we move forward on trade agreements in this country. 
   For the first time I believe that the values of this Nation are finally starting to be recognized and reflected as a basis of these trade agreements; the attempt to try to elevate standards upwards, rather than having a race to the bottom when it comes to trade relations, because so many of our constituents have felt for some time, and we have heard it in our own congressional district, that the trade agreements really don't speak to their needs, that they are competing on an uneven playing field in relation to the rest of the world. 
   That is really what this agreement was about, was trying to level the playing field, to try to elevate standards globally, not only influencing and recognizing the needs of our workers here in America, but trying to influence and recognize the needs of workers throughout the rest of the world by having basic principles as part of the trade agreement, core international labor standards as part of these trade agreements as we move forward, environmental protections, all on an even par of enforcement with other important provisions that are part of the trade agreement. 
   But let me also admit the sheer political fact, and that is there is very little political upside in supporting trade in Congress these days because it is so unpopular back home. I think because of that, because of the growth of globalization and the interrelationship that we have now in the world economy, very few workers feel that there has been a real upside to them. 
   That is what we are trying to accomplish in this trade agreement is a recognition that they, too, have a place at the table when this comes to trade; that they do have rights that need to be protected and assured; that we should be a Nation that stands up in opposition to the exploitation of child labor or slave labor; that other workers around the world, as they do in the United States, have the right to collectively bargain so they have better leverage in negotiating decent, fair working conditions and compensation for themselves and their families, wherever they may be living in this planet. 
   But, to me, trade has been more than just goods and products and services crossing borders, although that is what most people think about as trade. Trade is also an important tool in our diplomatic arsenal. It is also about how we, the United States, chooses to engage the rest of the world, whether it is a negative engagement or a positive engagement. 
   Nothing could be more positive than having a healthy trade relationship with rules in place that everyone has to live by. I happen to believe something that Cordell Hull, who was FDR's Secretary of State, said many, many years ago, and that is when goods and products cross borders, armies don't. There is so much conflict, and there are so many rivalries, and there is so much violence in this world today that trade, if used right, with the right rules of engagement, can be a positive experience not only for our own economic needs here in the United States, but also abroad. To me, that is what this agreement really speaks to is incorporating these types of values now as we move forward. 
   We have got a few trade agreements that we are trying to work on; Panama and Peru, for instance. Colombia and South Korea may need some more work in talking to a lot of our colleagues, but at least we are establishing what those rules need to look like. Now we can get down and haggle out the details as we do move forward.

   Mr. KIND. We had a very important caucus meeting earlier today, the Democratic Caucus, talking about the provisions of this trade agreement. 
   What I heard in that caucus, and I am not going to speak on behalf of those who spoke, but there was a lot of pent-up frustration. For the last 6 years with one-party control, our  ideas, thoughts and values were excluded in terms of the template of trade agreements and what was in these bilateral regional trade agreements coming before Congress. 
   But also, as you just recognized, there is a big concern about the lack of enforcement of existing trade agreements and the likelihood of enforcement being done by this current administration in future trade agreements when they come before Congress asking for our ratification. That is a legitimate concern, a concern that I hear back home from a lot of my constituents as well. 
   Unless the administration wants to step up and start enforcing these trade agreement and say we entered into these trade agreements for a reason, and that is to uphold the terms of the agreements and make sure everyone is playing by the same rules, trade confidence in this country is going to continue to ebb, and it is going to get worse. I think that would be disastrous ultimately for our long-term national economic growth and for helping our workers and expanding economic opportunities both at home and abroad. 
   So there is a big question mark with the majority of the people in this Congress with regard to the administration's willingness to enforce these agreements.

   Mr. KIND. I look forward to working with my colleague here who, I think, appreciates this. As we go forward with this new template, we also need to focus on capacity building in a lot of these nations that we are trying to enter into agreements with, countries like Panama and Peru that aren't exactly wealthy and have a lot of resources, but to enable them to establish the institutions so they can do a better job of policing labor standards or environmental standards within their own countries. I think there is a great need and calling for us to do that. 
   But, ultimately, there has to be a willingness on our part and the administration's to take these agreements seriously and to enforce them seriously. 
   We all hear it back home; when you see someone losing their job or a plant closing down, it is usually laid at the doorstep of one of two factors. Either it is bad trade or it is illegal immigration. It is obviously more complex than that, but we need to have a broader discussion within the context of trade, as well, in regard to worker empowerment so that when people do lose a job, they don't have to make a showing of trade relation in order to get any assistance from the government. When a factory closes, it does not matter to the family affected whether it is trade related or some other circumstance, because they feel the pain the same way. 
   We have to step up our efforts in education and worker training in this country so our workers have the skills to compete in a 21st century economy and so they can be full participants. We should also be talking more about portability of health care and pension and retirement security, so it is not necessarily tied to a single job or occupation; and when they lose it, they lose all of that, the whole fabric of supporting their family is destroyed overnight.

   Mr. KIND. I think you are exactly right. I would submit that in a short while we will be engaged in a immigration reform debate in this Congress. But as long as we have a huge economic disparity right across our border and throughout the Western Hemisphere, really we will be battling the issue of people wanting to come to the United States to realize the hope and the promise of our country and a better way of life for themselves and their families. 
   Trade is a way to try to elevate people's standards upwards and create job opportunities across the globe. Or we will always be at the losing end of the immigration proposition because of what the United States has to offer and the temptation to enter this country either legally or illegally for a better way of life.

   Mr. KIND. There are a lot of positive features to trade, but the congressional district I represent, western Wisconsin, is still heavily manufacturing, a lot of agriculture, and there's been a lot of displacement and a lot of jobs lost. 
   And I don't think any of us here on the floor tonight are promising that with this new template of trade that we're going to be able to guarantee everyone's job in this country. You just can't do it. In fact, each generation of Americans have had to wrestle with their own transition and economic displacement that's occurred at that time period. Whether we're moving from the agrarian to the industrial age, from the industrial age to the information age, to the next new thing, there are going to be displacements. 
   As long as we can remain the most innovative and creative Nation in the world, which we've been able to sustain for some time, we're going to be able to make those adjustments probably a lot easier than other people around the globe. 
   I don't think anyone's here to offer this hope or promise that everyone's job is going to be guaranteed with this new template right now. We can't do that any more than we can shut down the information age or shut down the World Wide Web and the Internet. Now with the push of a button, we've got services crossing borders and collaborations being created that we've never  imagined before, and that's a large part of globalization today.

   Mr. KIND. I think you're exactly right. One of the forces, quite frankly, that we are contending with in the United States, in this hemisphere, especially in South America, is a gentleman by the name of Chavez, the President of Venezuela, who's been fond of traveling around, spending his petrodollars all around, and delivering a very anti-American message. 
   I think one of the reasons that message is starting to resonate, much to our concern, is because a lot of the workers in those countries where he's visited have felt excluded and left out of trade agreements. What's in it for them? And finally, for the first time, with this agreement, we're starting to address our concern for their needs as well.

   Mr. KIND. You're exactly right. We're less than 4 percent of the world population, and we can no sooner turn ourselves into a fortress of solitude and hope to maintain economic progress and opportunity in our own country.  
   But the Democrats in Congress haven't been dealing with trade in a vacuum. We've been promoting this innovation agenda for some time. We have had legislation on the floor to try to enhance further fields of study in those crucial fields of math, science, engineering, technology, those fields that will enable our students and workers to be innovative and creative and develop into high-paying jobs that we hope to see here in the United States. 
   We've been moving that legislation forward, working with our Senate counterparts. We're trying to increase research investment in the National Institutes of Health, for instance, so we can be at the cutting edge of medical and scientific breakthroughs. All this is interwoven into the economic agenda the Democrats have been standing for that the New Democratic Coalition has been a big part of in helping to formulate that agenda. 
   That's, I think, the direction we need, and I think the American people want to hear that type of message and see that type of agenda. Our concern is there's a lot of economic anxiety throughout the country, and they want to know what their role is going to be in this global marketplace. Perhaps more importantly, they want to know what kind of future their children have to look forward to. 
   The Democrats for the first time have been able to get legislation to the floor that speaks to those needs, that starts speaking to those anxieties. Will it solve all those problems? No, but I think it's the best hope that we have to make sure that our country is well positioned to stay competitive globally.

   Mr. KIND. I also want to commend JIM MCCRERY, who is ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Republican colleagues on Ways and Means who are also embracing this template to go forward on trade agreements. But as Chairman Rangel reminded all of us today in caucus, this new template doesn't commit any single member on future trade agreements. We will still have the opportunity to review them when the President formally submits them for our consideration. We will see if they are the best deal struck for our Nation and for our constituents' best interest. 
   I think now, with this agreement, the template is finally shaping up to where we can get wider bipartisan support. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done. We can't hold this out as the silver bullet to the challenges that our workers are experiencing day in and day out, but trade is going to be an important part of our economic equation, whether we like it or not, because of the effects of global warming and the ease of transporting goods and products, services, across borders, all that is breaking down. 
   The question is, whether we roll up in a fetal position and pretend it's not happening and try to pursue neo-isolationist policies, or whether we embrace this change and try to make the changes that we have to, to be in the best position to stay competitive. 
   That's really, I think, what the discussion will be about in the coming weeks when we start analyzing these trade agreements coming forward. I want to thank my colleagues for taking some time this evening to discuss a very important issue on the floor. Hopefully, we will have some more discussions in the future.

   Mr. KIND.

   Make no mistake, everyone is in agreement that we want to stop the AMT from affecting 20-plus million Americans next year. The difference is our party wants to pay for it; they don't. 
   We have had the fastest and largest accumulation of national debt under Republican rule in the last 6 years, and they're saying that's not enough.  
   We are almost completely dependent on borrowing money from China to finance our deficit, and they're saying that's not enough. 
   The fastest growing area of spending in the Federal budget is interest payments on the national debt, and they're saying that's not enough. Let's pile on some more and let's leave this mortgage, this legacy of debt for our children to handle. I think that is a disgrace.

   I have had numerous conversations with Mr. Inslee, who I consider one of my closest friends and colleagues in the House, and I certainly understand the appreciation that he has in light of the challenges we face with global warming and the potential impact it's going to have on polar bears. But as one of the cochairs of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus in the House, we think this amendment is unnecessary and, in fact, counterproductive. 
   I contacted the Canadian embassy and the Canadian Government, who opposes the amendment. They say it would risk crucial conservation funding streams and habitat protections for the very polar bears that we're all interested in protecting. Also, our own U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposes this, again because of the cooperative alliance that we've established not only with Canadian officials in the proper wildlife management of this special species, but the fees collected from hunting that go right back into a conservation program that the U.S. and Russia have partnered with in order to enhance the protection and the growth of this population.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Just to reiterate, Mr. Chairman, numerous agencies that have looked at the science of polar bear management in Canada and other places feel that the limited permits that are issued for this hunting purpose is conducive to conservation efforts and habitat protection up in Canada, especially through the indigenous tribes there that are issued these permits every year. 
   The Canadian letter that I just referenced earlier stated, ``Removal of the sports hunting exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act would have no impact,'' no impact, ``on the numbers harvested, but would cause economic hardship to the Canadian northern indigenous communities.'' 
   Again quoting from the letter from Canada, ``Any action such as that proposed in the amendment is premature and should at least await the outcome of the two reviews.'' The two reviews they are referring to is our own Fish and Wildlife review and also a Canadian review in regards to the status of polar bear populations, those reports are going to be coming due some time early next year. 
   Also, the National Wildlife Federation, I want to clarify, the National Wildlife Federation has not endorsed nor opposed Mr. Inslee's amendment, but they stated in a letter submitted to Members of Congress yesterday, ``We understand that there may be a debate about managing polar bear populations, which we believe is a distraction from the real issue of global warming.'' They go on to state that the only thing that could adequately protect the polar bear population is prompt action taken on global warming. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) on the importance of that issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding me this time. 
   I rise, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, in strong support of this 8-month extension of the Andean Trade Preference Act. It is the right thing to do at the right time, Mr. Speaker.  
   There is no question, as my friend from New York just referenced previously, that our image has been tattered and beaten abroad. That is no less true here in the Western Hemisphere, especially with our neighbors to the south, through Central and South America. And I have always believed that our trade policies are more than just the exchange of products and goods between our Nation and others but also an important tool in our diplomatic arsenal. An arsenal that needs to be rebuilt now even in our own Western Hemisphere. 
   But I also want to remind my colleagues that this is not a free pass for these four Andean nations to get this trade preference. They have certain strict criteria that they have to meet first to gain eligibility for these preferences. Criteria such as respecting internationally recognized worker rights, treating the United States investors fairly, providing market access to U.S. goods, demonstrating a commitment to implement its WTO obligations, and, finally, to meet the U.S. counter-narcotics criteria. 
   And on that last point, it is not insignificant that there has been substantial progress, according to our own State Department and USTR office, of the drug eradication efforts and partnership that we have established with these four Andean nations. They have also met the criteria, again, through reference of our own State Department, but ATPA is perhaps the single most effective alternative development program we have going in the region. By providing these local citizens with long-term alternatives to narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration, ATPA has helped the governments, especially in Colombia and Peru, to isolate violent extremist groups; to revise their economies; and increase their investments in their education, health care, and infrastructure system. 
   And I submit that if we are not trying to actively engage these nations to help them build their economy and expand economic opportunities, they are going to come to the United States to realize those opportunities that they are not receiving in their own countries. 
   That is why I encourage my colleagues to support this extension.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's planting season back home in Wisconsin. I still represent one of the largest agricultural producing districts in the entire Nation. Our farmers need a new farm bill. They need to know what the rules are that they have to work and live under. 
   But we need to do a farm bill the right way, not the wrong way, one that maintains an important safety net for family farmers across the country and is also responsible to the American taxpayer. 
   Unfortunately, I kind of feel like Paul Harvey here in the well today about to give the rest of the story. This farm bill could be summed up in simple words, it's a missed opportunity. In fact, it could be summarized by the phrase: Where's the beef? Where's the real reform? 
   Why do I say that? Let's take a look for a second at the so-called reforms under the commodity subsidy programs. By the time you include off-farm and on-farm income and allow double entities, dual entities on the same farm, and their adjusted gross income, you have adjusted gross income up to $2.5 million and you still qualify for taxpayer subsidies. That would constitute approximately two-tenths of 1 percent of farm entities throughout the country that might be affected by these so-called reforms under the direct payments. 
   Now let's remind ourselves, these direct payments are $25 billion, that go out over the next 5 years, regardless of price, regardless of production. It's not a safety net. It's an entitlement program that each and every one of us will have to go home and look our taxpayers in the eyes and try to explain to them why some of their tax dollars are going to go to a farm entity with an adjusted gross income of $2.5 million.     
   If you look at the loan deficiency program and the countercyclical, the two other subsidy programs that currently exist, we went in the wrong direction rather than the right direction with reform. 
   There will still be allowed double dipping under the loan deficiency program. And the loan rates are being increased rather than decreased. And under the countercyclical, the target prices are going to be increased. What does that mean? It means that they will be triggered much earlier and will cost the taxpayer much more if prices start to decline. 
   One of the reasons there is less funding under the commodity title is because we're at a record time of commodity prices throughout the country. In fact, since the last time the farm bill was on the floor last year for consideration, you look at the five major commodity titles, and they have gone up tremendously since that time: Wheat, an additional 126 percent; soybeans up 57 percent; corn up 45 percent; cotton, 32 percent; and rice, 31 percent. Those are the main subsidized crops that we have throughout the country. Yet, instead of going forward with some reasonable and imminently justifiable reform to tighten up these programs so it is more justifiable to the taxpayer, they're going in the opposite direction. 
   I always believed that we had the capability, in light of current market prices, to produce a farm bill that maintains an important safety net for our family farmers but in a way that's less market and less trade distorting and is also justifiable to the American taxpayer.

And unfortunately it's the American taxpayer who is currently facing increased costs of food and fuel that will be paying more over the next 5 to 6 or 7 years by the time we get a chance to look at the next farm bill and talk about the reforms that may be needed. 
   I led an effort 5 years ago under the last farm bill for some commonsense reforms. People back then said wait for the next one, it's coming. Well, I've been here long enough to understand that tomorrow never comes, and today is the opportunity we have, in light of current market prices, to do the right thing.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, I represent one of the largest agriculture districts in the Nation, western Wisconsin. We do a lot of corn, a lot of soybeans, a lot of beef cattle, obviously a lot of dairy. I've got a 200-acre farm myself, and we rotate corn and soybeans, have some beef cattle on it. One  of the additional concerns I have with the subsidy programs is how skewed it is to the very biggest entities. 
   Over two-thirds of these commodity subsidy programs are going to the 10 percent largest entities in agriculture today. Why is this a problem where I'm from? Well, a lot of these big entities are using the additional subsidy money to gobble up the family farms that exist around them. It's driving up land prices in Wisconsin and making it virtually impossible for new beginning farmers to enter agriculture. 
   If you look at the reforms that are being touted in this farm bill before us today, they just don't meet the test of time. The income limits that apply currently to direct payments, by the time you count dual incomes on the same farm go as high as 2.5 million in adjusted gross income. That's after expenses. That's after all the cost of doing business is deducted out. And according to last year's tax returns, for those who filed a Schedule F Farm Income Report for tax purposes, these reforms that are being touted today might affect two-tenths of 1 percent of farm entities throughout the country, two-tenths of 1 percent. Give me a break. And the income limits have been lifted for the other two subsidy programs, the loan deficiency program and the countercyclical program. 
   And to top it all off, they've created the granddaddy of all earmarks in this Permanent Disaster Fund, which we all know, based on past history, is going to be a very targeted, very regional dispersion of this new Disaster Relief Fund.     
   Now, when you think about the fact you've got three existing subsidy programs already, LDP, counter-cyclical, the direct payments, you throw on top of that the crop insurance subsidization that goes on in the farm bill, why do we need to add another layer of entitlement funding with this new disaster relief program? But we all understand how these farm bills come together. They usually go above baseline. They have to come to the Ways and Means Committee to find offsets in order to pay for it.

My fear is we're going to see it 6 or 7 years from now when the next farm bill is up for consideration. 
   It is a missed opportunity. The President is right. We ought not be giving taxpayer subsidies to wealthy individuals at a time of record-high commodity prices in the marketplace.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from Virginia, he really is an expert on these programs, but he knows as well as anyone the reason commodity spending is down is because commodity prices are up. 
   Two of the three subsidy programs are based on the amount farmers are getting in the marketplace. But that can all return in a heartbeat, and he knows it. 
   The fact is that you need a few Members of Congress here today to stand up and say the emperor has no clothes. As I said from the beginning, where's the beef, where's the real reform? 
   When you still allow taxpayer subsidies going to a farm couple with an adjusted gross of $2.5 million, that's not reform. When you lift the income limits under the LDP and the countercyclical program, that's not reform. When you increased the loan rate and the target price, it's not reform. 
   You have marginal reform with the crop insurance. Instead of having a farm bill today that has reasonable reform for taxpayers throughout the country, and has the great conservation title for the 21st century, or the healthy food bill of the 21st century, it's more status quo. It's more wait for 5 years, we will do it then. 
   Well, those 5 years never come. The time has never been better today, and the President is right. We should not be spending taxpayer subsidies for wealthy individuals at a time of record prices in the marketplace. When people are facing increased food and fuel costs, let us not do this to the American taxpayer and use their money needlessly. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.'' We can do better. I know we can do better in producing a bill that provides a safety net for family farmers but is also responsible to the American taxpayer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I thank my friend and colleague for yielding me a little bit of time to speak on his motion. 
   There is one, I think, serious concern that many of us who have been advocating reform under the commodity title, the so-called commodity subsidy programs, and that is what was done with the two subsidy programs now where funding currently isn't going out. And the reason it is not going out under the loan deficiency program and the counter cyclical program is because market prices are high.     
   That's a good thing, because farm income is good, debt to asset ratio has never been better in farm country. 
   But what this bill proposes to do, instead of holding those programs constant, they are actually increasing the loan rate under the loan deficiency program and the target price under the countercyclical program, which means that if things do turn south in farm country, if prices do drop--and we know how cyclical agriculture can be, and these are safety net programs--those programs will trigger much sooner and at a much greater expense than what I fear is being accounted for right now in this bill. 
   That, I think, speaks to the unfunded mandate concern that the gentleman from Arizona and myself, and others included, have in regards to the so-called reforms that we are just not seeing under the commodity title, not when they go in the opposite direction with the LDP and the countercyclical programs by dialing up the loan rate and the target prices of those two programs and triggering them at a much earlier time and at a much greater expense for the taxpayers of this country.  There is a whole lot of other reform that we felt were justifiable and reasonable under the commodity title. 
   Quite frankly, we don't get there. In fact, if you look at the payment limitation caps that exist under the direct payments, it would only affect two-tenths of 1 percent of farmers in this country, hardly the type of reform we would like to see.

The so-called reforms that are being advocated under the commodity subsidy title would only affect, at best, two-tenth's of 1 percent of farm entities throughout the country. 
   With an adjusted gross income limit of $2.5 million, these income limits don't even apply to the loan deficiency program or the countercyclical program, two of the three subsidy programs that exist today. At the end of the day we should produce a farm bill that's less market and less trade distorting and more responsible to the American taxpayer.

   Mr. KIND. M r. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 770 which encourages the designation of a National Veterans History Project Week. This resolution encourages increased public participation in the Veterans History Project. 
   As you may know, the Veterans History Project collects and saves the stories of America's veterans who have bravely served this country from World War I to today's conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This project provides Americans an important way to honor our soldiers: by preserving the story of their service, in their own words, for the use and benefit of future generations. 
   In 2000, I authored and Congress unanimously passed legislation creating the Veterans History Project. Since its beginning, the project has collected more than 50,000 stories and documents. In addition, the Veterans History Project was honored by Harvard University as one of the finalists for the Innovations in American Government Award competition in 2005. 
   We must get the word out to all veterans about this important initiative. We have millions of wartime veterans and civilians in this country and their stories are a reminder to us all of the costs of the freedoms we so deeply cherish. Let this resolution also serve as a reminder to the distinguished members of this body that the decisions we make here in Washington have a far-reaching impact in the homes and communities all over this great country. We must support these brave men and women whom we send out to the front lines to fight for the freedoms we are privileged to enjoy. 
   Since the beginning of our Nation, the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines of the armed forces have been called on to risk their lives and fight for the ideals that make America great. Regardless of what one thinks about the wars that they fought in, or the wisdom of our involvement, all Americans must agree that the men and women of our armed forces have responded to the call of their country and performed with honor and dignity. War veterans and the civilians who have supported them all across this Nation have stepped forward once again, this time answering the call of civic duty by recording their stories and contributing personal documents for the Veterans History Project. Their participation ensures that their accounts are recorded and preserved, becoming a part of this Nation's memory and history. 
   The volume of materials already collected by the Veterans History Project is a testament to its success. I believe, however, we can do even better. By passing this resolution today, we can encourage more participation in this important program and ensure that this vital collection of American history continues to grow even further. 
   Capturing the stories of our war veterans is more important now than ever before. Every day, America loses over 1,000 of our aging World War II veterans and with them, their firsthand accounts of that war. As our country faces new challenges and threats in foreign policy, we must not forget the events and lessons of World War II. That is why it is imperative that we capture th e stories and per sonal histories of those veterans to day before it is too late. The Veterans History Project is instrumental in accomplishing this important goal. 
   I call upon all members of this body to publicize and promote the Veterans History Project in their own districts and communities. I cannot think of a better way to honor our veterans than by trying to preserve as many of their memories and stories as possible. 
   I commend the gentleman from Nevada for introducing this resolution and I strongly urge my colleagues for their support.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2419, FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to inform my colleagues of a Fair reform amendment that I and others will offer later in this debate. 
   For too long, our farm programs have given billions of taxpayer subsidies to a few, but very large and wealthy, entities. This has got to change. Our Fair reform amendment will reform these commodity programs so they act like a true safety net. 
   Simply put, let's help farmers when they need it. Let's not when they don't. The committee bill before us, however, will continue to give taxpayer subsidies to individuals with an adjusted gross income of $1 million. It will spend $26 million in subsidies to commodity producers who are receiving at or near record commodity prices. 
   Our reform, however, will establish a real revenue-based safety net in case prices collapse. But the savings we find in phasing out direct subsidy payments we reinvest in rural America: $3 billion more for voluntary conservation programs, $6 billion for nutrition programs to combat hunger in this country, $2.6 billion for specialty crops and healthy foods programs, $200 million for rural development programs, $1.1 billion for McGovern-Dole, all of which is paid for in this current farm bill. 
   The opportunity for reform has never been better, given the strong market prices that exist today. Our reform amendment is fair and completely justifiable. 
   I urge my colleagues to support real reform so we can help family farmers when they need it, and so we can go home and justify it to the American taxpayer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, this farm bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation before this Congress in this session because it truly does affect us all.     
   It affects our family farmers. It affects consumers in America. It affects our wildlife and natural resources. It affects people who are hungry, both in this country and abroad, and it affects economic development opportunities in rural America but also in the developing world, and it affects my home State in Wisconsin, where agriculture is still the number one industry. I know, I have a 200-acre farm in western Wisconsin where we rotate corn and soybeans. I've got beef cattle on it from time to time. 
   But for too long farm policy has resulted in billions of dollars of subsidies going to a few, but very large and very wealthy entities who then gobble up family farms around them, drive up land values and make it virtually impossible for new beginning farmers to enter the business. These subsidies have distorted the marketplace, and they distort our trade policies. Too many farmers have planted for the government paycheck instead of the marketplace. This has got to change. 
   But instead of heeding the call for reasonable, justifiable reform in light of current market prices, the farm bill before us fails to even make token reforms under the Title I commodity programs. In fact, they still allow taxpayer-supported subsidies to go to individuals in this country with an adjusted gross income of $1 million. Over the next 5 years, there will be $26 billion in direct subsidy payments going out to commodity producers who are getting at or near record prices in the marketplace. And under these direct payments, the committee raises the cap from $40,000 to $60,000 and allows multiple entities on the same farm to collect the same type of subsidies. It also eliminates the cap with the loan deficiency program. 
   It's a missed opportunity. In fact, what we have before us today is a bipartisan, fair, reform amendment that takes light of the market conditions and offers reasonable and justifiable reforms under a very simple proposition: Let's give our family farmers help when they need it; let's not when they don't. 
   What we propose in our amendment would be phasing out these direct payments that were meant to be temporary in the 1996 farm bill, and now we're in the third farm bill, and they're increasing these subsidy payments and lifting the caps. 
   We also replace the current countercyclical program with a true safety net, a revenue-based safety net that even the corn growers have been working on as a replacement over the last few years. 
   We also place a tighter income limit at $250,000 adjusted gross, even slightly above the administration's own $200,000 limit that they recommend. 
   Plus, we call for long-overdue reform with the crop insurance program based on the good work that our friends Mr. Cooper and Mr. Waxman have been doing in this, and we all do this under justifiable market conditions, ending up with a farm bill at the end of the day that does not distort our market, nor our trade policies. 
   For too long family farmers have suffered due to the inequities of this farm bill, and with the savings that we use to reform the Title I programs, we make significant new investments in other priority areas. We have a $6 billion increase in funding under the nutrition title to deal with hunger in America. 
   We have a $3 billion increase of voluntary incentive conservation programs, when today three out of every four farmers applying for conservation funding assistance are turned away because of inadequacy of funds. 
   We have a $1.2 billion increase for specialty crops above what the committee did, and a healthy food program to combat the obesity epidemic which is ravishing our Nation.  
   We also have $1.1 billion in guaranteed funding out of the McGovern-Dole bill and $500 million for minority and disadvantaged farmers, $200 million increase for rural development to create economic job opportunities throughout rural America. 
   And at the end of the reform, we even have money for deficit reduction. How refreshing that we may have a bill coming out of this Congress that actually reforms enough to have some left over to reduce the massive budget deficits and prepare for the aging of our Nation. 
   What's really nice about this is it is all paid for. We don't have to go to the Ways and Means Committee or the Financial Services Committee to seek offsets in order to pay for these other priorities and still provide a safety net for our family farmers. This amendment gets us out of the box that my Republican friends find themselves in in not being able to support a tax increase to finance this farm bill. 
   And you guys are exactly right. If you had been pulling this on us while we were in the minority, we would be raising bloody hell as well, because if you lose the process in the place, you lose a sense of fairness, and if you don't have fairness at the end of the day, you can't get things done. 
   We're saying we don't have to go down that road. Let's make some commonsense reforms to find the offsets to deal with the other priorities while still maintaining a proper safety net so when the farmers are in trouble, if market prices plummet, there will be a safety net for them; but let's not do it when they don't need it, so we can go home and look the taxpayers in the eyes and justify exactly what we're doing here. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Chairman, change in this place is very difficult. In fact, sometimes the toughest thing to accomplish is changing the status quo. 
   But the fundamental fact is that when you've got two-thirds of the subsidy program in this farm bill going to just 30 congressional districts who are well represented on the committee, I think it's unrealistic to expect that that committee's going to produce a policy statement that embraces reform and new ideas. I should know. I used to serve on the committee. And I'm not being critical. That's just a fact. They have their districts to represent as we have districts to represent as well. 
   My district takes a hit under this reform bill. But sometimes it takes a group of well-intentioned individuals to move the cause of reform forward, and that's what we're trying to do tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (HUBBARD ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6580 is a combination of two good pieces of legislation joined together to be pay-as-you-go compliant under our current budget rules. The first part of the bill is the Hubbard Act, an important bill introduced by my good friend and colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Devin Nunes from California. The second part of the bill (H.R. 1264) is a bill that I and Charlie Wilson of Ohio introduced to make it easier for individuals to save and to plan for their funerals. 
   Let me begin by commending Representative Nunes for sponsoring and for introducing the Hubbard Act. This bill makes an important change to the rules governing sole survivorship in the Armed Forces. It's the right thing to do. In a moment, you will realize why. 
   Representative Nunes represents the Hubbard family in California. Tragically, this family has lost two sons, Jared and Nathan, to the war in Iraq. The remaining son, Jason, left the Army under the sole survivor rule, which protects parents from losing all of their children to war by permitting the last remaining sibling in combat to return home if all other siblings have been killed or have been severely injured. This truly is the Saving Private Ryan scenario. After being discharged, however, Jason Hubbard was asked to repay significant portions of his enlistment bonus; he was denied transition health care, and he was told he wasn't eligible for GI benefits even though he had already paid into the program. 
   Currently, there are no standard benefits available to those who separate from the Armed Services under the Sole Survivor Policy regardless of whether one's service obligation was completed. The Hubbard Act will allow those troops who voluntarily separate under the sole survivor rule to qualify for the same benefits provided to those who involuntarily or who honorably separate from the military. Sole survivors of their families who have already made the greatest sacrifice should qualify for the benefits that they've earned. This bill corrects that. Again, it's the right thing for us to do. 
   To offset the costs of the Hubbard Act, H.R. 6580 also includes language to eliminate the current dollar limitation for qualified funeral trusts. Current law limits a funeral trust to just $9,000, but this is generally no longer sufficient to cover a family's funeral and burial expenses. With this contribution limit, even those who responsibly plan for their own funerals often leave their families with substantial expenses. 
   Given that the qualified funeral trusts can only be used for specific, limited purposes, I see no reason to place a dollar limit on their use. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill will have a positive impact on the Federal Treasury. 
   The passage of this legislation is an important step for American families and funeral directors, and it would allow for seamless funeral and burial planning for families in western Wisconsin and throughout the United States. 
   I hope these two commonsense, bipartisan pieces of legislation packaged together will pass this Congress and will move to the President's desk swiftly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6580. 
   Finally, I would like to offer my thoughts and prayers to the Hubbard family. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. I hope the passage of this bill will offer them some solace, will honor their sacrifice and will respect their sons' service to our country. May God bless Jared and Nathan. 
   May God also bring a special comfort to those families who have lost a loved one while serving our Nation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KIND. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago our Nation watched with shock and horror as the I-35 bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. Many of the residents of my congressional district in western Wisconsin make a daily commute to their jobs in the twin cities. Many of them over this very bridge. Their safety and the safety of all of our residents is our utmost concern. Our thoughts and prayers go out this evening to the victims of that great tragedy along with their families and the community. 
   But at moments of great tragedy, Mr. Speaker, there are also moments of great triumph, of strangers coming to the aid of strangers, the first responders answering that emergency call, health care providers administering first aid and taking care of the injured during this great tragedy. And now it's our turn. It's our turn as a Nation. It's our turn as a Congress to come together and make sure we pass this authorization for the appropriation of funds so we can begin rebuilding this important bridge but also help the community rebuild and to ensure that this tragedy is never repeated anywhere else throughout the country. 
   I commend the leadership of the Transportation Committee, the chairman and the ranking member, the members of the committee, but especially the Minnesota delegation for how they've been able to rally amongst themselves but also to get this body to come together during this time of crucial need to do the right thing, step up and to assume our responsibility as a great Nation and come to the aid of those who have suffered during this tragedy. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill that will finally move forward important construction, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects along the Mississippi River, Great Lakes, and elsewhere. In particular, H.R. 1495 will authorize the corps of engineers' sustainability plan for the upper Mississippi River. 
   On the eve of Earth Day, founded by the great Senator from Wisconsin Gaylord Nelson, what better gift to the people of the upper Mississippi River basin than the largest ever investment in ecosystem restoration in the river's history? This bill will have a tremendous impact on water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation in the upper Mississippi River region. 
   Reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act has been a long time coming, and it has seen some improvement over the years. The current bill, for instance, includes an important provision, that I included, requiring that construction and restoration projects on the upper Mississippi achieve equal progress so that construction and navigation improvements do not degrade the river ecosystem. The WRDA bill of 1986 established the upper Mississippi River system as the only waterbody in the Nation recognized by Congress as both a ``nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial navigation system,'' so it is important that the needs of these two aspects of the river are met in tandem. 
   The Bush administration also has recognized the ecological importance of the basin by making the upper Mississippi River Basin environmental management program a priority project in the corps budget. A relatively modest program with authorized funding of $33.5 million, the EMP has demonstrated remarkable results in restoring river habitats all along my congressional district in western Wisconsin and beyond. And its long-term resource monitoring program has produced invaluable data and knowledge. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is especially fitting that we pass this bill today in light of the 20th anniversary that EMP celebrated last year. This bill, H.R. 1495, and the accompanying manager's amendment contain language assuring that the navigation and ecosystem sustainability plan will continue the EMP's mission, including long-term resource monitoring. 
   But this bill will address long-standing needs well beyond the upper Mississippi. This country's water resources infrastructure was largely constructed 70 or more years ago, and much of it has fallen into various states of disrepair and neglect. Hurricane Katrina so clearly demonstrated to the world the consequences of this lack of attention. Reauthorization of WRDA is a necessary first step in meeting the needs of our citizens, industry, and environment. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this vital legislation so that residents of low-lying areas can be reassured that  the levees that protect them will be made adequate, so that farmers will know they will be able to ship their grain downriver to be exported to foreign markets, and hunters, anglers, and birdwatchers will know that the habitat they know and love will be maintained.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to provide my strong support for H.R. 1905, The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. Ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to participate in our democracy is a responsibility I take very seriously and H.R. 1905 is one legislative measure that seeks to achieve this objective. 
   We take pride as a Nation for the numerous freedoms extended to our citizens; however, the United States is the only democracy in the world that deprives the residents of its capital full voting representation in the legislature. For the past 200 years, District of Columbia residents have fulfilled their responsibility as citizens in countless ways such as serving in the military, paying federal taxes and serving on juries. Their rights should now be extended to  include having a voice in the United States Congress. 
   There is no place in our democracy for the 206-year-old injustice of ``taxation without representation'' for the over half a million District residents. With 82 percent of our Nation's citizens in support of expanding this fundamental right to vote to all citizens, the time is now to correct this injustice and restore democracy in our Nation's capital. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to capitalize on this opportunity to extend to District residents an entitlement cherished so deeply by citizens of the United States--the right to vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill I have authored that will help scientists and local officials make informed, scientifically based decisions about one of the most important natural resources in this country, the Upper Mississippi River. 
   The Mississippi River is one of America's great national treasures, running right through the heart of this country. It is North America's largest migratory bird flyway, with 40 percent of the continent's waterfowl species using this corridor during their annual migrations. It also waters the Nation's breadbasket, providing the nutrient-rich soils we enjoy in the midwest and water for irrigation. It also provides drinking water for nearly 30 million Americans and a passageway for billions of dollars in commerce. 
   But, the Mississippi is threatened by increasing sediment and nutrient flows that gum up the river and poison its ecosystems. H.R. 2381, The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act, is a commonsense piece of legislation that would establish a coordinated public-private approach to reducing these threats, which affect all parts of the river and even the Gulf of Mexico where nutrients have created and continue to enlarge the gulf dead zone. 
   We can address these issues, but we need hard scientific data to do it. That is where this bill comes in. H.R. 2381 establishes a sub-basin monitoring program whereby the United States Geological Service will monitor where nutrients enter the river and use computer modeling to follow the nutrient flows downstream. This will allow local conservationists and land managers to pinpoint exactly where conservation and education are most needed. 
   This scientific approach has received widespread approval and been endorsed by the five Upper Mississippi State Governors. I thank the Natural Resources Committee staff for helping put this innovative piece of legislation together, and I thank the chairman for his support of the bill. This bill has passed the House in each of the last three Congresses, and I urge my colleagues to support it again today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to have helped craft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers. 
   Unfortunately, over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under the guise of ``relief' for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented as tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers, many of whom are hard-working middle-class families. 
   Specifically, H.R. 3996 provides for a 1-year patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. The AMT was developed in the 1970s to ensure that America's wealthiest could not take advantage of the tax code in a way that would allow them to avoid paying taxes altogether. The AMT was not indexed for inflation, however, and without this legislation it will reach into the pocketbooks of middle-class families it was never intended to hit. In my district alone, the AMT could affect 50,000 additional western Wisconsin families this year, many of whom have no idea they face a tax increase. Without this legislation, it is estimated that the AMT will hit an additional 437,000 taxpayers in Wisconsin and 23 million nationally. It is hard for me to think of something more important than protecting 23 million Americans from a tax that was never intended for them. 
   Additionally, this bill extends several popular expiring tax provisions. In particular, the bill will provide property tax relief for 30 million Americans, help for more than 12 million children through an expanded child tax credit, tax relief for more than 11 million families through state and local sales tax deduction, help for more than 4.5 million families to cover the cost of education through the tuition deduction, and relief for more than 3.5 million teachers who will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for their classrooms. 
   Finally, and most importantly, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules that the Democratic majority restored at the beginning of this Congress. The tax benefits provided are fully paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating narrowly-targeted tax breaks for  corporations. These changes establish fairness in the tax code and show that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After 6 years of fiscal recklessness--deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out-of-control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. Protecting millions of taxpayers from being caught by the AMT is of the utmost importance. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3996.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   And to my good friend from Missouri with whom I serve on the Ways and Means Committee, I would hope that as this process moves forward, we can get together and have an honest discussion of what needs to be offset, what should be extended, and how we are going to provide tax relief to 23 million Americans who would otherwise get caught up in the creeping alternative minimum tax. 
   And that's why today I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill, and I commend the chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, for helping us bring forward a bill that is not only fiscally sound but morally responsible. 
   There are some elements of common agreement. We all here agree that we want to stop the AMT from hitting 23 million more Americans, 56,000 in my congressional district alone in Wisconsin. The big difference is we pay for it; they don't. We did, as we promised the American people we would do when we became the majority this year, reinstitute pay-as-you-go budgeting rules, something that was in place in the 1990s that gave us 4 years of budget surpluses. We are paying down the national debt rather than adding to it. 
   But with the expiration of pay-as-you-go budgeting, we've had the fastest and largest accumulation of national debt in our Nation's history under their watch, under their economic plan: Over 3 trillion new dollars added to the national debt, and by the time this President leaves office, it will be 4 trillion. We went over 9 trillion in accumulated debt this week for the first time in our Nation's history, and there are consequences. 
   Let's make no mistake about this debate today. This bill will be paid for. The question is, is this generation going to have the moral responsibility to pay for it, or are we going to stick it to our children and grandchildren with more deficit financing? They are borrow and spend; we are pay-as-you-go. 
   And I don't know how many of my colleagues noticed this week, but the dollar went into a free fall. And the main reason that the dollar went into a free fall is because there was a rumor on the market that the Chinese are going to start unloading their high dollar reserves and start buying euros. And the only tools we could possibly have to counter that was in hoping another Chinese official would step up and say, no, that's not true, it's just a rumor. Fortunately, they did; otherwise the Federal Reserve would have to tighten the money supply to prop up the dollar, and we know the consequences to economic activity if that happens. 
   This is the economic dilemma that they have put us in by saddling us with huge debt. And they can talk all they want about percentage of GDP, but as long as more deficit is being accumulated, China will remain the number one purchaser of our debt today. And that is wrong for the future economic growth of our Nation, and it's especially wrong for our children. 
   So the question is, do we adhere to pay-as-you-go budgeting? We can have an honest discussion of what appropriate offsets should be in order to pay for the tax relief for 23 million families. But what shouldn't be on the table and what shouldn't be debated today is more deficit financing, which is the easiest thing to do. I'll be curious to see what type of substitute they want to offer, what their plan is, because it has got to be under pay-as-you-go budgeting. And we will see if there are some areas of common agreement with that. But what shouldn't be debated and what shouldn't be open for consideration is pay-as-you-go budgeting so we don't leave a legacy of debt to our children and grandchildren. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.

   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague for yielding to me and commend him on his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us be clear on what we are trying to do here today. We are trying to help you. We are trying to help find some cost savings on what was the largest expansion of entitlement spending in the last 40 years that was passed under your rule, with no ability to pay for it, all deficit financing, no cost-containment measures. 
   All we are saying here today with H.R. 4 is let us give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the ability to go out and negotiate a better deal for the American taxpayer. And I, for the life of me, don't understand why any Secretary, with all due respect to Secretary Leavitt's article in the papers yesterday, would not want to have this negotiating authority in their arsenal. In fact, the last outgoing Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, during a moment of unguarded candor, said after his resignation that the one thing that he regretted while serving as Secretary of Health and Human Services was ``I would have liked to have had the opportunity to negotiate.'' And he based that on his success in negotiating better prices for Cipro and FluMist. 
   The VA system is already negotiating better prices. It is working well. No one in this Congress is proposing any change or repeal with the VA system. And except for the administration's penchant for no-bid contracts, there is no other product or service in this country where we specifically prohibit the Federal Government from going out and negotiating a better price for the American taxpayer. We can change that today with passage of H.R. 4. 
   Let's give it a shot. Let us give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the discretion to negotiate better prices for our consumers.  
   In Wisconsin, there currently exist several programs that allow the state to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug costs. For instance, Badger Rx Gold is a public-private sector partnership between the State and Navitus Health Solution that on average saves participants 23 percent on prescriptions. SeniorCare is another program that has successfully negotiated lower drug costs for seniors in Wisconsin. Since enrollment in Medicare Part D began in May of 2006, there has been an increase in the number of participants in SeniorCare from 85,000 to over 110,000. 
   According to an analysis by AARP Wisconsin, more than 94 percent of SeniorCare participants are better off under SeniorCare than they would be under Medicare Part D because the co-payments are lower and the coverage is more comprehensive. Therefore, it is critical that the Secretary of Health and Human Services also have the authority to negotiate for lower drug costs so all seniors in our country can benefit. 
   Mr. Speaker, having clearly seen the success of negotiating lower drug costs at both the state and federal level, I enthusiastically support the legislation before us today, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend and colleague from California for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act before us today. As a former member of the Education and Workforce Committee, I am proud of the bipartisan work that the committee has done on this legislation. In fact, it is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will be considering all year, because we are talking about access and affordability for more for students to be able to go and develop the skills they need to be competitive in the global marketplace. 
   I also want to especially thank a number of individuals who helped include in this reauthorization the Realtime Writers Act, which is vitally important. In the 1996 Telecom Act, we mandated that every television station had to have closed captioning for the hearing-impaired community. The problem is we are not producing enough students with those real-time captioning skills in order to meet that mandate. 
   Furthermore, virtually every courthouse throughout America is experiencing vast shortages of official court reporters, who are the guardians of our public record, and yet we are not producing the students in order to meet that pent-up demand and pursue that noble and important career. 
   I want to thank Representative Andrews, who was helpful in steering this and making it a part of the Higher Education Act. Mr. Regula was a cosponsor of the original legislation with me. Senator Harkin has been the leader and champion on the Senate side to promote this bill. And I thank them for their support as well as the terrific work of the National Court Reporters Association in educating our colleagues. 
   I also want to commend Representatives Hare and Loebsack for the amendment that they offered and got adopted in this legislation that would provide competitive grants for rural leadership training skills for superintendents and principals throughout the country. 
   As those on the committee are well aware, we are facing a demographic challenge, with over 50 percent of the superintendents and principals about to retire in this country in the next 5 years. Not only is quality teaching in the classroom important, but also the quality of leadership in schools and school districts around the country is vitally important as to how well those schools are going to perform for our students. 
   So, again, I commend the committee for the work product that they have before us today, the bipartisan work that they have been able to do, and I encourage my colleagues to support this reauthorization.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2956, Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act of 2007. 
   For months, I, along with many of my colleagues in this chamber, have been calling on the President to forge a new direction with the war in Iraq. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. 
   Despite failing to meet his own benchmarks of progress, despite new reports of the unsustainable cost of this war, despite the tremendous dissatisfaction and disenchantment of the American people and members of his own party--the President recently made public statements to the effect that he is unwilling to change the course and try a new strategy. 
   The American people are dissatisfied with the deteriorating situation in Iraq. They are tired of finger-pointing and political gamesmanship. They want some answers, and they quite rightly expect and deserve one. As their elected representatives and leaders, I believe it is our responsibility in Congress to work together to move this country forward to an honest solution. 
   It is clear that American troops have accomplished their military mission. Yet we have now tasked them with forging political compromise as well, leaving them in the middle of a burgeoning civil war in Iraq. It is widely recognized that the sectarian strife taking place in Iraq right now cannot be solved through military means alone, and the President's refusal to entertain any new strategies has put our troops in an untenable position. I cannot continue in good conscience to ask our brave troops to risk their lives because I don't believe their sacrifice is being met with an equal commitment from the Iraqi people. The tough but necessary political compromises are not being made. 
   While the Iraqis are moving toward a transparent and effective government, what is missing is the necessary political accommodation to move the country towards reconciliation. Unfortunately, Iraqis by themselves appear incapable of achieving political progress. Instead, years later, they continue to lean on the United States and our military for stability, teetering on the brink of full-blown civil war without the will to make the political compromises necessary to peace. 
   Be assured that I am the last person in this chamber that wants to take irresponsible actions that would take the country into complete chaos. But American military power is not the solution to the war. More troops, more time, more money--these are not the answers. Congress needs to understand, as the American people do, that we must begin planning for a responsible withdrawal and redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq. H.R. 2956 provides for a safe and orderly reduction of troops in Iraq and a transition to a limited presence of American troops in country for force protection, training of Iraqi Security Forces, and counterterrorism missions. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   We must send a clear message to the Iraqi government that the patience of the American people is not endless, and that they must take control of their future. Passage of H.R. 2956 will help send that message. 
   I believe strongly that we must not wait any longer to send this message. The time to act is now, to force the hand of this Administration and the Iraqi government. Waiting any longer will simply lead to more fatalities for U.S. soldiers, Iraqi military, and civilians. 
   Finally, I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks and undying admiration for our men and women in uniform for their service to our country. May God bless them and their families during this difficult time. May God provide his special blessings and care for those who fell in the line of duty. And may God continue to bless these United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Chairman, I want to thank and commend my good friend Mrs. McCarthy from New York for the wonderful leadership that she has shown in the reauthorization of this important legislation. 
   I agree with my good friend and colleague from Connecticut that this is one of the more important pieces of legislation that we will be dealing with in this session of Congress, and I commend the efforts of everyone on the committee for the bipartisan support that's been shown on behalf of this bill. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation will provide a vital increase in funding for a variety of domestic volunteer service programs, including AmeriCorps, Volunteers in Service to America, and Learn and Serve America. Expanding these important community-based programs is essential so that residents in the neediest places receive the assistance that they need and deserve. 
   I'm very proud that my home State of Wisconsin has more than 35 AmeriCorps programs. Jump Start for Young Children is just one of several programs that help prepare young children from low-income families to succeed and go on in school. Just this past year, this program benefited from the service of 3,500 corps members and volunteers from over 70 colleges. Together, these individuals were able to assist more than 13,000 preschoolers in over 20 of our States in this country. I'd like to applaud the hard work and selfless efforts of these individuals who have not only rebuilt houses in communities but also lives. 
   I'm especially proud that three of my congressional staff members are former AmeriCorps volunteers: Karrie Jackelen, Brad Smith, and David De Gennaro. The contributions of these participants is truly admirable given the enormous difference they've made in so many lives. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is a yearning for community involvement and community service across this country, and it's especially acute with the youth, the children of our Nation. 
   It was unfortunate that the current President sent this Nation to war without asking for any type of contribution or significant sacrifice from the average American. Except for our troops and their families who have borne the brunt of this sacrifice and burden, there's very little asked of the American people. 
   This legislation, which was the vision of President Clinton and his administration, tries to correct that deficiency. It's a good, bipartisan bill. I encourage my colleagues to pass the GIVE Act today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, during debate tonight on the Fairness in Farm and Food Policy Amendment to the farm bill I offered with my colleagues Mr. Flake, Mr. Blumenauer, Mr. Ryan, and others, a false claim was made regarding the budgetary impact of the amendment, and I would like to correct the record to reflect the truth. While the error, to the best of my knowledge, was not intentional and the false statement was not made knowingly, I believe it is important that I make the accurate information known. 
   Tonight, Chairman Peterson stated that the savings claimed by the reforms made by the amendment were not realized, and he questioned, therefore, the validity of these reforms. Unfortunately, the statement was based on inaccurate information. After consulting with the Congressional Budget Office, it appears the Chairman was basing his comments on a comparison with current law rather than a comparison to H.R. 2419, which was how our amendment was drafted. The official CBO score shows that our amendment would have, in fact, saved the government billions of dollars during both the five- and 10-year windows in relation to the bill as reported by the Agriculture Committee. 
   It is unfortunate this mistake was made on the House floor tonight and was not corrected at the time. When writing policy that affects every single American, it is important that we base our decisions on timely and accurate information. I appreciate this opportunity to provide the real facts on our amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise, obviously, in support of the legislation. I do want to take a moment and thank my good friend from Texas for being an original sponsor of the legislation that we had introduced earlier this year in regards to disaster relief. 
   Madam Speaker, as you know all too well, it's always bittersweet to be before the Congress promoting a disaster relief bill; bitter because of the disastrous effect that disasters have on so many families and businesses throughout the country, and certainly we have received our fair share this year alone. But also sweet, given the bipartisan cooperation that we're seeing from the leadership, the leadership on the committee, and I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their help and assistance with this package, and the urgency in order to get this done so that we can get the assistance out and the help provided, so we can start rebuilding our communities again, getting people back in their homes, getting businesses up and functioning, hiring people and restoring people's lives. 
   And we believe this Disaster Tax Relief Act is the right approach. It has three major features to it that I think merits attention. One is, by using the Tax Code, you build in some predictability and certainty for anyone throughout the country who's affected by disaster. Doing it this way, we don't have to wait for Congress to take an action on an appropriation bill or provide FEMA with more funding in order to get help out there. 
   Another important feature is that it is a nationwide, consistent and fair approach; so that Members, given their seniority or position on certain committees, don't have increased leverage in providing assistance to their area while neglecting other areas throughout country. By dealing with these tax provisions, it applies uniformly throughout the Nation in every district, every State, they qualify merely based on a Federal disaster declaration in that area. 
   Then, finally, I believe it provides additional assistance to businesses. Over the last year in dealing with the floods that have devastated the upper Midwest and talking to community leaders, but especially business owners, I was struck by the frustration business owners had in what little disaster assistance is out there for them to get their businesses up and going. About their only recourse, since they don't qualify for direct FEMA grants, was for them to go to the Small Business Administration and negotiate a loan at a rate that's typically not even competitive with local bank rates in their area. By revising these tax provisions this is, I think, a direct response of the need for providing more help to businesses, large and small, that are also affected by these disasters. 
   Real quickly, to highlight some of the provisions, the measure changes limitations to the deduction of personal casualty losses. It waives limits on charitable deductions for relief associated with federally declared disasters. Businesses can write off or deduct qualified disaster expenses through 2011. Businesses hurt by disasters can carry back now net losses for up to 5 years. 
   And two more provisions that I have to commend the Iowa delegation especially in promoting and getting including in this legislation, from Mr. Boswell to Mr. Loebsack and Mr. Braley, the additional low-income housing credits that's in this bill, and the private activity bond provisions for housing bonds and for business property projects. 
   As Mr. Brady also indicated, there is an increase in the charitable mileage rate that Mr. Lewis from Georgia has been advocating for some time in order to help those who are incurring travel expenses for charitable purposes to keep pace with the increased energy costs that they're facing. This will make it a little bit more affordable for them to continue these activities. 
   About a little over a year ago, Madam Speaker, the rains came, the waters rose, and the flooding occurred in the upper Midwest. And just when so many people were returning to their homes and getting back into their business, early in June this year we suffered the same type of flooding phenomena. It was a double whammy within a 10-month period of time. 
   To go through it once is one thing. People have this rallying effect and this collective responsibility to one another, and it's truly inspirational seeing how complete strangers show up on people's doorsteps to help. Seeing how the local community leaders and the first responders are the first ones out there battling the devastating effects of these disasters. 
   But to get hit within a 10-month period of time with the same type of disaster really takes the wind out of the sails. People have been looking for the government, the Federal Government, along with State and local agencies and all the help that they're getting from the private sector to enable them to get back up on their feet. 
   The floods in the upper Midwest over the past year that devastated the State of Iowa, northern Illinois, southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin and portions of my district were tough enough. And then to see Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the devastating effect that that has caused to so many lives in the southern part of our country, the wildfires out west, there is a great urgency and need in order to move this disaster relief package forward. 
   This is one aspect of it. There will still be an emergency supplemental appropriation bill to provide disaster assistance as well. But again, given the outlines and the contours of this legislation, we think it's a uniform, fair approach with built-in predictability, so that if a disaster declaration is declared, people know what they can expect and what type of relief they can have. And then coupled with the assistance that FEMA is able to provide. 
   Let me just conclude by thanking FEMA for the assistance that they've provided, at least in the upper Midwest that I personally witnessed. They brought teams in that were the height of professionalism, very sensitive to the needs. They tried to expedite the process as quickly as possible while staying true and responsible to taxpayer funds. We appreciated that assistance as well as the coordination that they provided at the State and local level. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to support the legislation. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, I do want to thank and commend the leadership of this Congress, from Speaker Pelosi to Minority Leader BOEHNER, as well as the leadership on the House Ways and Means Committee, to Mr. Rangel, to Mr. McCrery, and my colleagues on the committee. 
   I also want to thank all the hard work and effort that our staff on the committee and off the committee have put in to putting this legislation in order. 
   And disasters, as my friend from Texas so eloquently stated, is not fun. It is not fun seeing the effect that it has on families, on little children, on businesses and the spirit of the communities. But they also are a time of great inspiration, and it really tests the true character of any community. 
   And we've unfortunately seen that in a span of 10 months twice in the State of Wisconsin. We still have communities there that are wrestling with some very important decisions about possibly relocating whole towns into higher ground or to different locations where there have been businesses and homes for generations there, and it's not an easy decision. 
   At times like that, it's inspirational seeing how people come together and rally from the agencies, to local leaders, to first responders, to volunteer organizations, and complete strangers just showing up because of their concern and compassion for their fellow citizens. 
   Now, it's the country's time, and this Nation has always shown that compassionate streak, that when one area has been hit by a disaster, we all rally and collectively respond. And no one, no matter where they live, is immune from this, and that's been demonstrated again over the course of this last year. 
   We think this is an appropriate direction. We think the provisions in here are the right way to go, and I would encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIND. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I thank the Chair of the subcommittee, and I too want to commend the Chair and ranking member of the committee for bringing this important AMT fix before the Congress today. 
   Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree with my friend from New York more. These 1-year fixes of the alternative  minimum tax are just not sustainable. It is not fair, because it doesn't build in predictability and certainty with the Tax Code. That is why I commend the gentleman from Massachusetts, given the groundwork he has so far laid in trying to find a permanent fix to the AMT dilemma we face in the Nation. 
   Obviously, none of us in this Chamber or in this Congress would want to see millions of working families wake up on Tax Day realizing that because of bracket creep and the inability to index the AMT, that they are going to be facing a higher tax liability. Given the doldrums that the economy is facing right now, working class families especially can't afford to take an additional tax hit. 
   But at some point in this Chamber and in this Congress and in this country, we have to start paying for things again. That is why one of the first things that we did as a new majority last year was reinstitute pay-as-you-go budgeting rules. Not because we thought it was going to be easy or simple or fun, but because we thought it would be necessary to restore some fiscal discipline. 
   While many of us have been working on the extension of tax provisions and making sure AMT doesn't capture more working families, we are trying to do it in a fiscally responsible manner by finding appropriate offsets to pay for it so we are not adding to the debt burden of future generations. That is the great task left before us. 
   It is unfinished today, because obviously this AMT fix is not paid for, but it is something we have to take up in the next session of Congress, finding a permanent fix, and getting into the Tax Code with major reform, which is coming up next year already. 
   Again, I appreciate the leadership that the gentleman from Massachusetts and others on the subcommittee have shown so far on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support it.
