<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for H.R. 5501. 
   While most widely recognized for renewing our commitment to global AIDS relief, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 reauthorizes provisions on all three of these deadly diseases of poverty. 
   The World Health Organization reports that 1.7 million people died of tuberculosis in 2006, with 200,000 dying from HIV-associated TB. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, known as MDR and XDR, pose a grave risk to global health. These strains are far deadlier than normal TB and are much more difficult and expensive to treat. A contagious, airborne disease, TB knows no barriers or borders and can only be successfully controlled in the United States by also controlling it overseas. 
   The Lantos-Hyde Act declares TB control a major objective of U.S. foreign assistance programs. The legislation requires a 5-year plan to support the treatment of 4.5 million tuberculosis patients and 90,000 new MDR-TB cases. 
   This bill incorporates substantial portions of my bill, H.R. 1567, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act. The Lantos-Hyde Act prioritizes the Stop TB Partnership's strategy, including expansion of the successful treatment regimen for both standard TB and drug-resistant TB. It further promotes research and development of new tools. 
   Recognizing the deadly synergy between tuberculosis, an opportunistic infection, and HIV/AIDS, the Lantos-Hyde Act authorizes assistance to strengthen the coordination of HIV/AIDS and TB programs. TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS, and the explosion of drug-resistant TB in sub-Saharan Africa threatens to halt and roll back our progress in combating both diseases.

   Mr. ENGEL. I'll talk fast. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the legislation authorizes assistance for the development of new vaccines for TB. The current TB vaccine is more than 85 years old and is unreliable against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most of the worldwide disease burden. New TB vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and would lead to substantial cost savings. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 5501 today. We can control and win the fight against AIDS and TB.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RECOGNIZING THAT VIOLENCE POSES AN INCREASINGLY SERIOUS THREAT TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my House Resolution 564, which brings attention to the serious and growing problem of violence in Central America. 
   I first want to thank my colleague and the ranking member on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Dan Burton, for introducing this resolution with me. I also want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their support of this bill. 
   The February murder of three Salvadoran legislators in the Central American Parliament and the subsequent shocking murder in prison of the Guatemalan policeman linked to the crime illustrate the very real daily threat posed by violence in Central America. While this high-profile incident brought violence in Central America to a spotlight, it is, unfortunately, nothing new. 
   Homicide rates in El Salvador and Guatemala are higher today than they were in those countries' civil wars. According to government statistics, Guatemala's murder rate has doubled since 1999. 
   As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I focus intently on violence in Central America and the roots of this violence. At a recent hearing that I chaired on this topic, I was taken aback by the major role that drug trafficking plays in encouraging violence in the sub-region. 
   Ninety percent of the cocaine shipped from the Andean region to the United States flows through Central America. The sub-region's location between the highest drug-consuming and the highest drug-producing regions of the world make it particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, we are the highest drug-consuming portion of that equation. 
   If drugs are the primary factor in this scourge of violence, youth gangs are a close second. The U.S. Southern Command has estimated that there are 70,000 gang members in Central America alone. Fortunately, we are beginning to address this crisis. The United States and Central American officials have started to work together to combat violence in Central America; but, obviously, much more needs to be done. 
   This resolution recognizes the recent progress that has been made in enhancing U.S.-Central American cooperation and combating violence in Central America. The seven countries of Central America, the Dominican Republic and the United States held its first-ever dialogue on democratic security in Guatemala City this July. That meeting was the first time in almost a quarter century that high-level officials from the United States and all of these countries met formally to discuss security issues. 
   At this meeting, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Tom Shannon, announced that the U.S. strategy to combat criminal gangs from Central America and Mexico was beginning. The United States also pledged $4 million in assistance to help Central Americans begin to address this issue.  
   This resolution commends U.S. and Central American officials for their joint efforts to combat violence and encourages greater cooperation in the future. In the coming days, the Bush administration will present Congress with a plan to assist Mexico and Central America in dealing with issues of crime and violence, particularly as they relate to counternarcotics. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues from the State Department and Central America as we begin to shape a future assistance package that will address violence in Central America. 
   Finally, I want to point to one area of progress that we have seen since this resolution was first introduced in July. 
   On August 1, Guatemala's legislature approved the international commission against impunity. This is a groundbreaking agreement between the Guatemalan Government and the United Nations to combat impunity in Guatemala. It is a major step for all of us who care so deeply about curbing violence in Central America, and I want to congratulate my colleagues in the Guatemalan Congress and the executive branch on this major accomplishment. 
   Let me say in closing that one of the things I have noticed as chairman is the feeling of neglect in the hemisphere that the other nations feel that the United States is not concentrating on this region, that we are looking elsewhere in the world. I think that this resolution and what we are doing goes a long way in combating that feeling. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 564.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a 10-term member of the United States House of Representatives, co-author of the DRIVE Act, Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act, H.R. 670, and co-chair of the Oil and National Security Caucus. 
   For too long, the United States has been too dependent on foreign oil. We consume nearly 21 million barrels per day, and our appetite is growing. This reliance on a single resource is particularly troubling because much of that oil comes from nations that are unstable, unfriendly, or downright hostile. 
   Despite our economic dominance, we continue to give our money to foreign nations because we are addicted to foreign oil. Despite our military might, we remain vulnerable because we are addicted to foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for that to change. It is time for bold leadership to move us toward energy independence. 
   Energy independence is a goal that other countries are already achieving. Brazil, a nation that once relied on foreign countries to import 80 percent of its crude oil, will be entirely self-sufficient in a few years thanks to its investment in biofuels. 
   I believe we can become self-sufficient by replacing our consumption of foreign oil with domestic production of biofuels; first from corn, then from cellulosic feedstock and other biomass--including agricultural and municipal waste. 
   I am proud of the legislation that this legislative body has produced today. This bill will strengthen national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy and create new jobs, and begin to reduce global warming. 
   This legislation takes groundbreaking steps to increase the efficiency of our vehicles, making an historic commitment to American grown biofuels, requiring that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources, and strengthening energy efficiency for a wide range of products, appliances, lighting and buildings to reduce energy costs to consumers. 
   It mandates increased automotive fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020, the first such change since 1975. 
   It repeals tax breaks for profit-rich oil companies, and invests that money in clean renewable energy and new American technologies. Not only would this reduce our dependence on foreign oil, the measure would also save consumers billions of dollars. 
   Mr. Speaker, among the specific legislative initiatives in this bill near-and-dear to my heart, that I have long advocated with some of my friends and distinguished colleagues here in the House, are: 
   Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle, PHEV, and other Advanced Drive Transportation Technologies, which will save fuels costs for consumers and businesses, reduce air pollution, and decrease dependence on imported oil; 
   National Tire Efficiency Consumer Information Program, which will create a national program to educate consumers about the crucial role played by passenger tires, and the proper maintenance of passenger tires, on vehicle fuel economy; 
   Renewable Fuels Standard, which will ensure that a percentage of our nation's fuel supply will be provided by the domestic production of biofuels. It will provide a pathway for reduced consumer fuel prices, increased energy security, and growth in our nation's factories and farms. 
   United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Provisions, which establish a grant program to fund joint ventures between American and Israeli businesses, academic institutions, and non-profit agencies, with the goal of promoting the development of clean alternative fuels and more energy efficient technologies. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help pave a path to a new era in American energy. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this pragmatic and forward-looking bill. 
   Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (OPPOSING SINGLING OUT ISRAEL'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   Yesterday, I was in front of the United Nations in demonstration of protesting Iranian President Ahmadinejad's speaking to the United Nations.  
   I have always been a strong believer in the United Nations because I think that it is a good hope for world peace; but, frankly, I must say, the U.N. discredits itself, and it discredits itself once again by having this so-called Human Rights Council and the way it operates. And the U.N. really discredits itself by focusing so much hatred on one tiny little country, Israel. Whether it's in the General Assembly or the Security Council or the so-called Human Rights Council, Israel has become about 40 percent of the resolutions in the United Nations totally. 
   It's absolutely outrageous that you have countries like Algeria, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, even Egypt and Russia participating when Israel has such a better record of human rights than any of these countries. 
   The problem inherent with the United Nations, unfortunately, is you have dictatorships basically running the show. And we try to have a democratic institution, but it's inherently not, because it's dictatorships that are now a majority there. 
   It is outrageous, the Israel-bashing that goes on at the United Nations, and I am proud of this Congress for standing up and saying that enough is enough. People are dying in Darfur. We don't hear the Human Rights Council be so concerned about that as they are about bashing Israel. 
   So I strongly support this resolution. I think that the Congress does itself proud by bringing truth to the American people and to the world. And the Human Rights Council is no better than the organization that preceded it. We need to change it, otherwise the U.N. will continue to be discredited.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman for yielding to me. I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was in New York City, my hometown, where I spoke at a demonstration in front of the United Nations protesting Ahmadinejad's speaking at that world body. I also then went to Columbia University where I also participated in a protest outside of Columbia University. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to be able to tell my children and my grandchildren that I did something when evil raised its ugly head. Perhaps if there had been more of this in the 1930s, Adolph Hitler might not have come to power. He said what he was going to do, as the gentleman from Illinois just said, and he carried it out. When Mr. Ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth and do all kinds of other countless, horrific things, he means it. 
   This bill squeezes the Iranian regime where it counts the most, in the pockets, economically. No one could have  foreseen that the Soviet Union could have rotted from within. But the Iranian regime is rotting from within. They are now importing oil. There's an energy crunch in Iran. This is the way to topple that regime. I think that they are the biggest threat right now to the world. 
   The United Nations discredits itself. We will soon have a resolution condemning their so-called Human Rights Commission, which does nothing but attack Israel. We need to stand up and say that we were able to act when it counted. This is one of the most important things that the Congress can do by slapping sanctions on Iran. 
   We have the Syria Accountability Act which I introduced with the distinguished ranking member. We are going to have another bill. Syria and Iran, who represent threats to the region, need to be hit in the pocketbook, economically, in order for their regimes to collapse or for them to change their behavior. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does that. That is why everyone should support it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RECOGNIZING AND WELCOMING THE DELEGATION OF PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM THE CARIBBEAN TO WASHINGTON, DC -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from American Samoa, my classmate, we came to Congress together in 1989, for yielding me this time. I would like to thank Chairman Lantos for marking up this resolution, and for the support of many members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   I would also like to thank my colleagues. This is the first speech I am making on the House floor since the passing of my dear mother, and I want to thank my colleagues for their support and for their strength and caring for me and my family. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution welcomes a delegation of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers from 14 Caribbean nations to Washington, D.C., for the Conference on the Caribbean, which will be held next week. 
   I am the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I can tell you that the relationship that the United States has with the Caribbean nations is of paramount importance. In fact, in many of the trips that we have gone on, people have said to us they want the United States to be involved. They have a sense, many times, that we have looked elsewhere, and they don't understand why. 
   So I think it is important for our subcommittee to be involved, our committee to be involved and for the U.S. Congress to be involved in helping to foster good ties with the Caribbean nations; and of course this resolution lays the groundwork, and the interaction with the delegations from the Caribbean that will be here this week is very, very important. 
   As Mr. Faleomavaega said, the Caribbean nations are as culturally varied and physically beautiful as anywhere in the world. It is important to expand our strong relationship with the Caribbean Community, also known as CARICOM. This is an historic conference. For the first time in its history, through the coordination of the Caribbean Community, the State Department, the Congress, the Conference on the Caribbean is convening in Washington. I cannot state how important that is and how significant that is and what kind of important role the United States Congress can play. 
   I am honored to be the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, and I will do everything in my power to help facilitate relations between the United States, United States Congress and the nations of the Caribbean. 
   The Foreign Affairs Committee is pleased to be meeting with the members of this delegation on June 20 at 2:30 p.m., and I encourage all our colleagues, both on our committee and on our subcommittee, and even people that are not on our committee, to attend this meeting. 
   The delegation will also be meeting with President Bush, as well as members of the Ways and Means Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus, and as well as, of course, our Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I visited four Caribbean countries in the last 6 months and have learned much from our friends in the south. In Haiti, leaders are very appreciative for the support of the United States and for the recent passage of the HOPE legislation, but want to make sure we coordinate closely with the government on our assistance plan. 
   Further to the south, leaders of the many small island nations feel neglected by the United States and are looking for closer cooperation on energy, security, crime, education, health and other issues. Countries like China are stepping in and filling the vacuum left by the United States in these small, but strategically important countries. This is our hemisphere, the Western Hemisphere, and we simply must be more engaged. We cannot stand back and think that other countries are not going to move into the vacuum. You know, we used to go to school when we were kids and learn about the policy of ``hands off the Americas,'' but that's not true anymore. Other countries, like China and like Iran and other places, will step in if we neglect these countries. 
   Our friends in the Caribbean have offered their support for U.S. efforts to combat global terrorism. With the recent revelation that the suspects from Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana were involved in the plot to blow up JFK Airport in New York City, we need more than ever to work closely with our allies in the Caribbean to defeat terrorism. 
   I was just in Trinidad with a delegation. We met with the leader of Trinidad, and he told us in emphatic terms how closely he wanted to work with the United States to combat terrorism. They're willing, they're able, they want to work with us. We just need to show that we want to work with them. 
   Terrorism is not just a single region issue, it impacts all areas of the world. When we have friends reaching out to us in our hemisphere as allies on the war on terror, we must closely engage with them. 
   I am looking forward to this historic meeting that ushers in a new era of cooperation between the United States and the Caribbean, an area of the world to which, again, I don't believe we have been paying adequate attention. 
   The United States and the countries of the Caribbean can enhance collaboration in several important areas, including mutually beneficial trade and economic relationships, battling crime, drugs and terrorism, and combating the spread of diseases, including HIV/AIDS. There is also a golden opportunity for the Caribbean nations and the U.S. to cooperate on new and clean energy production technologies. And, again, when we were in Trinidad, we visited some of those technologies, Trinidad being a major supplier of natural gas to the United States of America. 
   Our relations with the Caribbean also are very important as there are large numbers of Americans of Caribbean heritage, as the gentleman from American Samoa pointed out, making significant contributions to our culture in America. I represent the New York City area district. In New York City and in the suburbs, and in my district alone in New York, there are very, very large numbers of Caribbean residents, including Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans, and many, many others. The Dominican Republic is a country that wants to work closely with us, a very important country. Haiti needs our attention. Grenada, where the United States invaded when Ronald Reagan was President, now we seem to be neglecting them. We visited there as well. So these are countries that we need to watch, to work with. 
   The gentleman on the other side of the aisle mentioned St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It's just coincidental that the foreign minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who will be here, went to college with me some 40 years ago in New York City. And we have maintained our friendship through all those years, never knowing that I would eventually go to Congress and he would become the foreign minister of St. Vincent in the Grenadines. And so I hope to work with him on these issues. His name is Louis Straker. These are important relationships, and we need to continue to foster them. 
   And finally, we must continue to work on ways of strengthening the relationships that have brought prosperity to many Caribbean nations and that promise to lift up those in need. It  is my hope that our friends in the Caribbean can see some real concrete results coming out of this important Caribbean Conference in Washington. 
   Let me just conclude by saying the time for rhetoric is over. It is now time for action and a real enhancement of our relations with the Caribbean. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I thank the chairman. I thank the gentleman from the American Samoa, the gentleman from Arkansas. We all need to work together. This should be bipartisan. This is good for America. We need to strengthen our ties with the Caribbean.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. After 12 long years of little to no legislation supporting the environment, I am happy to stand up today to support a week of great environmental bills. 
   In celebration of Clean Environment Week in this House, the Democratic majority has brought forward three bills that will be good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for the people of New York and the rest of the Nation. 
   This bill, H.R. 720, will reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund. The goal of this bill is to provide money to local governments in order for cities and towns across the country to improve and renovate their clean water infrastructure. The communities that will be using this money are extremely supportive of this bill. 
   The Clean Water Fund is essential to help States and municipalities make critical upgrades to their water infrastructure systems. In turn, these investments ensure clean water and foster economic development. 
   One of the most successful environmental programs in our Nation's history was the Clean Water Act of 1972. In the 35 years that it has been in existence, the Clean Water Act has helped to ensure that the water we drink as well as the bodies of water that we enjoy in nature will be clean and safe for use. 
   H.R. 720 will allow us to continue receiving the benefits of the Clean Water Act. It authorizes up to $20 billion over the next 5 years to keep our water and our environment clean. 
   Another bill we supported this week is H.R. 569, legislation to boost sewer overflow controls. This bill will authorize $1.8 billion over 5 years to prevent combined sewer overflow. Sewer overflow affects over 750 municipalities across the country. 
   During a heavy rainstorm, inadequate sewer facilities and infrastructure can easily overflow, causing major health concerns as well as an environmental mess. Madam Chairman, nobody here wants to see what happens when a sewer overflows into bodies of water around our neighborhoods. Yet Congress has done nothing to combat this problem over the past decade, despite a desperate need for action. 
   The total cost for fixing combined sewer systems across the country has been estimated to be about $50 billion. We cannot expect small towns and local governments to be able to pay for this renovation by themselves. And this problem is not lessening. Every year, we see antiquated sewer systems backing up and outdated infrastructure crumbling. The problem is getting worse, and the longer we wait, the more we will have to pay to fix it. 
   Combined sewer backups are likely to occur in 37 States and the District of Columbia. My home State of New York is one of the 37 States affected. The 17th District of New York straddles the Hudson River, which can flood under heavy rain conditions. Madam Chairman, I for one do not want to wait until we have sewers backing up in our own backyard before we take action. We have waited long enough, and passing H.R. 569 was a good first step in fixing these aging sewer systems. 
   For all these reasons, I support H.R. 720, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (BOB HOPE MEMORIAL LIBRARY -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona in whose district my son Jonathan is enjoying himself as a sophomore at the University of Arizona. I would like to thank all concerned for the opportunity to speak about my bill, H.R. 759, a bill which will name the third floor library at Ellis Island in New York Harbor the Bob Hope Memorial Library. 
   I would also like to thank Representative Gallegly for his assistance with this bill, and I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee for their help in bringing this bill expeditiously to the floor. 
   Most Americans remember Bob Hope for his work in the entertainment business as a comedian, actor, dancer and singer, as well as his work with the American troops abroad. Perhaps his work with American troops abroad is the thing that he is most remembered for. But what few know is that Bob Hope was actually an immigrant from England, came here when he was very, very young. He is sometimes even referred to as America's most famous immigrant, whose life epitomizes the American Dream. Bob Hope embodies the American Dream, and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission even called naming the library a fitting tribute. 
   After a long period of restoration, Ellis Island, where my grandparents, all four of them, came through about 100 years ago, Ellis Island was turned into a museum in 1990 with the purpose of allowing people to come and remember the 16 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island from 1892 through 1954 to pursue the American Dream. 
   Like many of the other 16 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island, Bob Hope arrived in America in 1907, which is actually the same year that my grandmother, my mother's mother, came to this country, and Bob Hope arrived in 1907 with little in the way of worldly possessions. Bob Hope described himself upon arrival as, and I quote him, ``a 4 year-old boy in knickers who had no idea of the opportunities that lay ahead.'' 
   He went on to become a household name in the United States and around the world. After arriving in the United States, the Hope family moved to Ohio, and he later studied and started his career in radio. 
   He moved on to appear in numerous movies and even Broadway plays, and is perhaps best known, as I mentioned before, for his unwavering commitment to entertaining our Nation's troops abroad. For nearly six decades, often during holidays in World War II, through Vietnam and until the Gulf War, Bob Hope traveled the globe, bringing a little bit of America to U.S. troops during times of peace and war. 
   Troops abroad even took calling him ``GI Bob.'' In 1997, Congress named him an honorary veteran. Bob Hope has been recognized in many ways for his work. He has been honored with over 1,500 awards, but this award or reward is perhaps the most fitting. 
   Some notable awards include several Academy Awards, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1962, an Emmy and a Golden Globe. Despite all the awards that Bob Hope received, he had a special place in his heart for Ellis Island. In 1990, when the Ellis Island Restoration Commission suggested naming the third floor library of the museum in his honor, he stated it would be, and I quote him, ``one of the single most important high points of my career.'' 
   Sadly, Bob Hope passed away in 2003 at the age of 100 and did not see this project finished. But today I hope we would move, as the first step, in seeing this come to fruition. 
   The Bob Hope Memorial Library will serve as a daily reminder to Ellis Island's visitors of Bob Hope's great contributions to the American people, the American culture and the American Dream. After all, it is Bob Hope. It's Bob Hope. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask to insert into the Record two statements, a letter from Bob Hope back in 1990 expressing his support of the museum, as well as a letter from the Ellis Island Restoration Commission expressing their support for this project.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my distinguished friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, for giving me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. When we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress put the interests of Big Oil ahead of enacting a comprehensive energy bill for the American people. 
   Today we begin to right that wrong by repealing $14 billion in giveaways in tax loopholes to Big Oil. We are also repealing a provision which suspended the royalty fees from oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. We simply cannot let these companies off the hook for reaping record profits without paying their fair share. 
   We will then invest these funds in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency and create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve which will also promote new energy technologies and improve energy conservation. The 110th Congress presents us with a new opportunity to advance forward-thinking 21st century energy policy. As a matter of national security we must wean ourselves off of foreign oil. 
   I will be reintroducing the bipartisan Engel/Kingston DRIVE Act, also known as the Fuel Choices for American Security Act. I hope we pass that bill as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE MURDER OF NORTHERN IRELAND DEFENSE ATTORNEY PATRICK FINUCANE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure, my friend, the chairman, to call him the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I thank him for yielding to me. 
   Before I start my remarks, I just want to pay tribute to Mr. Smith, the gentleman from New Jersey, who has been an outstanding supporter of human rights, not only for the Irish peace process, although he has been a leader in that, but throughout the world. And I commend him for this resolution, and I am pleased to be a sponsor of it, I believe the lead Democrat on the resolution; and it is something that has been a long time coming. 
   As the chairman said, the struggle for peace and justice in Ireland, particularly the north of Ireland, continues. We are all very hopeful because there has been great progress made, and we think that progress will continue to be made. And the chairman explained Sinn Fein's acceptance of policing and everything else. So we have to continue. 
   One of the things that is so important is the fact that the Finucane family, and I have met with them a number of times, they are convinced that until there is an independent inquiry, any other inquiry will be tainted. And that is why this resolution calls for an independent inquiry. We want to get to the bottom of what really happened to Pat Finucane. We all know, we all suspect, but we need an impartial commission. We need an impartial investigation because of collusion with loyalist forces and the police for many, many years. Nothing short of that will do, and that is what this resolution calls for. Before you can put the past behind you, you have got to have it all come out and know exactly what happened. 
   There has been great progress. The Irish Government, the British Government have all worked together for progress. And they are both to be commended. Both governments are to be commended because progress is being made. But there is still a long way to go. So I support this. And we still have other things that need to be put in place here in the United States, the case of Malachi McCallister, and I want to mention it, who is struggling to stay in this country, and many of us are behind him and fighting to keep him in this country. 
   There are still many injustices that have been perpetrated in the past that still have to be resolved. But starting here with inquiry into Pat Finucane's murder is something that is very, very important and very important for this Congress to go on record as supporting. And this is bipartisan. It is something, I think, that can make progress. And, again, only when we put the past behind us and let the truth hang out can we really put the past behind us. And that is what this resolution attempts to do. Again, only an independent commission will suffice.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (DTV TRANSITION ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman, and I rise in support of S. 2607, the DTV Transition Assistance Act. 
   I agree with everything that all my colleagues have said, and I certainly agree with Mr. Boucher that we really need to help facilitate the digital transition, which is what this bill does. This has been a long time coming, and we're now coming down to the wire. We have only 223 days until analog TV signals will go dark. 
   In the Energy and Commerce Committee several years ago, I joked and said when people turn on their TV sets on February 17, 2009 and their TV goes dark, many of our political futures will go dark if we don't have a good transition along the way. Since we began this process several years ago, I have been saying repeatedly that we need to make this transition work. That's why I introduced legislation, the National Digital Television Consumer Education Act. My legislation would help to educate consumers about the effects of the digital transition and what they need to do to prepare for it. 
   So I do agree with Mr. Boucher that we're ill-prepared. Even if people know that it's coming, we also have to make sure that they know how to set up their TV for digital broadcasts.

   Mr. ENGEL. People need to know how to set up their television for digital broadcasts. They need instructions on how to get the coupons that the government is providing to enable them to get these converter boxes, they need to know where to purchase the converter boxes, how to set them up, and many people need these instructions in languages other than English. 
   These are very, very huge challenges, and we are not spending nearly enough money to rise to the occasion. This bill is a good bill, but we need other legislation as well to help facilitate the digital transition. 
   In February, every American must be able to turn on their television and watch a crisp digital broadcast. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and other bills we will be providing to ease the digital transition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California and I rise to support this bill as I support all legislation dealing with the problem of spoofing. 
   I too have an anti-spoofing bill which passed the House last Congress. It was the first bill passed this year in the Telecommunications Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee as well. 
   It is very important that we deal with this problem. My colleagues have highlighted so many incidents where people have looked down at caller ID, and fraud has been committed on them. 
   People should have confidence that when they look at the caller ID, that that caller ID is accurate. And crooks and other people that want to steal people's identity should not have carte blanche. 
   The problem with this is we are always catching up with the crooks. As technology develops, crooks can think of ways to subvert it. When we realize there is a problem, Congress catches up and works to close the loophole. This is a loophole that must be closed. 
   Again, my colleagues have highlighted many of different instances where elderly people have been defrauded, where people think that they have the confidence of their bank or Social Security, they look at the number of the Social Security office, and they have confidence and they give out their Social Security numbers or other kinds of personal information which can be used to steal their identity. 
   I want to commend my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and assure them that we on the Energy and Commerce Committee will work with them. This whole Congress needs to be working together on this. This is obviously a bipartisan working together. This is not an issue where it is a partisan issue. All Americans need to have this loophole closed. The sooner we do it, the better.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 951. I am the lead Democrat on the resolution, and I am proud to be the lead Democrat, and I am glad it is a bipartisan resolution. 
   This resolution condemns the Palestinian rocket attacks on civilians in the south of Israel and supports Israel's right to self-defense. I ask my colleagues: When are these horrendous, unprovoked attacks going to stop?     
   Last week a student at Sapir College in Sderot was killed, and one other person wounded by shrapnel after a Kassam rocket fired from the Gaza Strip by Palestinians hit the western Negev campus. The rocket that struck the college's parking lot was one of a barrage of six fired 1 week ago, two of which landed in Sderot. 
   I've been in Sderot. It is a good town. There are good people there, and they live in fear. 
   According to the Jerusalem Post, a total of 22 Kassam rockets were launched in the south of Israel on that day from the Gaza Strip. In fact, Mr. Speaker, more than 4,000 rockets and mortars have been fired at Israel from Gaza since Israel withdrew in 2005. And my colleagues have mentioned that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. People say there should be land for peace in the settlement. Well, Israel gave up land, didn't get peace. It's not land for peace, it's land for war, and it's got to stop. 
   Today, longer range Palestinian rockets are hitting larger Israeli cities, representing a serious escalation in Hamas' terror war against Israel. The Hamas rockets simply continue the pattern of indiscriminate attacks on innocent men, women and children, which has been the strategy of the Palestinian terror groups for decades. They represent a blatant violation of human rights and international law by intentionally targeting civilian populations and using human shields to hide the rockets. 
   I am further concerned by the source of these weapons of terror. Published reports indicate that Iran and Syria have provided material support and training to those carrying out the rocket attacks. I was pleased to be the author of the Syria Accountable Act, and we must make sure that Syria is held accountable, and Iran as well. 
   The world stood with the U.S. after the terrorist attacks of September 11, and we must strongly support our friend and ally, Israel, at this time. The people of Israel must know that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with them as they seek to defend themselves against the terror. 
   It is important to point out that Israel's military response has been carefully calibrated to halt the rocket fire, surgically eliminate the terrorists firing the rockets, and ensure the safety of Israeli citizens, while at the same time making every effort to limit Palestinian civilian casualties. In this, the Israelis have my full support. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 951 takes a firm stand against the Palestinian rocket attacks and condemns Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations carrying out the terrorism. It holds Syria and Iran responsible for their roles enabling the terrorist organizations and offers America's strong support to our ally, Israel, as it responds in self-defense. 
   Mr. Speaker, rocket attacks against Israel must end. We must support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Ackerman) for yielding to me. 
   I speak obviously as an American, but I also speak as a New Yorker. And, Madam Speaker, there isn't a New Yorker alive, as there isn't an American alive, whose life was not changed as a result of what happened 7 years ago today on September 11, 2001. I lost many constituents in the attack on the World Trade Center, lost many friends, and even today, every week when I fly back into New York and I look at the landscape of New York City, I always imagine where the Twin Towers would be and know that the landscape has changed forever. 
   But even more importantly than the landscape, it's what was done to all of us as Americans on that day. I think we lost our innocence that day. I think the feeling that somehow or other we could never be attacked because we had the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans protecting us went out the window, and we realized that we were as vulnerable as anyone else. 
   The evil people who forced the planes to fly into the World Trade Center have many friends who are still around and would still do us harm, and we as a Nation have to be resolved, to be prepared to fight against terrorism, yes, conduct the war on terror. I know some don't like that phrase, but there is a war on terror, and we have to make sure that we do everything possible to win that war on terror. 
   As was mentioned before, we all remember where we were that day when we first heard the news. We all remember how we felt, and I remember a day or two after the carnage going down there, looking around, and standing in disbelief and saying I can't believe that this is New York, I can't believe that what I'm seeing isn't just a dream, I can't believe that I'm not going to pinch myself and wake up. 
   Let me say that we still have a fight on our hands. It's also a fight to honor our first responders, to say thank you continuously to those who protect us, and to remind ourselves that there are literally thousands upon thousands of New Yorkers and people in other States who came down in the aftermath of the World Trade Center catastrophe and helped people. And those people, as a result, have difficulty and health problems today, and we as a Nation must continue to make sure that these people are protected and taken care of and not turn the other way and look the other way. 
   Right now, the New York delegation is fighting to make sure that the first responders and others who helped people and who became sick as a result are not turned way and that we are taking care of them, and let us resolve to continue to do that and more in the aftermath of September 11. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I think that the Congress unanimously should speak with one voice and say, Never Again.

   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend from Nebraska, and I too want to rise to pay tribute to my classmate in 1988, Peter Hoagland. Peter and I were best friends, socialized with our wives and our kids many, many times. He was truly a gentleman. Both our colleagues from North Dakota and from Nebraska really epitomized what Peter meant to all of us. His wife, Barbara, and the five children, a wonderful family. 
   And let me just say that Peter was in public life for all the right reasons. He cared so much about this country. He cared so much about public policy. He cared so much about people. 
   In all the time I was with Peter, I was with him a lot, I never once heard him utter a negative word about anybody. He really truly respected this institution. He loved our country, and he respected each and every Member in this House, on both sides of the aisle. 
   It came as quite a shock to me when I found out about his passing, although I had known that he had been ill for a while. Sixty-six is awfully young, too young, when you have such a good person with such a great, keen intellect and a wonderful person. 
   So I just want to say on behalf of myself, my wife Pat, my family, and our class of 1988, we were 18 Democrats and 15 Republicans that year, we're all going to miss Peter very, very much, and may he rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill.  
   I will vote for this bill because it is important financially to my home State and City of New York, and frankly to the country. To those who say let the greedy Wall Street pigs go down without money from the taxpayers, I say, if they go down, we all go down. This won't only affect them, it will affect all of us. Jobs will be lost, people will not be able to get loans, IRA's, 401K's, pension plans, and retirement savings would be jeopardized, banks will fall, our economy would slip into deep recession or even depression. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people have told us to stop the partisan bickering in Washington. The American people want us to come together to solve problems. And that is what we, Democrats and Republicans have done in this bill. 
   Is this a perfect bill? Of course not. I would have liked to have seen a bill structured differently. I would have liked to see more emphasis in helping the average person who may be facing bankruptcy or foreclosure. I would have liked to see an economic stimulus package designed to help middle class people in the bill. But this bill has to pass both Houses and get signed by the President, so compromises had to be made. 
   Our democratic negotiators have done a good job in modifying the original bill put forth by the Secretary of the Treasury. This bill now enables the taxpayers to recoup the money from Wall Street in 5 years, if the taxpayers are not fully paid back. There is now much more oversight at our insistence. Excessive compensation is curtailed for CEO's, and the money is not being dispersed all at once. We are also able to help some people being foreclosed upon. 
   Madam Speaker, I am not thrilled with this bill, but passing it is the right thing to do for my city, my State, and my country. Wall Street drives so much of the New York economy and the economy of the United States as well. Today Madam Speaker, we have only 2 choices: vote for this bailout bill or do nothing. We cannot wait another few months, weeks, or even days to try to craft something else at this late date. If we wait, I fear that the very underpinning of our Nation's finances would very well be in great jeopardy. In that light, Madam Speaker, I will hold my nose and vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my good friend from Massachusetts for recognizing me. 
   I'm very proud that this was the first bill that was reported from our Telecommunications Subcommittee this year. We had extensive hearings last year on the bill, and this bill is truly bipartisan. 
   I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Barton, for working with me on this bill, as well as Chairman Dingell, Mr. Stearns and of course my friend, ED MARKEY. 
   When people look at their caller ID, they have a right to believe and expect that the number that is there and the name of the person who is listed there is truly the number and the name of the person calling them. And I was shocked when I first heard that can you manipulate both the name and the number. In fact, there are Web sites, you only have to dial a Web site and pay a fee and you can manipulate the name, the number. And there's even technology where you can change the sound of a person's voice. So a 50-year-old male calling can sound like a 21-year-old female, and the name is different, and the phone number is different. That should not be. 
   Constituents thought they were receiving calls from congressional offices at one time, and these calls turned out to be far from appropriate. 
   Think of the mischief that can continue to happen. Unscrupulous people can trick unsuspecting victims to release personal information such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers. It's easy for someone to pretend to be with Chase Manhattan or Citibank when you take a look and you see it says Chase Manhattan or Citibank and a number, and someone calls and says, well, we just need to verify your Social Security number with your account, and perhaps a senior citizen or someone else would feel that they could trust the caller ID and give personal information. This has to stop. 
   Having investigated this issue in great depth, I became convinced that what was happening was only a harbinger of things to come. There's a strong possibility that more and more  people will use this technology in political campaigns. Imagine calling someone at 2 o'clock in the morning and having the number of the opposite political campaign calling you to say vote for this candidate. So this is ridiculous. 
   You could have insulting, slanderous, racist, sexist calls, and people would think when they look at their caller ID that it's somebody else calling, not the person who is calling. 
   Both the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Florida pointed out numerous instances. So this is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation, one that is needed, one that the American public is probably not aware that needs to be corrected. People just don't think that this can happen. They believe in what the caller ID says. 
   So I urge my colleagues to give this important legislation strong support. This is a good step towards protecting our Nation from this emerging technology. And again, the people who use this have to have the intent to defraud in order to come under this statute. So this protects everybody, as Mr. Markey pointed out. 
   There may be some instances, Mr. Stearns pointed out, where we would want to protect this technology, where we would not want to give the correct ID. This shows that if you have the intent to defraud, you can be prosecuted under this. So it strikes a fair balance. Those were the hearings that we had. 
   And, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I'm pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvement Act. The COPS hiring program has been an unqualified success. Since the program first began in 1994, we have seen crime rates plummet throughout the country. 
   There are many factors one can point to for this drop in crime, but the most obvious one is that the COPS hiring program has given our local governments over $9 billion to hire over 117,000 police officers. 
   Law enforcement agencies in my district, New York's 17th, have received $625,984,137 in COPS grants since 1994. This funding has translated into 6,997 additional law enforcement officers in my district. Unfortunately, Republicans ended the COPS hiring program last year. A likely result of this, is that crime rates are inching upward. 
   It is essential that we stay vigilant in our fight against crime by passing the COPS Improvement Act. When this bill passes, law enforcement agencies across the country will be able to add over 50,000 police officers to our streets. In my district, we will gain $190,978,211 in funding and 2,991 more police officers. 
   But the COPS program is not just about the number of police officers; it is also about giving police officers the tools they need. Since 1994, $26,678,080 in COPS grants have been awarded to law enforcement agencies in the 17th District of New York to purchase technology that enables agencies to put more officers on the beat. This translates into more bulletproof vests and mobile computers. 
   If the COPS Improvement Act of 2007 passes into law, an additional $8,139,075 in technology grants will likely flow to the 17th District of New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities in urging my colleagues to pass the COPS Improvement Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 99, a budget resolution providing a number of common sense solutions to the budget crisis created by 12 years of Republican fiscal mismanagement. 
   I was here in 1993 when President Clinton and Congressional Democrats passed our budget resolution. And this year reminds me of 1993. We are hearing exactly the same complaints about this budget as we did that year. And we all know what happened when we passed our budget back then. 
   The Democrats helped create the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. We balanced the budget after years of Republican Presidents had pushed us deeper and deeper into debt. We helped create more wealth than had ever been created in America. We created the largest surpluses in history. And we did this without a single Republican supporting our budget. 
   In fact, the minute the Republicans got back into power, they wiped out the surpluses we gave them, and began drowning us in debt. They took the economic expansion we gave them, and drove us into recession. 
   Mr. Chairman, once again we are faced with red ink as far as the eye can see. We have a debt of almost $9 trillion, and the Republicans have abdicated any attempt to solve this. 
   The budget resolution we have introduced incorporates the pay-as-you-go rule that was one of the first acts of the new Democratic Congress. We are also increasing funding for veterans in order to fulfill the promises we made to them long ago. Our budget provides $3.5 billion more than the President's budget for veterans' health care, and $6.6 billion more than was provided in the 2007 budget. This is the largest funding increase for veterans in our Nation's history. We are also providing $50 over the next five years to cover millions of uninsured children. 
   I strongly support the Democratic budget resolution. It will help put our fiscal house back in order, without relying on the massive middle class tax increase that the President's budget includes. I would encourage my colleagues to support this budget as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007. I regret that this legislation is even necessary in the 21st Century, but even today, we see instances of pay discrimination time and time again. 
   The reason we are bringing this legislation to the Floor today is because unfortunately, activist judges on the U.S. Supreme Court have changed the rules to make it much, much harder for an employee suffering pay discrimination to bring his or her case to court. 
   Prior to that case, an employee had 180 days from her previous paycheck to file a lawsuit for pay discrimination. However, five members of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Samuel Alito, changed those rules. Now, an employee has 180 days from the time of the decision to file a lawsuit.  
   However, oftentimes it is extremely difficult to know when pay discrimination is occurring. In the Supreme Court case under which the new rules were decided, Lilly Ledbetter filed her lawsuit because she was being paid far less than the lowest paid male employee holding the same position as hers. And she only found out about this because an anonymous person slipped her a note that showed her that fact. 
   There was no way that Ms. Ledbetter could have known about her pay discrimination if she had not received this anonymous note. However, the five Supreme Court Justices decided that she could not sue because it had been more than 180 days since her employers had decided to pay her less than the men. 
   This legislation is not only beneficial to employees, it is good for employers as well. With the current strict time limits, employees have more of an incentive to file lawsuits if they suspect discrimination, simply because if they delay their suit, they will give up their right to sue. It does not make sense to encourage people to sue before they have all the facts. We should ensure that we have a statute of limitations that makes sense. 
   I have fought against pay discrimination since my first day in Congress. Discrimination of any kind should never be allowed, and I intend to keep fighting against it. 
   The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is commonsense legislation that should be enacted into law as we work to end discrimination at all levels. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 2831, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.

And I want to also salute the strong bond and ties between the United States and the State of Israel. We have shared values, we have shared concerns, and we have had a wonderful, close ally-to-ally relationship for the past 60 years, and we want it to continue for another 60 and way beyond. 
   I think it's important, at this time, to reflect the fact that Israel was created in the ashes of the Holocaust, and that the United States and Israel, sharing in common bonds, there is also a moral imperative for us to continue to stand by that beleaguered State. 
   I think it's also important to say that we must not put pressure on Israel  to make unilateral concessions in her quest for peace. It takes two to tango, and we need to have both sides make concessions and work together. 
   Let's remember that Israel left Gaza. Israel left Southern Lebanon. She was willing to do land for peace, but, instead, got land for war. So we have to be very careful and not put pressure on Israel. Celebrate her 60th anniversary. And long may the close relations between our two countries continue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a very disturbing report has come out that Iraq has agreed to award $1.1 billion in contracts to Iranian and Chinese companies to build a pair of enormous power plants. That is what the Iraqi Minister of Electricity said on Tuesday. Word of the project prompted serious concerns among American military officials who fear that Iranian commercial investments can mask military activities at a time of our heightened tension with Iran. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when young Americans are dying in Iraq and when the U.S. is spending billions of dollars in Iraq, this makes absolutely no sense at all. The Iraqi Electricity Minister said that the Iranian project would be built in Sadr City, a Shiite enclave in Baghdad that is controlled by followers of the anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. He added that Iran had also agreed to provide cheap electricity from its own grid to southern Iraq and to build a large power plant, essentially free of charge, in an area between two Shiite holy cities. 
   The expansion of ties between Iraq and Iran comes as the U.S. and Iran clash on nuclear issues and about what American officials had repeatedly said was Iranian support for armed groups. This is an outrage and should not stand.

We look forward to continuing our work with you. Thank you so much for everything you have done, and, also, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry). 
   I would to also thank our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, the gentleman  from Michigan for his strong support of this legislation. 
   This passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee in a bipartisan way and in no small part due to the people I have mentioned before. I also want to thank the dedicated majority and minority staffs of the Consumer Protection and Telecommunications subcommittees for their diligent work in crafting an excellent bipartisan, compromise bill. 
   Madam Speaker, the prepaid calling card market is a $4 billion industry. In a recent independent study it was found that, on average, companies failed to provide 40 percent of the minutes guaranteed by the card, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
   This fraud harms segments of the population who are least able to afford it, the poor, recent immigrants, minorities and seniors, and the companies don't stop there. They have even preyed upon our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is unconscionable and obviously un-American. This legislation would end the deception and the fraud that these people have suffered at the hands of unscrupulous companies. 
   Now, the bottom line for this bill is this is a consumer protection bill. If we are in favor of protecting the consumer, then we should vote for this bill, because it's very, very simple. People have a right to know that when they buy a prepaid calling card, what they see is what they get. If a card says you get 60 minutes of calling time, then that consumer who buys the card is entitled to 60 minutes of calling time. 
   What we find in little small print that nobody can see or understand, there are so many hidden fees. Some calling cards say that you only can get the 60 minutes if you call at certain times. But if you don't call at other times, you don't get the minutes. Then the time you get the minutes is only from 2 to 4 a.m., which is ridiculous. Some cards charge you 3 units, 3 minutes of call time if you get a busy signal. Or 3 minutes of call time if you are just connected, as for a connection charge, even if it was across the street or in the same State. 
   So consumers don't want to think they are being defrauded. Consumers are entitled to get what they pay for. Sometimes there are companies that are very legitimate. Most of the companies are legitimate. 
   If a company says that you get 60 minutes of calling card, and it's a legitimate card, and that card may be a little bit more expensive than the fraudulent card, the unsuspecting consumer will buy the cheaper card thinking that he or she will get a better deal, when, in reality, the 60 minutes may only be 30 or 32 or 35 minutes. 
   The bottom line is this, if you are for the consumer, if you are for truth in marketing, then you should support this bill. If you are not, and you want things to go along the way they have been, then don't vote for the bill. 
   I am so delighted that we have bipartisan consideration on this and that, in a bipartisan fashion, we all agree that this is something that really should pass. 
   Nobody, nobody should be against this, not the telecom companies, not consumer groups, not any Members of Congress. 
   If we want to stand for legitimacy and say that we want to protect the consumer, and that we want people to understand that when they purchase something, they know what they are getting, then we ought to all vote for this bill. 
   I thank my colleagues. This is a tremendous victory for the consumers in America.

   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for bringing up that very important point. He should know, as I am sure he does, that there is no intent to penalize mom-and-pop store owners or anybody who may sell a card of this degree without any knowledge that there is something wrong with the card. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to go after the companies who fraudulently manufacture and sell these cards, not to go after individual grocery stores or mom and pop stores that sell these cards. I definitely agree with the gentleman that if someone does not have a knowledge that they are selling the card that may be flawed, we should not in any way, shape or form penalize them. That is certainly not the intent of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (ALS REGISTRY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), with whom I have worked so closely during these past 20 years on so many things, and he is doing a wonderful job as chairman of our Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I am so proud that through hard work and compromise with the Senate, that today we will take up a final version of the ALS Registry Act. The House has passed this bill before. It was stuck in the Senate. We finally have it shaken loose and it is back with the Senate version which we are proud to all support. Thanks to this legislation, we will provide for the creation and maintenance of a single, nationwide ALS registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time. The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The causes of ALS are not well understood, and there is no known cure. 
   I first became aware of this disease through my grandmother. My father's mother was diagnosed with this disease. I was only 2 1/2 when she passed away. As Mr. Pallone mentioned, the most famous person with this disease is Lou Gehrig. I come from the Bronx where the Yankees play, and Yankee Stadium just had its last game on Sunday evening. The clips that we saw were from that famous speech that Lou Gehrig made at Yankee Stadium. You could hear the echoes reverberating, saying that he felt he was the luckiest man on the face of the Earth. And it is fitting that today we pass this bill, just a few days after Yankee Stadium where Lou Gehrig toiled for so many years is closing. This is a fitting tribute to Lou Gehrig. 
   A single national patient registry which collects and stores information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS does not exist in the United States today, believe it or not, and that is what this bill is going to change. 
   The establishment of a national registry will help identify the incidence and prevalence of ALS and other motor neuron disorders in the United States and collect data which is urgently needed for ALS research, disease management and the development of standards of care in order to significantly enhance the Nation's efforts to find a treatment and cure for ALS. 
   I would like to thank Steve Gibson and Pat Wildman of the ALS Association for their partnership on this bill. We have worked with them for so many years, as well as William Garner of Chairman Dingell's staff for his work on this bill. I would also like to thank John Ford, formerly of Chairman Dingell's staff and Katherine Martin, formerly of Ranking Member Barton's staff who worked so diligently on this bill prior to its original House passage in 2007. 
   I thank all my colleagues for it and urge them to pass this bill. It has been a long time coming, but it is finally here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my colleague and good friend from New York. 
   I rise to support this very important bill. Iran continues to defy Security Council resolutions by continuing to develop its nuclear program. The U.S. and our allies in the U.N. Security Council have recognized the danger that would be posed by a nuclear Iran and have repeatedly demanded that Iran suspend uranium enrichment. 
   To change Iran's course, the U.S. must increase pressure with every appropriate diplomatic and political tool. U.S. sanctions have already helped to discourage investment in Iran, and further pressure may yet convince the regime in Iran to comply with international obligations and drop its nuclear program. 
   This bill will counter Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program by sending a clear message that if Iran does not end its quest to obtain nuclear weapons, and its support for terrorism, it will face strong economic sanctions. The legislation imposes sanctions that will undercut Iran's nuclear program and support for terrorism. 
   Moreover, the legislation reaffirms our commitment to multilateral diplomacy to increase pressure on Iran to beef up its program. Finally, it explicitly states that nothing in the act authorizes the use of force against Iran. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this very important measure.

   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the chairman for yielding to me, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. For the United States, passage of this legislation will clear the way to deepen the strategic relationship with India, open significant opportunities for American firms, help meet India's surging energy requirements in an environmentally friendly manner, and bring India into the global nuclear nonproliferation mainstream.     
   This agreement marks the culmination of a decade-long process of India's emergence on the national stage and the Indian Government's effort to steer a more pragmatic and realistic course in foreign affairs. We have common strategic interests with India, and this will enhance these interests. 
   India's energy demand is expected to grow nearly 5 percent per year for the next two decades. We should be a partner in that. 
   When the Congress passed the Hyde Act, we recognized India's refusal to transfer nuclear technology to others. These unique circumstances make this change in U.S. nonproliferation policy possible. We're now poised to reap the benefits of ending India's nuclear isolation. 
   Eligibility to civilian nuclear cooperation is an essential step toward bringing India fully into the global effort to prevent onward transmission of nuclear weapons know-how. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 426 and I want to thank my colleagues, Congressmen Jim McGovern and Joe Pitts for introducing this important resolution. 
   As my colleagues have said, Colombia's internally displaced population represents one of the worst humanitarian crises in the hemisphere, and the second largest population of internally displaced in the world. 
   Many estimate that Colombia has the highest number of displaced persons in the world after only Sudan--up to 3 million people. 
   According to Amnesty International, over 60 percent of these displaced persons have been forced off areas of mineral, agricultural or other economic importance. 
   In fact, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has deemed it the ``greatest hidden humanitarian crisis in the world.'' 
   This problem is particularly severe among Afro-Colombians and the indigenous. I hope that Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and the Bush administration can concentrate on this during the next phase of Plan Colombia. 
   The Colombian government's proposal for the second phase of Plan Colombia--the Strategy for Strengthening Democracy and Social Development--focuses greater attention on socioeconomic aid. However, the President's FY 2008 budget for Colombia did not reflect this change.  
   Therefore, I was particularly pleased that my friend and colleague from the neighboring district to my own Chairwoman Nita Lowey made welcome changes to our foreign assistance to Colombia in the FY 2008 House State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. 
   In particular, I appreciate Chairwoman Lowey's report language that indicates that U.S. foreign assistance to Colombia should be increased for organizations working with internally displaced persons (IDPs) and municipalities and departments with high IDP populations. 
   I was also pleased that funds in the FY 2008 Foreign Ops bill were targeted specifically towards Afro-Colombians who as I noted are among the chief victims in Colombia's civil conflict. 
   I would be remiss not to mention that I have been impressed by the significant progress made by President Uribe in reducing kidnappings, homicides and massacres in his country. No one can deny these results. 
   But I believe that we must now build on this success by working together in improving social conditions in Colombia, chief among them the plight of Colombia's internally displaced.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, academic freedom is one of the bedrocks of a free society. This is known in the United Kingdom, just as it is known in the United States and other democratic nations. 
   Among the nations with an open academic climate is the democratic state of Israel. The views expressed on its campuses span the spectrum from left to right and liberal to conservative. Its students are of all ethnicities, speaking many different languages. But, on May 30, the University and College Union of the United Kingdom voted to urge its membership to consider boycotting Israeli faculty and academic institutions. This deplorable action by men and women of letters runs against the very tenets of free academic exploration. How can people of learning expect to share the studies of the great questions of our time if they are not speaking to one another? 
   Moreover, I fear that the reason behind this extraordinary step is much more dark and ominous. I believe that underlying this attack on Israel's academia is a not-so-well-veiled anti-Semitism. By singling out the conduct of Israel, a democratic and pluralistic country surrounded by a sea of dictatorships, the Union's leadership has taken absurdity and hypocrisy to new heights. 
   The legislation on the floor of the House today voices Congress's extreme disapproval of the Union's short-sighted, bigoted, and offensive action. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 467 and tell the nations of the world that academic societies are no places for closed-minded, hate-filled efforts to stifle free exchange.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for allowing me to speak. 
   My colleagues, I cannot believe some of the rhetoric I am hearing from the Republican side of the aisle. The Republican ploy of combining tax cuts for the rich with the minimum wage increase is just simply mean-spirited and wrong. This bill should be passed cleanly and on its own. It has been close to 9 years since the last increase in the minimum wage, the second longest period without a pay raise since the Federal minimum wage law was first enacted in 1938. 
   While wages have remained stagnant, basic costs of living have skyrocketed. America's current minimum wage is simply not a liveable wage, and families are struggling to make ends meet as their living standards decline. An increase in the minimum wage is desperately needed if we are to lift those who are falling further and further behind. Raising the minimum wage is an issue of fairness, and it is time that we treat all working Americans with the fairness and equality they deserve. 
   I commend the Democratic leadership for including this in the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress. Some 7.3 million people will benefit from a raise in the minimum wage, and we need to do this forthwith. Please vote for the bill.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5. This legislation will help ease the burden of student loans that so many of today's young people face by cutting loan interest rates in half over the next 5 years. 
   As the father of three, I am all too familiar with the challenges of financing a college education. I have one child in law school, one in undergraduate school. It is very, very difficult. I can imagine the vast majority of the American families that don't make what Members of Congress make, how even more difficult it is for them. So a college education becomes out of reach for many families. It is very, very important. 
   We are going to cut student loan interest rates in half by the next 5 years. The vast majority of student loan borrowers are low to middle income students who are burdened with huge amounts of debt upon graduating. In my home State of New York, the average subsidized Stafford loan debt for a 4-year graduate is over $14,000, and a student starting school in 2007 will save $2,360 over the life of his loan; a student who starts school in 2011 will save over $4,500 over the life of this loan. 
   These are real savings put directly into the pockets of people who need it most, and I am proud that Democrats have made it a priority to make college more affordable in this 110th Congress. This is the right first step. I commend the Chairman and I commend the leadership of the Democrats here in the 110th Congress.

   Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease which results in progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles and other organs, notably the heart. There are nine muscular dystrophies affecting over 300,000 individuals in the United States. The most lethal is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects 1 in every 3,500 boys. There is no cure. 
   Prior to 2001, there were few resources directed toward research and development of therapies and care models for those afflicted with muscular dystrophy. To address this issue, the Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2001 was introduced. Congress overwhelmingly supported the legislation. Unfortunately, the authorization for this work expired in 2006. 
   The 2001 law specified a number of provisions for expanding and intensifying research on muscular dystrophy. These efforts included the establishment of six scientific centers of excellence, the creation of a Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee (MDCC) to develop plans for supporting research and education on muscular dystrophy, and an expansion by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into epidemiological activities regarding muscular dystrophy. 
   The reauthorization of the Paul D. Wellstone MD-CARE Amendments officially names the Centers of Excellence the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers. In addition, it ensures that data collection at CDC is updated regularly with a requirement for regular reports to Congress. The bill also requires the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to work with appropriate medical or patient organizations to finalize an initial set of care considerations and for CDC to disseminate that information to targeted audiences. 
   Once again, thank you Mr. Speaker for your commitment to muscular dystrophy. 
   I know this bill will have a profound effect on so many families in America upon enactment.

   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 584, a bill to name the headquarters of the United States Department of Education after President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
   In the entire District of Columbia, with all its Federal buildings, parks and monuments, there is not a single Federal facility named after the man many historians call one of the best Presidents in American history. From his stewardship of legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid, to his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Johnson left a legacy on this Nation that we still enjoy today. 
   In addition to his quest to achieve racial equality in the United States, President Johnson was an avid supporter of education. In 1965 he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law. This landmark bill provided significant federal funding to public schools. Also in 1965, he stewarded the Higher Education Act to passage. Thanks to this legislation, children in poverty for the first time were able to attend college. 
   Madam Speaker, like President Johnson, I was a public school teacher, and I understand the importance of a good education. Let me conclude by quoting President Johnson himself.   
   I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this Nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.   
   Madam Speaker, I can think of no better person after whom we should name the building of the Department of Education. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 584.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this very important issue, as well as Mr. Castle. 
   I am proud to stand here today as an original cosponsor of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enactment Act. 
   We all remember that dark day last July when President Bush cast the first veto of his Presidency on legislation approved overwhelmingly by the House and Senate, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. To veto a bill that has the support of 72 percent of the American people and will do such good is simply unconscionable and indefensible as far as my concerned. 
   Despite what the critics may say, H.R. 3 doesn't end life. It honors life. As anyone who suffers from diabetes, Parkinson's disease, ALS, or a host of other debilitating health conditions knows, scientists believe that embryonic stem cells provide a real opportunity for devising unique treatments for these serious diseases. 
   Now, let me be absolutely clear. This is not about abortion. This is not about cloning. This is about the use of embryonic stem cells which would be discarded anyway, as the gentlewoman has pointed out. It has been estimated that there are currently 400,000 frozen embryos created during fertility treatments which would be destroyed if they are not donated for research. I would never condone the donation of embryos to science without the informed written consent of donors and strict regulations prohibiting financial compensation for potential donors. Our Nation's scientific research must adhere to the highest ethical standards, and H.R. 3 protects this. 
   The National Institutes of Health have admitted that U.S. science has fallen behind Europe and Asia in stem cell research because of President Bush's policy. While the number of States have committed significant funding towards embryonic stem cell research, NIH Director Zerhouni has noted that a patchwork collection of different stem cell policies in States could inhibit critical collaborations. We need a national commitment and a national directive on stem cell research. 
   Over 200 patient groups, universities and scientific societies have urged President Bush to expand the Federal policy on embryonic stem cell research. We must not allow those standing in the way of health and science to compromise the future well-being of our families and loved ones. Simply put, that would not be ethical. We must honor life by passing H.R. 3 today.

   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reauthorization of State Children's Health Insurance is unquestionably one of the most important bills we will pass this year. This bill will protect six million kids currently covered by SCHIP and provide coverage for an additional five million children. 
   This bill provides aggressive outreach to enroll children by simplifying enrollment procedures and awarding States bonuses for finding more children. This is important since two-thirds of the uninsured children in our Nation are actually eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP. 
   What is the response of our Republican friends? Block the bill from coming up in our committee; create phony issues because they're against insuring children. Illegal amnesty? Give me a break. No hearings? We've had seven hearings on this bill. Eligible for private insurance? 93.5 percent of the children we cover in this bill would have no private insurance without this bill. 
   What is the President's response? Under the President's plan, this program would see its funding cut from last year; and, worse, the amount allocated for its reauthorization would be less than half of the amount required to maintain coverage for current beneficiaries. 
   He says he will veto this bill because it covers too many children. This is unconscionable. Sixty-one national advocacy groups devoted to improving children's health request that we fund the SCHIP program at 60 billion additional dollars. The President countered with $4.8 billion. Clearly, there is a disconnect. 
   We are proud that, despite budgetary constraints, we will be able to reauthorize our SCHIP program at $50 billion. I am proud that we will be covering 11 million low-income children under this reauthorization, and I know our Nation will be better off for it. 
   This is an amazing feat. Passing bills like this is why we should all feel honored to be Members of Congress. I'm sorry that my Republican friends just continue to say no. We say yes, yes to 11 million children, yes to saying that our children ought to be insured, yes to saying that America's children need our help. Pass this bill. It is good for all our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1427, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007. This legislation is many years in the making, and its consideration today is timely, given the problems we face in the mortgage industry. 
   In recent years, we have seen serious problems in the subprime mortgage market. Without an effective regulator in the mortgage market, these problems will continue to grow, and we will continue to see more families losing their home to foreclosure. 
   In addition, H.R. 1427 creates an affordable housing fund for low income individuals and families. This fund will receive a percentage of the investments that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hold, totaling approximately $500 million a year. This money will help those with low incomes purchase a new home. 
   The recent problems in the mortgage market have hit those with low incomes harder than any other income bracket. This is exactly the group of people who will be helped most by this bill. And for the first year, the entire reserve fund will be dedicated to those affected by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi. These hurricane stricken areas are in desperate need of assistance, and this bill will provide at least a portion of what they need. 
   Having a strong regulatory body overseeing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks will give consumers and markets confidence that the housing market is safe. When housing lenders started going under due to the increased number of foreclosures, consumers became increasingly reluctant to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into a new home. If people are confident that a strong regulator will be overseeing the GSEs, it will help to increase consumer confidence in the housing market. 
   This bill is specifically good for my District in the Bronx, Rockland County and Westchester County in New York. The price of purchasing a home there is staggering, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are limited in the amount of money they can loan for a new home. This limitation makes it more difficult for people in my District to buy their first home. This legislation will help to fix this problem by increasing the limit on loans. 
   Even though H.R. 1427 will put additional money into low low-income housing assistance, I am proud to say that this bill will not add a single dollar to the national deficit. The majority in this Congress has consistently stuck to the pay-as-you-go rules that we created as one of our first acts of the year. 
   Madam Chairman, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act is eight years in the making, and it is long overdue. I am happy to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Our country values diversity, values individuality, values different cultures and respects people for who they are. Hate crimes are simply un-American. 
   In 2005, there were over 7,000 Federal hate crimes committed in this country, but the current law does not cover most true hate crimes. 
   Late last year in New York, three men lured Michael J. Sandy to a parking lot, beat him and chased him into traffic where he was struck by a car. He died 5 days later, one day after his 29th birthday. Why did these attackers target Michael J. Sandy? Because he was gay. 
   Today, Mr. Sandy's attackers can not be prosecuted under Federal law for two reasons. First, in order to be a Federal hate crime, a victim must be engaged in a federally protected activity such as voting. Second, the current hate crime law does not consider sexual orientation a protected class. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act will sensibly expand the definition of a Federal hate crime to cover all violent crimes motivated by race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability when the defendant causes bodily injury or attempts to cause bodily injury through the use of a firearm or an explosive device. 
   Thankfully, New York law has allowed this case to be prosecuted as a hate crime, but it is time to update our Federal laws to protect our citizens. 
   The bill will also give local law enforcement the help they need in solving and prosecuting these despicable crimes. Some of these cases can strain local resources, but under this legislation, law enforcement can reach out and secure Federal resources to pursue these complex cases. 
   Because the bill makes common sense reforms, the bill has enjoyed wide bipartisan support. In fact, the bill is supported by 31 State Attorneys General and over 280 national law enforcement, professional, education, civil rights, religious, and civic organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (SHIRLEY A. CHISHOLM UNITED STATES-CARIBBEAN EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 176, the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Education Exchange Program. I would like to pay tribute to our colleague, BARBARA LEE, for introducing this excellent legislation and for the work of Chairman LANTOS in moving H.R. 176 forward. 
   Representative LEE and I have traveled to the Caribbean together, and we have seen through our site visits, including to St. George's University in Grenada and an education program at an orphanage in Haiti, the tremendous need for expanded educational cooperation between the United States and the Caribbean. In fact, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada listed cooperation on education as among the most important issues for his country's citizens. 
   As such, H.R. 176 creates an educational exchange program between the United States and CARICOM countries, called the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Program, and provides educational-related assistance for the nations in the CARICOM region. Education is an area in which the United States has a clear advantage--one which we should use to help our neighbors in the Caribbean. 
   As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, it has been a priority of mine to help promote good relations between the United States and CARICOM countries. Just last month, the Presidents and Prime Ministers of 14 Caribbean countries met with members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs as part of the historic Conference on the Caribbean and discussed how we could expand relations. During our meeting, I told the Caribbean leaders that we would pass a U.S.-Caribbean Education Exchange Act soon and hold a hearing on deportees. With today's passage of the Caribbean education legislation and last week's hearing, I am proud to say that we have lived up to our promises. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is aptly named for Shirley Anita Chisholm, a former member of the United States House of Representatives from 1968 to 1983 who had family roots in the Caribbean nation of Barbados. I am glad that we honor her service with this important educational exchange program, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 176.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HIGH LEVEL VISITS BY OFFICIALS OF TAIWAN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 136 which expresses the sense of Congress that restrictions on visits to the United States by high-level elected officials from Taiwan--including the President of Taiwan--should be lifted. And I thank my friend, Mr. CHABOT of Ohio, for introducing this important resolution. 
   Taiwan is without a doubt one of the most important allies of the United States in the Asia Pacific region. Taiwan is a rising economic power and has consistently ranked as one of the top ten U.S. export markets. In 2005, U.S.--Taiwan bilateral trade totaled $57 billion. In addition, our political ties with Taiwan have become ever more important in a world where China is increasing its global reach. 
   I am the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. In Central America and the Caribbean, I have seen China continue to expand its presence while Taiwan becomes increasingly isolated. Given these realities in our own hemisphere, I believe that we must work closely with Taiwan to increase its global visibility and membership in international organizations when it is strategically and politically feasible. 
   Given our strong political and economic relationship, it would seem inconceivable that we would place restrictions on high-level elected officials of Taiwan during their visits to the United States. Taiwan is a key U.S. ally which is trying hard to maintain its international position, and we should give Taiwan our strong support. I commend Mr. CHABOT for introducing this important resolution and hope that Congress can work closely with the Bush Administration to ensure that these restrictions are actually removed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee, I thank my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for allowing me time under his leadership. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I am pleased to see it moving forward after more than a decade of advocacy. 
   While researchers' ability to identify genetic markers for diseases has given hope and promise to millions of people regarding how to make more informed choices about their personal behavior, the promise of this breakthrough is hindered, as many of my colleagues have said, by well-founded fears of how information may be abused in the employment and insurance industries. 
   While many states, including my own home State of New York, have laws which prohibit discrimination in health insurance, and by employers based on genetic testing and information, it is clear that the laws are not fully comprehensive and that Federal action is necessary, certainly to make it more uniform across all 50 States.     
   Fear should not be a deterrent to knowledge. Disregarding available tests for fear of discrimination prevents citizens from making smarter, personalized choices about their own well-being. We know too much to subscribe to one-size-fits-all medicine. And once again, it should be our physicians, not our insurance companies, who influence our health care decisions. 
   This is a wonderful bill, very much overdue for enactment, years and years and years in the process. It's supported by hundreds of patient advocate groups, and will make a true impact on the health care of our Nation. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, we had the honor of listening to King Abdullah of Jordan and his speech before. I must be candid and say that I was somewhat disappointed in some of the things that he mentioned. 
   When he talked about the plan in Riyadh for two states living side by side, we all, of course, hope for that, but the plan in Riyadh forces Israel to go back to the 1967 borders, which are indefensible and is really a nonstarter. 
   If the Palestinians really want peace in the region, then they know what they have to do. They need to do three things, and the Hamas government needs to do three things. They need to recognize the right of Israel to exist, they need to abide by all previous agreements signed by the Palestinians, and they need to renounce terror and violence. 
   I would have liked the King to have said that. I think that would have been most hopeful, but it is important that all of us that want peace in the Middle East work to the ultimate solution, which is two states in peace, living side by side, an Arab Palestinian state and Jewish Israeli state, and it can only happen if the Arabs recognize Israel's right to exist.

   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5264 which extends trade preferences for Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia. I want to thank Chairman Levin and Chairman Rangel, the dean of our New York delegation, for their leadership on this issue. This is certainly a bipartisan issue, and it is a very, very important issue. 
   I am the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And as chairman of that subcommittee, I believe that the extension of the Andean Trade Preferences is crucial in promoting the development of the economically and politically fragile Andean region while at the same time supporting the United States' geopolitical goals. 
   ATPDEA has been enormously successful, as all my colleagues have stated, having created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Andean region. Every job created in the Andean region, as was mentioned before, is another potential illegal immigrant remaining in their home country. Without the extension of ATPDEA, these jobs, which are in sectors that do not directly compete with U.S. jobs, will be eliminated. 
   I just returned a few short days ago from leading a bipartisan congressional delegation which included Ecuador and Bolivia. In fact, Madam Speaker, at this time I will submit into the Record a letter that the five of us who were on the trip sent around to the rest of our colleagues supporting the extension of the Andean Trade Preferences, signed by myself, Mr. Weller, Mr. Hinchey, Mr. Green, and Ms. Foxx.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (KOSOVA -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise because I listened intently to the remarks just made by my friend from Texas, and I want to say that as someone who has supported the independence of Kosova for the past 20 years, I couldn't disagree more. 
   I am proud of the United States for supporting and encouraging the independence of Kosova. I am proud of the Bush administration for doing the right thing in Kosova. I am proud of the United States standing on the side of freedom and self-determination and independence, and I am proud that the United States understands that the people of Kosova are entitled to the same kinds of freedoms that we had for ourselves in our own revolution more than 200 years ago. 
   No, I don't think that every independence or separatist movement in the world is entitled to declare independence, but I think that we need to look at everything in terms of its context. 
   The former Yugoslavia broke up. There were several components of the former Yugoslavia. We now have several independent countries of Macedonia and Croatia and Slovenia and many others, Montenegro, and Kosova, also, as part of the former Yugoslavia is entitled to that same kind of independence and self-determination. 
   We remember where the former leader of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, had set out to ethnically cleanse his country of Albanians, to commit genocide against the Albanians in Kosova to drive them out, to indeed burn practically every Albanian home in Kosova when they were driven out. It was only because of the courage at that time of President Clinton and the United States where we helped and bombed and prevented genocide that that was prevented. 
   So I think the situation in the former Yugoslavia, in Kosova, is unique. I think that Serbia relinquished any kind of claim to Kosova by the way their former leader Milosevic persecuted and committed genocide against the Albanian population. 
   Self-determination for the people of Kosova is the right thing to do. The United States and the European Union have stood strong in supporting Kosova independence. Kosova, indeed, will be a strong ally of the West, of the United States, of the European Union. 
   The people of Kosova love the United States. They trust us. They care about us. They know we are there for them. I want to tell you, as someone who has been so involved with this issue for the past 20 years, there are no better friends that we have across the world, the United States has, than the people of Kosova. 
   So I am very, very proud that that is a new nation. I am very proud that the United States has recognized them. I, indeed, would urge all freedom-loving countries of the world to recognize the people of Kosova. 
   We in this wonderful democracy are so blessed and so fortunate to live in the United States, and we have principles for which we stand, and those are the same principles that the people of Kosova are standing for and looking at us to follow exactly what we have done in terms of democracy. I hope to go to Kosova in the very, very near future to celebrate with the people there. 
   I want to say one other thing. Kosova will be a multiethnic state, and that means that minority rights have to be protected in Kosova. There are some who are concerned about Serbian Orthodox churches and that minority rights, including Serbs, need to be protected. I agree. Those churches need to be protected. Minority rights need to be protected. I am confident that the leaders of Kosova will protect those churches, will protect those rights, will protect the rights of all Kosovars, whether they be Albanian, Serb or others, and the people understand that. I know the people of Kosova, and I know they understand that. 
   I just want to very, very strongly state that I am proud to be a friend of the people of Kosova. This Congress has been a friend of the people of Kosova. Our government has been a friend of the people of Kosova, and I think we as Americans can hold our heads up high and say that the ideals for which our revolution was fought more than 200 years ago are the same ideals of the revolution for the new independence and new nation of Kosova.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act. With the alarming increase of no-bid contracts and cost-plus contracts under this administration, I am very gratified to see the Democratic majority bring this bill up for a vote so that we can put an end to these scurrilous practices. 
   The United States government has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years to contractors that did not even have to submit a bid for the work it wanted to conduct. So much for good old fashioned American competition! In addition, there have been very few penalties for the contractors when this work went far over budget and Federal dollars were misused such as in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort. American taxpayers have had to pick up the tab for these cost overruns, and they have been on the hook for millions and millions of dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, in this week devoted to oversight legislation, this is a necessary bill to protect the taxpayers of this Nation from paying too much for too little work. This bill will reduce the number of no-bid contracts and strictly control cost overruns. Further, new rules will be promulgated for disclosing contractor overcharges. 
   The Accountability in Contracting Act is long overdue, and I thank the Speaker, the Majority Leader, and Chairman Waxman for bringing this bill up for a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address H.R. 4351, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, the original idea behind the alternative minimum tax, AMT, was to prevent  people with very high incomes from using special tax benefits to pay little or no income tax. The AMT's reach, however, has expanded beyond just the wealthy to threaten millions in the middle class. And when the AMT applies, its costs are often substantial. 
   One reason for the AMT's expansion is that, unlike the regular income tax system, the AMT is not indexed for inflation. Another reason is that individual income tax cuts enacted since 2001 have provided higher credits and deductions and lowered tax rates, thereby leading to more taxpayers owing tax under the AMT. 
   Last year, 4.2 million Americans were affected by the AMT. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that, if Congress does not act, 23 million taxpayers will be affected this year. That will include over 54,000 families in my district--many of whom do not have very high income, and do not receive many special tax benefits. We need to protect these Americans from the AMT. 
   Further, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office, the percentage of New York City taxpayers currently hit by the AMT far exceeds the comparable national estimate: 6.7 percent versus 4.0 percent. 
   The bill before us today provides a much needed 1-year patch for the AMT. It is a necessary step in the right direction on this issue; and we completely pay for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4351.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (SUPPORT FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOSOVO -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to once again express my support for the independence of Kosovo, which is a nation in the Balkans, 90 percent ethnic Albanian country that has struggled a great deal and is now on the verge of independence. 
   I would like to put a little history in perspective. The former Yugoslavia has broken up, and much of the components of the former Yugoslavia have become independent nations. I have long argued that so, too, the people of Kosovo deserve to be an independent country. 
   There have recently been negotiations in which the United States and Russia and the European Union, called the Troika, have taken part, negotiations between Serbia and the Kosovar Albanians. And just 2 days ago, on December 10, after 120 days of negotiations, it has been found that no agreement could be reached. So now the question remains that, since no agreement was reached, what should happen? 
   I say that Kosovo should very soon declare its independence, and that the United States and the European Union and other freedom-loving countries should recognize the new nation of Kosovo. There is a plan called the Atasari plan which was put together by the Scandinavian diplomat that has been blocked in the United Nations because of Russian threats and intransigence. The Atasari plan, which grants supervised independence to Kosovo, should be immediately implemented. 
   And when the people of Kosovo declare their independence, that Attasari plan should be implemented again with the European Union and the United States recognizing the newly formed nation. 
   This should come soon after the first of the year, perhaps a few weeks or months into the new year, and I intend to be in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, when independence is finally declared and accepted. 
   I rise because I think that the United States plays a very vital role and does play and has played a very vital role, and the people of Kosovo trust the United States to be there and be their friends. I want to say to the people of Kosovo that the United States has always been your friend and will continue to be your friend. 
   The long and troubled history of the Balkans we all know; wars started there, world wars started there, and I think perhaps a little history to where we got to where we are now. 
   In 1999, basically every Kosovar Albanian, 2 million were driven out by the then-dictator of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, and the United States came to the rescue and bombed and helped prevent ethnic cleansing in the area. So when the Kosovar Albanians came back, they found that virtually every one of their homes were burned, some to the ground and beyond recognition. 
   The country has been building itself up since then, but only independence can get the country on the right track. Since that time, the United Nations and the UNMIK forces of the United Nations have been governing Kosovo sort of as an international governance. But the time for that is over. The people of Kosovo need to know that there is a future and they need to know that they, like other peoples in the world, can lead their own nation to freedom and democracy. 
   So, again, I rise here to once again offer my support for the people of Kosovo, for the independence of Kosovo, to tell them that the United States will stand behind them, and I hope that shortly after the first of the year again the U.S. will be among the first countries to recognize the new independent nation of Kosovo. They are going to need our help and we will continue to give it to them.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, six years have passed since America lost our innocence and terrorism struck at the root of our Nation's soil. I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 643, which recognizes September 11 as a day of remembrance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a New Yorker, born and bred. I love our city. I was in New York when this tragedy occurred. I would often say to my children when we were in New York, look at the skyline, look at the World Trade Center. It was so invigorating. It makes me feel so wonderful just to be in this city, the city I love, the city in which I was born. 
   We New Yorkers are a tough breed; but I have to tell my colleagues, six years ago when I drove over the George Washington Bridge to return to Washington and I took a look at the Manhattan skyline and saw the Twin Towers were not there, in its place I saw only smoke and fire and it deeply affected me. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I think of the victims, the men, women and children who lost their lives; the firemen, the policemen who went there to save people's lives, and lost their lives, I am saddened. People who went to work, like millions of people across our great country go to work to earn a living to support their families, they went to work and so many were killed by terrorists for simply going about their daily lives. Some of these were my constituents and their families continue to mourn this great loss. 
   Six years later we have far more to do. The terrorist ringleader, Osama bin Laden remains on the lam. We also know many of those brave individuals who sought to rescue and then recover the victims of this tragedy, are now becoming ill due to exposure to environmental toxins at Ground Zero. Today these brave volunteers, area residents and students still lack a comprehensive federal plan to provide treatment and monitoring of their ailments. This is unconscionable. 
   I am proud to join with my NY Colleagues this week to introduce the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill would ensure that everyone exposed to the Ground Zero toxins has a right to be medically monitored and all that are sick have a right to treatment. It would also rightfully provide compensation for loss by reopening the 9/11 Compensation Fund. 
   Today, I feel sorrow in our remembrance of the tragedy of 9/11. We will never forget what happened that day. But we must look forward and right the wrongs our nation has perpetuated against our own heroes and provide them with the care and compensation they so desperately deserve. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans to pause and reflect on the tremendous loss of life that day, and how so many sacrificed so much for their fellow Americans.

   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for yielding to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish to thank you for bringing up the ALS Registry Act of 2007 for a vote, H.R. 2295. This is truly a bipartisan measure, as well it should be. I introduced this bill with my colleague, Lee Terry of Nebraska, and we are proud to have the support of over 275 bipartisan members of Congress. 
   I know that the gentlewoman from Wisconsin who sat next to me on the committee was very concerned about this bill. I am glad that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) is here, as well, because I have a picture here of Lou Gehrig who, of course, puts a face on this disease. ALS is very often known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and we all remember the Yankee Clipper, Lou Gehrig. Mr. Fossella and I, both coming from New York, we know Lou Gehrig and his tradition very, very well. 
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is very similar to multiple sclerosis. While the great baseball player, Lou Gehrig, put a national face on ALS over 65 years ago, my own family was devastated by the death of my grandmother, Dora Engel, my father's mother, who is believed to have passed away as a result of ALS when she was about 58 years old. 
   Unfortunately, families across the Nation face challenges and experience the suffering associated with ALS every single day. As was mentioned before, 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time. The average life expectancy for a person who is diagnosed with ALS is only 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. 
   As was mentioned, the causes of ALS are not well understood and there is no known cure. We need to provide hope to change this tragedy today. 
   Surprisingly, a single national patient registry which collects and stores information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS does not currently exist in the United States today. The legislation I introduced with my colleague (Mr. Terry) would create an ALS registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and aid in the search for a cure from this devastating disease. The registry would collect key data, and information is determined by a newly created Federal Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry. 
   The ALS Registry Act will also build upon a fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007 congressional appropriation which directed the CDC to evaluate the science to guide the creation of a National ALS Registry. 
   I wish to express my gratitude to the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in particular to the ALS Association, who worked for months with me and my staff to improve the bill that we had introduced in the previous 109th Congress. I also want to thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, House Subcommittee Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Deal for their support of the ALS Registry Act. Finally, I especially want to thank John Ford and William Garner of Chairman Dingell's staff and Katherine Martin of Ranking Member Barton's staff for shepherding this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I want to thank Emily Gibbons of my own staff, my legislative director, who was also my health expert and really did more for this than anybody else I know. 
   The establishment of a registry will bring new hope to thousands of patients and their families that ALS will no longer be a death sentence. I thank my colleagues, and Madam Speaker, I urge the swift passage of the ALS Registry Act, H.R. 2295, today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RECOGNIZING ANNIVERSARIES OF MASS MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend from Missouri, and I rise in strong support of H. Res. 759, which recognizes the 40th Anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th Anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the Mall in Washington, D.C. 
   The gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) is so right when she says that these rallies inspired the cause of human rights all over the world. And as we fight for human rights all over the world, we must continue to fight for human rights wherever bad things raise their ugly heads.     
   For decades, Jews in the Soviet Union faced serious restrictions on their right to practice their faith. In response, a campaign developed in the United States and around the world to pressure the Soviets to end the abuses and permit their Jewish population to emigrate. In 1964, the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry was founded to spearhead a national campaign on behalf of Soviet Jewry. Israel's victory in the 1967 6-Day War inspired Soviet Jews to intensify their efforts to win the right to emigrate to Israel and other places, but the Soviets followed with an anti-Zionist propaganda campaign in the state-controlled mass media and a crackdown on Jewish autonomy. 
   A key event in the campaign to free the Soviet Jews occurred in 1982 when President Reagan enacted Public Law 97-157, expressing the sense of the Congress that the Soviet Union should cease its repressive actions against those individuals who seek the freedom to emigrate or to practice their religious or cultural traditions. This law drew special attention to the hardships and discrimination imposed upon the Jewish community in the Soviet Union. 
   After so many years of captivity, the Supreme Soviet passed a law in 1991 that codified the right of every Soviet citizen to emigrate, precipitating massive emigration by Jews from the Soviet Union, primarily to Israel and the United States. The hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Soviet Union and former Soviet republics have greatly enriched their new-found homes in areas as diverse as business, science, the arts, politics, and philanthropy. 
   As Ms. Berkley mentioned, I was proud to be part of the effort to liberate the Jews of the Soviet Union and remember the historic Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jews in Washington, DC 20 years ago before I was a Member of Congress. I remember meeting Natan, then Anatoly Sharansky, at the gathering of approximately 250,000 people prior to the start of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. This event helped increase the awareness of the plight of Soviet Jews throughout the world. Earlier, I demonstrated in front of the Soviet mission to the U.N. in New York in an effort to demonstrate how deeply I felt about religious freedom and the right of the Jews of the Soviet Union to emigrate. 
   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 759 and remember the campaign to liberate the Jews of the former Soviet Union. And, again, may we have many, many more resolutions like this to help all oppressed people all over the world.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 385, which condemns the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994. 
   I led an official congressional delegation to Buenos Aires in February and visited the leaders of the Argentine Jewish community. I saw the site of the devastating July 18, 1994, bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association. I will never forget the sadness I felt laying a wreath of flowers on the memorial to the 85 victims of the terrorist attack and will always keep in the forefront of my mind the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of that horrible crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, overwhelming evidence links the attacks to the government of Iran, and the execution of the bombings to Hezbollah, a terrorist organization based in Lebanon. The state prosecutor of Argentina announced this conclusion on October 25, 2006, stating that the AMIA bombing was ``decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former government of Iran, whom, at the same time, entrusted its execution to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah.'' He specifically alleged that the attack was approved by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former leader of Iran and the current chairman of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Iran's Expediency Council. 
   On November 9, 2006, an Argentine judge issued an arrest warrant for Rafsanjani and others for their involvement in the AMIA bombing. One year later, the General Assembly of INTERPOL issued six Red Notices, circulating the Argentine warrants in an effort to extradite the indicted Iranians. 
   One of the perpetrators of the AMIA bombing was Hezbollah operative Imad Moughnieh. Moughnieh was not only responsible for the act of terror in Buenos Aires, he also carried out the dastardly attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983. This brutal terrorist was reportedly killed in Syria on February 12, 2008. While I do not know who carried out the attack on Moughnieh, it seems that justice has been done. 
   It is unconscionable that the entire leadership of the government of Iran was involved with the terror campaign in Argentina. We must not let the world's lead sponsor of international terror continue to get away with its criminal deeds. 
   I stand with the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, and the government of Argentina, which has stepped up the pace of the AMIA investigation. The United States must continue to work with Argentina and provide any help it needs as it seeks to bring the terrorists to justice. 
   I stand with the peace-loving Jewish community of Argentina which, despite the horror which befell them 14 years ago, remains vital and strong. Their survival is a testament to the human spirit which will not succumb to the reprehensible designs of an evil few. 
   And I stand with the freedom-loving peoples around the world who know the horrors of terrorism and will not rest until the perpetrators have been apprehended and convicted in a court of law. 
   Again, I strongly support H. Con. Res. 385, a resolution of which I am a cosponsor, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Con. Res. 322 and to offer my warmest congratulations on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. 
   On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel. Since this proud and historic day, Israel has proven itself to be a vibrant democracy and a true friend of freedom. Throughout, the United States and Israel have had a special friendship; an unbreakable bond between nations whose relationship is much deeper than mere allies of convenience. 
   During its six decades of existence, the Israeli people have faced the most grave threats from hostile neighbors and have bravely defended themselves against repeated terrorist and military attacks. Yet, despite the years of war, terrorism, and diplomatic and economic isolation by enemies far and near, the Israeli people have never turned away from their vibrant, pluralistic democracy that guarantees freedom of speech, association and religion. 
   Indeed, the modern State of Israel has built a new and dynamic democratic society and created a thriving economic, political, cultural and intellectual life. It is a nation of immigrants, as is the United States, which has benefited from the diversity of its population. 
   Throughout my career in Congress, I have consistently made a strong and close relationship between the United States and Israel among my highest priorities. As the only true democracy in the Middle East and our closest ally in the region, I firmly believe that we must support Israel as it faces the many serious threats to its very existence. We must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel when it is under attack and support its right of self-defense even when the rest of the world turns away. 
   As we approach the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding, I am reminded not only of the close strategic ties between our countries, but of how much our two nations have in common. Through Democratic and Republican Administrations, alike, the bonds between us have only grown stronger. As Israel enters its seventh decade, let us resolve ourselves to make security and prosperity of the State of Israel a key priority here in the House of Representatives while we continue to promote a warm and unshakable friendship between the U.S. and Israel. 
   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 322 and offer my warmest congratulations to the Israeli people on the 60th anniversary of their independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. This bill calls for necessary funding and emergency  planning to protect the American rail system and other critical points of our Nation's infrastructure. 
   I support H.R. 1401 because I have seen the chaos that can ensue when a disaster occurs. I was in New York City on 9/11, and I saw firsthand what can happen when we are improperly prepared for a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The entire world saw in New Orleans that without planning and foresight, the aftermath a disaster can be even worse than the disaster itself. This bill will require a national plan to prepare for rail and public transportation emergencies. 
   This bill will also provide grant funding dedicated to rail and public transportation security. Included in these grants will be $100 million over the next 4 years to improve security in six New York City tunnels. Anybody who has traveled through these tunnels, as much as I have, will know this funding is critical. 
   In addition to providing direct funding for emergency prevention, this bill will require training programs to teach employees of public transportation systems how to prevent and prepare for a terrorist attack, and how to respond to such an attack. And it will go further, by establishing programs which will test how well the transportation systems have prepared for such an attack. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1401 is a wide ranging bill that touches on a number of critical infrastructure points in the United States. For example, currently our Nation has only 100 surface transportation inspectors. This bill will increase that number to 600 over the next 3 years. 
   In addition to providing grants for localities to secure their infrastructure, this bill will help prevent attacks that we haven't even thought of yet. $200 million in this bill will go towards research and development that is intended to plan for and prevent terrorist attacks. 
   Mr. Chairman, millions of Americans from coast to coast rely upon public transportation every day. Our people deserve as much safety as we can provide for them. We cannot predict when a terrorist attack or natural disaster will occur, and we cannot always prevent these from happening. However, we have also seen that the better prepared we are, and the more we have planned, the better we can address these problems. H.R. 1401 will go a long way towards helping us minimize the impact of a terrible disaster. I strongly support it and urge my colleagues to offer their support as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the last Congress refused to do so, and I am glad we are doing it now. 
   As a New Yorker, I understand the serious concerns about homeland security, and I have long argued in favor of a formula funding based on risk. In the 109th Congress, Mr. Fossella and I introduced the Responsible Bioterrorism Funding Act of 2006, which directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a funding formula based on risk. Unfortunately, again the Republican Congress did not pass our bill. So in 2006, as a result, New York's homeland security funding was cut by 40 percent. Thus, per capita in New York we received $3 per resident while other States received as much as $60 or more. 
   No State has a higher risk of terrorist attack than New York, so the new funding formulas proposed in this bill will allocate funding based on risk rather than an across-the-board funding level as established in the PATRIOT Act. This is very, very important and this bill strikes the balance between allocating most of the funding based on risk while ensuring that each State has the proper funding to reach a level of preparedness. 
   I also stand in strong support of title II of this bill, which establishes a communications interoperability grant program. I have worked on this as well. I believe this is a good part of this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (FAA AIRSPACE REDESIGN -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Aviation Administration has come up with a proposal to redesign the airspace around New York, New Jersey and the Pennsylvania area. Despite all the opposition and all the concerns of the people affected, lo and behold, the FAA made no significant changes in their final proposal. Full steam ahead, business as usual, the public be damned. 
   So I stand today in strong opposition to the FAA proposal to redesign the airspace around New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia. Specifically, I am disturbed by their actions surrounding the proposal to route up to 600 airplanes a day over Rockland and West Chester Counties in New York, which I represent. 
   The FAA created that proposal with zero input from the people whose lives would be most harmed by this proposal. In fact, even when I brought this up to the FAA in a meeting in my office, it took over a week of urging before they would even agree to attend a public forum that I held in Rockland. 
   They also conducted this entire process over the course of several years without any kind of adequate notification. My constituents expected better and they deserved better. 
   Throughout this process, we have seen, time and time again, that the FAA would ignore the opinions and suggestions of myself and anyone else who would be affected by their proposal. Valid suggestions that would improve this proposal were written off without serious consideration. 
   The FAA is trying to push through a proposal that doesn't make sense, and they are refusing to accept any changes. 
   But the plan itself is not my only problem. The misleading tactics and the stonewalling by the FAA only add to this issue. Every effort I and my constituents and some of my colleagues have made has been met with bureaucratic resistance while, at the same time, the FAA has laid down strict deadlines for comments and changes.  
   Just as an example, I tried multiple times to get an answer for how loud it would be when an airplane flies over us. This is critical information since overflights will be happening up to 600 times a day. All the FAA would tell me were 24-hour noise averages, which tell me nothing. Noise averages mean nothing to us. A room could be silent for 23 hours and have a 140-decibel rock concert for an hour, and the noise average would be something around a whisper. This is just one example of the FAA providing incomplete or misleading information. 
   In addition, every document the FAA has sent to my office, from the original proposal to the record of decision, has been extremely complicated and vague. I've been living in New York my entire life, and I was unable to interpret the maps of where the planes would be flying over my district. If my staff and I, who are knowledgeable about the region, are unable to decipher the maps, how is the general public supposed to know where the airplanes will be flying over their homes? The answer is that they will not, and that's just what the FAA wants. 
   It would be easy for the FAA to publish good maps of the area. They could use maps that are labeled with names of cities, streets and bodies of water. They could draw lines of these maps signaling precisely where the planes would be flying and at what altitude, but they chose not to do so. They chose instead to provide strangely colored maps with very few labels, so it was nearly impossible to figure out where the planes would be routed. It is this type of complex and misleading information that makes me and my constituents distrust the FAA. 
   And finally, let me say the agency has deliberately manipulated information that it is giving out to be public. For example, my office sent in over 25 pages of comments from over 60 constituents. We also sent in a petition signed by nearly 100 local residents, and finally, we sent 237 pages of a transcript from a public town hall meeting I held in Rockland, which was attended by well over 1,000 people. Dozens of people spoke, not one of whom supported the plan. But the spokesperson for the FAA was quoted in the newspaper claiming they had only received five comments from affected people. Five. This is dishonest. This is unacceptable from an agency that is supposed to represent all of the people in the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill came to the House for a vote, I strongly supported an amendment to eliminate funding for this airspace redesign proposal. I did this, not only to express my dislike for the proposal, but also to send a message to the FAA that they cannot treat Americans this way. And I will continue fighting this. 
   And finally, let me say to my colleagues, this may only right now concern the northeast corridor, but if the FAA can get away with running roughshod over Members of Congress, over constituents, over Americans, they can do it in any region of the country. We need to fight this. This is wrong. If it can happen in the northeast, it will happen all over America. We must fight this plan, and I will continue to fight it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding to me. 
   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of H.R. 1830, which extends trade preferences for Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Ecuador. I want to thank Chairman Rangel, the dean of the New York delegation, and Chairman Levin for their leadership on this issue. 
   I am the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and as chairman, I believe that the extension of the Andean trade preferences is crucial in promoting development in the economically and politically fragile Andean region while also supporting essential U.S. geopolitical goals. My ranking member, Mr. Burton, just spoke and gave very good reasons why this should be supported. I agree with every one of them. 
   With anti-Americanism on the rise in the Western Hemisphere, I believe that positive engagement with the Andean region can both improve our image abroad and help us to more effectively engage our neighbors. Many of our neighbors in the hemisphere feel a huge sense of neglect from the United States. The extension of the Andean preferences is a great way to show our neighbors that we are engaged and do indeed care. 
   I believe that the preference program has been enormously successful, having created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Andean region. Every job created in the Andean region is another potential illegal immigrant remaining in their home country. Without the extension of these preferences, these jobs, which are in sectors that do not directly compete with U.S. jobs, will be eliminated. 
   I am also in possession of a letter from the AFL-CIO which gives its approval of these agreements. 
   Moreover, I feel that without the extension of ATPA, many of the unemployed in the Andean region would turn to drug cultivation after they lose their jobs. The Andean preference program was originally created not only to support economic development in the region but also to divert illegal coca manufacturing toward legitimate industries. Using these trade preferences as a tool in the drug war is still very important today. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by mentioning that President Bush recently traveled to five countries in the Americas in an effort to reinvigorate our partnership with our friends in the region. Prior to his trip, President Bush said that ``The working poor of Latin America need change, and the United States of America is committed to that change.'' I believe that the extension of ATPA can help bring this well-needed change to our friends in the Andean region. 
   I want to emphasize that in my travels in the region, the region feels that the United States is looking elsewhere and is not engaged. The worst thing we could do would be not to pass this because it would prove their fears. We need to pass this. We need to do it quickly, and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1254, a resolution I authored which commends the United States and Brazil for signing the Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality. And, I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Howard Berman for his leadership on this issue. 
   The Joint Action Plan is an important step forward in global efforts to combat the evils of racism and to stand together, as the two largest democracies in the Western Hemisphere, to promote equality for all people. 
   The United States and Brazil share a history of slavery in the Americas. The legacy and residual effects of that common history remain with both the United States and Brazil long after emancipation. Although the experience of race and the phenomenon of racism have been treated and understood differently in Brazil and the United States, today our paths converge. The ways in which our racial histories have diverged, and more recently the ways in which they have converged, offer a great learning opportunity for both countries. 
   Brazil and the United States are the two largest countries in the Western Hemisphere and have the largest Afro-descendant populations--populations which often face the most  difficult economic and social barriers. Therefore, it is highly significant that our countries are now working together. The United States and Brazil have much in common, and our large vibrant minority communities are simply another trait we share. As Chairman of the Brazil Caucus, I believe that working together to stamp out discrimination only helps to bring our countries and peoples closer together, while each nation learns from the other's success stories in fighting ethnic discrimination. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of this important resolution. Our Congress can and should play a vital role in ensuring the success of the Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality. Our partnership on the Joint Action Plan is a positive step in strengthening our friendship and promoting racial and ethnic equality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6028. And I would like to commend Chairman Berman for his leadership on this important legislation that authorizes full funding for the Merida Initiative. 
   In my subcommittee, as Chair, we held three hearings on the Merida Initiative, so we've covered it really quite extensively. And I'm more convinced than ever that this is such an important bill and such an important proposal. 
   Recent events in Mexico make the Merida Initiative more crucial than ever. Just last month, the chief of the Mexican federal police was brutally murdered at his home. Shortly thereafter, the deputy police chief of Ciudad Juarez, a city smack on the border with the United States, was shot dead. 
   The narcoviolence in Mexico is not only undermining the safety and security of our friends to the south, but it is fueling the drug trade and violence here in the United States. 
   As Western Hemisphere Subcommittee chairman, I worked with Chairman Berman in developing this legislation and was pleased to contribute two key parts. First, the Central American piece of this legislation authorizes a much greater amount of assistance for the subregion than the Bush administration proposed. The initial $50 million for Central America was really a drop in the bucket when you look at the whole thing and the needs that are necessary, especially considering that 90 percent of the cocaine shipped from the Andes to the U.S. flows right through Central America. 
   H.R. 6028 sets aside at least $15 million per year for youth gang prevention programs. That was something that I care very much about as well. With approximately 70,000 gang members in Central America, and the transnational connections linking gang members there to the United States, this is a vast improvement over the administration's proposal. I hope we have learned by now that failing to adequately invest in prevention programs will only hurt us in the future. 
   I was also pleased to work with the chairman on a provision in H.R. 6028 which establishes a Merida coordinator at the State Department. My staff and I have too often been frustrated by the inability to obtain information on Merida activities or to figure out who was responsible for what, and what would fall under Merida. The Merida coordinator will keep track of all U.S. government assistance, which fulfills the goals of the Merida Initiative. 
   Madam Speaker, the Merida Initiative is moving on two legislative tracks; this authorization bill, and the supplemental appropriations bill. I understand that the Mexican Government has expressed concerns with certain language in the Senate supplemental proposal. It is my hope that the final product will include important human rights provisions while respecting Mexican sovereignty and the spirit of partnership in which the Merida Initiative was designed. Our relationship with our neighbors to the south is very important, and we need to work with them in a collaborative way and in a partnership. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for your leadership on this important legislation and your commitment to the governments and people of Central America and Mexico. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation. And I want to again say that it's important not only to have funds in there and language in there for Mexico, but for Central America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic as well. 
   It's also important that we look at the whole situation of guns. Guns that are manufactured in the United States are smuggled over the border, and 90 percent of the guns that are collected come from the United States. And they fuel narcotrafficking, they fuel violence, they fuel the drug trade, and we need to do something about that. So I am pleased that my provision, the Southwest Border Violence Reduction Act, was incorporated into this language to look at this problem, to deal with this problem, and understanding that what we do in the United States goes hand in hand with what happens south of our border as well. 
   So again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I thank the ranking member, with whom I've collaborated on so many things through the years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I rise to condemn the fact that former President Jimmy Carter on Friday is going to Damascus to meet with the senior Hamas leader. This is really a disgrace, and, frankly, I think that Jimmy Carter embarrasses himself by doing so. 
   Hamas is a terrorist organization. It is designated a terrorist organization by both the United States and the European Union. Hamas has been responsible for the murders of 26 Americans, and I would like to read the names and I would like to submit into the Record this list of the 26 Americans that have been murdered by Hamas: 
   Yitzhak Weinstock of California, Nachshon Wachsman of New York, Sara Duker of New Jersey, Matthew Eisenfeld of Connecticut, Ira Weinstein of New York, David Boim of New York, Yael Botwin of California, Leah Stern of New Jersey, Malka Roth of New York, Judith Greenbaum of New Jersey, Marla Bennett of California, Benjamin Blutstein of Pennsylvania, Dina Carter of North Carolina, Janice Ruth Coulter of Massachusetts, David Gritz of Massachusetts, Rabbi Eli Horowitz of Illinois, Dina Horowitz of Florida, Alan Beer of Ohio, Tzvi Goldstein of New York, Goldie Taubenfeld of New York, Shmuel Taubenfeld of New York, Tehilla Nathanson of New York, Yitzhak Reinitz of New York, Mordechai Reinitz of New York, David Applebaum of Ohio, and Nava Applebaum of Ohio. 
   Twenty-six American citizens killed by Hamas, and yet Jimmy Carter would shake the hand of the leading Hamas terrorist with blood on his hands. Shame on Jimmy Carter. 
   Today Jimmy Carter was in the West Bank and met with another Hamas leader and laid a wreath at the grave of Yasser Arafat. Isn't that really something? 
   Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist, does not renounce violence and terrorism, and refuses to abide by all previous agreements signed by previous Palestinian Governments. And yet Jimmy Carter would shake the hands of murderers and terrorists with blood dripping from their hands. It's no wonder that the Daily Star in Lebanon has an article today saying ``Jimmy Carter, a Fool on a Fool's Errand.'' It's surely disgraceful. This is a new low. 
   Jimmy Carter wrote a book, ``Palestine: Peace not Apartheid,'' and fabricated portions in that book. I spoke with the former leader of the Carter Center, who said he was with Jimmy Carter on a number of these meetings and the accounts that Jimmy Carter wrote in his book were absolutely incorrect and falsified because he was in the meetings with Jimmy Carter and took notes. 
   So I just want to say that I think all freedom-loving people ought to condemn any kind of meetings with terrorists. To meet with terrorists only encourages them to do more terrorism so that they can be players. It's truly a sad day when a former President of the United States will shake hands and greet the leading terrorist, the leader of the leading terrorist organization, Hamas, a man who was responsible for the deaths of 26 Americans, countless more, with blood dripping from his hands. It is truly a shame. I believe that we should all condemn it.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' 
   As a senior member of the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have worked hard throughout my career in Congress to pass commonsense healthcare measures. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on the underlying legislation. H.R. 6331 prevents the pending 10 percent payment reduction for physicians in Medicare, enhances Medicare preventive and mental health benefits, and improves and extends programs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Our physicians are the backbone of our communities and we must guarantee that they are fairly compensated for the good work they do. By eliminating the physician payment reduction and through the other measures included in H.R. 6331, we can ensure our patients' continued access to quality care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply trouble by some of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle. It is absolutely disgraceful that the Republican leadership has been urging a ``no'' vote in part because we are strengthening the Medicare program in this bill. There have been comments from the Republican side opposing the expansion of the Medicare Savings Program, MSP, in this bill--a program specifically designed to provide a extra assistance to low-income seniors who desperately need it. Republicans also oppose he expansion of Medicare's coverage of preventive services in this bill. We all know that improving access to quality health care, such as by providing preventive services will save millions of Medicare dollars down the line. It is backwards thinking to simply wait till seniors' healthcare erodes beyond repair before we take action. 
   Democrats will stand by our Medicare beneficiaries and doctors and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6331 today. Republicans should do the same. Anything different is simply unconscionable.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not in opposition to this legislation, but simply to talk for a moment about the problems of the FAA. 
   Early last year, we were informed by the FAA of their plan to implement a redesign of the airspace in the northeast, which would negatively affect Rockland County, which I represent. I wanted to know more about the redesign, so I investigated the maps and other materials on their website, and my staff did the necessary research. 
   After looking at the information, I could not determine how many more planes would be flying over my District if the FAA changed the airspace to their preferred alternative. The maps were extremely vague, with no landmarks or cities identified. 
   Only through persistent inquiries to the FAA, most of which yielded little new information, did I finally learn that their plan would send up to 400 additional flights every day over Rockland County, at altitudes as low as 5,000 feet. This translates to one flight every 2 to 3 minutes over a previously quiet suburban area. 
   Although I strongly disagreed with their decision to send hundreds of new planes over Rockland every day, the plan itself wasn't the FAA's only problem. The bigger issue was how they tried to implement this plan without telling the very people who would be most affected by the redesign. Although a number of town hall meetings were held in the region, the FAA avoided going to Rockland County. Only through my efforts did I finally get the FAA to hold a town hall meeting in Rockland County, where 1,200 attended and spoke in universal opposition to this plan. Before this  meeting the FAA arrogantly decided not to consider Rockland County's views. The FAA maintained it was too late to take their voices into consideration. Of course, it would be too late if they stubbornly kept their mindset of ignoring the views of Rocklanders before the close of the official comment period. At least the FAA did eventually meet my demands and come to Rockland to listen to my affected constituents. Unfortunately, the FAA didn't learn from the universal opposition to their failed plan, as they continue to pursue the flawed redesign plan. 
   Throughout the whole process, the FAA has made it difficult, if not impossible, to get accurate information on the effects of the airspace redesign. For example, over a year after it was announced to us, we still don't know how loud it will be when 400 planes fly overhead every day. We don't know how much additional pollution this will cause. We don't know how it will affect the disproportionate rate of childhood asthma in my District. This level of secrecy is simply unacceptable. 
   Everyone in this room knows that we must do something to prevent this summer from turning into the disaster of delays we experienced last summer. However, it seems to me the solution is not to implement a flawed airspace redesign proposal that will relieve little, if any, congestion. The FAA estimates that this will possibly save a couple of minutes per flight. However, they can't say this for sure. Last year, at Members supported the call for the GAO to study the effectiveness of this redesign. And despite the fact that the GAO is currently studying whether this will actually have any benefit on congestion, the FAA is rushing full speed ahead to implement their plan before the study is completed. 
   Over time we have witnessed a number of different strategies to reduce regional delays without adversely affecting thousands of people. Reinstituting flight caps at Newark, La Guardia, and JFK can help to reduce delays. Opening up military airspace, as the President did over the holidays, is another way to help. Expediting the implementation of the NextGen air traffic control system will offer positive benefits as well. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to put yourselves in the position of the 300,000 people who live in Rockland County, as well as the countless others the FAA failed to properly consult in the drafting of this flawed proposal. Think about trying to read a book in your quiet living room, and then imagine someone turns on the vacuum cleaner every two minutes for the entire day. My constituents chose to live in Rockland County because they wanted to get away from the noise of the city. They didn't choose to buy a house next to an airport. They live 30, 40, even 50 miles from the nearest major airport, and they have had little say in this redesign plan. I ask you to take this lesson into account: Today's airspace redesign harms people and their quality of life in my District. Tomorrow, another redesign effort can have the same negative impact on your constituents. If this plan goes forward, I fear for the quiet neighborhoods across the county.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RECOGNIZING THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), for introducing this resolution that recognizes a small but important friend of the United States. 
   It is often said, Mr. Speaker, that good things come in small packages, and in the case of San Marino, this is certainly true. San Marino is the third smallest country in Europe, only Vatican City and Monaco being smaller. 
   San Marino, which is home to 29,000 inhabitants in a territory one-third the size of the District of Columbia, attracts several million visitors a year. The tourist industry makes up over 50 percent of the country's GDP. 
   San Marino is said to be the oldest republic in the world. It was founded in 301 A.D. by Marinus of Rab, a Christian fleeing from religious persecution by the Roman Emperor. 
   Its constitution, which dates back to 1600, is the world's oldest written constitution, and remains in effect to this day. 
   San Marino has been an active player at the international level, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and Council of Europe. Through these bodies, San Marino has sought to promote interreligious and intercultural dialogue, as well as the protection of intellectual property. 
   San Marino has also cultivated a close friendship with the United States based on our shared values and interests. This relationship was first expressed when President Abraham Lincoln exchanged letters with the Captains Regent of San Marino. 
   Nearly 150 years after these letters were sent, the United States and San Marino upgraded their bilateral relations to include the first ever exchange of ambassadors. President Bush welcomed San Marino's new Ambassador, Paulo Rondelli, during a White House ceremony on July 25. U.S. Ambassador Ronald Spogli presented his credentials to the Captains Regent in San Marino's Palazzo Publico on March 8. I welcome this development in our bilateral relations, and look forward to ever closer cooperation with our European ally. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution which recognizes the close relationship between our two countries, expresses gratitude to San Marino for its friendship and support, and commemorates the first ever exchange of ambassadors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1567) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide increased assistance for the prevention, treatment, and control of tuberculosis, and for other purposes, as amended.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (STOP TUBERCULOSIS (TB) NOW ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. H.R. 1567, the Stop TB Now Act, which I introduced with my colleagues, the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), has 106 bipartisan cosponsors, and I am proud it is moving forward today. It is a very, very important and timely bill. 
   International tuberculosis control has become an important issue to me. It is remarkable in this day and age, with treatment available, that TB is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world. In fact, TB kills more women worldwide than all causes of maternal mortality. As you know, tuberculosis is also the biggest killer of people with AIDS worldwide. Someone in the world is newly infected with TB every second, and TB counts for more than one-quarter of all preventable adult deaths in developing countries. 
   I strongly believe that the global community, with the United States in the lead, must do more to adequately address this disease by investing in quality TB control programs, using the groundbreaking Global Plan to Stop TB as a guide. It is for this reason that I have introduced this bill, the Stop TB Now Act, which will set forth the U.S. fair share towards achieving the goals of the Global Plan. 
   I believe if we don't make bold and wise investments in international tuberculosis control, not only will we fail to save millions of lives and miss out on the many accompanying benefits of controlling this killer, but also that this disease will become far more difficult and costly to treat. 
   Extremely drug-resistant TB, or XDR-TB for short, highlights this danger. It has been found on six continents, is a growing epidemic in southern Africa, and is already reported to be here in the U.S. Regular, or non-drug-resistant, TB is curable with drugs that cost just $16 in most developing countries.     
   Cases of drug-resistant TB, however, can cost thousands of dollars to cure,  with treatment that is far more difficult for patients and practitioners. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a man-made problem and is caused by poor TB treatment. We, the global community, have the power to prevent drug-resistant TB and the power to treat and control regular TB, and yet, unfortunately, we have chosen not to do so by our inaction. 
   Through aggressive, committed leadership, the U.S. has proven that it is feasible to massively scale-up our investment to fight HIV/AIDS and malaria, and well we should. We have increased funding to fight AIDS from $840 million in 2001 to $2.9 billion in 2004, to over $4.4 billion in the House Foreign Operations bill in fiscal year 2008. 
   U.S. funding for malaria efforts increased from $100 million in 2006 to an administration request of $387 million for fiscal year 2008, with a House Foreign Operations level of $350 million. 
   Even our response to the potential threat of avian flu has been aggressive, from just $4 million a few years ago to $100 million in the Foreign Operations budget for fiscal year 2008 and an additional $160 million in the fiscal year 2007 supplemental. 
   However, only tuberculosis, the greatest curable infectious killer on the planet, has been left behind, and we must correct that, and that's the purpose of this legislation. 
   Because of our chronic neglect of tuberculosis, this disease is not only responsible for the preventable deaths of some 4,000 people every day, it is undermining our enormous efforts and billions in investments to fight AIDS. Tuberculosis is the leading killer of people with AIDS. Through U.S. leadership, we are seeing increasing numbers of AIDS patients access life-saving antiretroviral therapy, but they're not dying of AIDS. They're dying instead of tuberculosis. And what a shame that is and how ridiculous it is when we have the power to stop and end it. And more recently, people have been dying in large numbers in southern Africa due to drug-resistant TB. 
   While the President's AIDS initiative has made commendable scale-ups in TB and HIV efforts, they are still, in my opinion, grossly insufficient. Much of PEPFAR's scale-up supports testing tuberculosis patients for HIV and ensuring that TB and AIDS programs work together. It's very important. I'm glad we're doing it, but it's not addressing the core TB program needs. And PEPFAR's TB-HIV efforts are focused on those co-infected with both diseases and mostly in Africa, again, while commendable, but TB is a global problem and we need to combat it everywhere. 
   The costs of inaction are greater than the costs laid out in this bill. This past spring, it became clearer than ever that tuberculosis knows no border when a gentleman named Andrew Speaker, an attorney from Atlanta, traveled across the globe and came back to the United States with a highly resistant form of TB. We all remember that. Many of us were shocked by it. 
   Being from New York, I'm very familiar with what happens when TB control is neglected. In the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the City of New York paid a dear price for its failure to invest adequately in tuberculosis control. The city, along with many other areas of the country at the time, experienced an epidemic of tuberculosis. In this case, the epidemic was a multidrug-resistant TB, which inevitably develops in the absence of basic TB control. New York City launched an aggressive tuberculosis control campaign and brought down its burden of drug-resistant TB. The cost to the city? Over $1 billion to control some 300 cases, far higher than it would have been and it would have cost to prevent the situation in the first place. Tuberculosis is not just a global issue, but as we can see, it's certainly a local one as well. 
   When it comes to tuberculosis, Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot afford to maintain the status quo. The resources authorized in this bill represent a realistic and urgently needed increase in funding for global TB control based on the needs laid out in a costed-out, comprehensive business plan. The cost of inaction is much, much greater. 
   In conclusion, I would especially like to pay tribute to our former colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, who was a champion of global tuberculosis efforts during his time in the House. He's doing this great work as well now in the Senate. 
   I would also like to thank the many groups whose advocacy helped bring the Stop TB Now Act to the floor, particularly RESULTS and the American Thoracic Society. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congressman Payne and their staffs for their unfailing support for tuberculosis control and this legislation and to the Energy and Commerce Committee and Mr. Dingell for expediting consideration of this bill. I'm proud to serve on both the Foreign Affairs and the Energy and Commerce Committee, the two committees that have jurisdiction on this bill. 
   Again, this is truly a bipartisan bill. I wish to thank the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and all the people, all the colleagues who have cooperated on both sides of the aisle because only by working together can we get at the scourge of TB. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thank my colleague, and I just want to let him know and let my colleagues know that we worked together with Senator Lugar, who's the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and we specified that the funding would be a ceiling, not a floor. 
   The bill appropriates up to $400 million in 2008 and up to $550 million in 2009, including global activities to be carried out by USAID and CDC. So that's what we did. We negotiated it so we wouldn't necessarily spend all the money. We would spend up to that amount of money, and that would be the limit, but it would not be the  money that we would spend if we didn't need to spend it. 
   We worked closely with WHO, CDC and USAID, and the overall global number is derived from Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB 2006 through 2015, of which WHO is a partner and USAID is the current Chair of the Stop TB Partnership's coordinating board. The plan is well documented, detailed, costed out, and again, builds up from country estimates and was reviewed in an exhaustive process. 
   Finally and furthermore, the World Health Organization developed and released a ``Global MDR-TB and XDR-TB Response Plan'' that supplements the need calculated by the Global Plan's need in light of the outbreak of drug-resistant TB. 
   USAID and the CDC work together globally and both have agreed to this coordination of funding, and again, we have a ceiling of what we spend and not a floor. 
   So, again, I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   I first want to thank the gentleman from California, our colleague Mr. Honda, for this resolution congratulating the Ethiopian people for their nation's second millennium. I also commend America's large Ethiopian community, the Committee for the Celebration of the Ethiopian Millennium, and Ambassador Samuel Assefa and his staff for making the celebration in Washington, D.C. a truly memorable event. That celebration brought together the finest Ethiopian artists, musicians, scientists, and scholars from around the world for the purpose of making the event not just a social festival but also a learning experience. 
   Mr. Speaker, Ethiopia is one of the most fascinating countries in the world. It is a country of great antiquity with a culture and tradition dating back thousands of years. The most recent humanoid remains yet discovered, known as ``Lucy,'' were found in Ethiopia. 
   Modern-day Ethiopia is a multiethnic country with some 83 languages spoken, most of which belong to four main language groups. It is a multireligious country where for centuries, Christians, Muslims, and Jews have co-existed. 
   In a region of the country known as Kaffa, Ethiopians in the ninth century discovered what we now know as coffee. Ethiopians still practice a traditional ceremony around coffee, a significant social event of the day for family and community. 
   Today Ethiopia is an emerging democracy, a leader on the continent of Africa, and a friend to the United States. Ethiopia stood by the American people on September 11 and has continued to cooperate with the U.S. Government and the world community in the fight against terrorism. 
   I wish to express our gratitude and to extend our best wishes to the people of Ethiopia as their nation observes the beginning of its third millennium.

You can see these bills were all supported with strong bipartisan support. But I want to especially commend the staffs on both sides of the aisle for working very, very hard in getting these bills through. 
   The very first bill we did was H.R. 1567, which was my bill, the Stop TB Now Act of 2007. And I want to especially commend my legislative director, Emily Gibbons, who was so responsible for this bill. If it wasn't for her, I don't think this bill would have come to its fruition. She was tenacious and was extraordinarily helpful to me in passing this legislation, and this legislation is clearly also a tribute to her fine work. 
   So I wanted to mention that, and I wanted to again thank my colleague from Arkansas.

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Let me first thank my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, Mr. Wexler from Florida, for introducing this important bill. 
   The Eurasia Foundation has been a key U.S. government partner in the ongoing effort to promote democracy, expand economic opportunities, and facilitate government reform in countries that formerly comprised the Soviet Union. 
   Created in 1992 with bipartisan support, the Eurasia Foundation has invested over $360 million in Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia in programs that have complemented United States goals for participatory government and active citizenry in this region. 
   In addition, the Eurasia Foundation has been able to leverage significant private sector funding, in main part due to the annual funding support from the U.S. Government. 
   This bill seeks to enhance those efforts by recognizing the Eurasia Foundation as a distinct and independent entity that could continue to raise private capital while under a U.S. Government authorization. 
   Vital work remains unfinished in this part of the world. It is clear that political and economic stability in Eurasia will have a direct impact on the security of the United States. 
   For these reasons, it's imperative that we continue to support programs such as those conducted by the Eurasia Foundation. 
   I strongly support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), for introducing this important resolution that congratulates Mr. Sarkozy on being elected the next President of France. 
   Over two centuries ago, the people of France assisted the people of the United States in their pursuit of independence during the American Revolution. Since then, the U.S. and France have shared an extensive and mutually beneficial relationship. Today, the United States and France are major economic partners, with nearly $1 billion in trade taking place between the two countries each and every day.  
   France is the United States' ninth largest partner for trade in goods and sixth largest partner for trade and services. The United States and France are scientific and technical partners as well. Research institutions and private companies in both countries participate in extensive scientific collaboration on a wide range of issues, including computer development, biotechnology, and space exploration. 
   This spirit of cooperation also typifies the cultural exchange that takes place between American and French academic institutions, museums, and theatres. In light of our continued friendship between the people of the United States and France, we are honored that President Sarkozy will be appearing before a joint session of Congress this week on November 7, 2007. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which congratulates Mr. Nicholas Sarkozy on his election to the presidency of France and welcomes President Sarkozy to Washington. 
   I might also add that it is especially nice that the leader of France has demonstrated time and time again that he has warm feelings towards the United States of America and is, indeed, a pro-American leader of France. The relations between the United States and France in the past several years has been a little frosty, and it's nice to see that those frosty relations have thawed. It's nice to see a leader of France who understands and wants to work with the United States and understands that we have a very close, long-standing relationship between our people. 
   I welcome President Sarkozy. I look forward to hearing him when he speaks before a joint session of the House and Congress later on this week. I think that this resolution is a fitting tribute to him, and I believe that the United States and France, under his leadership, will enjoy warm ties. 
   If I can think a bit about my French from grammar school, I could say, Vive la France. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   This resolution is particularly valuable as it catalogues a series of facts and actions related to the growing presence of Iran south of our border. 
   Last month, immediately after his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Ahmadinejad flew to Venezuela and Bolivia. This was his third trip the region this year. Mr. Ahmadinejad has used these trips to announce increased diplomatic cooperation and multilateral agreements on energy and industry. 
   Iranian involvement, Mr. Speaker, in Latin America is not new, as we all know. In 1994, Iran and its proxy terrorist group, Hezbollah, were involved in planning the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires, where 85 people lost their lives in the bombing. 
   In fact, just last week I met with the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, who updated me on Argentina's progress on the AMIA bombings. 
   Hezbollah remains operational in parts of Latin America, and they continue to fundraise for their global operations.  
   The United States must do everything we can to help Latin America crack down on terrorist groups in the region, both through joint military exercises and through legislation, giving to governments new tools to eliminate the terrorist threats. 
   I strongly urge passage of this timely resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the horrific events at Virginia Tech just a few days ago cause all of us to reflect. My heart goes out to the victims, to the victims' families, to the people who were injured. This is something that is just a terrible tragedy, an unthinkable, terrible tragedy. And as the father of three, including two in college, it really makes one stop and pause. 
   I say very, very respectfully, at a time of violence we need to reflect on this violence. And it certainly seems to me that upon reflection, to say that this country needs to have sensible gun control legislation, not legislation that would take guns out of the hands of people legitimately who have the right by the second amendment to own guns; but how could a deranged young man like the killer be able to just walk into a store and purchase any kind of guns at will and then use them to mow down 32 or 33 people? 
   It is all a matter of commonsense. We get emotional about these issues, but I am really speaking from the heart. Commonsense says that we need to have sensible gun control legislation so that criminals, people with mental illness, cannot just purchase guns at will and as many as they want. 
   In my home city, New York City, our mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has been leading a crusade for sensible gun control legislation, and I agree with him. And, again, it takes a tragedy of this magnitude to kind of just sit and reflect and say, what are we doing or what are we not doing and why is it an infringement on anybody's second amendment rights to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, deranged people, and people who shouldn't own them? 
   I think that this country really, really needs to reflect on its policies regarding guns. And, again, I support the second amendment, and I think there are many, many legitimate reasons for people to own guns. But after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, I say it again: I believe more than ever that this country needs to adopt sensible gun control legislation. We need to use our commonsense, and we need to try to prevent tragedies like the tragedy at Virginia Tech from happening again. 
   I know people say guns don't kill people, people kill people; that is true. But guns in the hands of the wrong people kill people. And I really think in all good conscience that we really need to reflect. 
   And, again, my heart goes out to the families, the victims, and all the students at Virginia Tech. But as a country, we need to come to grips with this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. This bill will provide long overdue assistance to our wounded veterans. 
   I know every Member of this body has read some of the horrific stories that have come out of veterans' facilities such as Walter Reed, which is just a few miles from where we stand. Stories such as mold in the rooms, holes in the ceiling, and insect and rodent infestation became commonplace at what should be our preeminent Army healthcare facility.  
   We owe our war veterans the very best care that our country can provide, but these problems at Walter Reed are not isolated incidents. They are indicative of an Administration that has failed soldiers and veterans at every level. The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act will help remedy the problems that have become known over the past few years. 
   This bill will take a number of steps to improve the quality of life for injured veterans. For starters, it will reduce the workload of case managers handling the medical care of vets. Currently, these case managers are overwhelmed with thousands of soldiers who have come back wounded from Iraq. 
   In addition to reducing their caseload, this bill will also require that case managers are properly trained to handle the supervision of the soldiers in their care. These injured soldiers need an advocate to help them navigate the paperwork and potential obstacles they face. 
   H.R. 1538 will also direct the Department of Defense to create a toll free hotline for soldiers to report problems with their medical care, or with the facilities in general. Had there been a hotline already, we might have learned about the Walter Reed problems long ago. 
   As has been proven with all the problems that we have seen in military medical facilities recently, there has been a general lack of oversight involving the military hospitals. This bill will fix that problem by creating an oversight board. This board would be composed of members of the House, Senate, as well as appointees of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This oversight is critical to prevent these terrible conditions from reoccurring. 
   Mr. Chairman, throughout our Nation's history, our freedom has been preserved by members of the Armed Forces. Countless soldiers throughout our history have given their lives or their health to preserve our way of life. Ensuring that they get the very best healthcare is the very least we can provide them with. How can we possibly ask a soldier to sacrifice a limb to preserve our safety, and then put them in a dirty, moldy room when they return? This is unconscionable behavior, and passing R.R. 1538 is a good way to address some of these problems. 
   I strongly support the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, and I urge my colleagues to offer their support as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank our distinguished chairman for yielding to me. 
   Madam Chairman, I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, named after our dearly departed two great House Foreign Affairs Committee chairmen that I had the pleasure of serving under, Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde. 
   The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a major threat to the health of the global community, from the most severely affected regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, as the chairman mentioned, I'm the chairman of the Subcommittee of the Western Hemisphere, to the emerging epidemics of eastern Europe, central Asia, south and southeast Asia, and Latin America. 
   I also want to take this time to pay tribute to our colleague who is in the Chamber, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who has worked so hard in combating global AIDS, probably harder than anyone else in the Congress. I'm delighted that she's here, and her hard work has not gone unnoticed. 
   While most widely recognized for reviewing our commitment to global AIDS relief, H.R. 5501 reauthorizes provisions on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, all deadly diseases of poverty. The Lantos-Hyde Act is a decisive step forward for global health, particularly for our efforts to control tuberculosis. 
   I want to take a moment to specifically address the tuberculosis provisions included, as the chairman mentioned, as my bill H.R. 1567, the Stop TB Now Act which passed the floor earlier this year, was largely incorporated into this bill, and I'm delighted about that. 
   The World Health Organization reports that 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis in 2006, with another 200,000 dying from HIV-associated tuberculosis. The multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant TB, known as MDR and XDR, poses a grave risk to global health. A contagious airborne disease, TB knows no barriers or borders and can only be successfully controlled in the United States by controlling it overseas. 
   This Lantos-Hyde Act declares TB control a major objective of U.S. foreign assistance programs. In support of WHO targets, the bill prioritizes halving TB deaths and disease, cutting them in half, and achieving a 70 percent detection rate and an 85 percent cure rate by 2015.  
   The Lantos-Hyde Act prioritizes the Stop TB Partnership's strategy, which includes expansion of the successful treatment regimen for standard TB, treatment for individuals infected with both TB and HIV, treatment for individuals with drug-resistant TB, and enabling research and development of new tools. 
   Recognizing the deadly synergy between TB, an opportunistic infection, and HIV, the Lantos-Hyde Act authorizes assistance to strengthen the coordination of HIV/AIDS and TB programs. TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS.

   Finally, the legislation authorizes assistance for the development of new vaccines for TB. The current TB vaccine is more than 85 years old and is unreliable against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most of the worldwide disease burden. New TB vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and would lead to substantial cost savings. 
   Studies modelling the 10-year economic benefits of a vaccine that is 75 percent effective have estimated worldwide savings in medical costs of $25 billion or more. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a very, very important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SCHIP program. The bottom line, my friends, is do we want to fund children's health care for poor children in this country or do we not? 
   The arguments against it from fiscal conservatives, and I always have to question that a bit because our Republican friends have driven up the deficit to the greatest in American history, and now they want to tell us this program is too expensive. 
   One of the reasons the American people are so disenchanted with Congress is because the Republicans are blocking a bill that is very, very supportive of what American people want. We see here that 72 percent of the American public, two-thirds of the Senate, the majority of the House, 43 State Governors and more than 300 organizations support this legislation; and our friends on the other side of the aisle are blocking the will of the American people. 
   Let's fund this bill. Let's help poor children. Stop with the nonsense, stop with the nonsense about New York. We try to help as much as we can. Congress ought to help our poor kids. That's the question. Do you want to help poor kids, or don't you?

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend, the chairman; and I rise today in strong support of this bill. 
   We have an opportunity today to right one of the most troublesome provisions of the Medicare Modernization Act, the provision which prohibits the Secretary of HHS from using the bargaining power of 40 million American senior citizens and disabled Americans who are enrolled in the Medicare to negotiate more affordable drug prices. 
   It is simply common sense. We know that our senior citizens continue to struggle on fixed incomes to be able to purchase their prescription drugs in addition to essential basic living necessities, like food, electricity and rent. We know costs in the Medicare program continue to skyrocket. By negotiating prices, we may be able to achieve record drug savings for seniors while also shoring up the fiscal health of the Medicare program, thereby protecting U.S. taxpayer dollars. 
   I am troubled by the repeated false assertions on the other side of the aisle that this legislation would mandate price controls and limit seniors' access to drugs. Nothing can be further from the truth. 
   H.R. 4 continues to prohibit the Secretary of HHS from requiring a particular formulary, and it simply says we should give the government the best shot at trying to negotiate lower drug prices. No price controls. Even Tommy Thompson, who said he considers this bill one of his finest accomplishments, stated that he regretted the clause in the bill prohibiting HHS from negotiating drug prices. As Secretary Thompson notes firsthand, he was able to use HHS to negotiate key savings for Cipro during the anthrax attacks of 2003. So there is room for improvement. 
   I respect the research and development that the pharmaceutical companies conduct. Frankly, we should not bash the pharmaceutical companies. They do good work. I have a plant in my district that has created and manufactured terrific prescription drugs. I would never support a bill that I believe would stifle innovation at the expense of the American people. But I believe that we can and should promote policies which put more good options on the table. This bill does that, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (HONORING OFFICER CHRISTOPHER RIDLEY -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, nearly 2 weeks ago Officer Christopher Ridley, age 23, of the Mount Vernon New York Police Department saw a street scuffle outside a county social services building in White Plains, New York. While off duty and in plain clothes, he drew his service weapon and attempted to break up the fight. 
   Unfortunately, officers from the Westchester County police also came upon the scuffle and tragically and mistakenly fired on Officer Ridley, who was killed. 
   Last week I attended the wake and funeral of Officer Ridley in the City of Mount Vernon, which is in my congressional district. Hundreds of local residents, police, and others from throughout the area turned out to pay their final respects. My heart goes out to Officer Ridley and his family by this terrible tragedy. One of our finest was  struck down at a very young age, which is around the age of two of my children. 
   The investigation into the shooting has begun, but the life of a brave 23-year-old is already taken. I ask my colleagues to remember Officer Ridley, who was posthumously promoted to detective, and also remember so many others for the brave sacrifice they make each and every day protecting us and our communities. 
   We must always remember those in law enforcement for the difficult job they are called to do each and every day. 
   May Detective Ridley always be remembered for his brave commitment to maintaining the peace and keeping us safe.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. This bill will expand Section 8 Vouchers to improve system efficiency, encourage self-sufficiency, and increase the number of families who can participate. There are currently 20,370 vouchers in use in New York's 17th district which I proudly represent, and 2 million families using vouchers nationwide. These Section 8 Vouchers allow low-income families to choose the housing option that best fits their needs, and encourages permanent economic stability. 
   According to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, there is funding for 150,000 vouchers that are not in use under the current Section 8 Voucher formula. By reforming Section 8 Vouchers, we put funding and vouchers in the hands of people who need them the most. 
   Madam Chairman, in New York we highly value Section 8 Vouchers housing. The vouchers provide much-needed assistance to families and individuals wishing to become more economically self-sufficient, but who lack the means to do so on their own. Simplifying and expanding Section 8 Vouchers will help alleviate a monumental housing crisis in the state of New York and throughout the country. H.R. 1851 relieves pressure on struggling communities and families and will bring economic security and self-sufficiency within their reach. H.R. 1851 reforms Section 8 Vouchers in a comprehensive and logical way, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman, my distinguished friend, the chairman, for yielding time to me.  
   Mr. Speaker, it's time to get our troops out of the middle of an Iraqi civil war. It's time to start bringing our troops home. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle are essentially saying ``stay the course.'' At what point, I would ask my friends, do we say that the administration's policies in Iraq have failed and it is time to change course? I think that time is now. 
   Even the Bush administration's interim assessment of whether the Iraqis are meeting basic benchmarks shows that they have failed to achieve any level of political and economic success. Here we are in the fifth year of the war, longer than World War II, more than half a trillion dollars and 3,600 American lives lost, and Iraqi politicians seem further apart than ever. Indeed, the evidence that our soldiers are involved in an Iraqi civil war is mounting and a solution seems even further from our grasp. 
   Young American service personnel cannot solve the problem of Iraq, because, ultimately, Iraq is not a military problem anymore; it is a political crisis. And if the Iraqis cannot solve their political problems, we cannot do it for them. Only Iraqi politicians can bring about a solution, and our military personnel should not be dying to hold together the collapsed Iraqi state. 
   Mr. Speaker, this war has turned into a great strategic fiasco, from the lack of planning to insufficient number of troops, to incompetent management of reconstruction projects, to the use of torture in military prisons. Our blunder in Iraq will affect our ability to succeed in the Middle East and elsewhere for years to come. 
   Therefore, I strongly support this bill, which requires that we begin redeploying American troops home within 120 days of enactment and ending by April 1, 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in our Energy and Commerce Committee, we're  pushing ahead to grant health care coverage to millions of children, a program called SCHIP. Unfortunately, the President's proposal to reauthorize SCHIP is woefully inadequate. His funding level won't even cover the children currently enrolled in the program. Nationwide, 6 million children are covered by the SCHIP and another 9 million are uninsured. If there was ever a question of where our priorities are, it should be with strengthening and modernizing the SCHIP program. 
   I've just come from a meeting with our Governor, Eliot Spitzer. New York operates a separate stand-alone program under SCHIP, Child Health Plus. As of December 2006, nearly 400,000 children were enrolled and receiving comprehensive health coverage in the program. Our stand-alone SCHIP program has increased enrollment by over a quarter of a million children since the start of the program. 
   Nationwide, we have to remember that the SCHIP program is a critical part of our health care safety net, providing health coverage to more than 4 million low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP has served New York and our country well, and I will continue to work to improve access for children's health care coverage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I am going to come here and speak from the heart. I do not want to read a speech because I think it is important to speak from the heart. I am not here to point fingers. I am not here to chastise anyone. I am not here to talk about what might have been. 
   I support our soldiers. I support the war against terror, but I rise in support of this resolution which is Congress' responsibility. We have to look, Madam Speaker, at the current situation in Iraq as it is, not as we might wish it to be, but as it is. 
   Several years ago, I voted to give the President the authority to go to war in Iraq based on what we were told then. I must say that I regret that vote. 
   I regret it not only because no weapons of mass destruction were found or that there was no connection between al Qaeda and Iraq at that time, even though we were told there was. There was obviously faulty intelligence. We will never quite know if we were misled or if our intelligence was bad. But one thing is very, very clear to me, that this war has been mishandled from the beginning. 
   The President is now talking about a surge of sending 21,500 more troops to Iraq. When we first went into Iraq, I am a big believer if you are going to do something, you do it right or you do not do it at all. We were told by General Shinseki that there were not enough troops in Iraq, not enough troops at that time several years ago to be able to protect the borders, to protect insurgents from coming in, to protect people that would do us ill from coming in. 
   And his statements were dismissed. Not only were his statements dismissed, but then he was dismissed; and now here it is 3 or 4 years later, we are being told that the solution is to send more troops again. It is obvious to me that this is too little too late. 
   The war in Iraq has morphed into a civil war. It is obvious to anybody who looks at the situation that the Shia and the Sunni are fighting each other, and our brave men and women are caught right in the middle of it. Eighty percent of the people of Iraq on both sides do not want us there, and more and more our people are becoming sitting ducks. 
   I grieve for the more than 3,200 brave Americans who have died and the countless thousands more who have been injured; but it is one thing, Madam Speaker, to die in fighting for the freedom of your country, defending your country. It is quite another to die in a senseless civil war that more and more we see we cannot control nor probably should we attempt to anymore. 
   From the minute we came into Iraq, unfortunately, not only did we have no troops, there was mistake after mistake. We fired the Ba'ath Party people. So we had people who were angry at us to begin with. We have not been able to give the Iraqis what we said we would give them. They find that their way of life is worse now than ever before. We were not greeted as liberators, but we were greeted as occupiers. 
   And when we look at what we supposedly are there to protect, we look at the leader of Iraq, Mr. Maliki. He is propped up by the al-Sadr brigade, viciously anti-American, viciously killing Iraqis. He cannot go after them. They are the base of his support, and we are to believe that somehow he is a great patriot and is fighting for democracy in Iraq. 
   We talk about al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is certainly a threat. I am a New Yorker.  I will never ever forget September 11, 2001. And we have to go after al Qaeda and we have to fight terrorism, but I believe that the war in Iraq has now become a distraction against the war on terror. 
   So by staying in Iraq, are we fighting the war on terror, or are we making it more difficult? A troop surge will not work. There are other priorities that we have. Our young people are sitting ducks. This is more and more like Vietnam. You cannot leave and you cannot stay. 
   We support our troops. This surge will not work. Congress needs to send this message to the President and to Iraq and to the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGEL. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding, and it's hard to believe that it has been 20 years. We are classmates, and I am very proud of the work that Mr. Neal is doing on the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to strongly support the bill, but I want to express the frustration that so many people here have expressed that we are not permanently repealing the AMT. Every year, it seems, we come and we talk about a fix, which we are doing now, which needs to be done, but we point fingers at each other, we play the blame game and somehow or other a total repeal and a redoing of the AMT doesn't happen. 
   If you come from a high-tax State like mine, like New York, which also happens to be a very high cost-of-living State, people are making more money because it costs more money to live in a high cost-of-living State. 
   Yet many of these middle class families find that they are being hit with the AMT. Even if we pass this today, as I am sure we will, those families will continue to be hit with the AMT, even though they are middle class, and, as all my colleagues have mentioned, the AMT was never supposed to affect them. 
   We need to put our heads together and come up with a plan to have alternative means of raising revenue and not have the AMT that affects so many middle class families. We are talking about a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street, and yet we never seem to have the money to bail out the middle class. 
   We need to do that. We need to do it, and we need to do it now. We need a permanent fix, not patchwork every year. PAYGO, I am certainly for it, but the main thing is, middle class families should not be harmed by the AMT. And in a State like New York where there is a high taxation and high cost of living, we have a double whammy. 
   I thank my friend, I support the bill, and I hope that next year we will come back for a permanent fix and finally repeal the onerous AMT.
