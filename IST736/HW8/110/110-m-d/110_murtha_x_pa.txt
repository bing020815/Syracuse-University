<DOCNO>Mr. MURTHA. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Well, as Bill Young said, we worked together when he was chairman. When Jerry was chairman, we worked together. 
   The only thing I disagree with, when it comes to the floor, I am not sure I like to hear a lot about amendments. I mean, you know, I like to see it try to work in a hurry. 
   But, anyway, I am concerned, when I heard the other day the Secretary of Defense say that the United States military must prepare for more fighting, future wars against insurgents and militias, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than spend money and time preparing for conventional conflicts. 
   Overemphasizing the Department's focus on training and equipment for counterinsurgency missions appears to be simply a rationalization of a short-term budget decision made in the waning months of this administration. I am worried because we have been saying over and over again, let's look beyond Iraq, let's make sure we get the military back to the position where it should be. 
   These decisions have left the Armed Forces in a degraded state of readiness. Both of us, when Jerry was chairman, when Bill was chairman, we have tried to increase the amount of money for the military to increase our readiness without the support of the administration in many cases. 
   They have let the facilities, which directly impact service personnel, quality of life, in disrepair. Every place we have gone we have seen the disrepair. They have left many defense acquisition programs broken or badly damaged. 
   I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense saying, Mr. Secretary, we have got some real problems here. We have got to fix these procedures by sending a budget up to it. We have got to stop the supplementals, put it in one budget so we can have some semblance of order when we look at these decisions. These decisions fail to take into account the potential missions the U.S. armed forces must prepare for and may have to undertake in the years ahead. 
   I find these comments questionable that he has made at a time when not one combat unit in the United States is rated as combat ready. We need a national strategy. We have tried to provide a national strategy to identify both near term and long-term threats to this country. We need a vigorous debate to achieve this strategy, and it hasn't happened since the Cold War. 
   Now, I hope that in the base bill and this supplemental we are moving in that direction. I hope that's what we are going to be able to accomplish. 
   Now, we spend more money on intelligence than any other country in the world. Put them all together, and we spend more money. I have got Punxsutawney Phil in my district. Punxsutawney Phil comes out once a year, he sees his shadow, and 50 percent of the time he is right. 
   Well, I will tell you, I wouldn't say that the intelligence effort that we spend so much money on is any more than that, because so many things have not been right. 
   I am concerned that if we don't pay attention to what we know, we who have been here a long time, we are not going to be prepared not only to fight a war, but to prevent a war. We can no longer be the world's policeman, and I think all of us understand that. 
   We need to rebuild our diplomatic alliances, and we need to restore our international credibility. Our military and diplomatic force must include the strengths of our allies. We cannot do it alone. 
   Now, let me say in this bill we have $3.6 billion for C-17s. We produced 34 C-130s. We went through it with the subcommittee in detail. We had to make some changes because the full committee wanted us to make some changes, $3 billion for medium and heavy trucks. I remember when we went to Saudi Arabia the first time, we asked General Schwarzkopf, what was the biggest shortage, and he said trucks. 
   We have tried to take care of the things we realize need to be done. We put money in for Humvees and Marine Corps facility maintenance, and we put in for medical maintenance. We transferred money to the military construction committee, and they made the decision where that money should go--and $570 billion--no one in Congress, probably in the history of Congress, paid more attention to medical care for the military than Mr. Lewis, Mr. Young and myself. We have tried to be in the forefront in making sure that they have what they need in order to take care of the troops.     
   As a matter of fact, we put money in some years ago for a center to take care of the amputees, and it took them awhile to understand that we were serious about it, but it happened. I am proud to say that is working very effectively. 
   So what we have done under the Constitution is appropriate the money where we think it will do the most good, and we will continue to do that. This is a good bill, and I hope Members vote for it so we can get the money to the troops that they need.

   Mr. MURTHA. Let me just say that the Revolutionary War, my great-great-grandfather fought in it. We fought our own war. In the Civil War, I have my great-grandfather's hat in my office. He fought against the South in the Civil War. We fought our own war. What we are trying to do in this legislation is force the Iraqis to fight their own war. That's what it's all about. Sixty-two Americans have died this month. We want to force the Iraqis to fight their own war.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing people say that we have got to give this a chance. For 4 years we have given this a chance. For 4 years we have had our troops overseas. 
   Here is the problem that we face. Every time that we give them a chance, they disappear. For instance, they said that the Iraqis are going to lead this surge. Let me tell you, 50 percent of the Iraqis in the units aren't showing up. So the Americans have to take over. We have to pay the bill. 
   The Europeans, this is just as important to the Europeans as it is to us, and the Europeans benefit from the oil that comes from Iraq, yet they are not really participating to any significant amount, versus the first war where they participated significantly. George Bush I got a coalition together. 
   The problem we have with what is going on, this is not General Petraeus' war, this is the administration's war. This administration has put us in a position where the military has to actually violate their own guidelines in order to get troops to Iraq. 
   I knew over an a year ago we didn't have the numbers of troops we needed to sustain this deployment, and the surge makes it worse. The worst thing we can do is send troops, and if you vote against this, you are going to vote for sending troops into war without being fully mission-capable, without the training and equipment they need, and that is absolutely unacceptable. 
   I note to the Congress and I note to the people sitting on that side who worked so hard to fund the military, we put $70 billion in last time that the administration did not even ask for. 
   We have 36,000 additional troops in here for the overall picture. So if you vote against this, you are voting against those 36,000 troops, for the total number of troops that need to be not deployed, but need to be available to be deployed. 
   Our reserves are in desperate shape. Our Strategic Reserve, when we started this war with C-1, they are now in the lowest state of readiness. They couldn't be deployed. Only two divisions would be deployed. So we have a lot of work to do. 
   And I say to the Members, you are voting against supporting the troops if you vote against the money that goes to the troops and the money that has already been sent or is going to be sent. They are going to run out in April, and we need to get this bill through. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members on both sides of the aisle to vote for this legislation.

   Mr. MURTHA. Let me tell you what is in this bill and what you are voting against. There is $1.7 billion of this bill request for military health care. If you vote against this bill, you are denying our troops $1.7 billion. 
   There is $450 million for post-traumatic stress. There is $450 million for brain injury care. It is insufficient, but that is the money we put in the bill; $62 million for amputee care at Walter Reed, $20 million to fix up Walter Reed. That is what is in this bill for health care. 
   If you vote against this bill, the military families will be denied $17 million to help prevent child-spouse abuse. 
   The bill increases accountability over contractors. When I was in Iraq a month and a half ago, the contractors were falling all over each other. GAO and the inspector general of Iraq said to us, help us get this under control. I asked or one of the Members in the subcommittee asked the GAO what we could do to help. And I asked the Under Secretary of Defense: How many contractors do you have in Iraq? He couldn't tell me. He said, we will tell you within a week. We still haven't heard, and that has been over a month ago. We have had 11 hearings, and we are going to have 35 more hearings before this year is over. We are going to hold the Department of Defense accountable for the money that they are spending and the strategy that they are using. 
   This bill bans permanent bases in Iraq. This bill bans torture in Iraq. We have sent troops to Iraq that were not trained in their specific MOSs, and that is exactly why Abu Ghraib happened. We had people that were untrained, National Guard members who were untrained who went into that prison, didn't know how to handle it, and it caused a natural disaster, a public relations disaster. 
   The way the military is doing the job, and there is nobody that regards the military higher than I do. Nobody is more inspired by the troops that I have talked to and I have seen. But let me tell you something. With the type of tactics that they have to use, by knocking down doors and by using overwhelming force, it makes enemies. That is the problem we have, and we are not winning the hearts and minds of the people when we do that.     
   Let me talk about the readiness of our troops. Every unit in the United States, except two National Guard units, went into this war with the highest state of readiness. Now, there are only two units in the United States that are at the highest state of readiness. 
   This provides money to take care of that. If you vote against that, you are voting against money to take care of readiness for our strategic reserve. 
   Let me tell you what General Craddock says. General Craddock is the European commander, the NATO commander, American commander. Listen to what I am saying. This is what General Craddock says: ``We have very little capacity left after we source the global force pool, if you will, for these ongoing European Command missions. Our ability to do that now is limited because we don't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to the other missions.'' 
   He is saying what I have been saying for a year and a half. This is a failed policy wrapped in illusion. We do not have the troops. We do not have a strategic reserve to be able to react to a future national threat to this great country. The troops can only do so much. 
   This bill includes $1.4 billion for new armored vehicles. If you vote against this, you are voting against the new armored vehicles which we need so badly. We put an extra $313 million above what the Defense Department requested for those vehicles. That is the V-shaped vehicles which resist the IEDs. If you vote against this bill, you will be denying the troops better protection and better equipment. 
   The bill also includes billions to reset the forces. What I have been saying is the equipment, somebody said the other day, well, they train on old equipment. Well, why does that mean anything? Those of you who have been in the military knows what it means. It means when you go into combat, you do not have the type of equipment you need. You are risking the lives of these people by training on inadequate equipment. We have two units that will not go to the desert because they have to rush them out over to Iraq. 
   It is not the military's fault. The administration has forced the military to break their own guidelines in order to send troops over to supply this surge and to sustain this deployment. 
   Finally, we are saying in this bill, you cannot send troops back into battle unless they have the appropriate training, they are fully trained, mission capable. Is there anybody that is going to vote against that? If you vote against this bill, you vote against that. If you vote against this bill, you vote against sending troops back in less than a year at home. That is unacceptable. 
   You can sit here and say we are fighting this war, oh, yes, you can sit here in Washington and say you are fighting this war. But let me tell you something, those young people sometimes went back three and four times; their families are suffering. These are not 140,000 people. These are each individuals with families and relatives that are bearing the brunt of this fighting that are sent back. 
   This bill forces the administration to live up to the guidelines they have set for their military and not to extend them. A psychologist told us in a hearing that if you spend 3 months in combat that there is a good chance you will start to develop PTSD three months in this intensive combat in Baghdad. 
   Now, you can sit here and talk about us fighting this war on terrorism. We put an extra billion dollars for Afghanistan in this bill so we could fight terrorism where it started in Afghanistan. That is where it started. 
   Let me tell you something. We set benchmarks. We set benchmarks because it has not worked. Every time something happens over there, what he says is, well, we will send American troops; we will send American troops  back before they have their time at home. We will extend American troops. The Iraqis have to start to bear this responsibility for themselves, and that is why we are putting it in the bill. 
   The American people in the last election sent a message. They said we want the Iraqis to solve their own problems in Iraq. The Americans have borne the brunt. We are spending $8.4 billion a month, $2 billion to get people and equipment and supplies over to Iraq, $2 billion a month, 8,000 miles away. 
   I will tell you what hurts the troops; I will tell you what hurts them. It hurts them when they extend it beyond 13 months or the marines, beyond 7 months. What hurts the troops, if you send the troops back before they have a year at home. That is what hurts the morale of the troops. I am the person that found the 44,000 shortage of body armor in the initial invasion of Iraq. We had troops in danger because they did not have the equipment they needed. We cannot send troops back into combat without equipment and fully being trained. 
   Let me just say this in the end. My grandfather's Civil War hat is in my office. He lost his arm in the Civil War fighting for the North, some of you Southerners here. My great-grandmother lived to be 96. I was 6-years-old when she died. She said you are on this Earth to make a difference. We are going to make a difference with this bill. We are going to bring those troops home. We are going to start changing the direction of this great country.  
   Mr. Speaker and distinguished Members of this body, the United States currently has 145,000 troops on the ground in Iraq and over half a trillion dollars has been expended in the war. More than 3,200 of our sons and daughters have lost their lives and close to 25,000 have been wounded; hundreds with amputated limbs and thousands with traumatic brain injuries. 
   The Pentagon reports that the Iraqi Security Forces have grown in number, reaching their goal of 325,000 trained and equipped. The Iraqis have a Constitution and have held national elections. These milestones have been met, yet lack of security and stability continues. The war in Iraq has been plagued by mischaracterization based on unrealistic optimism instead of realism. Reality dictates that conditions on the ground are simply moving in the wrong direction. 
   There are limits to military power. There is no U.S. military solution to Iraq's civil war. It is up to the Iraqis. 
   Beginning in May 2005, after two years of mischaracterizations and misrepresentations by this Administration, the Defense Appropriations subcommittee required the Department of Defense to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the facts necessary to measure stability and security in Iraq. Since July 2005, we have received these reports. They are dismal and demonstrate a clear lack of progress in vital areas of concern. Electricity, oil production, employment and potable water remain at woeful levels. 
   The average weekly attacks have grown from 430 in July 2005 to well over 1000 today. In fact, attacks throughout the country have increased 10 percent over the last 4 months. Iraqi casualties have increased from 63 per day in October 2005 to over 125 per day. 
   Recent polls show that more than six in 10 Iraqis now say their lives are going badly, double the percentage who said so in late 2005. Sixty-nine percent of the Iraqis surveyed said the presence of U.S. forces in the country makes the overall security situation worse. In January 2006, 47 percent of Iraqis approved of attacks on U.S.-led forces. When the same polling question was asked just 8 months later, 61 percent of Iraqis approved of attacks on U.S-led forces. 
   The support of the American public continues to erode and there is little confidence in the current strategy. Today less than 30 percent of Americans approve of the way the President is handling the war, and only 11 percent support the President's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. A February 2006 poll showed that 72 percent of American troops serving in Iraq believed the U.S. should exit Iraq within the year and 42 percent said their mission was unclear. 
   Wars cannot be won with slogans. There must be a clear and reachable plan and a defined way to measure the success of that plan. The President says he has a new plan for a way forward in Iraq. General Peter Schoomaker, Chief of the United States Army, said in a recent hearing that in order for a plan to be effective we ``have to be able to measure the purpose.'' But the President sets forth a plan with no defined matrices for measuring progress and no consequences if progress is not made. This new plan is simply more of the same open ended commitment in Iraq that has not worked. 
   A new strategy that is based on redeployment rather than further U.S. military engagement, and one that is centered on handing Iraq back to the Iraqis, is what is needed. I do not believe that Iraq will make the political progress necessary for its security and stability until U.S. forces redeploy. 
   In order to achieve stability in Iraq and the Region, I recommend:

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the heroes who died seven years ago today in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in the Congressional district that I represented, Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
   On September 11, 2001, I was in the U.S. Capitol, where the subcommittee I now chair was marking up the annual Defense Appropriations Bill. After the order was given to evacuate, I headed back to Pennsylvania. The next day, September 12, 2001, I visited the crash site of United Flight 93 in Shanksville, only 30 miles south of my home. We all owe  a deep debt of gratitude to those heroic passengers who foiled the terrorists' plan and saved the lives of countless Americans working and visiting in the U.S. Capitol. 
   In our darkest hour, Americans everywhere joined together in acts of bravery, compassion and hope. Our first responders worked round-the-clock to help those in need, and millions of us gave our time and resources to relief organizations like the American Red Cross. In the months following September 11th we found comfort and pride in each other. We were all Americans, and we were determined to move our great Nation forward. 
   Madam Speaker, our number one duty is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. Our brave men and women in uniform are fighting around the globe so that our children can grow up in a world absent of war and terrorism. We pay tribute to their bravery and to their sacrifice on this anniversary of September 11th, 2001.

   Mr. MURTHA. I want the Members to know I carry in my pocket the names of 18 people who have been killed from my district. Two years ago, I said this is a failed policy wrapped in illusion. I am absolutely convinced that there's more instability in the Middle East today than there was then. 
   This recommittal motion works against everything we are trying to do. We want a plan. We want a plan in Iraq. We want stability in the Middle East. We don't have stability. Pakistan, Afghanistan, and of course Turkey might even go into the Middle East. So when you talk about victory, you're talking about stability, which we don't have. It's absolutely essential to put a plan in place that holds the President accountable. 
   All this time the President has asked for things and we have given them to him. For 5 years we have said to the President of the United States, You need money, we are going to give to it you. Now we are saying we are going to have a new plan, and that plan is going to change the direction of this war, and we are going to bring those troops who fought so honorably home to their families.

   Mr. MURTHA. As the gentleman from Florida said, we just passed a $459 billion bipartisan Defense appropriation bill, and it funds the troops, it funds the health care, it funds almost all the Defense Department. It does not fund the war in Iraq. 
   Now, when I spoke out 2 years ago, I said we need stability in the Middle East. All of us want stability in the Middle East. We can talk about Iraq, but it's not in isolation that you talk about Iraq. You have to talk about Pakistan and what's happening in Pakistan and why we haven't had an overall diplomatic success there. You can talk about Turkey, on the verge with tanks moving towards the border and might go into Kyrkystan, which would completely disrupt what is going on in Iraq. 
   You can talk about Iran and the policy that we have had in Iraq and how it has disappointed us with the influence that Iran has gained. When we were attacked, Iran was one of the first countries to come to the support of the United States with their concern about what had happened, their concern about al Qaeda. 
   What we are trying to do here today is stop torture. We do it by saying the Army Field Manual has to be the guideline for torture. If you're going to have prisoners, and I have talked to service people, Colin Powell agrees with this, Gates agrees with this, almost all the military understands if you don't have guidelines set by the Army Field Manual, it hurts our troops. It's pretty hard to argue. If you're for torture, I don't say you vote for this or you vote against this bill, but this stops torture by saying you've got to comply with the Army Field Manual. 
   The other thing we say in this bill is you have to have fully equipped and fully trained troops. Can anybody argue about that? Is there anybody that can say to me we shouldn't have fully trained and fully equipped troops? I don't think so.     
   The other thing, it sets a goal. And the goal is to start the redeployment out of Iraq and have them out within a year. That doesn't mean that we are going to necessarily get it, but we have to start it. At some time we have to convince the Iraqis that we need to change the direction and they are going to have to take responsibility. I think they have started that. I think we have backed off a little bit. 
   What we did in Vietnam was make the mistake that every time they made a mistake, we took over. In this particular case, we have to let the Iraqis continue to do their job. 
   Now, the government has let us down; there is no question about it. The government has not changed the policies. There has been ethnic cleansing. There have been 4 million people ethnically cleansed either by sending them out of the country or by moving them from Sunni areas into Shiite areas or vice versa. 
   This is one of the reasons that the military commanders have said over and over, the Iraqis are finally taking an interest. The al Qaeda has been defeated, according to what the military commanders are saying. 
   What is the point in us being there if al Qaeda has been defeated? I said a couple of years ago, there are only 2 or 3,000 al Qaeda, and the Iraqis know where they are and know what they have to do to take care of them. 
   I am convinced that this bill starts to force the Congress to have oversight. We are the board of directors, somebody said to me today. The President is the executive officer. We are the board of directors. When the board of directors sees the policies going in the wrong way, and actually, the people of the United States are the board of directors and we act for the board of directors by the people of the United States. If we think it is going the wrong way, we have to change the policy. 
   This is a change in policy. This holds the President accountable for the decisions he is making. It doesn't tie the commanders' hands. No torture. They are supplied with equipment and training. That is not tying the hands of the commanders. And we are starting to get them out already. 
   Al Qaeda has been defeated. The civil war has wound down. It is time to get us out. Let's remember, stability in the Middle East doesn't depend just on Iraq. It depends on Pakistan with nuclear weapons or the possibility of nuclear weapons. Stability depends on Iran. Stability depends on Syria. Stability depends on Turkey, our allies. We need a diplomatic effort. 
   As I said and the Chief of the Joint Chiefs said, we cannot win this militarily; it has to be won by the Iraqis and it has to be won diplomatically. 
   This helps us hold the administration accountable, and I would ask for all Members to vote for a bill that changes the direction of this Congress and this country in this effort in Iraq.

   Mr. MURTHA. I would say to my good friend from New Jersey, he voted for the $459 billion bill where we had a CR that fully funded the MRAPs, fully funded, $16 billion for the year. We are not holding up the MRAPs. And we provided the transportation.     
   We were very careful with this bill. The gentleman knows how careful I am in taking care of the troops. The gentleman knows how careful he is in taking care of the troops. None of us are trying to put roadblocks in the way. What we are trying to do is hold the administration accountable for what they have done. We want stability in the whole Middle East, not just in Iraq. So we have got to focus also on the future of the country. Russia is starting to come up, China is starting to come up. And in our bill, which the gentleman from New Jersey was a part of, we started to look ahead. Iraq is occupying us as well as we occupying Iraq. 
   So I have to say to the gentleman, I just want to make sure we keep the facts straight. We have fully funded the MRAPS, even though it's costing $150,000 per MRAP to get them overseas because of the lateness of the request.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me explain what is in this bill for the Members. 
   We have $4 billion over the amount requested by the President. The President requested a total of $12.1 billion for military personnel pay and benefits. The committee recommends increasing the funds for those programs by $1.4 billion. The committee adds $1.4 billion to cover the full cost of housing allowance for military members in fiscal year 2007; $2.3 billion to cover the full cost of fielding an additional 36,000 Army troops. 
   If everybody here remembers, we added 30,000 troops in the supplemental, which the White House did not ask for, argued about, and which the Defense Department did not want. And yet now we are short of troops, and they are trying to blame the Congress for being short of troops. 
   We also added money for 9,000 additional marines. The committee recommends $52.5 billion for military operations, $2.2 billion over the President's request. 
   In addition to fully funding the request for military operations, the committee proposes an additional $2.5 billion to address training and equipping shortfalls in forces not deployed. We will set up a Reserve Readiness fund. 
   The committee recommends adding funds for the war in Afghanistan, $1 billion. That is where the original war started, and that is what you vote against if you vote against this bill. 
   $5.9 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces fund, $3.8 billion for the Iraq Security Forces fund, and a total of $2.4 billion is recommended for the joint IED task force. 
   The recommendations propose an increase of $17 million for DOD's Family Advocacy program. In other words, all of us hear, when we go talk with the families, the problems that they have. We add $17 million for that particular fund. 
   We have three significant reductions. We reduce some of the buys of hardware which we think ought to be in the base bill. 
   The committee bill recommends a total of $24.8 billion for equipment purchases, a slight decrease to the President's request of $86 million. The committees proposed an allocation of $1.4 billion to purchase what they call MRAP vehicles, that is, the vehicles with the V shape, which we need so badly. And that is what you are voting against if you vote against this bill: $311 million above the request of the White House. 
   For Army procurement accounts the committee approves a total of $15 billion: $994 million for tactical radios, $2.2 billion for tactical trucks, $867 million for up-armored Humvees, $636 million for Bradley fighting vehicle upgrades. And that is what you are voting against if you vote against this bill. 
   The committee bill includes $192 million not requested for three additional F/A-18s. We take care of the SEABEEs, something they have talked about that have been decimated by this war, and we put equipment in for the SEABEEs. 
   The committee is recommending reductions to several high-profile programs requested by the President. We deny funding for two Joint Strike Fighter airplanes because they ought to be in the base bill, and we will talk about that depending on what they authorize. 
   The President requested a total of $1.4 billion for research and development. The committee recommends a total of $1 billion. 
   Working capital funds: the committee bill provides a total of $1.3 billion for working capital. 
   Now let me talk about defense health programs. We just saw what we went through with Walter Reed. BILL YOUNG, who was chairman of the committee, and I went out to Walter Reed all the time. I had no idea, as most Members didn't, about what was going on at Walter Reed. And it really gets to me that every time we went out there, we asked them if you needed any help and they always told us everything is all right. We put more money in any way because we knew there would be some problems come about because of the fact that they were under BRAC. The committee decided unanimously to eliminate the closing of Walter Reed, especially during the time of war. We put $1.7 billion above the budget request.  
   The additional funding is for $450 million for post-traumatic stress. And that is not near enough, folks. That is not near enough. We figure there are going to be 65,000 military people who come back that are going to have post-traumatic stress. And that is what you are voting against if you vote against this bill. 
   We put $450 million in for traumatic brain injury care and research; $730 million to cover the funding shortfall created by Congress' having disapproved the Department's proposal to increase the health insurance premiums. And I am for that, but we didn't fund it. But we fund it in this bill, and that is what you vote against if you vote against this bill. 
   We put $62 million in for amputee care. Let me tell you something about amputee care. I went out to the amputee center in Brooks. Private industry put up a place in 18 months; $58 million they raised to put an amputee center up. We have been working on an amputee center at Walter Reed. It took us 3 years and it is still not built. JERRY LEWIS, BILL YOUNG, and myself, and it is still not done yet. 
   We are putting in $12 million for caregivers. The nurses called. They said, We have got a real problem here. We see these wounded. We see the people coming home all the time. It affects us mentally. It affects us emotionally. It affects us psychologically. We need help. So we put $12 million in; $6 million for Landstuhl, where they get the worst casualties; $2 million for Walter Reed; $2 million for Brooks; and $2 million for the hospital in California. 
   We put in $14.8 million for burn care. I want to tell you something, Members. You can go to all the hospitals. When you go to the burn care centers, you see the results of this war. We go to the hospitals. All of us go to the hospitals quite often. And let me tell you the burn centers are the worst when you go. 
   Now, we also took out 5 percent on contracting. Now, why did we do that? We did that because contractors are falling all over themselves and we asked the GAO and we asked the Inspector General of Iraq, How many contractors do you have? They couldn't tell us. They said, Help us find out how many contractors we have. 
   So we asked the Under Secretary of Defense. He couldn't tell us. He said, I will let you know in a week. 
   He still hasn't told us. So we took 5 percent out. They will tell us now how many contractors they have. 
   And we fenced 10 percent. So that is $800 million for the 5 percent and then $1.6 billion for the contractors to come out. So that is $2.1 billion we have taken out for the contractors. 
   We put in for CERP, which is a program in which there is $456 million provided under operations and maintenance for the commanders. 
   No permanent bases we said over and over again. We put in no torture, which has caused us so much problem when they didn't have the people trained when they were in Abu Ghraib. 
   Contracting oversight. We have a death gratuity amendment. Military attorneys, we put some money in for military attorneys. 
   Meeting readiness guidelines: let me tell you what we do to meet readiness guidelines. When you talk to these families, they need a year at home before they are redeployed. Is there anybody that thinks we should send these folks back before they have a year at home? Is there anybody that thinks we should extend them when they have 13 months in country? Is there anybody who thinks we should send troops into combat who aren't trained and ready? Is there anybody here?     
   We put benchmarks in for the Iraqi Government, as the chairman of the committee explained, because we need to give them the incentive. We need them to have some benchmarks so they understand that they have to get this done. 
   Every time something happens, and this is a problem we have, every time something happens, we step in. They started out, they said, with 80 percent of the people in the Iraqi units deployed in Iraq. Now it is 50 percent. Where are they? They are on leave. They deserted. They are not there. So who makes up the difference? Our troops are the ones making up the difference. We have to force the Iraqis to make up the difference. 
   Why are we even thinking about forcing the military to break their own guidelines because of this surge? Because of the fact they can't sustain the deployment. So the administration has decided, we are going to have to send people back with less than a year at home. 
   We are going to send people back that aren't trained and ready? That is unacceptable. That is unacceptable to every single Member of Congress. We have an obligation to the taxpayer under the Constitution to take care of defense. 
   We have an obligation to have oversight and auditing and accountability. We have had 14 hearings so far. We will have at least 40 more hearings before we have the base bill. I am going to put you on notice right now, the supplemental, the 2008 supplemental, is not going to come up with the base bill. The 2008 supplemental is going to be held, because we are going to see if there is going to be progress in this country before we bring up the 2008 supplemental. We are going to see if what they say is true. We are going to find out if this administration is giving us the facts. 
   We have said to them under the Moran amendment, you have to tell us how much oil production there is. Oil production is below prewar level. Electricity production is below prewar level. Unemployment is 60 percent. 
   Incidents have doubled since I spoke out here a year-and-a-half ago. Doubled. There are now 1,200 a week. And when I say ``incidents,'' I am talking about 140,000 troops deployed to Iraq, individually. I heard Elizabeth Edwards the other day talk about breast cancer, before she knew it had come back, and she said to me, there is 40,000 people that have breast cancer every year, but it is one at a time. 
   What we are talking about are troops, 140,000 troops, one at a time; 140,000 troops with families; 140,000 troops that have wives and husbands and mothers and fathers that have to suffer during these deployments. 
   When you go to the hospital, you see figures. Don't think when you say you see 2,500 people who have been killed, 3,000 have been killed or 25,000 have been wounded. It is individuals that have been wounded, individuals that have been killed, and those families are suffering. 
   We have to put some benchmarks so the Iraqis, they have civil war, we have to put benchmarks in this bill so the Iraqis start to do it themselves, and the Americans aren't forced to make up the difference, but they do it themselves.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me say to the Members what hurts our troops. 
   I found our troops, 44,000, without body armor. I found our troops with a shortage of jammers. I found our troops with a shortage of up-armored Humvees. I find our troops now, because of the policy, having to go back to Iraq before they have a year at home. I find our troops now because of the policy of this White House having to extend troops that have been there 13 months, and I find our troops having to go into combat untrained or not trained as well as they should, not going to the desert where they have this tremendous training area, going right into Iraq. 
   That is what hurts our troops. That is what hurts the morale of the troops when you send them without training, without the additional training they need, without the equipment they need and without the resources they need. 
   We are putting in the resources. If you vote against this bill, you are voting against the resources they need to go into combat.

   Mr. MURTHA. One of the Members said, how many less Iraqis have been killed? I don't know how many less Iraqis we killed. I know 62 individual American soldiers or marines have been killed this last month. 
   I want to say about equipment, I have got a chart here with the Army National Guard. Every single National Guard unit in this Nation, all 50 States, doesn't have the Humvees they need. 
   Every State, they don't have the 7-ton trucks they need. Every State, they don't have other equipment, the equipment they need for jammers and so forth. 
   When you say they are training on equipment and are not fully trained, they don't have the equipment to train on. This bill provides that. When you vote against this bill, you are voting against the extra money to fix that problem.

   Let me tell you what it would be today. Almost no division in the United States is ready to report for duty if we had to send them out someplace else to a national threat. That is the difference today. Today we are trying to fix this. Today we put money in the bill to fix this.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Chairman, the President requested $463.1 billion in total FY 2008 new budget authority for the Department of Defense and intelligence community programs that fall under the purview of the Defense Subcommittee. This is an increase of about $43.3 billion over last year's enacted level--a 10.3 percent increase in nominal terms. The lion's share of the increase over FY 2007, some 80 percent, was allocated to operation and maintenance and procurement programs. DoD's research and development program request is the same as last year's level, a decrease in real terms due to several major programs having completed their R&D phase and moved into full-fledged production. 
   The Committee's reported bill meets its budget authority allocation of $459.6 billion for FY 2008. This figure is a little more than $3.5 billion below the President's budget request. Nonetheless, the Committee bill provides an increase for Defense of $39.7 billion over the FY 2007 enacted level, or about 9.5 percent in nominal growth. With respect to outlays, the Committee bill is roughly $2.9 billion below the allocation. 
   In general, meeting the budget authority allocation required shifting funding for certain programs between the FY 2008 base budget bill and the FY 2008 war supplemental, to be considered in September. This largely affected appropriations for the Department's operation and maintenance activities. The bill recommends an overall reduction to the operation and maintenance accounts of some $5.7 billion below the request. Nonetheless, the bill fully funds home-station training, equipment maintenance, and other key military readiness programs covered in these accounts. Finally, notwithstanding a slight reduction to the military personnel pay accounts, all other major program activities, such as weapons procurement and R&D, are funded at or above the President's request. 
   Meeting the allocation also required deferring consideration of several high profile programs until the FY 2008 war supplemental is taken up. These include: 
   The Basic Allowance for Housing shortfall. 
   The ground forces' strategic reserve readiness and equipment rehabilitation and recapitalization. 
   The purchase of at least ten C-l7 cargo aircraft, $2.5 billion, and MRAP vehicles, $4 billion or more. 
   The purchase of additional Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters. 
   The Department's Global Train and Equip program. 
   The Defense Health Program ``efficiency wedge'' shortfall.

   Mr. MURTHA. You were using this as an example, the RSC. You were using those as stopping earmarks. 
   I am just saying that the Members come to the committee. We have a $459 billion bill. We find all kinds of shortages. I will give you an example of what we just found. 
   I went down to five bases, sent the staff down later, and we found that they didn't have the money to take the troops back when they come back after BRAC. We put $3 billion in that. This is an earmark. 
   Years ago, we put a couple billion in for ships. That is an earmark, and the Navy didn't want them. And yet, the SL-7s, if we wouldn't have had them in 1991, we would not have been able to get there. 
   We have confidence in the Members. Under the Constitution, Congress is responsible for appropriations. They make recommendations, but it is a bureaucracy that makes recommendations. The President doesn't make recommendations. He sends long lists, the White House sends long lists over to OMB. And anybody that has worked at OMB will tell you, billions of dollars, as the gentleman knows, in requests go to OMB. 
   I expect the Members to vet them. We try to vet them the best we can. We know that very few earmarks are not of real value to military. If there is any, we take them out. We have had a few like that, and we take them out as soon as we can. 
   So I don't make apologies for having earmarks. As I say, $456 million went to the RSC. So I don't make apologies. That is the Congress' job. Less than 1 percent of the $459 billion budget in that sense was projects for Members of Congress. And I would think Members of Congress know, as well as the bureaucracy over in the Pentagon and White House know, what needs to be done. And I think the gentleman will have to agree with that. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   And I want to say to the gentleman I had to find out that the young people in the schools where the bases are needed counseling. General Casey went out and found the same thing, and then he called me and said we need to take care of it. We already took care of it. We take care of all kinds of things like that. 
   The people that work in the hospitals that Bill and I visit all the time were hurting so badly, they needed help. We put extra money in for it. 
   And when you talk about programs that you may not think directly affects the Defense Department, breast cancer research, prostate cancer research, those diseases affect military families. 
   Diabetes. Not long ago, I asked the Air Force, How many do you think you have with diabetes in the Air Force? And they said 40,000. The Surgeon General went back and said 150,000. That is in all the families. We started a research program to see how we get them under control because it saves not only emotional strain and physical strain but it saves money. 
   So we do these kinds of things all the time, changing the direction of the Defense Department with health care things, with educational facilities that are important to the military.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, we will have appropriated in one year, $1.2 trillion. This bill that we are voting on today is called the Iraq Accountability Act. 
   Now, it's fine to have loyalty to the President of the United States. All of us know how important loyalty is; all of us know how important it is to be loyal to our friends, but there comes a time when this independent Congress has to stand up to the President of the United States. 
   We will have appropriated $95.5 billion. And if you vote against this bill, you're voting against that which is $4 billion more. You're voting for loyalty to the President, but you're voting against $4 billion more, $95.5 billion for the amount for the Department of Defense programs. 
   If you vote for President Bush, you're voting against $12.3 billion for military personnel pay and benefits, everything the President asked for. If you vote for loyalty to President Bush, you're voting against $1.2 billion, mostly to cover housing allowances which were left out of the last bill. The total amount provided is $13.5 billion. If you vote for President Bush and loyalty to President Bush, the conference committee has added $1.15 billion to cover the full cost of housing allowances. The committee has also added $2.3 billion to cover the full cost of 36,000 Army troops and 9,000 Marines. If you vote to be loyal to the President, you're voting against those troops. 
   When you talk about support the troops, I am talking about supporting the troops. Conferees recommend $50.4 billion for military operations even more than the President requested. We are adding $2 billion to address training and equipment shortfall. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee talked about readiness. Right now, we have a tremendous shortfall of equipment. We have no strategic Active Duty Reserve in this country. And we put extra money, we put $2 billion in to start to replenish the strategic reserve. 
   This conference proposes to fully fund the President's request to train and equip Iraqi and Afghanistan troops. If you vote against this bill, if you vote for the President and to be loyal to the President, you're voting not to include $25.6 billion in equipment purchases, $800 million above the President's request. 
   If you vote against this bill, you're voting not to allocate $3 billion to purchase the mine resistant, new vehicle with the V-shape which resists the IED, one of the most important pieces of equipment that we will send to Iraq. We put $400 million for Abrams vehicles, Abrams tank, and we put $768 million for the Strykers. 
   Now, let me talk about defense health. Today, the Subcommittee on Defense just had a hearing on defense health. Every single year, Dr. Chu, the Defense Department shorts the health care system of $2 billion. Every year. Every year, the Congress has to make it up. 
   We have extra money, we have $3.3 billion for the defense health care programs; $2.1 billion above the budget request. If you vote against this bill, you're voting against those requests. $450 million for traumatic stress brain disorders; $450 million for traumatic brain injuries and post traumatic stress; $661 million to cover funding shortfalls created by the Congress in having disapproved the Department's proposed increase in health insurance premiums; fees for military beneficiaries; $62 million for amputee care; $12 million for caregivers. This is an important point. For caregivers. We heard from the Department of Health, from the Defense Department about the problem caregivers have. 
   All of us go to the hospitals as often as we can. I get post traumatic stress seeing these young wounded people. I am inspired by them. I see the families when I went to Fort Bragg and Fort Stewart and Fort Hood. I admire them. I admire their discipline, I admire their courage. I admire their patriotism. But let me tell you something: They're burned out. They're hurting. 
   If you vote against this bill, you're voting not to give them the money that they need. If you vote against this, you're voting against the provision that says no permanent bases in Iraq. If you vote against this, you're voting against 15 percent that comes out of Defense for the contractors. We have 125,000 contractors in Iraq and there has been no oversight, and we had 2 months before we could even find out about the contractors. 
   One of the provisions we put in this bill was a provision that said you can't deploy troops unless they are trained and equipped. You can't deploy troops unless they've had at least a year at home. Now, more and more I am seeing, they are saying that's the most important provision in this bill. They need a year at home to recuperate from their deployment; they need a year at home to retrain and to get ready to make another deployment. The Secretary of Defense made that decision, and we appreciate him making that decision. But at the same time, because of the policy of the White House, he had to make the decision, in order to sustain this deployment he had to make the decision to extend them to 15 months. I hear rumors that he is going to extend them for 18 months. 
   The troops that I talked to, the troops that I talked to just recently, were very frank with me. I said, ``Look, we want to help in any way we can. Tell us what the problems are.'' And they went through the myriad of problems they have with these deployments. 
   These are individuals. These are individual people. They've got families. They have loved ones. One first sergeant said to me, ``I hate to tell my kids I have to go overseas again. I hate to tell the kids.'' One woman in Iraq, and this is in an article in The Washington Post, she sighed and she says, ``This war is a war between the Iraqis,'' she said. Another soldier said, ``We're just interfering and letting our soldiers die.'' 
   I have to say that when you say there is some success in Iraq, we had four of the deadliest months in the history of this 4-year war in Iraq. We had more people killed in the last 4 months than any other period of time during this war. We have had 330 killed since the surge started. And these are individuals. These are not numbers, these are individuals. 
   We have less electricity than we had before the war started, less oil production than we had before the war started, less potable water, higher unemployment. 
   We have a provision in this bill that says the Iraqis have to take over this fight themselves. The Iraqis just maybe killed one of the highest leaders. That's what we want. We want to give them the incentive to take over the security themselves. 
   And let me say what's important on this floor of the United States Congress and what's important to the President of the United States: It is the national security of the United States. That's what's important. It is important that Iraq take over their national security, but our own need concerns me. Our strategic reserve is depleted completely, our troops are burned out, and we need to find a way to do a diplomatic effort, to put an all-out surge in diplomatic efforts in order to bring our troops home as soon as practicable.  
   So I urge the Members to override this veto, and start to bring our troops home as soon as practical.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, apparently a number of people have not read this bill. I know my friend BILL YOUNG has read it. 
   We have $1.5 billion to cover the full cost of housing allowances for the troops. If you vote against this, you are voting against housing allowances. We have a total of $2.3 billion in this bill to cover the full cost of fielding an additional 36,000 Army troops and 9,000 Marines. If you've read this bill, you'll realize we added $2 billion to address the training and equipment shortfalls in the forces not deployed. One billion dollars is dedicated to purchase Army National Guard equipment. If you vote against it, you're voting against $1 billion for the National Guard. You're voting against an additional $750 million for Afghanistan. You're voting against $2.4 billion with a joint IED task force. In procurement you're voting against the very thing that the military wants most, and that is the new vehicle with the V shape which is resistant to IEDs. 
   Now, let me talk a little bit about IEDs. In the last 4 months, we have lost more troops than any other period during this war. And I am sorry to hear from a friend of mine's wife who called me and said there was a joke on one of the shows last night by a Republican Presidential candidate who said that he brought an IED back and he put it under this guy's desk. That individual owes an apology to every troop that serves in Iraq. 
   When we go to the hospital, all of us, we see burn victims. We see victims that are wounded badly. And many of us don't get an opportunity to see the families.  
   I went to Fort Hood, Fort Bragg, and Fort Stewart. These folks are burned out. The truancy rate is up in the schools. The achievement is down in the schools where our troops' children go. One soldier said to me, a first sergeant, a woman, she says, I hate to tell my children I'm going back to Iraq. 
   They're going back the third and fourth time.     
   A general said to me, ``I can only take 9 months.'' And we're sending them back to 18; I hear rumors that they are going to extend them to 18 months. 
   We have an accountability bill, this is called the ``Iraq accountability bill.'' This war has been so mismanaged that we have the responsibility to force the White House to be accountable. The policy is not set by the military, the policy is set by the White House, and we have to hold the White House accountable for the mistakes that they have made. 
   We will have appropriated $1.2 trillion for the Defense Department in 1 year. We are spending nearly $10 billion a month in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have 126,000 contractors. And it took us 2 months, the committee that funds every cent that is spent in Iraq and Afghanistan had to spend 2 months to find out there were 126,000 contractors. And we told this to the Secretary of Defense. When one of the Members of Congress said, and one of them is making $300,000 a year, one of the contractors, he said, ``That's more than I make.'' Imagine, we've got a contractor making more than the Secretary of Defense makes. We have a contractor that I saw, when I talked to the Cavalry Division that was in Iraq, here is a guy pumping gas, this is what a soldier told me, he gets $25,000 a year, and right beside him was a guy pumping gas for $80,000 a year. This is what I call accountability. 
   We have to hold the White House responsible for accountability. Why do they have 126,000 contractors? Because we don't have enough troops. Why are they extending the troops to 18 months, possibly? 
   And finally, they realized they couldn't send them back before they had a year at home. They had to be trained and they had to be equipped. That is what we say in this bill, we say you've got to be trained and equipped. 
   I had General Pace come up after the last hearing. I said, General, you've got to tell me you're not sending any troops back there untrained and ill-equipped. And I don't know that this conversation made the difference, but a short time later they announced they are going to extend people, and they are not going to send anybody back unless they had a year at home. It is absolutely essential. 
   I talked to some of the wives at Fort Bragg. I got one story from the hospitals about how the service was there, they were able to get service anytime they wanted, within a week they were able to get service. Then I talked to the wives, the officers' wives, I said, after talking to them for a while, how many of you got service in a week? No hands went up. How many did it take over a month? Half the hands went up. We've got to take care of the people at home. 
   Let me tell you something, I get fatigued in going to the hospitals. The caregivers that care for them every day, think what they go through. A nurse called me and said you've got to put some money in the bill, and we did, to take care of caregivers to give them some relief. These caregivers see it every day. So we put $6 million in for Landstuhl program. We put $1 million in for Walter Reed, for Brooke's and for Bethesda. They are burned out. The troops are burned out. What we are trying to do in this bill is hold the White House accountable for the policy mistakes that they made. 
   We went into Iraq without weapons of mass destruction. I believed it. When I went there the first time, I saw a line drawn around Baghdad. They told me they were going to use biological weapons. I believed that. It took me 6 or 7 months to realize we had made a mistake. We went to Afghanistan, it was the right place to go. 
   I am inspired by these troops, I am inspired by their families; but they are burned out and they are bearing as much as they can bear. When we sit here, and one of the previous speakers said ``we.'' I hear this all the time, ``we're fighting,'' ``we're fighting terrorists.'' We are not fighting terrorism, we are sitting here in an air conditioned place while they are out there in dust. 
   And let me tell you about the policy in this latest deployment. I worried. I didn't say anything in public, but I worried. When you send 37 different elements out by themselves among the Iraqis, when you've got interpreters who you don't trust, you are going to expect the kind of disasters you just saw. That's the thing that worries me when you don't have enough troops. And one general said to me, he said, ``If you're there more than 9 months, you start making mistakes.'' Imagine what he's saying? He said, ``I question myself after 9 months.'' A psychologist told us, who came before the committee, he said 3 months in heavy combat, 3 months of going out every day and having IEDs, imagine a Presidential candidate making jokes about IEDs when these kids are blown apart? It's outrageous. 
   Let me tell you something, we owe a great deal of gratitude to these families and these young people who are doing the fighting. It's not ``we'' doing the fighting, it's ``them'' doing the fighting. They deserve accountability from the Congress of the United States, and we are going to demand that from this accountability bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, today we once again consider a supplemental spending bill for our troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The spending bill before us represents a compromise between both the House and Senate. It provides funding to take care of our troops in the field through the balance of fiscal year 2008, and through June 2009. The funding in this bill closely follows our vision of ``looking beyond the war in Iraq.'' 
   For fiscal year 2008 this supplemental includes: 
   $825 million for National Guard and Reserve Equipment; 
   $1.6 billion for HMMWVs; 
   $3.1 billion for Medium and Heavy Tactical Trucks; 
   $102 million for Land Warrior equipment sets for next-to-deploy units; 
   $1.2 billion for various Joint Unmet Operational Needs as identified by the Department of Defense, but not included in the budget request; 
   $500 million for Army and Marine Corps Facility Maintenance and Repairs (this includes barracks); 
   $300 million for Facility Maintenance and Repairs at DoD medical treatment facilities; 
   $94.9 million for Wounded Warrior efforts; 
   $50 million for Family Advocacy Programs; 
   $570 million for treatment and research activities within the Defense Health Program; and 
   $3.5 billion to address the increasing cost of fuel that was not included in the budget request. 
   For fiscal year 2009 this supplemental includes: 
   $1.2 billion for military personnel and $51.9 billion for operation and maintenance. This is sufficient funding to maintain all anticipated military operations through June 2009; 
   $394.8 million for Bradley base sustainment; 
   $390.2 million for HMMWV recapitalization; 
   $1.1 billion for the Defense Health Program; and 
   $2.0 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund. 
   This is a good piece of legislation, and I'd ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides for a 3.5 percent pay raise for military personnel. It rejects the President's proposed increase in TRICARE copays and funds TRICARE by $1.9 billion, appropriates $2.6 billion to provide our military families with the immediate need for more counselors, teachers and child care providers. It also looks to the future. 
   The bill provides $938 billion above the President's request for advance construction funding for additional ships, provides an additional $980 million to purchase essential National Guard and Reserve equipment. We're looking beyond Iraq, trying to take care of any threat that may threaten this country in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill that BILL YOUNG and I worked out. 
   Let me say this to the Members: We did everything we could to work this out. We worked diligently. We sent a bill to the White House. They vetoed it. We've done everything we could do to change it. 
   I feel a direction change in the air. I see the Iraqis are starting to talk about redeployment. I see the administration starting to talk about other countries being involved. I see them asking the U.N. to get involved, something that should have happened a long time ago. But the point is, I see a new political diplomatic effort which is beginning to take effect here that's going to make a big difference. 
   But, in the meantime, we have to fund the troops. They'll run out in the next few weeks. They'll run out of money. There's no question about that. We send our staff continually to find out exactly how long it'll go. There'll be tremendous problems if we weren't to fund the troops. 
   And let me say what's in this bill. There's $94 billion for the Department of Defense military, and $24 billion of that is for reset and re-equipment; $7.7 billion for four critical initiatives; $1.1 billion for family housing allowances; $1.6 billion for strategic reserve readiness. We're trying to change. We're trying to stabilize the military. 
   We've already found with some of the work that we've done a couple of billion dollars in contracting that we can use and divert, and BILL YOUNG and I were talking about this earlier today; $1.6 billion for strategic reserve; $34 billion for MRAP. That's the new vehicle that resists the IED attacks. Almost $2 billion in additional funding for health care; we have funded the health care that was not funded last year. We put extra money in for Walter Reed. We put extra money in for care giving. We put extra money in for all kind of things. 
   But let me just say this: I saw the other day, to show you the kind of problem we have, I saw the other day a young fellow who got 20 percent disability when he got out of the military. And then he went to the VA, and he got 100 percent disability. But the point is, he gets no health care for his family, and he has four children. So even though he gets 100 percent disability and he's taking care of himself, and he'll probably be paralyzed at some point because he's getting worse instead of better, and these are the kinds of things we're trying to fix. 
   So we have several problems. First of all, we have the short-term problem; we have to take care of the funding for the military for the next 4 months. As Chairman Obey says, we need to take care for an extra 2 months from the original bill we passed. 
   Then we need to start to work on a nurse shortage. We're looking at paying the nurses $25,000 more. We're looking at doctor shortages. We are looking at an administrative shortage in the hospital. We, finally, BILL YOUNG and I worked, and we got General Casey going to all the hospitals finding out what the shortages are. We've got a lot of work to do here, and this bill starts us in that direction. 
   But let me just end this by saying, we're now in a position where I see that, by September, we'll be able to judge. When we pass our bill, and the 2008 bill will come up as a basic defense bill, then we're going to hold the supplemental until September. By that time, we will know that the surge is working or not working. And I predict, and I've been right in every one of my predictions, that incidents are going to continue to increase; oil production will not be above pre-war level; and that electricity will not be above pre-war level. And incidents will continue to increase, and more and more people will be killed by IEDs. 
   So I do not wish for a bad result, but I see the administration finally changing and finally recognizing this can't be won militarily. I think we're moving in the right direction. 
   It's very painful because people are frustrated. They'd like to see this thing over overnight. All of us are frustrated. But we have to take what we can get, and I think here we have a good bill, as good a bill as we could put together. 
   The two bills put together are good bills. I hope that everybody will vote for both bills because one takes care of the troops and the funding that's necessary, and the other takes care of all the other, the change in direction that we're trying to get in the military.     
   I would request that all the Members vote for both amendments to the bill.

You see incidents erupt. You see people getting killed. You see that nine people were killed just yesterday. You see that the IEDs are killing more people. More people were killed in the last 4 months than at any other time during the war. 
   We are trying to help you. We are trying to change the direction. We are trying to win it politically. We are trying to win this war. That is what we are trying to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, I would not have voted for this resolution. Two years ago, I would not have voted for this resolution. One year ago, I would have voted for this resolution. But after seeing no progress in Iraq, none, zero, having misrepresentation coming from even the Pentagon, I am beginning to believe it is time that we have to send a very strong message to this administration.     
   The total number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq is 3,382. Killed since President Bush announced his surge is 366. We have lost more people in the last 4 months than we lost in any other period of the war, and that doesn't count the number that have been wounded, and all of us have been out there and seen the ones that have been wounded. 
   The foreign minister of Saudi Arabia in The New York Times last week said, ``We don't see anything happening in Iraq in implementation. Our American friends say there is improvement; improvement in violence, improvement in the level of understanding, improvement in disarming the militia. We don't see it.'' 
   Admiral Fallon, he is the new commander in Iraq, the central commander. Admiral Fallon said last week in the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Prime Minister Maliki's progress thus far has been disappointing. They are not moving, in my opinion, fast enough to support what we are trying to do. The number one question in my mind is the ability as well as the willingness to do this.'' 
   Now, I said to the Iraqi National Security Adviser when he was here visiting me, I said, Look. I said, Originally we need a diplomatic effort, an international diplomatic effort. I urged him to change the Constitution. I urged him to pass a bill to spread out the oil revenues. 
   He said, Well, it's a slow procedure, and he started talking about how we needed to stay, and he talked about the war, he didn't call it a civil war, the insurgency and the al Qaeda. 
   I said, There is 2,000 al Qaeda. You don't think you can take care of 2,000 al Qaeda when you have in your country 26 million people? I said, Let me tell you a story. My great-grandfather's Civil War hat sits on that shelf there. And I took it out and I showed him that. We fought our own civil war. And then I said, My ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War. They were rag-tag. They didn't have shoes. They fought in cold weather without cold-weather gear. They fought the greatest army in the history at that time, the greatest navy in the history at that time, the greatest empire in history at that time, and we beat them. We beat them by ourselves, with a little help from the French. 
   You have to do this yourself, I said to the National Security Adviser for Iraq. You have to win this yourself. We can't do it for you. I said, Your Parliament takes a 2-month vacation in the middle of a time when it is crucial to the history. 
   The American people, three-fourths of them, are unhappy with what is going on. The Congress more and more. Even some of our Republican friends need to help us convince this President that we need to move in the right direction, we need to change the direction of this war. I see in a news release that the President is now, after all this time, considering benchmarks. After all this time, the President of the United States is saying I'll consider benchmarks. He finally is starting to compromise. He has come off the pedestal and the President is starting to begin to realize that something has to be done to change the direction of this country. 
   All of us want to solve this. All of us want stability in the Middle East. All of us want to do the right thing. But it is not working. Electricity production, below pre-war level. Oil production, below pre-war level. It has been that way for the last 4 1/2 years. Incidents are up. If you look at the way the incidents have gone, every month they have gone up. They have gone down a little bit, but they have gone up the whole time. And more Americans were killed in the last 4 months than any other period during this war. 
   We need to change direction. We need to send a message. We need to go to conference and have some kind of a conversation with the White House so that they understand. I am glad to see some Republicans went to the White House and spoke the truth to this President and said to him, Mr. President, we need a change. You are destroying the Republican Party. 
   Well, that is one of those things where I won't go there. 
   But let me say this: we need to have a strong vote. We need to vote for this resolution, and then we need to pass the other bill and get on with our business.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, it's not working. This policy is not working. That's why we want to change direction. I mean, it is one thing to stand here and rhetorically say it's working, say there's progress to make statements. Because the White House says it? Because the Pentagon says it? 
   Let me tell you, the Pentagon wrote and said, ``Further, the lack of timely supplemental funds has limited the Department's ability to properly contract for the reconstitution of equipment for both the active and reserve forces.'' 
   We put extra money in the budget, $17 billion last year. There wouldn't have been any money in the budget to reset. We have no strategic reserve. Our National Guard has only 40 percent of the equipment they need. They can't respond to a national disaster. As a matter of fact, the National Guard in this country couldn't be deployed overseas. The active duty American Armed Forces could not be deployed overseas because we have no strategic reserve. 
   This war has been mishandled. We need accountability. We had a hearing on contracting today, and I have been studying this contracting. Some of the accusations are that the contractors, there's 126,000 contractors in Iraq. We have approximately 140,000 troops there and 126,000 contractors. Now, imagine this. Some of them are making or being paid $600 a day, the contractors, and no accountability. It took us 2 weeks to find out who those contractors were, what they were doing. We still haven't gotten the details of what they're doing or who they are. This is unacceptable. 
   I saw in the book about Blackwater. It said in this book that Ambassador Bremer had 26 Praetorian Guards and those Praetorian Guards made $600 a day. Now, you can imagine them pushing through an area where the Iraqis lived, with their sunglasses on, you know, those little sunglasses that wrap around your eyes, with their khaki uniforms with their AK-47s or whatever weapons they carry. That does not make friends. 
   When I went to Iraq the first time, you could drive around anyplace in the city. Today, you can't drive anyplace. Matter of fact, they fly you from the airport to the Green Zone. 
   We are occupying Saddam Hussein's palaces. We are in the very area where Saddam Hussein occupied and there's no accountability. 
   We need to redeploy to stabilize this situation. We need to get our troops out of the killing zone. We have lost more people in the last 4 months than we lost any other 4 months in the entire war. 
   Now, let me tell you what you're voting against if you vote against this bill. 
   Well, first of all, let me tell you why I say it's not working. Oil production, below pre-war level; oil exports, below pre-war level; electricity production, below pre-war level. Hours of electricity in Baghdad, they had to shut down the Parliament the other day because they didn't have enough electricity. The microphones wouldn't work, and they had no air conditioning inside; and, of course, they have air conditioning in the Green Zone. Potable water, people with potable water, below pre-war level; unemployment rate between 25 and 40 percent; inflation rate in Iraq, 50 percent. 
   Now, here's what you're voting if you vote against this bill. There's $95.5 billion for the troops. There's $12.3 billion for military personnel pay and benefits program. $1.15 billion to cover the full cost of housing allowances, something that was left out last year. 
   We are adding $2 billion to address the training and equipping shortfalls in the forces not deployed. We actually have $4 billion more in this bill than was asked for. 
   We have $2 billion dedicated to the strategic reserve readiness fund. We recommend adding $1 billion for Afghanistan, where the real war should be fought. 
   We have $25.6 billion in this bill, and if you vote against it, you're voting against $25.6 billion purchases to increase the President's request by $800 million. That's the acquisition. The proposal allocates $3 billion. Let me tell you, the Pentagon asked for $1.3 billion. We added $1.2 billion for MRAPs. What are MRAPs? MRAPs are the V-shaped vehicles that resist IEDs. 
   Now, some of your children have been there. Some of your sons and daughters have been there. This the Pentagon says is their most important equipment, and we added twice as much money as they asked for in the budget, and if you vote against this, you are voting against that very equipment. 
   We passed legislation that fully funded everything at $4 billion more and the President vetoed it. He should have signed that bill. 
   For the Army procurement accounts, we approved a total of $15.8 billion, more for Humvees, more for Strykers. Somebody mentioned Strykers. Let me tell you something, if it hadn't been for the Subcommittee on Defense, there wouldn't have been any Strykers for the Army because they wanted them, but they weren't willing to ask for the money. 
   The defense health programs, somebody mentioned Walter Reed. All of us have been to Walter Reed. All of us have seen the young people who have been shattered by this war. All of us have seen the people who go to Walter Reed and are taken care of so well. None of us knew about Building 18, but we put money in the budget for three or four years in a row, and it was mishandled. It didn't go to fixing up the places that should have been fixed up. 
   I just went out there a week ago, and I met with the doctors. The doctors  said we don't have enough doctors. They said we don't have enough nurses, we don't have enough administrative people, at Walter Reed today. Why? Because they can't afford to pay them as much as they would on the outside. We put $2.1 billion above the budget request for Walter Reed. 
   $450 million for post-traumatic stress. Of all the other injuries that are suffered in Iraq, this is going to be the most damaging, the things that people will have to live with the most. I have seen young people that came back from Iraq that are having a hard time adjusting, and they were not in the heaviest contact. The psychologists that appeared before the committee said to me, 3 months in this situation is a long time, 3 months they start getting post-traumatic stress. Predictions are we will have 65,000 Americans, not Iraqis, Americans that are going to have post-traumatic stress. 
   You wonder why we want to bring this to an end? We want to change the direction? You wonder why we want to convince the President that it's not working? Why we have to have a diplomatic surge instead of a military surge? 
   We put $450 million in for brain damage to see if we can't find ways to help the people with brains that have been damaged. If you vote against this, you're voting against that. 
   Amputee care, $62 million for amputee care; $12 million for care givers. The care givers at Walter Reed, at Landstuhl are suffering because they see this all the time. They see these young people coming in, and they are shattered. 
   Let me tell you this, finally. I went down to Fort Hood, Fort Bragg, Fort Stewart; and I saw at those bases these families who inspire me, these families who I can't say enough about them. And they gathered around me and we talked about their problems. It had just been announced they are going to extend the troops for 15 months. Now, Secretary Gates made the right decision because he wasn't going to leave them at home. Because of what we have done here in the Congress, he is now leaving people at home for at least a year, and let me tell you that's essential for these people who have to go back. 
   Some of these troops in the 82nd Airborne will be deployed for the fourth and the fifth time. They're individuals. They're people. They're people suffering from the horrendous impact of this war, and I ask you to vote for this because we want to hold this President accountable for this war, hold him accountable and convince him we need compromises.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me say, I see the Vice President has gone to Iraq to urge the Iraqis not to take a 2-month vacation. I mean, we have got to put some pressure on them. It hasn't been working. I mean, I see the Vice President also said, he said they seem to be more enthused than they used to be. Let me tell you something, we have got to do something more than be enthused when the Americans are in the killing zone. That's the problem. 
   If this amendment were adopted, we would lose all our leverage on the Iraqis. The Iraqis could go on as they have, and one of the biggest problems  we have right now is that every time the Iraqis don't do something, the Americans are put in a killing zone. 
   So I would urge the Members to reject this motion to recommit.

   Mr. MURTHA. This Appropriation Committee will have appropriated $1.2 trillion for this war and for the Defense Department in one year. When I came to Congress, we had appropriated $100 billion for defense for the whole year. 
   We keep talking about progress; that's what the military leaders in Iraq talk about. I wish we saw progress. 
   I voted for this war because I believed that our Nation was threatened. Two or three weeks later, I realized that we weren't under any threat; we were misled. There was no threat to our national security. We went in with inadequate forces. I'm the one that found the lack of body armor, 44,000 troops without body armor, without armored Humvees; and now 4 years later, we're arguing about timelines where the Iraqis ought to take over the war themselves. We're arguing about allowing the Iraqis to do what the President agreed to. And we want to set a timetable so that they are forced to agree to it. There is no question in my mind every time the Iraqis stumble, the United States steps in and puts our American troops in between the civil war. 
   I just visited Fort Hood, Fort Stewart and Fort Bragg. The troops are somber. The troops are going to do their job. They're valiant. I am inspired by the troops. But let me tell you, they're burned out. In the schools in Fort Bragg they say they need counseling. In the schools of Fort Bragg they say there's higher truancy. They say the students' achievement has dropped. You know who's suffering? We talk about fighting this war. We're not fighting this war. A very small segment of this population is fighting this war, and they're burned out. I've had troop commanders who were there three times say, we can only spend 10 months in combat and we start making bad decisions; and I believe that. 
   They say there's progress, and I've just seen over 200 killed in 2 days. We've lost more Americans in the last 4 months than any other period during this war. That's not progress. The electricity production is below prewar level. Production of oil is below prewar level. How do you measure? Rhetoric doesn't measure progress. 
   In my estimation, this war has been so mishandled. Congress has an obligation to set a standard, to have accountability. And this bill is called the Iraqi Accountability bill, and that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to hold this administration accountable for the mistakes that they have made. 
   Does anybody know we have 125,000 contractors in Iraq? 125,000. And when we pointed this out to the Secretary of Defense, do you know what he said? He said, ``They're making more money than I make.''     
   The Secretary of Defense said these contractors are making more money than he makes, 125,000 of them. They couldn't tell the committee for 2 months how many contractors they had. 
   They have got a fellow fueling a truck on one side, and he's making $25,000, and right beside him is a guy making $80,000 fueling a truck. Why is that? Are we meeting our recruiting standards when we need 125,000 people that are contractors in Iraq riding around shooting people, as I saw in the Washington Post the other day, shooting inadvertently at people? They want to kill somebody, this one guy said? That's the face of America? We've lost credibility because of some of these contractors and the actions of these contractors. 
   I say we need to set timelines. We need to set a benchmark. We need to say to the Iraqis, it's time for you to take over and decide your own fate, like we did in our own revolution. 
   I ask Members to vote for this benchmark set by the gentleman from California.

   Mr. MURTHA. It's interesting to hear the gentleman say ``we.'' ``We fight.'' ``We aren't going to give up.'' ``We aren't going to surrender.'' 
   Let me tell you something. We are not fighting this war. It's the troops overseas. And when I talk to the families, when I go to the hospital, I see the results of this war. 
   Don't tell me we're fighting this war. It's the troops in the field, a very small segment of the American population that are fighting this war. If the President thinks we should continue the war, he ought to call for a draft and spread it out and let everybody serve in this war, not this small segment making such a sacrifice. 
   Don't tell me we're fighting in this air-conditioned office. We're not fighting this war. They're fighting it. And I'm proud of every one of them. But don't stand here in this air-conditioned facility and say we are fighting this war. 
   I am proud of these troops and what they have done. They have won the war. The mission was accomplished. We cannot win it militarily. It can only be won diplomatically.

   Mr. MURTHA. Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from California, that in the Revolutionary War they fought for 7 years against the greatest army in the history of the world at that time, ragged, with no shoes, no ammunition, and they outworked them and outfought them because they were on their homeland. 
   That is what I am saying the Iraqis should do. It is the Iraqis' country. The Americans should not be dying for Iraqis, caught in this civil war. 
   We have appropriated $1.2 trillion. We have appropriated over $140 billion more than the White House asked for, $140 billion more for the troops, to support the troops. We have given everything they asked for. In this Iraq accountability bill, we give them $4 billion more than the President asked for. We put a strategic reserve in, and we also take care of the health care, the post-traumatic stress. We take care of brain damage. We take care of the troops. We want to make sure the troops have what they need. 
   And to go back to the Revolutionary War, my great-grandfather's grandfather fought in the Revolutionary War on the right side and he prevailed. We don't have any letters from him, but we have letters from my great-grandfather who served in the Civil War on the right side, and he talks about how tough it was in the Civil War. But we  fought our own Civil War, and my great-grandmother lived to be 96; I was 6 years old, and she said, you are put on this Earth to make a difference. 
   We need to make a difference in this Congress, to change the direction of a mishandled war. We need to have oversight and accountability for the $1.2 trillion that we have spent on the Defense Department in 1 year.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURTHA. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURTHA. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has held 22 hearings and our members and staff have visited over 100 military bases and facilities, both here at home and throughout the world. The result is a $487.7 billion fiscal year 2009 Defense Appropriations bill that supports our troops and their families; invests in equipment needed to support the force; imposes fiscal discipline necessary to manage the department's resources; and addresses flaws in the U.S. national security policy. 
   Earlier this year, I was disappointed to hear the Secretary of Defense say that the U.S. military must prepare for fighting wars against insurgents and militias, he is talking about the future, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than spend time and resources preparing for future conventional conflicts. 
   I find these comments to be misguided and lacking in strategic vision, and the subcommittee agrees. When 90 percent of our ground combat units are rated as not fully mission capable and with what happened in Georgia, we need to be prepared for a contingency to prevent war. 
   This lack of strategic foresight has left our Armed Forces in a degraded state of readiness, has left our military facilities in disrepair, and has left many defense acquisition programs broken or badly damaged. That is in spite the fact that under Jerry Lewis and under Bill Young we put all the money we could put into the products in order to get them upgraded. 
   The bill addresses our future military needs and provides the resources urgently needed by the Department of Defense to prepare the United States military forces for threats to our national security beyond the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I am inspired by our troops and their families. Their sacrifice and service to this great country are applauded by both the American people and this Congress. We may disagree on matters of policy, but we can all agree on the need to take care of our troops and tend to the needs of their families. This bill addresses these needs in many ways. 
   For medical treatment and research, the bill adds $1 billion over the budget request within the Defense Health Program. Some of the recommendations include $300 million for traumatic brain injury and psychological help. Our subcommittee has been in the forefront of making sure that we have PTSD in mind; $40 million for medical care centers of excellence at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; $150 million for breast cancer research; $80 million for prostate cancer research; $20 million for ovarian cancer research; and $20 million for lung cancer. We found that 20 percent more military families have lung cancer than nonmilitary families, so we put money in trying to detect it early, which is how we prevent it. 
   For Family Advocacy Programs, the bill includes $102 million above the budget request, for a total of $410 million.  
   The bill provides $72 million to compensate servicemembers for Stop-Loss. We originally had more money in, but we couldn't figure out exactly how many people we had with Stop-Loss, so we said to the military, okay, we put $72 million in. After October 1st, anybody that has Stop-Loss gets paid, but you have to go back, do a study, and then tell us how much money you need for the period after that. 
   The bill provides $734 million above the budget request for the renovation and repair of barracks, military hospitals and other O&M funding for these facilities. 
   The bill includes language to ensure that the DOD takes steps necessary to ensure that Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Fort Belvoir remain the gold standard of military medicine. 
   The bill expresses concern over the frequency of troop deployments and the stress this places on the servicemembers and their families. All of us have seen the stress on the families. 
   Equipment and support of the forces. Key to improving U.S. military posture is to maintain our domestic industrial base. 
   Shipbuilding, $14.1 billion. 
   The bill provides an additional $523 million for the F-22. 
   The bill more efficiently aligns funding of the Joint Strike Fighter, $6.3 billion. 
   The bill includes $750 million for the National Guard, and we put $750 million in the supplemental unanimously. 
   The bill includes $3.6 billion for the Army's Future Combat Systems. 
   Improving fiscal responsibility. This bill reduces programs which have experienced uncontrolled cost growth due to poor management and designed instability while increasing funding for oversight activities. 
   The bill cuts $650 million from unjustified and uncontrolled growth in outsourcing, and adds $24 million for additional personnel required by the DOD Inspector General to oversee growth of DOD contracts. 
   For instance, I just saw in the news media, and that doesn't mean it is true, but there is $13 billion that has gotten lost someplace in the Iraq spending, $9 billion of it U.S. funds, according to the newspaper. 
   The bill reduces the presidential helicopter program, but we kept it alive, hoping we can get the cost down for the individual. 
   It cuts $197 million and 16 aircraft from the Armed Recognizance Helicopter. 
   I recommend that the Members vote for this bill. It is an entire bill. When the bill is signed by the President, it will be money for the rest of the year.
