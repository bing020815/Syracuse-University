<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I spent two good decades working professionally in renewable energy, and I know the great potential that new energy technology offers. The steps we're taking today will improve the world for future generations. 
   We should all feel proud as we pass this bill that will benefit our economy, our security, our children, and our planet. When future generations look back on the actions we're taking today, they will see it as a monumental first step away from centuries of consumption and exploitation and towards a bright and clean future. 
   I'm very pleased that this bill includes incentives for renewable energy, higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, a 15 percent renewable energy standard, and my bill, which will encourage groundbreaking research and geothermal energy. States like California have blazed the trail on these issues, and now everyone else can follow. 
   I support this bill, this rule, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP LEWIS DOLPHIN STALLWORTH, SR. -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Bishop Lewis Dolphin Stallworth, Senior, who passed away after a courageous battle with kidney disease. 
   Born in Welty, Oklahoma, in 1923, Bishop Stallworth found his life's calling with the church and the community. 
   Bishop Stallworth was a leader in the community, his influence extending far beyond the church that he founded in 1963. Bishop Stallworth volunteered as a police chaplain, hosted a weekly radio program, and frequently participated in local community functions. He also used his church as a place of learning, opening a school, originally located in the church basement, to educate young people. 
   He even organized a group of young men known as Stallworth's Soldiers, counseling them to get an education, stay out of trouble, and become model members of the community. 
   As evidence of Bishop Stallworth's enduring character and unparalleled passion, his love for his family, church and community, less than 5 weeks after his death, hundreds have already petitioned the school district to consider naming a school after him. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Bishop Lewis Dolphin Stallworth, Senior.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their support of this resolution and working so quickly to ensure that we recognize a very deserving group of scientists on their important achievements.     
   The scientists will be honored tomorrow at a luncheon here in Washington, so the timing of this bill is perfect. I appreciate the opportunity to describe this legislation that highlights the contributions of American scientists. 
   H. Res. 316 is significant not only because it applauds the breakthroughs of scientific work, but the bill also draws attention to many issues that we frequently work on in the Science and Technology Committee, putting a spotlight on scientific discovery as a way to get young people interested in fields they might otherwise ignore. 
   For the first time in more than 20 years, U.S. researchers have swept the scientific categories of the Nobel Prize by winning the awards for chemistry, physiology and medicine, and physics. It is fitting that we recognize the contributions of these individuals, and I am pleased we are doing so here today. 
   In December of last year, the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Roger Kornberg from Stanford University in my home State of California; the physiology prize went to Andrew Fire, who also works at Stanford in the School of Medicine; and the physics award went to John Mather from NASA's Goddard Space Center and to George Smoot from the University of California at Berkeley. Mr. Smoot also has the distinction of adding his name to the list of more than 170 grantees from the National Science Foundation who have been granted the Nobel Prizes over the years. 
   I am sure that with the improvements we will be making in the NSF program tomorrow and the Congress' dedication to expanding education opportunities, Mr. Smoot will certainly not be the last recipient of NSF funding to receive the Nobel Prize. 
   H. Res. 316 officially recognizes the accomplishments of these scientists and their contributions to improving society. 
   Madam Speaker, I can't think of a better way to honor these individuals, and I commend them for helping the U.S. sweep the Nobel Prizes in science for the first time in 30 years. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   Mr. Speaker, the energy policy in this country is neither sustainable nor healthy. Every day we import $800 million worth of oil, and not only does that put our economy at great risk, but some of that money is going to the very people who would harm us. 
   Our vote today in H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, will begin moving towards a rational and sustainable energy policy. 
   After spending more than 20 years climbing wind turbines and developing new energy technology, I can tell you that we have not even begun to realize the potential for jobs creation and sustainability in this industry. We need to be doing much more to expand the use of renewable energy. This bill is a first step to diversify our energy sources. 
   With H.R. 6 we will end billions of dollars of corporate welfare that we  have doled out to big oil companies currently enjoying record profits. 
   By investing in new energy technologies, we will also create an entire spectrum of good paying jobs right here in America. In fact, the passage of this bill will produce nearly 1 million jobs, generating close to $30 billion in new wages. 
   I am pleased that we are doing more than just paying lip service to expanding innovation and clean energy by following through with our responsibility to make the environment livable for future generations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee to increase innovation and investment in our energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the young men and women who joined the Armed Forces after 9/11 out of a sense of duty and love for our country are just like my son Michael, who joined the military because of those terrible attacks. I am proud and heartened by their commitment to service and patriotism, just as I am proud of my own son's commitment, and I am concerned about their safety and well-being, just as I was about Michael's when he was in the service. 
   When I talk about supporting our troops, it is not rhetorical, it is personal. And it is with great sadness and steely resolve that I stand up here tonight on the issue of Iraq and the President's plan to escalate that conflict. I am saddened because the misguided and mismanaged conflict has become a tragic disaster and a genuine  threat to Mideast stability and global security. The escalation will cause more violence in the Middle East and will weaken our Nation. 
   I am resolved, because it is our duty as the Congress of this great Nation to check and balance the power of the President on any issue we believe harmful to this country. This administration insists on finding a military answer rather than changing this failed approach and pursuing the diplomatic and political solutions necessary to bring an end to the violence. 
   Unfortunately, the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will not bring success there, nor make the United States more secure. In fact, the proposal means a further distraction from the mission in Afghanistan and the need for a tougher, smarter approach to the global war on terrorism. The President's proposal puts more U.S. lives at risk, further stretching the readiness of our ground forces and increasing the drain on our Treasury. 
   President Bush's plan is opposed by military experts, by Republicans and Democrats in both Chambers of Congress, and by the vast majority of our country. That is why I rise in strong support of the resolution under consideration in this body. 
   The resolution has two straightforward provisions: continuing support for those American soldiers who have served or are currently serving in Iraq; and disagreeing with the President's plan to escalate the conflict. 
   Supporting our troops is my top priority, not just because it is our duty and responsibility, but because it is personal to me and my family. 
   Recently the Washington Post reported that the Marine Corps and Army brigades that would be sent to Iraq under the President's plan are short of body armor, vehicles, and other important equipment. That shows just how desperate the President's misguided plan is. Military action should never be executed in desperation. 
   We must transfer the responsibility for establishing and maintaining law and order on the streets of Iraq to the Iraqis. Training those Iraqi units must be done outside of Iraq. This will mean more troops trained more quickly and will lessen the likelihood that Iraqi army and police turn to dangerous militias and death squads. 
   The members of our Armed Forces who have served in Iraq have done so, bravely and honorably. Unfortunately, the President's strategy in Iraq has not matched the commitment with which our troops have served in that country. 
   We must begin a responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq on a public timeline that makes sense, while pursuing political and diplomatic solutions. Yet the President has steadfastly refused to engage in the political and diplomatic efforts necessary to bring a resolution to the violence in Iraq. 
   Both Republicans and Democrats agree that we need a new direction in Iraq. I will continue to push for that new direction while always putting our troops first. 
   This resolution is an important first step. I stand with resolve in opposing President Bush's plan for an escalation in Iraq

   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 59 and the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
   As an engineer for my entire professional career and only one of a handful in the House, I thank Mr. Lipinski for introducing this legislation to bring the spotlight onto this professional career choice. 
   My father was an engineer; I am very proud to be following in his footsteps. As we vote on this legislation today, I am reminded of something that my mother used to tell me over and over: It was the engineers that would be solving many of our Nation's and our world's problems. Her words couldn't have been more relevant than they are today, as we face many challenges such as global warming, the demand for fresh water and food throughout the world. 
   Well, in the 1970s, the engineering profession wasn't considered the most exciting, but throughout the 1990s, we became aware of how exciting the challenges are that we are facing in engineering; and this has led to a resurgence in interest and inspired a whole generation of young people.     
   I am hopeful that with the passage of H. Res. 59 we will help inspire more of those young people to get involved in the engineering profession.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I feel passionately enough about renewable energy to have spent most of my career developing it, and I know firsthand that clean energy is an economic reality. Because of this, I will continue to fight for renewable energy standards and important tax incentives that are not included, but should be included, in this bill. However, I believe that H.R. 6 will create jobs here at home and is an important first step for greater energy independence and a green future. 
   H.R. 6 raises our fuel economy standards, stimulates energy efficiency, and allows the development of exciting clean energy technologies, such as the language I wrote to stimulate the development of geothermal energy technologies. New geothermal energy technologies have the potential to generate vast amounts of clean, domestically produced electricity, and we should begin research immediately. I support H.R. 6.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the chairman and the ranking member of the Veterans Committee and all members of the Veterans Committee for working together to provide our veterans with the services that they need. 
   The Veterans Administration health care system does, in most cases, provide outstanding health care to our Nation's veterans. Yet, as the brave men and women from our Armed Forces return home from Iraq and Afghanistan, we are seeing additional demands already being placed on the VA. Those demands include addressing the hallmark injuries of these conflicts, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. 
   These conditions are often the root causes behind the large numbers of soldiers who have attempted or contemplated suicide. The Defense Department estimates that 114 Iraqi and Afghanistan veterans have already committed suicide, and that one out of every 100 veterans has considered suicide. We must quickly address this problem by equipping the caregivers at our VA facilities nationwide with the ability to recognize and prevent these needless tragedies. 
   I strongly support H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act. It directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicides among veterans. It trains VA staff to recognize the symptoms of PTSD and suicidal thoughts. It monitors veterans who receive medical care in the VA system for suicide risk factors. It provides for suicide prevention counselors at each medical facility, so that when the veterans need help they can get it immediately. And it establishes a suicide hot line for veterans to call. 
   Our brave men and women in uniform have served this Nation with honor. We  owe them more than a debt of gratitude. We must also provide them with the support and care they need to return to a healthy and productive civilian life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the war in Iraq. 
   Let me explain a little bit what happens to a veteran soldier with a traumatic brain injury. They remove part of your skull so that your brain can expand into that while it's swelling up. They give you blood thinners so that you don't have blood clots. They give you antibiotics, and they put on a vest that keeps your body temperature cold, again so that you don't swell up and cause more injury. So this is the kind of thing that these veterans, these soldiers are going through. 
   And we estimate that there's approximately 12,000 servicemembers with some degree of traumatic brain injury. That's why I was motivated, along with Mr. Boozman from Arkansas, to introduce the Caring for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2007. 
   H.R. 2199 ensures that the VA will develop the infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of an increasing number of veterans diagnosed with TBI. Among other things, the bill requires the VA to screen all veterans for TBI. It creates a registry for veterans with TBI so that we don't lose track of them once they're diagnosed, and it also creates transition offices for patients with TBI who live in areas where the Veterans Administration isn't able to meet their needs. 
   I'm thankful for the leadership of Mr. Michaud and Mr. Filner on this issue, and for the opportunity to speak in favor of 2199.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I am proud to support H. Res. 917, and I thank my colleague Mr. LIPINSKI for introducing this resolution. As a mathematician who spent much of my career working as a renewable energy engineer, I am particularly honored to advocate for the passage of this legislation. H. Res. 917 supports the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week, a valuable opportunity to recognize the importance of the work engineers perform. 
   Engineers are responsible for many of the vital technological breakthroughs that improve the quality of life for Americans and people around the globe. American engineers and businesses lead the world in innovation, but unfortunately we are no longer producing as many engineers as our international competitors. Without a sustained national effort to train a new generation of engineers, our country is at risk of losing our competitive edge. 
   I am proud of the work of the 110th Congress to reinvest in the science, technology, engineering, and math education programs that will train the next generation of American engineers. In addition, the America COMPETES Act, which was passed last summer, is a signature bipartisan achievement that marks a major milestone for science, technology, engineering, and math education in our country. More work remains to be done, however, and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in a bipartisan effort to support engineering in America.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of H. Res. 326, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
   It is important to recognize the contributions of our men and women in the armed services no matter when they served. In particular, we should pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice during their service. 
   Although the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated nearly 25 years ago, the families of the fallen and their fellow soldiers find the same peace and solace there today. The memorial is a somber reminder of the devastating human costs of the Vietnam war and the massive losses this country sustained. 
   Mothers and fathers lost their children, and families throughout the country lost their loved ones. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a serene place that helps the country deal with one of the most difficult periods of our history, and it is important that we recognize such a lasting tribute. 
   Today, when we remember the Vietnam war, we should not forget the soldiers who laid down their lives in defense of this great Nation. Nor should we forget those who returned home with posttraumatic stress disorder. 
   As we reflect upon the commitment of our veterans from past conflicts, it is important to remember the 168,000 American soldiers currently serving overseas. We must do more for our Nation's veterans, those of past wars, current conflicts, and those who will defend our flag for generations to come. 
   We should never forget the deep sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and it is fitting that we pause today to commemorate one of the most important and emotional events in our history. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And first I want to say thank you personally for everything you have done for this institution and for this Nation. The kind of  leadership you are showing tonight has been shown over and over throughout your 3 1/2 years in the Congress, and I look forward to that kind of leadership in the future. 
   I want to say a few things about posttraumatic stress. The marital problems diagram that we saw earlier is a shocking example of the kind of thing that we are seeing throughout society as a result of this conflict. It turns out that about one in five of our soldiers that returns from Iraq is suffering from a serious form of posttraumatic stress. And that correlates very well with the numbers we are seeing in the graph: About 20 percent of divorce in the current year, 27 percent of other problems, 15 percent of infidelity. So we know that those numbers are about right. And this is exacerbated by having extended tours, by staying there longer than 12 months, and by going back repeatedly. And we know now that only about half of the servicemembers who are suffering from posttraumatic stress and veterans are receiving the right kind of treatment or are receiving any kind of treatment or have sought treatment.     
   We know that only about half of those that are looking for treatment are getting the kind of treatment they need. So only about 5 percent of the veterans really are getting the kind of treatment that they need on that. 
   We really do owe the veterans of the country that have served, that have volunteered in this day and age to serve our country, to go to a conflict region, knowing that their lives are in danger, that they could end up with post-traumatic stress, that it is going to be harmful on their families, nonetheless they volunteered to serve our country, to protect our freedom and fight for us back home. No matter how you feel about the war and any of those political issues, we should all agree that we owe our veterans for what they have done for our country. 
   You are finding throughout this Congress, the 110th Congress, that we have made a collective decision to do what we can for the veterans. We have increased the VA budget by $8 billion over the previous year. And that is significant. That is great, but we still need to do a lot more, and we are moving in that direction. 
   Today in the Veterans' Affairs Committee we had some bills on the GI bill for the 21st century which are an extension of the Montgomery GI bill, a terrific advancement to give our veterans the kind of education that they need to be productive members of our society. 
   That money is very, very well spent. I have heard oftentimes that for every dollar we invest in education for our veterans, we get paid back ten-fold. You can see that as a true indication of what happened after World War II. The veterans came back from World War II, and they were given a terrific GI bill, and they have contributed to our society in so many ways in terms of developing our infrastructure, in terms of raising our national stature. And we want to make sure that the veterans coming back from Iraq today have those same opportunities to contribute in other ways than just participating in the war. 
   With regard to the Iraq war, a specific type of injury is the hallmark or signature of this war, that is the traumatic brain injury. Before in earlier conflicts those kind of injuries, a serious form of traumatic brain injury resulted in death. Today they know how to treat that injury. I will give you sort of a graphic explanation. If that is going to be offensive, you better turn off the sound for a little while. 
   Basically in a serious form of traumatic brain injury, you get a bullet or shrapnel lodged in the brain, and what happens is your brain begins to swell from the injury. And so unless that swelling is dealt with very soon after the injury, the subject will die. So what they do in the field now is they open up a large section of your skull. They remove the skull itself and embed that into your GI territory to keep that skull viable so it can be reattached later on. In this situation the brain is allowed to swell, and they will have this proceed for about a month. During that time they need to put you in a cold surrounding. They put a cold jacket on you so you are shivering in your bed for about a month. They keep you on medication to keep the swelling down. When the swelling eventually goes down, they will reattach the skull and let you heal. 
   Another problem is when you have this sort of injury, you are very susceptible to reinjure that, to swell it after they have removed the shrapnel if they can or the bullet. You are very susceptible, so you have to be very careful a year or longer after this kind of injury. 
   We had a young man from my district, from the town of Manteca. It is a small town of about 60,000 people. He was a Navy corpsman and he was serving in Iraq and their convoy was attacked. He was servicing marines that were injured, and a piece of shrapnel was embedded into his brain. It went in through his eye and he lost his eye. He went through the treatment, and then they brought him back to Bethesda, Maryland. I visited him there a couple of times. This is a very long recovery. The young man is doing fine. He is back home now. 
   I can tell you the town of Manteca where he grew up and lived and went to church really came together for him. They had a dinner when he was still in Bethesda. About 300 people came out to the dinner to contribute and to show their support for this young man. It was a terrific outpouring of community and faith and love. It was a terrific thing to be representing this kind of town and this kind of a district where people come together in that sort of way for one of their own. 
   And then when he did come home, the church that he went to, they had a gathering. About a thousand people showed up, and he was there receiving accolades and welcome and love from the entire community. I can tell you, it is a terrible thing to see. Unfortunately, a lot of our young men and women who come back from Iraq don't have that strong of a community. We need to make sure that we provide them, through treatments and efforts to integrate them back into society, to educate them, that they get that sort of opportunity and that they receive the kind of reward that they should for the kind of service and sacrifice that they have made. 
   With that, I yield back to Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and thank you for your leadership.

   Mr. Speaker, we've heard a lot of different aspects of the stress of this war on our soldiers, from the families and the children, to the men and women serving. 
   One thing we haven't talked about is financial stress, and we know that veterans, especially guardsmen and women and reservists when they go overseas, they're particularly vulnerable to foreclosure; and just today in the Veteran's Affairs Committee, we did pass a significant Veterans Housing Authority bill that will be available to those young men and women coming up in the next month or two. 
   So we're working at all parts of this problem and finding ways to help the veterans through the crises that they're going to be facing upon return, and we welcome them back. This country loves our veterans, and we want to do everything we can for them

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I am very honored to be part of the historic 110th Congress. 
   It is entirely appropriate that the incoming Congress is making ethics reform one of its first acts. This issue is personally important to me and to all of Californians. 
   We need to provide Congress with a fresh start and improve the strained relations that exist between voters and elected officials. Members of Congress should be held in the highest regard by the people they represent, and the ethics changes will help repair years of damage. We must reestablish positive relationships with everyone we serve, and end this period of mistrust in our government. 
   Traveling throughout our State of California, I heard from many people who simply want to believe and trust in their elected officials, and today we are sending the message that we feel the same way. 
   I am confident also that this will be the first of very many steps that will take back trust and civility in Congress, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the ethics package.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, today is a landmark day for our country's path towards energy indepence, and I would like to thank my colleagues and the committees that have worked so hard to make enactment of this forward-thinking legislation possible. H.R. 3221, the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act, marks a major step towards a secure, sustainable energy future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am fortunate to serve on three committees that contributed significantly to the bill we are considering, and I have seen the tremendous collaboration that went into the creation of this comprehensive legislation. And as someone who has spent more than two decades working with wind energy and other forms of new energy technologies, I am particularly proud of our work here today. 
   Not only is the energy package we are debating today good for our environment and good for our security, it is also good for our economy. Estimates are that clean energy technology could create almost half a million new jobs--an entire spectrum of good-paying American jobs. 
   In addition, I am pleased that my bill, H.R. 2304, the Advanced Geothermal Energy Research and Development Act, has been included in this energy package. Geothermal energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, and it has the potential to generate vast amounts of clean electricity. 
   Geothermal, which utilizes the earth's natural heat, provides constantly-available baseload power, not limited by factors such as sunlight or wind conditions. Additionally, geothermal energy is 100 percent domestically produced--truly helping to lead our Nation to energy independence. 
   To extract geothermal energy today, engineers must tap into pre-existing water reservoirs near the surface. However, recent research indicates that new geothermal resources called Enhanced Geothermal Systems, or EGS, could greatly expand geothermal use and potentially generate as much as 100 gigawatts of power in the next half century. That is enough clean, environmentally friendly energy, to power 75 million homes. 
   EGS is in the early stages of development, and H.R. 2304, which has been incorporated into the bill we are debating today, authorizes Federal assistance for the research and development needed to make EGS both technically feasible and economic. 
   I would request that all of my colleagues join me in supporting the energy package before us today.

   When the National Academies report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' was presented to Congress, it painted a sobering picture of how dependent America's economy is on an educated public and how easily we could fall behind the rest of the world. Thankfully, the report also provides specific recommendations on how to increase educational achievement, which is the backbone of our economy. 
   As a mathematician and an engineer, I understand clearly the advantage of having a STEM education. This COMPETES Act will spur the creation of high-quality jobs and ensure that American companies won't have to look overseas for talented employees. 
   Again, I thank the chairman. I thank the ranking member.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, last night President Bush accepted responsibility for the failures in Iraq. Yet he offered no real strategy for winning the war in Iraq or the broader struggle with terrorism. 
   Many military and foreign policy experts, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have acknowledged that the President's proposal to increase troop strength is not a solution to the ongoing instability in Iraq. 
   I believe that an influx of troops will actually worsen the situation on the ground. Not only that, but redeploying 20,000 additional troops in Iraq will stretch our already fully deployed Armed Forces even further. 
   I am particularly concerned that deploying additional troops will significantly hinder our ability to effectively combat the global terrorist threat. In fact, the very consideration of redeploying troops in Iraq means that we are distracted from the wider war on terrorism, especially in Afghanistan where additional forces may be necessary to rein in al Qaeda and the Taliban.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the bribery and corruption charges against Congressman Jefferson are serious. They go to the very heart of our ability as a representative government to do its job. It is fundamental that the people trust their elected representatives to act in the people's interest, not in their own. The very appearance that these allegations create is damaging to the image of this institution. 
   In the coming days, Congressman Jefferson will answer in a court of law to the 16 charges on which he was indicted. Congressman Jefferson is entitled to the presumption of innocence in the allegations against him, including bribery, racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. 
   However, the Congress should be held to the highest standards. Earlier today, I called for the Ethics Committee to initiate its own investigation into the charges against Congressman Jefferson. 
   I support this resolution which calls for the automatic initiation of an Ethics Committee investigation when a Member of this body is indicted or formally charged with criminal conduct. This principle applies not just to Congressman Jefferson but to any Member of this House. 
   In the opening days of this Congress, I rose on the floor in support of a tough new ethics package.     
   I said then that Members of Congress should be held to the highest regard by the people they represent. Illegal, unethical or inappropriate conduct by Members of the House cannot be tolerated. 
   I was elected to this Congress to help change the way we do business in Washington, and I will continue to do so without regard to person or party.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on commonsense legislation to extend the production tax credit and investment tax credit and pay for it by reducing wasteful subsidies to big oil companies. 
   As an expert in renewable energy, I am confident that this legislation will ease the pain at the pump and allow our economy to create fam ily wage jobs and make America less dependent on foreign oil. 
   The bill we will vote on comes just after the big five oil companies report record profits. Our bill will channel unnecessary funding that goes to oil companies back to the renewable industry where it's greatly needed. I cannot overstate the urgency of extending the production tax credit and the investment tax credit as soon as possible. 
   As with any other form of electrical generation, renewable energy products must adhere to development timelines. And if the schedule of a project is delayed due to uncertainty about the tax credits, a year-long construction cycle will be lost, setting our country further behind foreign competition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to see the importance of this legislation and join us tomorrow in passing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I represent Stockton, California, which unfortunately has the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Many families in northern California have lost their homes and the foreclosures have lead to personal hardships, community instability and national economic risk. 
   When my constituents asked me what Congress was doing to fix the economy, I told them we are pushing to create family-wage jobs and put money back in people's pockets. Today we are building on these efforts by considering legislation that will provide fiscally responsible options for families struggling to stay in their homes. 
   Last December I hosted a workshop for foreclosures in Stockton with my colleague, DENNIS CARDOZA, to provide housing counseling to local families. While we expected the turnout to be high, participants started lining up 2 hours early and, ultimately, more than 500 people showed up. 
   I heard heart-breaking stories from my constituents, and this is just one single illustration of why today's legislation is so important. One of the biggest challenges facing the housing market is in the high-cost States, like California, that housing programs have not kept pace with the times. Unrealistically low limits for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA mean people living in the high-cost States have not fully benefited from these programs. 
   The economic stimulus package, temporary loan limit increase to $730,000, raising the loan limit, injects liquidity into the mortgage market to provide access to credit and opens new opportunities for refinancing. 
   However, since these increases are only temporary, it is clear that making them permanent will have beneficial effects for the housing market. I introduced the Homeowner Opportunity Act to permanently raise the loan limits, and I am pleased that today's legislation includes my bill. 
   I want to thank Chairman Frank for all of his support and assistance. This change will benefit my constituents and the entire country.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the tragedy that occurred today in Minnesota and assure our colleagues from Minnesota and the families of Minnesota victims that we stand in solidarity with them. 
   Thank you, Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for all your hard work to finalize what would be the first WRDA bill to become law since the year 2000. I would also like to thank the staff for their diligence in finalizing the details of this important legislation. 
   Simply put, enactment of this bill is long overdue, not just because we have billions of dollars of water infrastructure projects that desperately need to be completed but because this bill means more jobs throughout the country and each project we undertake provides a net benefit to the economy in terms of improved commerce, new jobs and a cleaner environment. 
   In particular, this bill is vitally important to my State, and the chairman and members of the California delegation know all too well that much of Northern California that I represent is held together by a fragile web of 100-year-old levees with varying degrees of stability. As a source of drinking water for 25 million Californians, the mix of natural and manmade channels in the San Joaquin Delta need constant oversight and perpetual maintenance to remain functional. 
   Of particular importance is a flood protection project near the city of Morgan Hill in my district that improves the Llagas Creek, a waterway that runs several miles through Morgan Hill south to Gilroy. I'm very pleased that we are correcting a jurisdictional issue in this legislation that stopped the Corps from completing work on Llagas Creek for years. Specifically, we are now directing the Corps to complete the Llagas Creek. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a conference member on this legislation, I want the Record to indicate that the Llagas Creek project is meant to be completed under the national directive language we included in the bill and under the cost-sharing ratio we have explicitly included in H.R. 1495. 
   I'm hopeful the Corps will expeditiously complete the project so the residents of Morgan Hill can rest easy in the knowledge that we're protecting them from periodic flood damage.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to thank my good friend and colleague from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), the sponsor of this resolution, which recognizes the invaluable contributions of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL. The gentleman from Colorado and I both share deep concern about our Nation's dependence on imported oil and the impact that fossil fuels have on our environment. 
   As someone who has worked at the national laboratory, I have spent many years at the laboratory working as an engineer, a consultant, and I certainly appreciate the work that NREL does. Tucked in the foothills of the Rockies and looking up to the scenic Flatirons, NREL has led the charge in developing and deploying cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies for three decades. I have been continually impressed by the caliber of work that this laboratory has put out over the years. 
   New energy technology takes time to develop. It's a long, difficult process, but we have seen tremendous advances. For example, in wind energy we have seen it come from an outlying technology to where now it's one of the leading sources of new energy in the world. We can expect other forms of energy technology such as solar, geothermal, and energy efficiency technologies to follow that same trajectory to becoming cost-effective and competitive with all other forms of energy. 
   The experts at NREL have played a critical role in developing a range of technologies that will transform our energy future. NREL scientists and engineers have made breakthroughs in such diverse areas as biofuels, wind, solar power, near zero-energy buildings, and super efficient cars and trucks. 
   As our country works to combat climate change and achieve energy independence, NREL's mission is more important than ever. But staying ahead of the technology curve requires considerable resources and very smart policymaking. I am sure that the dedicated employees of NREL share my appreciation for this resolution and will continue their tireless efforts to bring energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and practices to the marketplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. I have to say, I started my career developing wind energy technology. I got started when I was in college because of a few things that motivated me. We had the oil embargo of 1973. We had exciting technology that was being developed, computer simulations, actual hardware being placed in the field and then tremendous economic promise. 
   What spurred that on was the tax incentives of the 1970s. They gave us the motivation to move forward and to develop these new technologies. I can tell you the first time we put a wind mill together, we brought the investors in, we turned on the machine, and the wind, the blades flew everywhere, we would have had to run for cover, but that was the very start.  
   We kept going, the motivation was there, the economics were there. We kept improving year by year. We improved the aerodynamics, we improved the control system, we improved the mechanical system, the gears. Every bit of that technology and knowledge was improved over a 20-year period until today. We have one of the most economic forms of new energy technology in the world. It's growing by leaps and bounds all over the world, and I think there is a very big parallel to what's happening today. 
   Right now, we have a national security issue. We have very exciting technology taking place all over this great country. There is economic security at stake and now we also have a new element. It's global warming. So the motivation is there. 
   The problem is that the companies can't move forward without long-term planning. Part of that long-term planning is knowing what your rate of return is going to be, and if we don't move forward with production tax credits and investment tax credits, then the investors don't know what to expect, so they are not going to get into the game. 
   This has happened to our country repeatedly over the last 20 years, whereas Europe has kept a very steady plan, a very steady investment incentive, and they are way ahead of us in terms of renewable energy technology in terms of production, in terms of employment. 
   Now it's our turn to catch up. A 5-year extension is just exactly what we need, and I am so happy that the House, I am so proud of the House for coming together and moving forward with this legislation. 
   It's going to keep us competitive, it's going to create jobs throughout our great country in rural areas that have been depressed. It's going to create jobs in cities, in manufacturing, so this is the kind of legislation that I was sent here to produce. This is the kind of legislation that my colleagues all agree with me that is so important to our country, and I think the House did a wonderful job today. 
   It's going to help our country long, long into the future, and it's going to also benefit our national security, as I mentioned before, because we are importing about 11 million barrels of oil per day into this country. That's a tremendous amount of money going overseas. That's a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide going into the air. 
   So we are motivated by national security. We are motivated by economic security, and we are going to fight global warming, and we are going to adapt and we are going to move forward with the new technology, creating the kind of country that we want for our children to live in. 
   My good friend from New York, you look like you are ready to talk.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, over the next few years the renewable energy industry in the United States is poised to create hundreds of thousands of family wage jobs. But none of it will happen, and in fact we will lose jobs if we don't extend the investment and production tax credits for new energy technologies. 
   As someone who spent my entire career in the wind industry, I know firsthand how critical these credits are to increasing renewable energy use and production. These incentives helped to turn wind power into a viable and growing energy option. 
   Just last week, the Department of Energy released a report estimating that wind could provide 20 percent of our Nation's energy by 2030. Renewable energy is now competitive with conventional power. 
   I recently hosted a meeting in my district with the heads of solar and wind energy companies to discuss the potential for employment in the renewable sector. It's clear, with the right Federal incentives, the industry will flourish, and we could see the creation of half a million new energy technology jobs in just the next few years. 
   There's also a flip side. When the production and investment tax credits lapse, there's a devastating consequence for the renewable energy industry. For instance, the last time we didn't extend the production tax credit, the wind industry lost thousands of good paying, green energy jobs all across our country. 
   That's why today's legislation is so important. If we are serious about weaning ourselves off foreign oil, we need to pass the production and investment tax credits today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I represent the city of Stockton, California, which suffers from the highest foreclosure rates in the country. I have seen exactly how devastating this problem is for communities, and more important, for the families in our district. I hear all too often the heartbreaking stories of people struggling to keep up. In fact, Mr. Cardoza, who spoke a minute ago, and I have had foreclosure workshops to provide counseling to help families refinance and stay out of foreclosure. 
   Our current economic crisis, including the housing market meltdown, can financially devastate many people, and we need change right now so that hardworking American families can stay in their homes. We need to reform the system by raising the conforming loan limits and providing critical relief to hardworking families. 
   I strongly believe that we can help provide the breathing room that families need so they not only weather the downturn, but come back stronger than ever.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, this Congress remains committed to forging a new direction in Iraq. Overwhelmingly, the American people support our plan to establish important benchmarks and a responsible timetable to redeploy the troops. 
   Yet, the President has threatened to veto our legislation, even though it ensures our troops have everything they need, and for our veterans when they return home. However, just last week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, and I quote: The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited. 
   Mr. Gates went on to say that the strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive impact on communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment. To ensure that the Iraqis step up and take control of their own country, we must continue to demonstrate that the American people will not stand for an open-ended commitment of American resources or personnel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong bipartisan support of H.R. 363, Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research. Before my election to Congress, I spent my entire academic and professional career as a scientist, as a mathematician and an engineer. 
   I was particularly concerned when I read the sobering conclusions of the National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' about America's declining competitiveness in a science and technology-based global economy. The report calls for an immediate action to maintain America's competitive advantage, and I agree with those recommendations. 
   We are already moving forward to carry out some of the report's recommendations in an effort to renew interest in scientific development. H.R. 363 will provide grants to support young researchers in the early stages of their careers to engage in the high-risk, high-reward innovative research that challenges existing assumptions. The bill also establishes a Presidential Innovation Award to stimulate scientific and engineering advances in the public interest. 
   As a Nation, we face many daunting and almost overwhelming challenges, the solutions to which will require serious and dedicated scientific research. Conclusive research can take years, so we must work now to inspire today's students and researchers to take up such scientific pursuits. This bill provides just the right kind of specific incentives to compel young researchers to do the kind of pioneering and groundbreaking research that will yield dividends for the public interest.

   Unfortunately, too few of our undergraduates are choosing to enter  science-related fields. In order to continue our remarkable record of achievement, we must do a better job of encouraging students to pursue careers in science, mathematics and engineering. This amendment will provide scholarships for science students from low- and moderate-income families, and will help young Americans realize their potential.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (EARTH DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, all over the world, concerned citizens are coming together to celebrate the 38th annual anniversary of Earth Day. Since its inception in 1970, Earth Day has become an international call to action on behalf of the environment, and I am proud to offer this resolution in support of the goals and ideals of Earth Day. 
   We are constantly reminded of the serious environmental challenges that our country and our world are facing. The greatest challenge, global warming, continues to grab headlines, as it should. We are already feeling the effects of a heating planet, and it is long past time for our country to get serious about climate change. 
   Global warming is a serious threat, but also presents an opportunity and strong motivation to develop the clean energy economy of the future. I spent much of my career before entering Congress as a renewable energy engineer, and I have seen firsthand the development and evolution of the clean technologies that combat climate change. We have much of the scientific knowledge and technical capability to attack climate change head on, but there is still more progress to be made. 
   Today, Earth Day is an important opportunity to rededicate ourselves, both as individuals and as a Nation, to making the best use of the resources available to us. I want to commend the scientists, engineers, businesspeople, and educators who are working to develop the clean economy of the future, as well as the millions of Americans who are taking action to live greener lifestyles. I believe today is an important opportunity to honor the contributions toward a healthy planet. 
   Earth Day is also an important opportunity to look forward to a greener tomorrow. We should renew our efforts to push ahead with research and development of the cutting edge, environmentally friendly technologies of the future, as well as the many smart policies that will preserve our environment. Confronting great environmental challenges will require technological innovation, as well as a forward-thinking public policy. I believe we are up to the task. 
   As important as combating climate change is, Earth Day also reminds us of the other crucial environmental issues of our time. We need to preserve our precious natural resources, and to do that, we have to maintain our national lands, protect biodiversity, ensure clean air for everybody, and make smart investments in environmental cleanup efforts. These are important legislative opportunities before us, and I hope that we will embrace the chance to preserve our treasured landscapes. I am optimistic about our environmental future. Looking forward, I see an America that runs on clean sources of energy and supports a wide spectrum of family wage green energy jobs. I see an America where environmentally sustainable building practices are the norm, not the exception. And I see an America where our most beautiful landscapes are protected for our children and grandchildren. 
   I commend the organizers of Earth Day and the millions of people around the globe who are participating in Earth Day events today. Your dedication is admirable, and I am confident that environmental awareness and activism will continue to flourish. I am also inspired by the grassroots commitment to environmental protection that Earth Day embodies, and I look forward to celebrating many more Earth Days in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the goals and ideals of Earth Day. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I have been all around this great Nation and I have seen the environment change from the 1970s until the present day. When Earth Day was first declared, we had lakes that were catching on fire and we had pollution running in our rivers. We have seen tremendous progress. Our lakes and rivers are much cleaner now and our air is breathable, although it still needs progress, we still need work. 
   The great thing about looking forward with the environment is that we can create jobs, we can make America prosperous. When we trash the environment, everyone gets poorer. We want an America that is prosperous. We want an America that we are proud to pass on to our next generation. 
   Earth Day has been a big part of this. It deserves to be commended and recognized. It is bipartisan. Everybody drinks the same water and breathes the same air. So it is an issue that I think we have broad support on both sides of the aisle. I certainly have support back home in California, and I know that as I go around the country, I see the same level of interest, both in the environment and creating clean jobs and ending our dependence on foreign oil. These are all national security issues. They are issues that are great for our Nation. They are issues that we want to work for, and part of the reason I am here in Congress. 
   So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, the American Institute of Mathematics, MIT, Cornell University, University of Michigan, University of Utah, and the University of Maryland together created a mathematical breakthrough this week made possible by congressional support of the National Science Foundation. 
   The breakthrough involves defining the detailed structure of a geometric object called E8, the largest of the exceptional Lie groups used to study symmetry. E8, one of the most complicated structures ever studied, is a 248-dimensional Lie group used to explore the symmetries of a 57-dimensional object. Mapping out such an object is a magnificent achievement of the human mind. 
   Connections between E8 and string theory indicate that physical applications of E8 will eventually emerge. 
   The participants are to be commended for their work that has expanded the limits of human knowledge and brings hitherto unknown beauty and power to grace our human condition.

<DOCNO>Mr. McNERNEY. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Chairman, since the terrible events of September 11, 2001, we have relied heavily on the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard to be our eyes and ears against terrorism along our coastal borders and at more than 300 of our Nation's ports. 
   The Coast Guard's homeland security mission isn't new. It began more than  200 years ago when the service was founded. Yet, today, we are more focused on the need to provide maritime security. The Coast Guard has ramped up its efforts to ensure that we don't allow people into this country who intend to do us harm or weapons to unleash upon us. 
   We have improved our ability to deal with potential terrorist threats, but we must keep up the progress. America's security is our paramount responsibility, and our goals must be always to counteract threats against our citizens, address the dangers posed by terrorists, and eliminate the potential for introduction of weapons of mass destruction. 
   My congressional district is home to the Port of Stockton, one of the largest inland ports in the Nation. While it is an economic engine for California's Central Valley, moving everything from agricultural products to wind turbines, it may be viewed as a potential entry point for those who intend to do us harm. Thankfully, the Coast Guard understands the risk and provides constant security that insures continued business and peace of mind. 
   I believe that it's important to highlight the dual responsibilities of the Coast Guard, and we should ensure that the Coast Guard's homeland security missions are not lessened by the licensing and regulatory functions of the Guard. 
   My amendment is both simple and needed. It outlines formally that none of the changes to the marine safeguard mission of the Coast Guard shall impair in any way, the homeland security mission of the Coast Guard. It is important to note that we are not creating new authorizations. We are simply outlining formally the continued importance of protecting our waterways and ports, maintaining coastal security, and securing our borders against aliens seeking to unlawfully enter the United States. 
   Americans deserve to know that our ports and waterways are protected. This amendment does just that by clarifying the Coast Guard's homeland security missions are strengthened by the legislation we are doing today. 
   I consider all of my colleagues support for this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

The United States Merchant Mariners have supported and served alongside our Armed Forces in every major seafaring conflict since the birth of this Nation. 
   In times of peace, Mariners make the seas their home, transporting American goods all over the world and bolstering our national economy. In times of war, from the Revolutionary War to the conflicts today in the Middle East, Merchant Mariners have served as a lifeline to our international military operations, transporting troops, equipment, and needed supplies to theaters of operation. 
   The dedication and sacrifice of our Merchant Mariners is unassailable. Despite higher casualty rates than any branch of regular military service in World War II, Merchant Mariners have continued to answer the call to war with unflinching patriotism and valor. 
   Today, National Maritime Day, we should take time to reflect on the devotion of all our Merchant Mariners and the deep and lasting debt owed them by a grateful Nation. 
   Therefore, it is with great pride that I honor the service and sacrifice that the brave men and women of the United States Merchant Marine exemplify, on this, the 75th celebration of National Maritime Day.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, we are in a housing crisis that has led to instability and increases in criminal activity that is destroying our communities. While some people took out risky loans that they could not afford, many were caught up in exaggerated promises and the predatory lending practices that blossomed in recent years. 
   Stockton, California, in my congressional district, is unfortunately at the center of it all. One out of every 31 homes in Stockton faces foreclosure--the highest rate in the country. 
   While there is no magic bullet to solve the problems in the housing market, the bill we are voting on today is an important part of our nation's comprehensive response to the surge in foreclosures. 
   We are establishing common-sense homebuyer protections to ensure that responsible real estate professionals can provide safe mortgage products.

   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, in my district, the city of Stockton, California and surrounding San Joaquin County are the very epicenter of the growing national home mortgage crisis. San Joaquin County has the second highest level of foreclosures in the country. Nearly one out of 50 homes is being repossessed. Stockton has the highest foreclosure rate of any United States city, and this is tearing our communities apart. To add insult to injury, former homeowners who lost money when their houses were sold, have to pay taxes on their losses. And  those able to negotiate for a reduction in the amount they owe are forced to pay taxes on this amount. 
   This doesn't make sense. Thankfully, the legislation we're voting on today will eliminate this phantom tax and provide some breathing room for people in financial crisis. 
   I strongly support this bill.

   Mr. McNERNEY. I thank my friend from Minnesota. 
   Madam Speaker, the President turned his back on about 10 million American children that he could have protected. I am actually appalled by this decision to veto funding for children's health insurance, and his rejection of support from nearly every U.S. Governor and almost three-quarters of the American people. 
   The Children's Health Insurance Program is a good program. It is worthy and efficient. It costs less than $3.50 per day per child.     
   However, rather than protecting our children, this President put at risk nearly 45,000 of the children in my district and millions of children across the United States. As the cost of health care continues to rise, which it will, it's reckless to oppose a plan that covers our country's most needy children. 
   Let me tell you what I'm talking about in more personal terms. It's going to cost a family of four about $750 a month for health insurance. That's about $9,000 a year. If you're earning $45,000, you have a family of four, $9,000 is completely out of reach, and this follows on my good friend from Wisconsin. 
   You have to pay for gasoline, you have to pay for your car, for your transportation, about $1,000 to $2,000 for your mortgage. How on Earth are you going to be able to afford $9,000 a year for health insurance? You're going to be forced to take your children to the emergency rooms when their situations are critical. 
   So the Children's Health Insurance Program is very important. It's needed. Our children need to have that.

   The President's budget is fiscally reckless, adding $1.6 trillion in deficit over the next 5 years instead of becoming balanced over that same period. But you won't hear that from the President. He claims that the budget is balanced by 2012, but that is only because he leaves out enormous costs, including the 5-year cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the full cost of the Iraq war. 
   When realistic costs are included, the budget runs into significant deficits over each of the next 5 years. This, unfortunately, is more of the same. The President took a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion that he inherited and turned it into a $3.6 trillion deficit. This budget continues down the same path by borrowing from our children and grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairmen Oberstar and Johnson and Ranking Members Mica and Baker for their leadership on clean water issues and for their work to bring the legislation we are considering today to the floor. In addition, I would like to thank my colleague and good friend, Mrs. Tauscher, for supporting this legislation with me. Mrs. Tauscher and I have adjoining districts in California, and we have similar water needs. 
   My bill, H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, is straightforward and helpful legislation that I hope both parties will support. 
   Everyone recognizes the need for clean water. It does not matter whether you live in a city or in the rural, it does not matter what your political persuasion is. We all need clean water. Therefore, it is vitally important to identify new water sources for use in agriculture, industry and for residential consumption. 
   In the past, the State Revolving Loan Funds and Clean Water Act construction grants were available for identifying new water sources. But communities now increasingly depend on those funds just to provide for the maintenance and upkeep of existing water infrastructure, rather than finding new and potentially less expensive water supplies. 
   H.R. 700 will provide $125 million so that local governments can innovate to collect, clean and distribute new sources of water. The Healthy Communities Water Supply Act will encourage municipalities, public and private water agencies and nonprofit organizations to find ways to provide new sources of water. 
   For the small investment of Federal funding provided in this bill, we can spur innovation in water resources and move towards solving the increasingly pressing need to ensure clean water for drinking, for family farms, for businesses and for households. 
   H.R. 700 encourages innovation by funding pilot projects and forward-thinking ideas that lead to practical solutions, which can be applied across the board. This legislation means jobs in local communities by spurring the kind of research that can create new businesses and make our towns and cities more livable at the same time. 
   The constant threat of drought in the Western States, along with the reality of global warming, emphasizes why the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007 is so important. We must begin to investigate alternative water sources now, so that we can make strides in ensuring that we have water that we need in the future. 
   I am hopeful that we can move quickly to pass H.R. 700 and to work with the other body so we can provide water relief for our communities. 
   Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act.
