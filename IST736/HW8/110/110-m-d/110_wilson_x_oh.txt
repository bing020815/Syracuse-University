<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (HOUSE PASSES COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING BILL THAT WILL STRENGTHEN HOUSING MARKET AND ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, last week this House passed comprehensive legislation that will assist homeowners facing foreclosure and help strengthen the housing market and our overall economy. 
   This bill will help significant numbers of hardworking American families in danger of losing their home refinance into lower cost government-insured mortgages, and we can do this at no cost to the American taxpayer. 
   The bill also helps neighborhoods hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis by providing resources to allow cities and States to buy up and rehabilitate foreclosed properties. Today, these properties are driving down home prices, reducing State and local revenues, and destabilizing neighborhoods. 
   Madam Speaker, we simply cannot revitalize the economy without addressing our Nation's housing crisis. Last week, the Democratic Congress once again acted on the real challenges facing the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS SOMETHING THE ENTIRE CONGRESS SHOULD SUPPORT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, last week the House and Senate passed a bill ensuring that 10 million low-income children have access to the quality health care coverage they need to live healthy and productive lives. 
   Democrats and Republicans alike worked together to do what was right for our Nation's children. This bipartisan agreement will strengthen the SCHIP program over the next 5 years by ensuring that an additional 4 million low-income children receive access to health care coverage they desperately need. 
   At a time when the number of uninsured children is increasing, we need to do more, more to ensure that they have access to quality health care, and that is what this bipartisan agreement does. 
   Despite strong bipartisan support here in Congress, President Bush is threatening to veto this bill. Instead, he favors a plan that would take health care coverage away from needy children. A million children would lose health insurance coverage. He should reconsider his veto threat and support our bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5818. As a Member from Ohio, one of the States that has been hardest hit by foreclosures, I know how important it is for us to pass this bill. 
   Thirty-six percent of all the homeowners in Ohio will feel the effects of what's going on in the subprime crisis. The pain isn't limited to just the families losing their homes, but also the neighbors and the neighborhood around. What happens is homeowners are projected to each lose as much as $2,000 in property value during this crisis. And because of that, the State of Ohio will lose approximately $3 billion in tax base. These are truly scary numbers. 
   H.R. 5818 will help Ohio and America begin to heal. The flexible bill will give loans and grants directly to the States. States will then be able to clean up the blight, help families stay in their homes, and rehabilitate long vacant and decrepit homes. States will be able to stabilize their entire neighborhoods that are hurting from foreclosures.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Chair, today the administration says that our economy is moving. And in my section of eastern Ohio, it is moving, it is moving overseas. The middle class of our country is being left behind. It is time for some much needed fairness and relief to what is going on in our labor movement. 
   Madam Chair, the Employee Free Choice Act is a step in the right direction. The facts speak for themselves: Workers who belong to unions earn an average of 30 percent more than ones who do not belong. Union workers are also much more likely to have health care and pension benefits and a better opportunity in life. 
   As our middle class continues to feel the squeeze, it is time that we give workers a fair chance for representation and the benefits they deserve. Right now that isn't happening. The current system is broken. Workers are often denied the right that they need to form a union. Those who take part in legal organizing activities are often  punished. Some even lose their jobs. The Employee Free Choice Act also cuts through the red tape and delays.  
   Finally, Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act puts into place another important common sense measure. It provides workers with union representation when a majority of those workers have signed up for union representation. This option doesn't eliminate the existing ``secret ballot'' election process. It just gives workers another choice in how to select a union. 
   Madam Chairman, our middle class is hurting. Costs for basic needs like health care and transportation are climbing, but wages are not keeping up. The Employee Free Choice Act helps open up important opportunities for working families, and it brings balance to a system that sorely needs it.

   I rise basically to support my colleagues for introducing this important and long overdue rules package. This sets the tone for a more open and ethical Congress. In addition to other changes, the resolution creates important pay-as-you-go rules to clean up our fiscal house. 
   As a successful business owner, I learned the importance of balancing the books. If I hadn't, I would not have been successful in business. Our government needs to live by the same rule, and I join my fellow Blue Dogs to push PAYGO as part of the solution to the problems we are experiencing today.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6063, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008. 
   Since the beginning of flight, my home State of Ohio has played a critical role in the aerospace industry. From Wilbur and Orville Wright and the invention of the airplane, to the first American-manned orbital mission by Senator John Glenn, to Neil Armstrong's famous walk on the Moon--Ohioans have been instrumental in maintaining the United States leadership in space. 
   Fifty years after the creation of NASA, Ohio continues to play an important role in the aerospace industry. Ohio's NASA Glenn facility pioneered the use of liquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel--enabling astronauts to reach the Moon. And today, NASA Glenn is working to build cutting-edge vehicles that will one day send a new generation of explorers to the Moon and Mars. 
   NASA's economic impact in Ohio is deep and far-reaching. Today, Ohio's aerospace industry includes 600 companies and employs more than 66,000 Ohioans each year. 
   It is clear that NASA provides significant benefits to the American people. That's why I am proud to support H.R. 6063. It is a fiscally responsible bill that works to ensure that NASA has the resources it needs to successfully conduct a balanced set of missions in human spaceflight, science, and aeronautics. 
   This bill recognizes that NASA is an important contributor to the Nation's innovation agenda and builds on the provisions included in last year's ``America COMPETES Act.'' H.R. 6063 includes provisions that will provide our Nation's next generation of engineers and scientists with the hands-on training and education they need to advance our space program. 
   Madam Chairman, on the 50th anniversary of the U.S. space program and the establishment of NASA, I urge my colleagues in joining with me in supporting this important bill. 
   Mr. CALVERT, Madam Chairman, I commend Subcommittee Chairman Udall, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Members Hall and Feeney and their staff for their work on this bipartisan bill. It is most appropriate that we recommit our Federal support and investment to  our Nation's civilian space and aeronautics agency during this 50 anniversary year. 
   NASA has been the Nation's leading catalyst for innovation and technology based on 50 years of broad public support and strong bipartisan political leadership. The agency's work is linked to larger issues like national security, global warming, and American competitiveness. This valuable research is also the genesis of tens of thousands of high-tech jobs in America and millions of dollars into our economy. 
   H.R. 6063 largely follows in the tradition of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, the first authorization bill to endorse the Vision for Space Exploration which chartered the agency to move beyond low-Earth orbit. 
   I enthusiastically support most measures in this reauthorization including: the reasonable increase in authorization levels which allows the agency to maintain a balanced and robust portfolio of exploration, science and aeronautics activities; the accelerated development of the Orion and Ares launch systems in order to minimize U.S. reliance on Russia for access to the International Space Station; and the full authorization of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, as well as the funding to develop a commercial crew capability under this program. 
   I am somewhat concerned about language that may inappropriately tie the administrator's hands by requiring three shuttle flights; two contingency and one for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, before the fleet's final retirement. I understand why the committee has included the language but I also encourage the Science Committee leadership to work with the NASA administrator to alleviate the outstanding concerns about NASA's ability to properly manage the shuttle fleet and the remaining flight manifest without the mandated flexibility; especially if under unexpected budget and safety constraints. 
   Overall, I am happy to lend my strong support to this reauthorization. I believe it does a comprehensive job of providing NASA the rules and tools to succeed in this Second Space Age. There is not a NASA center in the 44th Congressional District of California, but I understand the criticality of the agency's success and its impact on our Nation's prosperity. I encourage all my colleagues to rediscover the many ways our constituents benefit from the agency's important work. We do not consider this legislation in a vacuum. Other nations are actively pursuing human spaceflight and exploration. China and India are out-producing us in engineering graduates each year many times over. NASA, with its excellent reputation in exploration, science and aeronautics is the one national agency which can focus and inspire America's youth to take up the challenging work of math and science careers. 
   Again, I want to thank the Science Committee leadership and their hard-working staff for their efforts in putting together this bill. I understand it will be important to have a solid civilian space and aeronautics blueprint for the next Administration to follow. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6063.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 76, honoring the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, and would like to take this opportunity to recognize Chairman MARK UDALL for his hard work on this resolution. This resolution marks the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, honors its contributions to space research and looks forward to future accomplishments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958 was a highly successful international effort in involving 67 nations that came together during the Cold War to coordinate global observations and measurements of the solid Earth, the oceans, the atmosphere and the near-Earth space environment. 
   During the IGY, the successful launches of the first artificial satellites took place, Sputnik 1 by the former Soviet Union and Explorer 1 by the United States, marking the dawn of the Space Age. Explorer 1 also enabled one of the most notable achievements of the IGY, the discovery of belts of trapped, charged particles in the Earth's upper atmosphere by the late Dr. James Van Allen of Iowa. 
   This year's commemoration serves not only to remember the great scientific work that was done during the IGY, but also, Mr. Speaker, to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, who will be critical to our continued progress and economic well-being. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 76 encourages the public, in particular our young people, to participate in the celebrations that are planned for this IGY anniversary year and to embrace challenging goals for future research in space science and Earth science. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not mention the activity of the International Polar Year and its 200 approved IPY research efforts, including  studies of environmental changes in the Arctic and marine life in the Arctic Ocean. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 76 and honor this 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. Through future research in Earth, science and space science, including that of the IPY, we have tremendous opportunities for new knowledge and new discoveries, and I hope we can look back 50 years from now on equally exciting accomplishments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation as a government to provide assistance to the men and women who have bravely served our Nation in our military; but once again, President Bush sent us a budget this week that significantly shortchanges veterans health care. 
   While our brave troops are fighting abroad as of right now, the President proposes a $3.5 billion cut in veterans health care over the next 5 years. His budget also provides less than veteran service organizations say is needed to meet the growing needs of veterans, including the fact that we have a growing robust amount of veterans with the Iraq-Afghanistan war. 
   For the fifth year in a row, the budget raises health care costs on 1.3 million veterans, imposing $4.9 million in increased copayments on prescription drugs, and new enrollment fees on veterans over the next 10 years. 
   The budget also increases TRICARE health care premiums for the Nation's military retirees, and includes several other changes in military health care that have been rejected by Congress in previous years. 
   If these proposals are not successful during the 2008 fiscal year, the budget for military health care will continue to be underfunded by at least $1.8 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, America's veterans deserve better, and they will get it from this Democratic House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 252, recognizing the 45th anniversary of John Herschel Glenn, Jr.'s historic achievement in becoming the first United States astronaut to orbit the Earth. 
   This resolution recognizes John Glenn's distinguished career as a military officer in the United States Marine Corps, during which he served in combat in the South Pacific and the Korean conflict and received many honors for his military service, as a test pilot on Navy and Marine Corps jet fighters and attack aircraft, and especially as an astronaut on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, on February 20, 1962, John Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the first U.S. manned orbital space mission, completing three orbits of the  Earth and landing some 5 hours later 800 miles southeast of Kennedy Space Center near Grand Turk Island. With that pioneer flight, John Glenn joined his fellow Americans, Alan Shepard and Virgil Grissom, in realizing the dream of space exploration and engaging the minds and imaginations of his and future generations in the vast potential of space exploration. 
   This resolution recognizes that John Glenn, having retired from the space program, continued his public service as a distinguished Member of the Senate for 24 years and through his work at the John Glenn Institute at the Ohio State University, which fosters public involvement in the policy-making process. 
   In 1998, John Glenn returned to space after 36 years as a member of the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery, helping researchers study how weightlessness affects the body of an older person. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge you and my colleagues to support House Resolution 252, to honor this 45th anniversary of John Herschel Glenn, Jr.'s landmark mission, piloting the first manned orbital mission of the United States, and to recognize the profound importance of his achievement as a catalyst to space exploration and scientific advancement in the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE COMPLETING 100-HOUR AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to comment on the good feeling of having the 100 hours' strong start and the issues that we touched upon. Many have talked about it today, but I believe it was very much an important part of fulfilling our promise to the voters throughout our campaigns in '06 to be able to come here in '07 and make a difference. 
   In less than 100 hours, we were able to move some major legislation, things like prescription drug negotiations with the Health and Human Services Administration, being able to negotiate, which just makes sense. When it is done on everything else that we buy in America, it is actually part of the way business is done, and why there is this protection to keep that from happening, I have no idea. It has been a great opportunity I think to see, and I think it will be a great benefit for seniors. There are so many things that have happened in this 100 hours. And even though the other side says it is not perfect, it is not; but it is certainly a good start. 
   To do something as simple as enacting the 9/11 Commission, to have the recommendations for safety and scanning our containers that go onto our boats and containers that go into our airplanes so that we know that we are not allowing illegal things into our country and things that can hurt us, this is just a really positive move in the right direction; and I believe it is a good one. 
   And the minimum wage, to do that raise for the working families of our country that have been neglected for 10 years, it is the right thing to do. I am so proud to be a part of the minimum-wage increase. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, what we did on energy planning yesterday in stopping the royalties that are being given to the large oil companies that are exhibiting exorbitant profits, and to be able to do something where we can say we are going to work towards energy independence in this country. We are going to look at options and how we can do ethanol. 
   I have an ethanol plant in my State of Ohio that we are trying to get up and running. We want to have alternative fuels. Coal-to-liquid is very exciting. In the Ohio Valley that I represent, we have an abundance of coal, coal that we will be able to use in a liquid plant to be able to produce fuel that could be used by the military. They are working on that contract as we speak. 
   One of the things that I like about the coal-to-liquid process is it is going to be a long-term investment. As leaders in government, we need to provide the leadership that needs to be done because we can't make the investment in coal-to-liquid plants and then have oil go down to $36 a barrel. It has to be a long-term investment for people to invest in it. It has to be an opportunity where we can work toward our energy independence. 
   I believe it is a very significant thing, Mr. Speaker. And to know that, again, it is one of the important things that we have done in this 100 hours. 
   And to know that by reducing the interest on student loans we have provided more students with access to college and higher education, that is what it is about. This is the kind of thing that I believe helps us give people opportunities because so many times we have had bright people who just can't afford to go to higher education. By cutting the loans $4,400 for the average student in their college expense, I think it is a great opportunity. 
   Last but not least, to finish up with the ethics part, to know that we have done something, to shine the light on the ethics that is in this very body, and that we are going to operate a Congress that is going to be above board and we are going to do things right. 
   In our first 100 hours, although it is not perfect, it is certainly a great first step in the right direction.

   Over the past 6 years, the Republican-led Congress has cut critical funding to maintain and restore our national parks and our water infrastructure. This new Democratic Congress is not going to allow them to crumble from neglect. That is why we are making a major investment in upgrading our national parks and our water infrastructure.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the commonsense energy debate that we are going to have today in regard to the bill that we are proposing. Being from the Midwest and from Ohio, I truly believe that our energy costs in Ohio are one of our most significant problems with why we haven't been able to do as much business development as we would like to.  We have the opportunity right now instead of paying royalties to the companies that are providing us with our energy, we can now invest in alternatives ways of finding resources to be able to provide the energy for our people and to stimulate the business growth, especially in Ohio and hopefully in America as well. 
   It is important to realize that we have the opportunities to burn ethanol. I am excited about the fact that certainly in my area we have an abundance of coal, and with clean coal technology we can create more energy. We have the opportunity now, Mr. Speaker, to look at coal-to-liquid fuel as an alternative to lessen our dependency on foreign oil. I truly believe that this is a move in the right direction, Mr. Speaker, and something that will help. I am looking forward to resolving the energy problems of our country.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, American families are facing real hardships as news of the slowing economy continues to make headlines. The latest troubles came with the release of the March job numbers, the fact that 80,000 people lost their jobs last month. This was not only the third straight month of job losses, but it also was the worst in the last 5 years. 
   Clearly, Washington must do more to stimulate the economy and assist middle-class families. Already this year, working in a bipartisan way, the Democratic Congress enacted an economic stimulus package that will give families in real need relief by providing recovery rebates starting this next month, raising loan limits for mortgages, and backing the Federal Housing Administration. 
   This is a good start, but it can't be the end of our efforts to reverse the negative impact of 7 years of failed economic policies.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the President's proposed budget is another step down the long road of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   While this administration's budget claims to reach balance in 2012, in reality, it actually will remain in the red all along those years. After all, over the last 6 years, the Bush administration's fiscal policies have posted the highest deficits in our Nation's history. 
   The administration has squandered the budget surplus it inherited, transforming $5.6 trillion projected surplus into a $2.8 trillion deficit over the same period, completely losing focus of what we need to do in America. 
   Even with this continued deficit, the budget still hurts American families. It proposes substantial cuts to Medicare and Medicaid both. What does this out-of-whack budget really fund? The President's tax cuts for the wealthy, of course. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President has put forth another budget that raises our national debt while cutting vital programs to Americans. His priorities haven't changed. Fortunately, the leadership in this Congress has changed.

   Earlier this year, the President made the same pledge. Unfortunately, earlier this month the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the President's budget and says that it falls short by 2012. Since taking office, this has been a difficult proposed budget. 
   Not only does the President's budget remain in the red for the next 5 years, but he also proposes raising taxes on some of the middle-class families. The President's health care proposal would result in a tax increase of $500 billion over 10 years by increasing taxes on middle-class families who are fortunate to have employer-provided health insurance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, a new report from the Budget and Appropriations Committee says that the new Congress faces a fiscal challenge of historic proportions. The cost of the war in Iraq, coupled with the growing price tag of tax cuts passed over the previous 6 years, have left the Nation deeper in debt than ever before and with one of the largest benefit deficits in the Nation's history. 
   Last year, Democrats committed to begin the process of restoring fiscal sanity by reinstituting a budget rule that helped Congress create a surplus in the 1990s. It is this fiscal discipline that is so important to House Democrats that we restored a pay-as-you-go budget rule on the second day of this new Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, historic debts are not good for any of us. They lead to rising interest rates, which cost middle-class families as much as $1,700 a year on credit card and mortgage payments. It also simply is irresponsible of us to continue to pass this debt on to future generations. 
   Madam Speaker, this week we will pass a final budget for the 2007 fiscal year after Republicans refused to pass these must-pass appropriations bills last year. It's time we get our fiscal house in order.

   After an active and impressive career serving the people of northeastern Ohio, Father McCarthy has retired to St. Paul's Parish in Salem, which is in Ohio's Sixth Congressional District which I represent. As the Sixth District Representative in Congress, I am honored to represent Father McCarthy, and I am also pleased to welcome him here today. 
   While Father McCarthy may have officially retired, he is showing no signs of slowing down. To this day, Father McCarthy remains active in the diocese, where he serves as the Bishop's Delegate for Retired Priests. 
   The people at St. Paul's describe Father McCarthy as a beloved and dedicated member of their close-knit community. They say he is someone who  never hesitates to help someone in need, whether that means making a late-night hospital visit to pray with the sick, or comforting a family member during the death and funeral of a loved one. 
   We are so lucky to have Father McCarthy among us here today in Congress. We are even more fortunate to have his unwavering commitment and faith guiding us each day in the Ohio Valley.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this week the new Democratic House addresses two of our Nation's most important issues, global warming and energy independence. 
   This new Democratic Congress recognizes that we must take wide-ranging action to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and to cut our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our planet, to reduce energy prices, and to boost our economy while strengthening our national security. 
   This week we will bring an Energy and Water funding bill to the floor that makes a significant investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. 
   We invest $51 million more than the President has asked for in our solar energy and more affordable, $70 million more for the development of biofuels, and $59 million more to develop technologies to improve our fuel efficiency. 
   Mr. Speaker, this new Democratic Congress is serious about addressing the issues that have been ignored for far too long. I would hope our energy bill would receive strong bipartisan support this week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, today, for the first time in a decade, America's minimum wage workers are getting a pay raise. 
   The minimum wage increase would never have happened had not congressional Democrats made it one of their top priorities when we came to Capitol Hill at the beginning of this year. 
   During our first 100 hours, House Democrats passed this much-deserved pay raise with the support of 82 congressional Republicans. As health care and groceries and energy and housing costs skyrocket for the average consumer, for many years these needs were ignored for millions of Americans. 
   And every day the minimum wage was not raised, it lost its value. As a matter of fact, the minimum wage was at its lowest level in inflation-adjusted terms since 1955. This is simply not fair, and that's why the new Democratic Congress has made increasing the minimum wage one of its top priorities. And with this increase today, Madam Speaker, Democrats are delivering on the promise that we made to the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues here today saddened by the death of Paul Gillmor. Paul and I took much the same track to come here to Congress in that Paul served diligently for the State of Ohio in the Ohio senate. As a  matter of fact, he and his wife, Karen, both left quite a legacy there and then moved on to Congress. I knew Paul, but through other people, so to speak, until I came to Congress. I can still remember how welcoming he was to me as another Ohio delegate and welcoming me to be here in Congress. I was very comfortable when he, Deborah Pryce and I were the Congress people hosting a banking financial seminar in Columbus not too many months ago, 4, 5 or 6 months ago. It was good to sit with Paul. We sort of chatted in between the time. 
   One of the things that comes to mind about Paul is that he was my sister, Becky's, Congressman. She lives in Henry County in part of his district. She is a yellow dog Democrat, but she loved Paul Gillmor. Just as recently as last night, before we knew any of this had happened, we talked about him at dinner. She said, ``Paul Gillmor always listens to us.'' So she felt very proud of her relationship with her Congressman. 
   I think many people have felt that way about Paul. When this type of thing happens, it shows you the compassion and the feeling among us, as one body, as one set of people representing America. I think that is what makes our country different from others. Paul Gillmor was certainly a perfect example of that. So my heart and my sympathy go out to his wife, Karen, and his five children. Hopefully, they will be able to continue the legacy he has set for the Gillmor family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, Democrats are taking a new direction in America. We realize that restoring the American Dream begins with a great education. Unfortunately, over the last 6 years affording a 4-year college education has become increasingly difficult, especially for the middle class. That is why this Congress is providing the single largest investment in higher education since the creation of the GI Bill. 
   We make college more affordable for all Americans by reducing the cost of student loans and increasing the size of Pell Grants, and we do this all with no new cost to the taxpayers. Our investment in college students would be paid for by reducing the excessive Federal subsidies to the student loan industry.  
   Madam Speaker, this new Democratic Congress is working to help restore the American Dream by opening the doors of a college education to more Americans. We need to all work together to raise all boats.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I welcome my good friend, Monsignor George Coyne, to the Congress this morning. 
   I have known Monsignor Coyne since I was a young boy and he was a student in the seminary. At that time, he was also working for my grandfather in our family business. My entire family came to know him well. Monsignor Coyne set such a good example that his brothers, Jerry and Tim, followed him as employees of our family business. 
   Even back then, Monsignor carried a deep faith and a commitment to serving others in our community, which he has all of his life as a priest. All of these years later, his faith and commitment are more evident than ever. Today, Monsignor Coyne serves the parishioners at two churches in eastern Ohio: Saint Joseph Church in Tiltonsville, and Saint Lucy Church in Yorkville. 
   Just as I have, parishioners at Saint Joseph and Saint Lucy have witnessed Monsignor Coyne's passion firsthand. Today the Congress and the viewers across the Nation have had their chance to see what makes Monsignor Coyne such a special person. For that I am deeply grateful. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Monsignor Coyne for joining us here today and for his years of dedicated service to the people of eastern Ohio.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote on the CHAMP Act, a bill that reauthorizes our Children's Health Insurance Program. This program will provide millions of children new health coverage and, through this program, protects Medicare for America's seniors. 
   Passing the CHAMP Act will reauthorize the vital CHIP program, which is set to expire September 30 of this year. Currently 6 million vulnerable American children receive health care benefits through the CHIP. If CHIP did not exist, these millions of children would not have access to quality health care. The CHAMP Act also provides protection for our seniors. It ensures that they continue to have access to the doctors of their choice by stopping a 10 percent payment cut to the doctors and encourages them to seek preventative health care benefits by eliminating copayments and deductibles.  
   Mr. Speaker, in one bill, this House is addressing the health care needs of our children and our seniors.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (DEMOCRATIC BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this is a taxing time for America. As a member of the fiscally conservative Democrat Blue Dog Coalition, I welcome these opportunities to come to the floor and talk about fiscal responsibility and what we need to draw our attention to in this Nation's most pressing problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a skyrocketing national debt. As Congressman Ross has pointed out and indicated in numerous ways, it has just gotten out of hand. We are paying so much money of our tax dollars to pay the interest on the debt to foreign countries that we are borrowing from that it is really changing the face of America. 
   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, the timing is especially good because April 17 is the tax filing deadline for this year. As Americans, we race to the mailboxes with our taxes to meet the deadline, and it is important to note how our national debt affects each and every U.S. taxpayer. The average U.S. household devotes almost $2,000 a year in taxes to pay interest on our national debt, $2,000 a year just to pay the interest. That is about twice the amount they pay in taxes to help fund the Department of Education, veterans' health care, and homeland security programs. 
   Under this administration's budget, the picture only gets worse for American taxpayers. By 2014, the GAO says that more than two-thirds of revenues will be required just to pay the interest on our debt. Under this projection, net interest would become the largest Federal spending program, larger than Social Security, larger than our defense budget, and larger than Medicare and Medicaid combined. This defies commonsense and is not in line with our national priorities. 
   An approach that faces this troubling reality is long overdue, and in the first 100 days of this Congress, we have proved that we are up to the challenge. We passed bills, Mr. Speaker, that benefit small businesses, and above all, we passed a responsible budget. It funds our top priorities, like strengthening our military and our homeland security. This is commonsense and this is what the Blue Dogs stand for. We want to make a difference by requiring and demanding fiscal responsibility. 
   This also does something very important. It restores fiscal discipline and returns us to surplus by 2012. 
   Mr. Speaker, as American taxpayers, we send our hard-earned money to the IRS. They should know where it is going. Today, too much of it is going towards paying interest on our national debt. With fiscal responsibility and cost accountability in place, this Congress can change what is going on and bring real relief to America's working families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say that what will be going on today is righting a wrong for working families in America, and that is raising the minimum wage. 
   It has been a full 10 years since President Clinton was able to raise the minimum wage to help the people who work for us on a daily basis. With all the increased costs we have today, of housing, of health care, it is just impossible for people to be able to make it. In Ohio, we have seen people suffer because the minimum wage has not been relevant to what is going on in their life. 
   Many years ago, Henry Ford was criticized for saying that he paid his workers better than others, and his logic was his workers would be able to buy the cars that they manufactured. We want the people today to be able to have the right to be able to buy the things that they need, certainly for their families. So raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.

   Today, by cutting student loan rates in half, we are opening up important opportunities for thousands of young Ohioans and young people across the nation. 
   Just in the first two years, this bill will save Ohio students an average of $2,230 and in four years $4,320.

The tamper-proof pad mandate was designed to fight fraud, and that's a good thing, but this October 1 deadline isn't enough time for States to inform providers and patients about the new requirements. This could mean patients are turned away from pharmacies as of this next week and their prescriptions not be filled. And that paper isn't widely available. Pharmacies that fill prescriptions not written on that special paper may be forced out of business if they're not getting reimbursed by Medicaid. All we need is a 6-month delay. The clock is ticking on this, and I'm asking for your help.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (THE BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise to point out some of the issues why I believe I was elected by the people in Ohio to come to Congress to help with the deficit spending and the problems that we have. 
   How we have gone from a surplus in 6 years to a record deficit under this administration, I believe that is why we had the turnout at the polls that we had this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are concerned. They are worried about the amount of money that is being spent on interest, on the money we owe on this deficit. They are concerned about the money that is being taken away from the education of our children. They are concerned about the money that is taken away from the health care of our families because of the interest that is paid on this debt. 
   It is just irresponsible; and at this point, Mr. Speaker, every man, woman, and child in this country owes $29,000 in this deficit budget that we have, or lack of budget that we have. 
   There has to be a change, and I truly believe that is what the people in America said all across America when they changed the face of Congress. It is now that we need to be responsible for what is going on. 
   I believe that by being a member of the Blue Dogs that I have the honor of being one of the frontrunners in asking for fiscal responsibility and demanding that we know what we are buying before we go forward and we know what we are paying for and that we use PAYGO in such a way that we do not start buying new things until we figure out how we are going to pay for them. 
   I believe that is one of the pledges that I and many of the new Congressmen that have come to this body made to the people that we dealt with on the campaign trail on a regular basis. We are concerned about what is going on. 
   It concerns me, Mr. Speaker, that people in this administration have said there is nothing to be concerned about with the deficit, that what has been spent, it will take care of itself. I believe that all of us know that that is not really how it works. 
   I know myself, as a small businessman, I have to be concerned that my spending does not overcome my income, and I realize the government has to live within those same means. We have to be sure that what we are doing is the right thing for the people in America, and even though it has been reckless and we find ourselves in a difficult situation, it starts with this 110th Congress, that we move forward to try to do responsible things for the people in America. 
   I believe that starts with thinking about what money could be directed to the education of our children. I cannot stress enough the fact of the money that is being taken away from programs that will improve people's lives in America because of the debt we have. For that reason, we feel that fiscal responsibility is a major thrust of this 110th Congress, and we believe that the Blue Dog Coalition is one of the leaders in what is going to happen in the future. 
   This is the difference, Mr. Speaker, that we make sure that new bills are going to fit the budget of what we have. We are not going to just be radical in spending money and not caring about what is in the future and what we need to do. 
   I am happy, Mr. Speaker, to be part of this Blue Dog Coalition and to be a new Member of Congress to try to bring about fiscal responsibility, and I look forward to working with the other 43 members of the Blue Dog Coalition to bring about this result.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond also to some of the things that both of these gentlemen have been saying, and that is in regard to putting a lid on the spending that is going on in our country today. 
   In 2001 through 2003, our spending just soared. And from that point the Blue Dogs have been saying that we need some spending caps, we need to be able to evaluate what we are spending on various programs. 
   The Blue Dogs feel that the purpose of holding the line on discretionary spending is where we need to go with fiscal responsibility. We feel, Mr. Speaker, that our budget needs to be held in place. And as was said earlier, 49 of our 50 States have budgets that they operate by. And I can only tell you from the State of Ohio, that we had a budget, and we even had a budget surplus, which was a savings account that we could use when there was a special need that came up in our State. 
   And that is the kind of plan I would like to see us do in Congress as well, is to not only stop the runaway spending, put the lids on spending, but then also create a mechanism where we would have a safety valve if a special need came up that we needed to be able to do for the people by having a type of savings account that we could use, and that would be something that I think would be very much in order. 
   Also, if I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention about the auditing of the various programs that we have in the government. It just makes good sense to know how they are doing, and if they are not doing well we need to hold people responsible for that. That is part of the Blue Dog Coalition approach, is to how we can audit and test where we are doing well and where we are not, and certainly to limit our spending where we are not doing well. This is all part of the future and part of the fiscal responsibility that we need to be doing.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe when the Katrina accident happened that we were out of line as much as we were and not responsive, as has been indicated here this evening, and it is even harder to believe that after the correction of that, we are back in the same boat again. 
   I know they changed FEMA directors. Mr. Brown was terminated and went on. And then now we have a new group of people running FEMA, but it does not seem to be any better. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Blue Dogs stand for accountability. We stand for accountability in a lot of different ways. We feel that there are some truly misguided priorities that are hurting our country and hurting us as people here. 
   Mr. Speaker, just Sunday evening, millions of Americans watched ``60 Minutes.'' We heard what the Blue Dogs have been talking about for more than a decade. 
   In the report, the U.S. Comptroller General, the Nation's top accountant, urged people to wake up to our budget crisis before it is too late. These are his words, Mr. Speaker. 
   ``What's going on right now is we're spending more money than we make.'' Couldn't be much more simple. ``We're charging it to a credit card and expecting our grandchildren to pay.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely wrong. The Comptroller General is absolutely right. Our fiscal mess is outrageous, and we as Blue Dogs stand for accountability. Reckless budgets and irresponsible spending has got us into the fix we are in, and now it is the responsibility of this Congress to help us get out. 
   The administration has had misguided priorities that have been painfully clear. They send pallets of cash to Iraq while our veterans at home suffer in dirty, broken-down facilities, not getting the medical care that they need after putting their life on the line for our country. Recent reports of the deplorable conditions and the roach-infested rooms at Walter Reed are an outrage, and they are unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, it is an understatement to say that our brave veterans deserve so much more than the way they are being treated. 
   We must hold this administration accountable for this reckless approach that has allowed millions of dollars to go missing in Iraq while our brave young men and women who need proper medical care have gone without it. We must provide real oversight to keep this from happening again, just like we need to provide real oversight as we work for a responsible budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, what will happen if we do not clean up this fiscal mess? We only need to listen to the words of the Comptroller General again in last Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' presentation. He said, ``We suffer from a fiscal cancer. It's growing within'' our country. ``And if we do not treat it, it could have catastrophic consequences for'' America. 
   As Blue Dogs, Mr. Speaker, we will shine a bright light on this cancer and nurse our budget back to health. Our future and the future of our children and our grandchildren depend on it.

While Washington Republicans continue to advocate for the same failed energy policies that got us where we are today, Democrats are providing American consumers with real solutions. 
   We must increase drilling. I support a new piece of legislation that says to oil companies: Use it or lose it. Use the leases you have on land where we know there is oil or lose those leases to an oil company that is willing to drill. 
   Oil companies that are raking in record profits are currently sitting on 68 million acres of leased oil-rich Federal land that they are not drilling. The amount of oil which could be produced from these reserves would nearly double the total U.S. production. If oil companies drilled those 68 million acres, the U.S. could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels a day. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week, we will have the opportunity to tell Big Oil to either use the leases they have or to lose them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 892 which I introduced to express the support for the establishment of the National Funeral Director and Mortician Recognition Day. 
   I introduced this resolution because I know firsthand how funeral directors help families through the grieving process in a most difficult time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a fourth generation funeral director in my family, and I know very well the profound service that funeral directors provide to their communities. Funeral directors are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. When a family calls a funeral director to make arrangements for a recently deceased loved one, the funeral director must put everything else on hold and attend to the family's needs immediately. 
   We all know that the death of a loved one can be emotionally devastating. Funeral directors play an essential role in giving families the space they need to navigate the grieving process. By taking care of all of the logistical arrangements, funeral directors allow families to celebrate the life of the recently departed and spending time together as a family. 
   Funeral directors also provide a major public service by participating in planning for pandemic disease and other mass casualty events that could happen within their community. Because of their familiarity with the physical aspects of death, they provide invaluable technical knowledge and assistance to public officials who are responsible for contingency planning. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that funeral homes are also economic anchors of their community. The funeral business is often a family business with multiple generations serving the community as funeral directors. Through good economic times and bad, funeral directors are there to serve their families with caring compassion and certainly with strict integrity. 
   As a lifelong funeral director, I know how important this service is to grieving families. This is why I think that it is proper that this Congress recognize the hard work and the sacrifice of thousands of funeral directors in this country by passing this bill. I thank Chairman Waxman for his support in this measure, and I urge the Congress to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Delahunt. 
   Mr. Speaker, the costs keep climbing. Thousands of our young brave men and women have been killed. Next month we enter the fifth year of this war, a war that has lasted longer than World War I or World War II. Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been spent, and some of that money seems to have just disappeared into the desert air. The costs keep climbing, and nobody, not a single Republican or Democrat, can deny that. 
   The question before us now is clear: Should we escalate this war and send 21,500 more of our sons and daughters to referee a civil war in Iraq? The American people have spoken out for change, and many of us here have listened carefully. But escalating this war does not reflect the hard reality at home or on the ground in Iraq. 
   Saying ``support our troops'' is easy, but actually standing up for our troops overseas and their families here at home demands so much more from us. We must ask the tough questions and provide real support, instead of empty rhetoric. 
   Supporting our troops requires that we protect their bodies and lives with the best armor available. Supporting our troops means equipping them with the most reliable weapons and effective training. Supporting our troops does not stop when they come home from the war. It is the Nation's solemn obligation to care for those who have given so much. Supporting our troops means we must ask ourselves the hard question, should we send more of our sons and daughters into the constant crossfire of Iraq's civil war? The answer is no. 
   Mr. Speaker, it comes down to supporting our troops. In addition to the best armor, the proper respect and the right benefits, our troops deserve the right plan. In fact, nothing matters more than the right plan. Our heroic soldiers have done everything that we have asked them to do. Without a realistic plan to guide them, we cannot say that we are supporting our troops. 
   While sacrificing health care for children and pharmaceutical needs for our seniors, this administration has shipped 363 tons of cash on pallets to Iraq. When it got there, the American officials turned it over to Iraqis, without any idea of where they were spending it or what they were doing with it. That defies common sense. It should not be a surprise that nearly $9 billion are missing. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, the costs keep climbing. As high as the cost is in dollars, it pales compared to the high price many of our military families have had to pay. Our troops are over-stretched, their families are overstressed, and there is no relief in sight. Every one of our active duty military brigades have served at least a year long in Iraq or Afghanistan. When a mother or father or husband or wife is abroad for a year, it places tremendous strain on the family. Too many families have been torn apart by this war. The cost of broken families will never be entered into an accountant's ledger, but the cost is too high, and it just keeps climbing. 
   This month, one young man from my district was killed in Iraq. I know that this country will feel his loss. He left behind his parents, his wife and an infant son, Mr. Speaker, that he never had a chance to meet. I feel their loss deeply, and I ask all of my colleagues to remember that every man and woman that has been killed in Iraq cannot be replaced and leaves behind many people who depended on them. 
   The resolution before us today could not be any more clear. It states that the Congress will continue to support and protect our troops. I will never vote for any legislation that will endanger our troops in the field, and we will never vote to cut off funding that will help to compromise the safety of our men and women in uniform. But escalating this war and sending 21,500 more troops to referee a civil war is not the answer.     
   The American people have spoken and they demand that we support our troops with a real change in direction. As the voice of the people, Congress will make sure that this administration finally takes notice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I'm sad to be here this evening, but I'm also proud that we can rise on this occasion to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the honor of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. It's right that we express the condolences of the House of Representatives. I feel like she was a dear friend to all of us, and I know that I loved her and that so many of my colleagues did. 
   It came as a terrible shock a week ago Tuesday when we found out that Stephanie died, but it's appropriate that we have this resolution we're doing this evening to appropriately honor a devoted American, and Stephanie was a devoted American. 
   Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a champion for the residents in the Greater Cleveland area. She was a tireless voice for our State of Ohio. She always greeted me with a big smile and, many times, with a hug. It was just the way she did and the way she treated people. A colleague of hers recently said that he felt that Stephanie treated people that way because it was almost as if God were watching. She was taken from us way too soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, her work was not finished. She is counting on us to carry on. My deepest sympathy goes out to her son, Mervyn, to her sister, Barbara, and to her extended family. She will be sorely missed by the Ohio congressional delegation, by all of Congress, and I will miss working with her.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, with thousands of Americans losing their homes and jobs, skyrocketing costs for basic items such as gas prices at an all-time high, Americans everywhere are feeling the negative impact of these failed economic policies that we are living under. 
   Congress has already enacted an economic stimulus package that will provide relief to families in need. Last week, House Democrats called on President Bush to again work in a bipartisan manner on a second stimulus package, one that would help our economy get back on track. 
   House Democrats are also working on legislation to help 1.5 million American families to avoid foreclosure. This legislation goes further than the President's plan to help only 100,000 homeowners. This one goes to 1.5 million. 
   Congressional Democrats are proposing strong initiatives that will help stabilize the housing market and help jump-start an economy that is simply leaving just too many people behind.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, today the House begins debate on the Defense authorization bill, a bill that was passed out of the Armed Services Committee 58-0, unanimously. The legislation received the support of the entire committee because it focuses on our Nation's immediate threats and the benefits our soldiers need today. 
   The Defense bill authorizes substantial resources to improve the protection of our troops, including $4 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. These vehicles have been shown to dramatically reduce the injuries of our soldiers. We want to ensure that our troops have access to the best equipment that will protect them while they are in battle. 
   In his budget earlier this year, the President proposed giving our troops a 3 percent pay raise. This Congress believes they deserve more, and consequently they will receive a 3.5 percent raise. 
   Madam Speaker, this Defense bill shows our dedication to the troops on the front lines, and it deserves strong bipartisan support.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, last year Democrats pledged to make Congress an open and accountable process to the American people. This week the House will consider a series of reform measures that deliver on that promise. 
   This week we will vote on legislation reforming the Freedom of Information Act, requiring a more timely disclosure of government documents, and another bill that nullifies the 2001 Presidential executive order so that the access to Presidential records is finally restored. Both of these important bills open up government to the American people so that they can hold their government accountable.  
   Finally, the House will debate a bill providing real oversight of government contracts by limiting how long Federal no-bid contracts can last and requiring agencies to minimize the use of no-bid contracts. 
   Real oversight will return to Washington, and this week we will pass important legislation that brings real accountability along with it.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I appreciate this opportunity. 
   Madam Speaker, when we sent cash over to Iraq on a pallet with no accountability, no understanding, and those hundreds of millions of dollars just disappeared into the desert air, we know that we need accountability. We need accountability in this war for the financial money that we have sent there. We also need accountability for the body armor and the proper rest for our soldiers, the proper training for our soldiers. We need to be able to show that we are showing accountability. 
   I am so proud to be a new Member of this Congress that is willing to stand up for our soldiers and for the right things to do for America. When more than $400 billion have been poured into Iraq with little oversight on how that money is spent, we have to ask ourselves, we can't wait any longer for the accountability that needs to be done. 
   I am proud to be a member of the Blue Dog Coalition to be able to stand up and say what the national debt is. If we could see the money that we spend every month, and month after month and year after year on the interest debt of our Nation, almost $9 trillion now, it is just hard to believe that we can continue down this lane of not making the proper decisions and not having accountability. 
   House Resolution 97 goes straight to the heart of the matter. It sets up the issue and the framework of how we are going to consider having the proper accountability so that we can know where we are going, where the money is going. These are hard-earned tax dollars, and many of these dollars are being spent that are not being spent on education and are not being spent on health care for our seniors. 
   These dollars are being funneled into foreign countries that were borrowing money to help pay this debt. It is not the right direction. 
   House Resolution 97 does call for regular reports to the Congress that outline how military and reconstruction funds are spent from now on. It also says the accounts for the terms and contracts that are awarded by our government, how long are the contracts? What is the accountability of them? Are they all no-bid contracts, and, if so, how long are they in place for? 
   We need to have that kind of accountability, and House Resolution 97 does that. It details how future taxpayer money will be spent. That is the kind of accountability that we need. The costs just keep climbing in Iraq, and we must get a true handle to know where these costs are. 
   The American taxpayer deserves to know the truth. They deserve to know what is going on, and this is what House Resolution 97 does. It shines the light of day on the process that is going on in Iraq. I am hopeful, if we can lean forward and move forward on this legislation, we will be able to have accountability that people will feel that we are doing the right things. 
   Our soldiers will know that they are having the right kind of support, and we, as Members of Congress, are providing the service and the change in direction to get America back on the right track.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (OUT IN THE COLD: OHIOANS HIT HARDEST BY HOME FORECLOSURES -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, being from Ohio and speaking on this issue is really quite easy because Ohio leads the Nation in predatory lending and in foreclosures, an unfortunate statistic that we are not proud of. 
   As a new Member of Congress and one that has worked very hard in the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate to pass legislation against predatory lending, I feel it a real calling to be one who speaks up strongly here in the Congress on the same type of issue that people are being taken advantage of in a big way. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Ohio's working families are paying the price, and in many cases, they are paying with their homes. In fact, Ohio leads the Nation, as I said, in foreclosures. 
   In my district, Mr. Speaker, in southeastern Ohio, from the suburbs of Youngstown to the small rural communities along the West Virginia and the Kentucky borders, predatory lenders are targeting honest Ohioans who only want one thing: they want a chance to purchase a home of their own and live the American Dream. 
   For millions who struggle with bad credit, these subprime and adjustable rate mortgages seem like the perfect opportunity to correct their problems. But in reality, when it sets in, it is the worst solution that they could choose. 
   Rates begin to skyrocket, late fees pile up, and before long it is too late. Too many families are losing their homes to foreclosure. Too many families are being left out in the cold. 
   The numbers are alarming. These subprime loans account for 63 percent of Ohio's foreclosures. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a problem that has spread far beyond Ohio to our  major cities all across America. In fact, two-thirds of the subprime loans are used in non-urban areas as well. 
   Today's working families are being challenged in so many ways. While wages stay flat or decline, we have seen people's gas prices and health care costs continue to soar. It's time that our working families finally get the relief they deserve, and taking on predatory lenders has to be a part of the solution. 
   As a member of the Senate, as I said, I joined colleagues to work on Ohio's predatory lending laws. I work on this important issue here in Washington also, because I believe it's an important one for the people of this country. 
   One of the things I did was to take a first step in introducing House Resolution 1723. It's a bill that I introduced that targets FHA home loans. It clearly outlines unacceptable practices that could be used in an attempt to influence an appraisal on a home. It also puts in place a blind draw, a system that would randomly select the appraiser, rather than having loan companies have favorites that they use to make unrealistic appraisals. 
   Ensuring that homes are appraised fairly is an important piece of the puzzle. Many borrowers cannot refinance or sell to avoid defaulting because their property is not worth what they owe on the home. Too often, the original mortgage is based on the inflated appraisal, and H.R. 1723 will keep that from happening when it comes to FHA loans. 
   Families across the Nation are now feeling the kind of pain that we in Ohio have suffered; 2.2 million subprime home loans made in recent years have already failed, or will in foreclosure. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 million, and that figure only begins to describe the cost to the families. 
   Our sons and daughters, our mothers and fathers, are losing their homes, and in the process they are losing their hold on the American dream. Our working families deserve real relief, not just empty words. 
   I urge this Congress to take a strong stand on predatory lending. We must make sure that Americans' dream of home ownership does not turn into a nightmare for even more families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Ross, and thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the budget that has been sent to us just as recently as yesterday. 
   I was elected by the people of eastern Ohio and sent to Washington to try to bring a commonsense approach to what is going on down here. I must say that the budget that we received yesterday and have looked through today making different points, it is astonishing, the math that is used. The budget doesn't add up, the numbers don't fit together, the lack of real fiscal responsibility, the tax increases on the middle class, the continued cutting of programs that are good for people, the lack of oversight over our war that is going on right now. It is frightening. It is frightening for everybody. There are several things that are wrong, though, that I would like to talk about. 
   As I said, the numbers don't add up; they just don't come together. There are assumptions that are made that are unrealistic, and it provides us with an opportunity for real failure, more so than we have now. 
   As Mr. Ross recently indicated, we are near $9 trillion right now in debt, and with everyone's share, with 300 million residents of America, we are looking at $29,000 per person. That is man, woman, child. 
   Looking at this, it is unfortunate that under this budget proposal there are crucial investments that have been cut to programs that are important to people. For example, they are cutting commodities for seniors and people with low incomes and people who have disabilities, but yet we are making real strong assumptions on the scenario of what can happen for the right things to give more tax breaks. 
   I did an interview today, Mr. Speaker, with a newspaper in Ohio, and was asked, how will you pay to restore the commonsense benefits that are in this budget? Well, one of the ways would be to eliminate some of the tax breaks for the people who need them least, and this would certainly be a thing that we as the Democratic Blue Dog Coalition would be supportive of. 
   We need to look at common sense. We need to find ways, such as PAYGO, which we are putting forward, to say that no program goes forward for more spending, Mr. Speaker, without eliminating a program that is costing us in the present time. This is what PAYGO is about. It is a direction that our country needs. PAYGO stands for common sense, and that is really what we are trying to do. 
   When we look at this budget, we say that in the President's budget this time for the 2008 series, it is more of the same, that there has been no change. It takes many, many assumptions that it is going to be a best-case scenario. But when you really look at the numbers, Mr. Speaker, it winds up quite bad again. 
   We are moving in the wrong direction, doing the wrong things. The unbid contracts in the war, the situation that we have where money is being drained on a daily basis out of America, I can't help but wonder all the good that could be done if we had fiscal responsibility, if we had people that were looking at the realities of what this budget could do. 
   So I am confident as a new Democrat in this Congress that we are going to work hard to try to bring common sense to the budget to try to benefit the American people. This best-case scenario assumption is just not a fair way to go. It hasn't proven good in the last 6 years, and I doubt very much it is going to prove good in the next 2 years. 
   I am happy to be part of the Blue Dog Coalition, to look for fiscal responsibility and fight for the rights of what should be done in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, as Congressman Ross said, I am a new Member, Mr. Speaker, and it is a pleasure to be here from Ohio. And one of the major concerns is the amount of debt that we have created in this country. 
   One of the reasons that I have joined the Blue Dogs is I like the idea of us having a balanced budget. I truly believe, Mr. Speaker, that Congress cannot buy on credit without being responsible for the credit card. 
   This is not the principle that I have lived by all my life as a successful businessman and these are not the principles that our government can run by. We need to be accountable. We need to be able to step forward and show what our money is being used for, and not to spend more than we have. 
   Each and every one of us has budgets within our home, we have budgets within our life that we use every day. We know that we have to live within our budget or we have bad consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, there is no difference for us as a government. We have to live within our means. And to see the transformation that has happened in the last 6 years in going from a large surplus of $400 billion to now a nearly $9 trillion balance of debt, D-E-B-T as Congressman Ross says, in our government. 
   It is time that we start saying to the Congress and to the administration we must live within our means. We have to know that the Blue Dogs are going to be watching and are going to be concerned, and one of the plans that has been set forth by the Blue Dogs is what we call PAYGO. That means that you don't buy anything that you are going to pay for to go forward until you decide what you are going to eliminate. It is just like each and every one of us does in our lives every day. We know that we can't just go out and buy anything, that we have to budget for it, we have to make an opportunity so that we are able to pay for it. 
   And so one of the new plans that you are going to be hearing coming out of this 110th Congress is going to be the PAYGO, that means that our spending must be paid for before we go forward. This is just one of the plans that the Blue Dogs are taking responsibility for to help us put a lid on the spending that is going on within our country. 
   I am so proud to join these other 43 people and now 44 of us in the Blue Dogs in bringing about accountability and helping us to put spending caps on what is going on in our government. I am delighted to be one of the speakers today that is concerned about what is going on in our country and look forward to working to bring fiscal responsibility to this government.

   Mr. Speaker, I would like to just speak for a moment, if I could, in regard to putting the lid on the spending. One of the things that we all know we came here to do is to stop the runaway inflation and debt that is just climbing up in our country on a regular basis. 
   The thought that spending from the year 2001 to 2003, total government spending, Mr. Speaker, increased by 16 percent, these types of raises and just continual going into debt is what has put our country where every man, woman and child now is at the level of $29,005. 
   We need to have the right kind of controls, and I believe in Ohio, Indiana, Florida, certainly please speak out as to what you feel the issues are in your State and what we can do about it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening to support the Blue Dog Coalition, and ask for a realistic and responsible budget as we move forward. 
   I believe that for so long, we have been out of touch, and I believe that the debt that has been created by this administration has been overwhelming. And I know that more people in America need to understand what really has happened and how there has been wasteful spending, not accountability, difficulties that have just been swept away and we need to stop and look at it. 
   So I am pleased as a new Member of Congress from Ohio to be a member of the Blue Dog Coalition. I believe that, as we take a closer look at what is going on with this budget that has been submitted to us, that we realize that there are not only numbers that don't add up, but there are assumptions that are made that really would go against any principle of gap accounting and any type of realistic obligations that we have to the American people to explain to them. 
   The numbers show that while real fiscal responsibility is so sorely needed, this is not what we have in this budget. And it becomes important that we have people like the Blue Dogs who have, and I have my new sign outside my new door in the Cannon Building at 226, of which I am very proud to be a member of the Blue Dog Coalition to show that every man, woman, and child in this country is in debt $29,000 as of today. And that number may be realistically much lower than what it actually is. 
   The numbers also show that we need accountability. In 2004 alone, the Federal Government spent $25 billion that cannot be accounted for. I have heard other rumors and other stories of money that just disappeared. 
   This is not fair. It is not fair to the people, the taxpayers whose money it belongs to. It is not fair for the programs that we could be doing for our seniors, for the education of our children, the health care that we could provide, and to help those in middle America, the working families to help with opportunities for them. 
   We were able in this new Congress, to move forward. And just yesterday, Congressman Scott, I did a TV interview in Youngstown, Ohio. And the person interviewing me asked why did we prohibit the other side from being able to amend and change in our first 100 hours. And I said, quite frankly, that I thought we needed to do that in order to be able to get the issues taken care of that we did. And it was with this kind of responsibility that we moved forward, and that I believe now we can work together and accomplish what needs to be accomplished, but certainly looking at the realism of what is going on with our national debt. 
   We need to work together, not a Democrat or a Republican, but rather an American initiative, to make sure that every dollar we spend, every decision we make is for the betterment of our country.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. I thank you for that observation. 
   I truly believe this is what the American people said in this November's election. They said: We need accountability. We need people to be responsible. And that is why the election turned the way it did. And I believe now that it is important for us to pursue every opportunity to make sure that we have fiscal responsibility, to make sure that we are doing the right things for the people, and keeping an eye on our national debt. 
   Just last week, I received a graph in my office, and the amount of debt that we are paying to foreign countries is huge in comparison to what we are spending on education or health care for our seniors. That is the thing that is most difficult to understand about this, is how we can let the really important things go and spend all this money on interest. I know as a businessman, I could not run my business that way. As a person, I couldn't run my personal finances that way. And so there is no reason to think that we should run our government that way. 
   Moving forward, I just think that we need to be sure that this Congress is responsible. And one of the primary ways of doing that, that the Blue Dogs are advocating, is PAYGO, and that is as we pay as we go, just like you and I do in our budgets at home. If we are going to buy a new car, we need to make a sacrifice of something else. If we are going to go on a vacation, there needs to be something traded for that. PAYGO, quite frankly, Mr. Scott, says that what we really have to do is to make sure, if we are going to pay forward, that we eliminate something that we are doing now, and then we pay as we go.

   Currently, more than 218,000 children in Ohio receive care through SCHIP, and the bipartisan plan vetoed by the President would have extended care to an additional 122,000 uninsured children throughout the State. 
   The President's veto on December 12th denied health care to children of hardworking families across Ohio just as the state's unemployment rate reached 6 percent. With our economy experiencing a downturn, families are struggling to put food on the table, heat their homes and pay for ever increasing healthcare costs, making reauthorization of SCHIP more important than ever. 
   I am saddened by this failed veto override, but will continue to fight for children's health care. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to strengthen SCHIP and improve health care for children in Ohio and across the Nation.

   House Democrats are calling on President Bush to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This reserve is 97 percent full, which is more than enough to meet any emergency we would have. Experts believe that tapping the reserve could lower our gas prices by as much as 5 cents to 25 cents per gallon.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, for far too long our country has suffered from the effects of this administration's lack of an energy plan. 
   This New Direction Congress has worked hard to set new standards for energy efficiency and independence. We enacted into law the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years. These standards will actually save the average family $1,000 a year. 
   We created a diverse portfolio of alternative fuel standards that, when combined with traditional energy sources, puts us on the right track to becoming less dependent on foreign oil. And we helped lower prices at the pump by pressuring the administration to suspend the deposit into the government reserve. 
   With these efforts we have made important steps. Much more needs to be done. We must come up with a more responsible energy policy that will provide relief for working families. 
   I believe that the solution to this problem requires Congress to focus on the Nation's efforts of encouraging innovation, while still using the abundant resources we have, like coal. I look forward to working on a comprehensive energy program this week and to make real progress for our Nation.

   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Thank you, Congressman Ross. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the Congress' efforts to construct a new energy policy that will increase our renewable energy, our portfolio and the resources that we already have  here at home. And that's one of the things that I'm really proud to be here this evening to speak with my fellow Blue Dogs and, certainly Congressmen Costa and Ross both who have gone before me. And the thing they stress that is so important, Mr. Speaker, they keep saying that we are so concerned that we use common sense in what we're doing. And I know myself, I have been supportive of drilling all along. I believe it's the right thing to do. We need to have our resources to help people who are feeling severe pain in our country right now. 
   I'm concerned, though, that the oil that we drill here be oil that we keep here. And so I believe it's American oil, and we should use it for America's needs. I feel the same way about natural gas. I believe it's one of the other issues that we're going to have to deal with in a very near time frame. 
   It concerns me that I can see buses running around Washington, D.C. right now, and they are run on gas. Why can't we do more of that? Why can't we use that natural resource that we have to lessen our dependence on foreign oil?     
   I believe that's one of the significant efforts that we need to make. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent a part of Ohio that has had a long proud period of steel and coal. We use coal in our area in many ways. And as a matter of fact, if we're fortunate enough, very soon to get our coal-to-liquid plan in my district in Columbiana County, Ohio. I will be very, very proud because we will be able to introduce a process that is safe, that we can sequester the carbon, we can grind the coal, we can use it to make fuel oil for airplanes. It's a new type of diesel project that can be done that actually burns cleaner than what our Air Force and what our airplanes are using now. So it's a great opportunity for us to find an alternative way to develop our own fuel. 
   And the amount of fuel that our airplanes use, people don't realize, but it's huge. And so this plant of ours in Ohio will produce 50,000 barrels a day. And that's just a small dent, but I think it could be a prototype for the kinds of thing that can happen with our natural resources of coal and being able to use it clean to produce the kind of fuel that will help us with alternative fuel. 
   As you drive up and down the Ohio River, you can see along my district of southeastern Ohio what amount of energy plants we have that use coal to produce electricity and also now to be using diesel fuel. You can see that this liquid fuel will help us more and more to reduce our dependency. And as someone said earlier, I believe it was Congressman Ross, that we are going to have a shortage of electricity now in the not-too-distant future. 
   This shortage of electricity, it is very important that we understand that we start gearing up for it now. We have the technology to burn coal clean to produce electricity. We can provide the coal with safe mining techniques that we have today, the technology that will make a difference in how we can get our coal out. 
   I believe that coal is another part of our energy plan that we need to look at, and especially from my area where we have an abundance of it, some say 200 to 300 years. So we can mine this coal and use it for an opportunity to help our workforce. 
   So I think as we drill and we have in mind that we're going to create a campus, or as Congressman Costa said, a toolbox, if you will, of different kinds of alternative energy. And I believe if we could start doing that, we will be in better shape. 
   I yield back to our leader, Congressman Ross.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, the House will be voting later to make sure a military sole survivor is allowed every benefit as if they had stayed in the military for their entire service. 
   A military sole survivor is a courageous member of our armed services who is pulled out of service because all of their siblings have died while also serving our country. Military sole survivors deserve the full benefits as if they had served and stayed their complete tour of duty. We're paying for this important benefit by repealing the limit placed on funeral trusts. 
   As a funeral director and a Congressman, I come to the floor today to talk about how important qualified funeral trusts are for the American people. The cost of a funeral in the United States is rapidly increasing. That's why, several years ago, qualified funeral trust plans were created within the tax code to allow people to plan and prepay for their funeral costs, lifting the financial burden from the families after their death. 
   Current law limits a funeral trust to $9,000. This is often no longer sufficient to cover the family's funeral expenses. With this contribution limit, even those who preplan their own funerals often leave their family with substantial debt. I know how families hurt during these times, I've seen it every day. The last thing they need to worry about is making sure that they have enough to cover their arrangements. This bill eliminates that limitation and even creates an income stream for the American taxpayer. That's a win-win situation. Complying with PAYGO, helping our soldiers, and allowing families to plan ahead, all are getting a win today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (BUSH BUDGET SHORTCHANGES HOMELAND SECURITY PROGRAMS--PARTICULARLY FIRST RESPONDERS -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, President Bush sent Congress a budget for 2008 for the fiscal year that continues the misguided priorities of this administration. Last November, the American people rejected the status quo, saying that we can do better. It is time for a change, it is a time for a change in direction. 
   Unfortunately, the President's budget is more of the same. His budget for the Department of Homeland Security is only 1 percent more than it was in 2007. This is a modest increase for a department that is charged with such a critical mission and has yet to meet the goals of protecting our country. 
   Particularly disappointing is the President's request for programs to support first responders. The President has reduced the preparedness and training by 33 percent. The firefighters' grants would be reduced by 55 percent. State and local law enforcement grants would also undergo cuts, depriving our communities of critical support when they need it most after 9/11. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are serious about ensuring that our local police departments and our firefighters have the equipment they need to better protect our communities. The President's budget must be rejected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, there are two people to blame for the extremely high increase in gas prices, President Bush and Vice President Cheney, two men who came to the White House from the executive suites of Big Oil. 
   This week, the President proposed a proposal that was literally written by the oil industry: Give more public resources to the very same oil companies that are raking in record profits and are sitting on 68 million acres of Federal lands they already have leased. 
   The President called for opening the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling, even though more than 80 percent of that is already under lease at this time. The President reported the same old rhetoric about drilling in ANWR, even though his own Energy Department has concluded that will bring no solution for the next 20 years. This type of rhetoric is what is hurting us and will continue to hurt our country. 
   Madam Speaker, America cannot afford any more failed Bush-Cheney energy policies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the American public is rightfully concerned about the future of our Nation's economy. Stagnant wages were already making it difficult for families to afford rising gas, home heating, grocery, and health care bills. Now, there is the added worry of losing their homes. The housing crisis could lead to more than 2 million homeowners losing their homes in the near future. 
   Fortunately, we address some of the housing concerns in the bipartisan economic stimulus plan. In that package, we expanded affordable mortgage loan opportunities through the Federal Housing Administration, and expanded financial counseling for families who are at risk of losing their homes. This was a good start, but more needs to be done. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I look forward to working with Chairman Frank to move through the committee his foreclosure prevention package. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks I hope that we can once again come together as Republicans and Democrats in this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Stupak-Visclosky amendment, calling for all iron and steel used under this act to be produced here in our United States. 
   Since 1892, my home State of Ohio has been a leading steel producer, and today remains among the top three steel producing States in our country. 
   In April, I had the opportunity to attend a hearing held by the Congressional Steel Caucus examining the dangers of standardized substandard Chinese steel. What I learned was that these products are not being inspected in China and the products are not being inspected at our ports when they enter our country. And again, today, the steel is not inspected as it is used to build some of our Nation's most critical infrastructure, like our children's schools. 
   In the last year we have seen China's iron and steel production increase by more than 50 percent. Today, Chinese steel is being used to make everything from our schools to our hospitals to our bridges, and I have serious concerns about whether or not this Chinese steel is strong enough to keep our families and our Nation safe. 
   This amendment will ensure that the steel used is from American companies that will follow the proper safety and quality standards in our products. Our children deserve safe schools. A strong and viable U.S. steel industry is critical to America's infrastructure and the national economic security and homeland security. 
   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me and to support the Stupak-Visclosky amendment, and encourage my fellow Members to vote for final passage of this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides a plan for responsible redeployment of our troops. This is the time to set a new course. Setting a date certainly gives the Iraqis the incentive to actually work to meet some benchmarks. 
   Our military men and women are among our most precious resources. They are performing admirably with courage in a situation that they never should have been asked to be in in the first place. They are doing their job. Now we must do ours. We must bring them home. 
   On a recent trip to Walter Reed to visit a seriously wounded marine from my district in Pomeroy, Ohio, I saw again the damage this war has done. Not just to this young man, but to his family also. They have all put their jobs and their lives on hold to care for him. 
   His courage and conviction are not in question. That marine would go back to Iraq tomorrow if we asked him to. We must not ask. How much more blood should be shed? How many more families must we shatter? Enough is enough.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of Ohio. (IRAQ RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq resolution that we are debating here is bipartisan. Over the last 2 days, Democrats and Republicans have come to this floor to voice their opposition about the escalation plan for this war. 
   There is also strong bipartisan support for a resolution in the Senate that would express the Chamber's opposition to the President's plan there. Unfortunately, Senate Republican leaders are preventing the debate and the resolution, preferring instead to blindly follow the President. 
   Why have Democrats and Republicans come together to express our opposition to the President's plan? Unlike the President, we have listened to the military experts, his own generals, the American people, the troops fighting in Iraq, and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that said this war no longer can be won militarily. 
   Congress must express an opinion to this President's plan. Over the last month, the House and Senate committees have conducted 52 hearings on Iraq, conducting oversight of an administration that is off course internationally. The oversight will continue and we will bring a change of course in Iraq

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, when we send our Nation's young men and women into harm's way, it is always with the commitment that we will provide them with all the care they need if they are wounded in combat. Unfortunately, this administration has broken its commitment to our soldiers. Saying that they support the troops is easy for the President and the Vice President; actually coming up with examples is becoming more difficult every day. 
   Dana Priest, the Washington Post reporter who uncovered the conditions at Walter Reed Hospital recently, said that money is the root of the problem exposed at Walter Reed. Yet in testimony before the House Oversight Government Reform Committee on Monday, top military brass said they were given all the money that they needed. How could this be? If they indeed have all the money they need, then why are we attempting to nickel-and-dime the injured soldiers who have put their life on the line for our country? 
   Mr. Speaker, this is just another example of this administration's inability to make government work. Fortunately, this Democratic Caucus is not going to let them get away with it.
